## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects with the color '2' and aims to fill the cells immediately to the right of these objects with the color '1'. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** 
- The object shaped like a rectangle maintains its structure.  No cells meet the criteria for filling with '1'.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- The vertical and horizontal segments of the '2' object are filled to the right with '1'.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
- Similar to Input_1, the right sides of the '2' objects are filled with '1'. Notice the 'diagonal' doesn't trigger a fill since it's not directly to the right.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions leveraging the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Extract connected objects (excluding background)
  filled = I
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:  # Focus on objects with color '2'
      for i, j in toindices(obj): # Iterate over object's cell indices
        if j + 1 < width(I) and index(filled, (i, j + 1)) == 0: # Check for '0' to the right within grid bounds
          filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j + 1)})  # Fill with '1'
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Extract Objects:** Identify connected objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** For each object with color '2', iterate over its cells. If a cell has a '0' immediately to its right (within grid boundaries), fill that '0' with '1'.


**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(1, frozenset((i, j + 1) for i, j in ofcolor(I, 2) if j + 1 < width(I) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0))) 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find Target Cells:** Directly identify cells to the right of '2' colored cells that are within the grid and contain a '0'.
2. **Recolor and Paint:** Recolor these target cells to '1' and apply the change to the input grid.


**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_indices = toindices(extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2))
  right_indices = frozenset((i, j + 1) for i, j in obj_indices if j + 1 < width(I))
  fill_indices = sfilter(right_indices, lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0)
  return paint(I, recolor(1, fill_indices))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Get Object Indices:**  Extract indices of the object with color '2'.
2. **Calculate Right Indices:** Determine the indices of cells immediately to the right of the object.
3. **Filter for Fill:**  Keep only the right indices where the corresponding grid cell contains '0'.
4. **Recolor and Paint:**  Recolor the filtered indices to '1' and update the input grid.


**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_fill_condition(i, j):
    return j + 1 < width(I) and index(I, (i, j)) == 2 and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0
  fill_indices = frozenset((i, j + 1) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(width(I)) if right_fill_condition(i, j))
  return paint(I, recolor(1, fill_indices))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Define Fill Condition:** Create a helper function to check if a cell should be filled: it must be to the right of a '2', within the grid, and contain a '0'.
2. **Find Fill Indices:**  Iterate through all grid cells and apply the `right_fill_condition` to identify those needing a fill.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** Recolor the identified cells to '1' and update the input grid.


**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, shift(replace(I, 2, 1), (0, 1)), I)
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Create Shifted Grid:** Replace all '2's with '1's and shift the entire grid one cell to the right.
2. **Cellwise Comparison:**  Perform a cell-by-cell comparison between the original grid and the shifted grid. 
3. **Apply Changes:** If the values in the corresponding cells match, keep the original value. Otherwise, use the value from the shifted grid (effectively filling with '1').


These five versions showcase diverse approaches to achieve the same data transformation, highlighting the flexibility of DSL programming.
