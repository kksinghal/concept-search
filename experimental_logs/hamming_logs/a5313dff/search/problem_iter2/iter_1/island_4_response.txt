## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by connected regions of the same color (excluding the background color, which appears to be 0 in most cases), then extending these objects one cell to the right with a specific color. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** 
- The object of interest is the '2' shaped figure.
- Every cell of this object gets extended one cell to the right with the color '1'.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- Two objects are of interest here: the larger '2' shaped figure and the smaller '2' in the top right corner.
- Both objects get extended one cell to the right with the color '1', but notably, the extension only occurs where the neighboring cell is '0' (background).

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
- Similar to Input_1, multiple objects are present.
- Each object extends one cell to the right with the color '1' only if the neighboring cell is '0'.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" utilizing the DSL from `dsl.py`.

**Version 1: Utilizing `dneighbors` for adjacency**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Identify objects excluding background
  for obj in objs:
    for cell in obj:
      v, (i, j) = cell 
      neighbor = (i, j + 1) # Define the right neighbor
      if j + 1 < width(I) and index(I, neighbor) == 0: # Check within bounds and background
        I = fill(I, 1, {neighbor}) # Fill with '1' if conditions met
  return I 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` extracts objects from the grid 'I'.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** The code iterates through each object and each cell within.
3. **Check Neighbor:** For every cell, it checks if its right neighbor is within the grid bounds and is the background color (0).
4. **Conditional Fill:**  If both conditions are met, the right neighbor is filled with '1'.

**Version 2: Using `shift` for neighbor calculation**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    right_shifted = shift(toindices(obj), (0, 1)) # Shift object indices to the right
    for loc in right_shifted:
      if index(I, loc) == 0 and loc[1] < width(I): # Check for background and bounds
        I = fill(I, 1, {loc}) 
  return I
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Object and Shifted Indices:**  It identifies objects and calculates the indices of their right neighbors using `shift`.
2. **Check and Fill:**  For each shifted index, it verifies if it's within the grid and represents a background cell before filling it with '1'.

**Version 3: Employing `rapply` for neighbor checks**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    for cell in obj:
      v, (i, j) = cell
      neighbors = rapply(((lambda x: (x[0], x[1] + 1)),), cell)  # Generate right neighbor
      for neighbor in neighbors:
        if neighbor[1] < width(I) and index(I, neighbor) == 0:
          I = fill(I, 1, {neighbor})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Generate Neighbor:**  This version uses `rapply` to generate the right neighbor for each cell in an object. 
2. **Check and Fill:**  It then checks if the generated neighbor is within grid bounds and a background cell before filling.

**Version 4: Combining `sfilter` and `toindices` for filtering**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    fill_indices = sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda loc: loc[1] + 1 < width(I) and index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0) # Filter for valid right neighbors
    fill_indices = frozenset((i, j + 1) for i, j in fill_indices) # Shift filtered indices to the right
    I = fill(I, 1, fill_indices) # Fill the filtered locations
  return I
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Filter Valid Neighbors:**  This version filters the object indices for those that have a valid right neighbor (within bounds and a background cell).
2. **Shift and Fill:** The filtered indices are then shifted right and filled with '1'.

**Version 5: Using set operations for neighbor identification**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    object_indices = toindices(obj)
    right_neighbors = frozenset((i, j + 1) for i, j in object_indices)  
    valid_neighbors = right_neighbors.intersection(asindices(I)).difference(object_indices)  # Find valid neighbors
    fill_indices = sfilter(valid_neighbors, lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0) # Filter for background cells
    I = fill(I, 1, fill_indices) 
  return I
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Calculate Neighbors and Intersect:**  It calculates the right neighbors of object cells and finds the intersection with all grid indices.
2. **Difference and Filter:** The intersection is then used to remove object cells, resulting in valid neighbor cells. These valid neighbors are filtered for background cells.
3. **Fill:** Finally, the identified background neighbor cells are filled with '1'.

These versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility of the DSL. Each version offers a unique combination of functions, showcasing different coding styles and logic within the DSL's capabilities.
