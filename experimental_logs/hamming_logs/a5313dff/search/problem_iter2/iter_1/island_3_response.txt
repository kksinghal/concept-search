## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects composed of the digit "2" and then extending those objects to the right by one cell, filling the new cell with the digit "1". This extension only occurs if the new cell originally contained a "0".

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The central object of "2"s is extended rightwards with "1"s wherever possible. 
* **Input_1:**  The top-most "2" object extends rightward with a single "1". Similarly, the large "2" object is extended with "1"s to the right.
* **Input_2:** The transformation follows the same pattern, extending the "2" objects to the right with "1"s only where the original grid had "0"s.

## Program Versions & Explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  filled = I
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      for i, j in toindices(obj):
        if j + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(filled, (i, j + 1)) == 0:
          filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j + 1)})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, False)` identifies contiguous objects of the same color. 
2. **Iterate and Extend:** The code iterates through each object. If an object's color is "2", it further iterates through the indices of the object.
3. **Extend Right:** For each cell (i, j) in the object, it checks if the cell to the right (i, j+1) is within the grid bounds and contains a "0". If so, it fills that cell with a "1".

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  filled = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 2 and j + 1 < len(row) and I[i][j + 1] == 0:
        filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j + 1)})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** This version iterates directly through the grid cells.
2. **Check and Extend:** For each cell containing a "2", it checks if the right adjacent cell exists and contains "0". If true, it fills the right cell with "1".

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      1 if j + 1 < len(row) and row[j + 1] == 0 and v == 2 else v
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **List Comprehension Approach:**  This version uses nested list comprehensions for a more concise solution.
2. **Inline Condition:** For each cell, it checks if the cell contains "2" and its right neighbor exists and contains "0". If true, it replaces the right neighbor with "1".

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  filled = I
  for i, j in asindices(I):
    if index(I, (i, j)) == 2 and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0 and j + 1 < len(I[0]):
      filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j + 1)})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Using `asindices`:** This version iterates through all cell indices using the `asindices` function.
2. **Check and Fill:** For each index, it checks if the current cell contains "2", the right neighbor exists, and contains "0". If true, it fills the right neighbor with "1".

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      branch(
        j + 1 < len(row) and row[j + 1] == 0 and v == 2,
        1,
        v
      )
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Using `branch` for Logic:** This version uses the `branch` function for a more functional approach to conditional replacement.
2. **Conditional Replacement:** The `branch` function evaluates the same condition as before. If true, it replaces the right neighbor with "1", otherwise, it keeps the original value. 

Each program version accomplishes the desired transformation using different approaches and function combinations, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
