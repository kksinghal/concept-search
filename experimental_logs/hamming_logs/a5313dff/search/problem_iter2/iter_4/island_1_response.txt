## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects with color "2" and extends a "tail" of "1"s from their rightmost bottom corner horizontally towards the right. This tail's length is determined by the number of consecutive "0"s present to the right of the object's bottom-right corner in the input grid.

**Input 0:** 
The single object with color "2" doesn't have any "0"s to its bottom-right, so no tail is added.

**Input 1:**
The large object with color "2" has three "0"s to its right, leading to a tail of three "1"s extending from its bottom-right corner.

**Input 2:**
The transformation is applied to both objects with color "2". The top object has two "0"s to its right, resulting in a two "1"s tail. The bottom object has one "0" to its right, leading to a one "1" tail. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  filled = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), objs) # Blank canvas with objects
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      i = lowermost(obj) 
      j = rightmost(obj) + 1
      while j < len(I[0]) and index(I, (i, j)) == 0: # Check for consecutive 0s
        filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j)})
        j += 1
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** It identifies all objects in the input grid.
2. **Blank Canvas:** Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input, populated with the identified objects.
3. **Iterate and Extend:** Iterates through each object. If an object's color is "2", it locates the cell to the right of its bottom-right corner. It then checks for consecutive "0"s in the input grid starting from that location, extending a "tail" of "1"s on the canvas for each consecutive "0" found.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  filled = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), objs)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      tail_length = len(extract(sfilter(hfrontier((lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)), lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0])), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0)) # Calculate tail length
      filled = fill(filled, 1, {(lowermost(obj), j) for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + 1 + tail_length)}) # Fill tail
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object and Canvas:** Identifies objects and creates a blank canvas as in Version 1.
2. **Calculate Tail Length:** For each object with color "2", it calculates the tail length by counting consecutive "0"s on the same row, starting from the right of the object.
3. **Fill Tail:**  Fills the tail with "1"s based on the calculated length.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  filled = I
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      j = rightmost(obj) + 1
      while j < len(I[0]) and index(I, (lowermost(obj), j)) == 0:
        filled = paint(filled, {(1, (lowermost(obj), j))}) # Paint individual tail cells
        j += 1
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Painting:** This version directly modifies the input grid instead of using a separate canvas.
2. **Iterate and Paint:** It iterates through each object. If the object's color is "2", it identifies the cell to the right of its bottom-right corner. Then, it checks for consecutive "0"s in the input grid and paints a "1" on the grid for each consecutive "0" found.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  def extend_tail(grid, obj):
    tail_start = (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)
    tail_indices = sfilter(hfrontier(tail_start), lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(grid[0]) and index(grid, loc) == 0)
    return fill(grid, 1, {(loc[0], loc[1]) for loc in tail_indices}) # Apply fill based on filtered indices
  
  return apply(lambda obj: extend_tail(I, obj) if color(obj) == 2 else I, objects(I, True, False, False))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Functional Approach:** This version uses a more functional approach with `apply` for object processing.
2. **Tail Extension Function:** It defines a helper function `extend_tail` that handles the tail extension logic for a given object.
3. **Apply and Filter:** It applies the `extend_tail` function to all objects with color "2" in the input grid, effectively extending their tails. 

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  def paint_tail(grid, start):
    j = start[1]
    while j < len(grid[0]) and index(grid, (start[0], j)) == 0:
      grid = paint(grid, {(1, (start[0], j))})
      j += 1
    return grid

  return apply(lambda obj: paint_tail(I, (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)) if color(obj) == 2 else I, objects(I, True, False, False)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Tail Painting Function:**  Defines a helper function `paint_tail` that paints the tail directly onto the grid, starting from a given location.
2. **Apply and Paint:** It applies the `paint_tail` function to each object with color "2", effectively painting tails on the input grid.
