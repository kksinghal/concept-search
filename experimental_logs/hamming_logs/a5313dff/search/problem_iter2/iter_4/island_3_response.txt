## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to identify objects made of the digit '2' and then fills the spaces within these objects and one cell to the right with the digit '1'.  Let's break it down by input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- The '2' object is identified. 
- The inner space of the object is filled with '1's.
- The cells immediately to the right of the rightmost '2's are also filled with '1's.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- The same logic applies, but notice that the original '1's in the input are replaced by '0's in the output, except when they are part of the 'fill' area.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

- The same pattern continues. The large '2' object is filled, and the cells to the right are also filled with '1's.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False) # Get all objects
  filled = I # Initialize filled grid
  for obj in objs: # Iterate through objects
    if color(obj) == 2: # Check if object is made of '2's
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1): # Iterate through rows
        for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1): # Iterate through columns
          if index(filled, (i, j)) in [0, 1]: # Fill '0's and '1's within the object and to the right
            filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j)})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **Identify objects:** We start by identifying all objects in the grid using `objects(I, True, False, False)`.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** We iterate through each object. If the object is made of '2's, we iterate through its bounding box (including one cell to the right) and fill all cells containing '0' or '1' with '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(1, mfilter(lambda loc: any((i,j) in toindices(objects(I, True, False, False)[0]) for i, j in neighbors(loc)), asindices(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** We identify the object made of '2's (assuming there's only one).
2. **Find neighboring cells:** We use `neighbors(loc)` to get all neighboring cells of each cell in the grid.
3. **Filter cells:** We keep only the cells whose neighbors include a cell belonging to the object.
4. **Recolor and paint:** We recolor the filtered cells to '1' and paint them onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = next(obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, False) if color(obj) == 2)
  return paint(I, recolor(1, backdrop(shift(obj, (0, 1))) | toindices(obj)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** Similar to version 2, we find the object made of '2's.
2. **Shift and create backdrop:** We shift the object one cell to the right and create a backdrop covering both the original and shifted object.
3. **Recolor and paint:** We recolor all cells in the backdrop to '1' and paint them onto the original grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  filled = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 2:
        for di, dj in [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1)]:
          if 0 <= i+di < len(I) and 0 <= j+dj < len(row) and filled[i+di][j+dj] in [0, 1]:
            filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i+di, j+dj)})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** We iterate through every cell in the grid.
2. **Fill surrounding cells:** If a cell contains a '2', we fill the cell itself and its surrounding cells (including the one to the right) with '1' if they contain '0' or '1'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(replace(I, 1, 0), recolor(1, mfilter(lambda loc: any((i,j) in toindices(objects(I, True, False, False)[0]) or (i, j+1) in toindices(objects(I, True, False, False)[0])  for i, j in dneighbors(loc)), asindices(I))))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Replace all 1s with 0s:**  We begin by replacing all occurrences of '1' with '0' in the input grid. 
2. **Identify the object:** Similar to previous versions, we locate the object composed of '2's.
3. **Find neighboring cells:** Using `dneighbors(loc)`, we identify the directly adjacent neighbors for each cell in the grid.
4. **Filter cells:** We selectively retain cells if their direct neighbors or the cells to their immediate right are part of the '2' object.
5. **Recolor and paint:** The filtered cells are recolored to '1' and then painted onto the modified grid (where '1's were replaced with '0's).

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, using various DSL functions and logic.
