## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of color '2' and extending them to the right by one cell, filling that cell with '1', but only if the cell to the right is currently the background color (most common color).

**Input 0:** The '2' object is extended to the right, filling the adjacent '0' cells with '1'.

**Input 1:** Similar to Input 0, the '2' objects are extended rightward. Notice how the extension only occurs where the background color is present.

**Input 2:**  Again, the '2' objects are extended to the right, but only where it encounters the background color.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      for i, j in toindices(obj):
        if j + 1 < width(I) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I):
          I = fill(I, 1, {(i, j + 1)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:**  We iterate through each connected object in the grid (excluding background).
2. **Check object color:**  If the object's color is '2', we proceed.
3. **Extend to the right:** For each cell in the object, we check if the cell to its right is within the grid bounds and contains the background color. If so, we fill that cell with '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(1, mfilter(product(range(height(I)), range(width(I))), lambda x: index(I, x) == 2 and x[1] + 1 < width(I) and index(I, (x[0], x[1] + 1)) == mostcolor(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify target cells:** We use `product` and `mfilter` to locate all cells with color '2' that have a background colored cell to their right.
2. **Recolor and paint:**  These identified cells are then recolored to '1' and painted back onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  for j in range(width(I) - 1):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) == 2 and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I):
        I = fill(I, 1, {(i, j + 1)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns:** We iterate through each column of the grid, except the last one.
2. **Check for condition:** For each cell, we check if it contains '2' and the cell to its right is the background color.
3. **Fill with '1':** If the conditions are met, we fill the right cell with '1'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(1, frozenset((i, j + 1) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(width(I) - 1) if index(I, (i, j)) == 2 and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find target indices:**  We construct a set of indices representing cells to the right of '2' that are also the background color.
2. **Recolor and paint:** We recolor this set of indices to '1' and paint it onto the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  new_grid = [[I[i][j] for j in range(width(I))] for i in range(height(I))]
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      for i, j in toindices(obj):
        if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == bg:
          new_grid[i][j + 1] = 1
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a copy:** We create a mutable copy of the input grid.
2. **Iterate and modify:** We iterate through objects like before, but instead of directly modifying the input, we modify the corresponding cell in the copy.
3. **Return modified grid:**  Finally, we return the modified copy as the output grid.

These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
