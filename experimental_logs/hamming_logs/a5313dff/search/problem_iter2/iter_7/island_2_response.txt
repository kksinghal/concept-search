## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '2' and filling specific cells adjacent to these objects with the digit '1'. 

* **Input_0:** The central object has no adjacent '0' cells, so no change occurs.
* **Input_1:**  '1's are filled to the right of the '2' object where they are adjacent to a '0'.
* **Input_2:** Similar to Input_1, '1's are filled to the right of the '2' object where they are adjacent to a '0'. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      for i, j in toindices(obj):
        if j + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0:
          I = fill(I, 1, {(i, j + 1)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** We use `objects(I, True, False, True)` to find all objects formed by non-background colors, considering only direct neighbors and excluding the background. 
2. **Iterate through objects:** We loop through each object `obj`.
3. **Check for target color:** If `color(obj)` is 2, we proceed.
4. **Iterate through object cells:** For each cell `(i, j)` in the object:
   - **Check for right neighbor:** If a cell exists to the right (`j + 1`) and its value is 0:
      - **Fill with 1:**  We use `fill(I, 1, {(i, j + 1)})` to fill that cell with 1.
5. **Return modified grid:** Finally, we return the modified grid `I`.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(1, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0 and any(n in ofcolor(I, 2) for n in dneighbors(loc))))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find target cells:** 
   - `asindices(I)` gets all indices of the grid.
   - We filter these indices using `mfilter` with a lambda function. The lambda function checks if the cell at an index:
     - Has a value of 0 (`index(I, loc) == 0`).
     - Has a direct neighbor (`dneighbors(loc)`) that belongs to an object of color 2 (`n in ofcolor(I, 2)`).
2. **Recolor target cells:**  `recolor(1, ...)` recolors the identified target cells to 1.
3. **Paint on the grid:**  `paint(I, ...)` paints the recolored cells onto the original grid.
4. **Return modified grid:** The function returns the modified grid `I`.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1):
    for i in range(len(I)):
      if I[i][j] == 2 and I[i][j+1] == 0:
        I = fill(I, 1, {(i, j+1)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns:**  We iterate through each column `j` from left to right except for the last column.
2. **Iterate through rows:** For each column, we iterate through each row `i`.
3. **Check for pattern:** If a cell `(i, j)` has value 2 and its right neighbor `(i, j+1)` has value 0:
    - **Fill with 1:**  We use `fill(I, 1, {(i, j+1)})` to fill the right neighbor cell with 1.
4. **Return modified grid:** Finally, we return the modified grid `I`.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, frozenset((1, (i, j + 1)) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1) if I[i][j] == 2 and I[i][j + 1] == 0))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and recolor cells:**  This program uses a single line with a nested generator expression to:
    - Iterate through each cell `(i, j)` in the grid (excluding the last column).
    - Check if the cell has value 2 and its right neighbor has value 0.
    - If true, it creates a tuple `(1, (i, j + 1))` representing the recoloring of the right neighbor cell to 1.
    - A frozenset is created from these tuples.
2. **Paint on the grid:** `paint(I, ...)` paints the recolored cells onto the original grid.
3. **Return modified grid:**  The function returns the modified grid `I`.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, mfilter(product(range(len(I)), range(len(I[0]) - 1)), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 2 and index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Generate potential target indices:** 
    - `product(range(len(I)), range(len(I[0]) - 1))` generates all possible cell indices in the grid (excluding the last column).
2. **Filter for target cells:** `mfilter` filters these indices using a lambda function. The lambda function checks:
   - If the cell at the current index has value 2 (`index(I, loc) == 2`).
   - If the cell to the right of the current index has value 0 (`index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0`).
3. **Paint on the grid:** `paint(I, ...)` paints the identified target cells (with their default color from the original grid) onto the original grid.
4. **Return modified grid:** The function returns the modified grid `I`.
