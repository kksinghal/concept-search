## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects made of the digit '2' and fills in specific background ('0') cells surrounding them with the digit '1'. 

**Logic:**

1. **Identify '2' Objects:**  The code first identifies connected regions of the digit '2' within the grid, treating them as distinct objects.
2. **Horizontal Fill Condition:** For each '2' object, the transformation targets background cells ('0') that are horizontally flanked by cells belonging to the object. 
3. **Fill with '1':** The targeted background cells are then filled with the digit '1'.

**Examples:**

* **Input_1:** The single '2' object in the center results in the background cells directly to its left and right being filled with '1'.
* **Input_2:**  The transformation is applied to both '2' objects, resulting in '1's filling the spaces between the 'arms' of the objects.

## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct code versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  filled = I
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      for i, j in toindices(obj):
        for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1)]:
          if index(I, (i + di, j + dj)) == 0 and (i + 2 * di, j + 2 * dj) in toindices(obj):
            filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i + di, j + dj)})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '2' Objects:** Similar to Program_B, it identifies '2' objects.
2. **Iterate within Object:** Instead of iterating through a bounding box, it iterates directly over the object's cells.
3. **Horizontal Check:** For each cell, it checks if the horizontally adjacent cells are '0' and if the cell two steps in the same direction belongs to the object.
4. **Fill:** If the conditions are met, the adjacent cell is filled with '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  filled = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == 0 and I[i][j - 1] == 2 and I[i][j + 1] == 2:
        filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j)})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Iteration:** This version iterates directly through the grid, simplifying the logic.
2. **Horizontal Check:** It checks for the '0-2-2' pattern horizontally.
3. **Fill:** If the pattern is found, it fills the '0' with '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  filled = I
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      box_indices = inbox(obj) 
      for i, j in box_indices:
        if index(I, (i, j)) == 0 and {(i, j - 1), (i, j + 1)} <= toindices(obj):
          filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j)})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '2' Objects:**  Identifies '2' objects.
2. **Inbox:**  Calculates the 'inbox' of each object, representing the inner perimeter.
3. **Check and Fill:**  Iterates through the inbox, filling '0' cells horizontally flanked by the object with '1'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  filled = hmirror(I)
  twos = ofcolor(filled, 2)
  for i in range(len(filled)):
    for j in range(len(filled[0])):
      if filled[i][j] == 0 and {(i, j - 1)} & twos and {(i, j + 1)} & twos:
        filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j)})
  return hmirror(filled)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Mirror:** It cleverly mirrors the grid horizontally.
2. **Apply Program_A Logic:** Utilizes the logic of Program_A on the mirrored grid, which now effectively targets the correct cells due to the mirroring.
3. **Mirror Back:** Mirrors the result back to its original orientation.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  filled = I
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      shifted_obj = shift(obj, (0, 1))
      for i, j in toindices(shifted_obj):
        if index(I, (i, j)) == 0 and (i, j - 2) in toindices(obj):
          filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j)})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '2' Objects:** Similar to other versions, it identifies '2' objects.
2. **Shift and Check:** It shifts the object one step to the right and iterates through its cells. For each cell, it checks if the original grid has a '0' at that location and a '2' two steps to the left (belonging to the original object).
3. **Fill:** If the conditions are met, the cell is filled with '1'.
