## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of value '2' and painting a border of '1's around them, but only to the right and below the object. This border extends to fill empty ('0') spaces but doesn't overwrite existing values.

**Example:**

```
Input:       Output:
0 2 2 0      0 2 2 0
0 2 0 0      0 2 1 0
0 2 2 0      0 2 2 0
              1 1 1 0
```

**Detailed Analysis:**

* **Input_0:** No change, as the '2' object is already completely bordered.
* **Input_1 & Input_2:** A right and bottom border of '1's is added to all objects with value '2'. 

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(1, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda x: x[1] + 1 < width(I) and index(I, (x[0], x[1] + 1)) == 0 and (index(I, x) == 2 or index(I, (x[0] + 1, x[1])) == 2))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mfilter(asindices(I), lambda x: ...)`:** This identifies the indices where a '1' should be painted. 
    * `x[1] + 1 < width(I)`: Ensures we're not on the rightmost edge.
    * `index(I, (x[0], x[1] + 1)) == 0`: Checks if the cell to the right is empty ('0').
    * `index(I, x) == 2 or index(I, (x[0] + 1, x[1])) == 2`: Checks if the current cell or the one below is part of a '2' object.
2. **`recolor(1, ...)`:** Creates an object with value '1' at the identified indices.
3. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the new object onto the original grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  filled = I
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      filled = paint(filled, recolor(1, frozenset((i, j + 1) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j + 1 < width(I) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0)))
      filled = paint(filled, recolor(1, frozenset((i + 1, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if i + 1 < height(I) and index(I, (i + 1, j)) == 0)))
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:**  Extracts objects from the grid (connected components of same value, excluding background).
2. **Loop:** Iterates over each extracted object.
3. **`color(obj) == 2`:**  Focuses on objects with value '2'.
4. **`paint(..., recolor(1, ...))`:** Similar to version 1, but handles right and bottom borders separately. 
    * First `paint` paints the right border.
    * Second `paint` paints the bottom border.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(1, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda x: ((x[1] + 1 < width(I) and index(I, (x[0], x[1] + 1)) == 0 and index(I, x) == 2) or (x[0] + 1 < height(I) and index(I, (x[0] + 1, x[1])) == 0 and index(I, x) == 2)))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to version 1 but compresses the border logic into a single `mfilter` call. The lambda function now checks for both right and bottom border conditions within a single expression.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  filled = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) == 2:
        if j + 1 < width(I) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0:
          filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j + 1)})
        if i + 1 < height(I) and index(I, (i + 1, j)) == 0:
          filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i + 1, j)})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates over each cell in the grid and, if it finds a '2', checks its right and bottom neighbors. If the neighbor is empty ('0'), it fills that cell with a '1'. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(1, difference(delta(ofcolor(I, 2)), ofcolor(I, 2))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 2)`:** Gets the indices of all cells with value '2'.
2. **`delta(...)`:**  Finds the indices surrounding the '2' objects.
3. **`difference(..., ofcolor(I, 2))`:** Removes the indices of the '2' objects themselves, leaving only potential border indices. 
4. **`recolor(1, ...)`:**  Creates a new object with value '1' at those border indices.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the border object onto the original grid.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic. Each version achieves the desired output, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
