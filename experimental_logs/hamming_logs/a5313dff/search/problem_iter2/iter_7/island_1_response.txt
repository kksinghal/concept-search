## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of color '2' and extending a "tail" of '1's to the right of the object, stopping at the grid border or another non-zero cell. 

**Input 0:** The object remains unchanged as it already touches the right border.

**Input 1:** A tail of '1's is extended from the rightmost point of the '2' object until it reaches the right border.

**Input 2:** Tails of '1's are extended from the rightmost points of all '2' objects, stopping at the grid border or encountering a non-zero cell.

## Program to be generated:

Here are five distinct program versions for the given transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(grid):
  def extend_tail(obj, grid):
    tail_start = (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)
    tail = {(tail_start[0], j) for j in range(tail_start[1], len(grid[0])) if index(grid, (tail_start[0], j)) == 0}
    return fill(grid, 1, tail)

  return fold(extend_tail, grid, colorfilter(objects(grid, True, False, False), 2))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_tail(obj, grid)` Function:** 
   - Calculates the starting point of the tail: `(lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)`.
   - Identifies empty cells ('0's) to the right of the object on the same row, forming the `tail`.
   - Fills the `tail` indices with '1's on the `grid`.

2. **Main Program:**
   - Extracts all objects from the `grid` (`objects(grid, True, False, False)`).
   - Filters objects to get only those with color '2' (`colorfilter(..., 2)`).
   - Uses `fold` (Note: This function is not provided in your DSL, it needs to be defined separately) to iteratively apply the `extend_tail` function on the `grid` for each '2' colored object.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(grid):
  def process_row(grid, i):
    for obj in colorfilter(objects(crop(grid, (i, 0), (1, len(grid[0]))), True, False, False), 2):
      grid = fill(grid, 1, {(i, j) for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, len(grid[0])) if index(grid, (i, j)) == 0})
    return grid

  return fold(process_row, grid, range(len(grid)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`process_row(grid, i)` Function:**
   - Extracts a single row from the `grid` using `crop`.
   - Finds '2' colored objects within this row.
   - For each object, identifies empty cells to the right and fills them with '1's.

2. **Main Program:**
   - Uses `fold` to iterate through each row index of the `grid`.
   - Applies `process_row` to each row, effectively extending tails for objects on that row.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(grid):
  for i in range(len(grid)):
    for j in range(len(grid[0])):
      if grid[i][j] == 2:
        k = j + 1
        while k < len(grid[0]) and grid[i][k] == 0:
          grid = fill(grid, 1, {(i, k)})
          k += 1
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates through each cell in the `grid`.
- If it finds a cell with value '2', it moves to the right, filling empty cells with '1' until it encounters a non-zero cell or the grid border.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(grid):
  def extend_right(grid, loc):
    i, j = loc
    if j + 1 < len(grid[0]) and grid[i][j + 1] == 0:
      return fill(grid, 1, {(i, j + 1)})
    return grid

  return fold(extend_right, grid, {(i, j) for i in range(len(grid)) for j in range(len(grid[0])) if grid[i][j] == 2})
```

**Explanation:**

- Defines `extend_right` to fill the cell to the right with '1' if it's empty.
- Uses `fold` to apply `extend_right` for every cell containing '2', effectively extending tails one cell at a time.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(grid):
  for obj in colorfilter(objects(grid, True, False, False), 2):
    grid = fill(grid, 1, connect((lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj)), (lowermost(obj), len(grid[0]) - 1)))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

- For each '2' colored object, it directly fills a line with '1's from the rightmost point to the right edge of the grid using `connect` and `fill`.

These five versions utilize different approaches and DSL function combinations to achieve the same goal, showcasing the flexibility and diversity possible with the DSL.
