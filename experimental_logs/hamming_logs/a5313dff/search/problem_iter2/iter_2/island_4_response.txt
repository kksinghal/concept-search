## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of a specific color (usually 2) and filling the cells to the right of these objects with another color (usually 1) if those cells are empty (color 0). The filling process stops when it encounters a non-empty cell or the edge of the grid. 

**Let's break down the transformation for each example:**

* **Input_0:**  The transformation doesn't change this input as there are no empty cells to the right of the object colored 2.
* **Input_1:**  The transformation fills the cells to the right of the objects colored 2 with the color 1, stopping at the non-empty cells or the grid edge. 
* **Input_2:**  Similarly, the transformation fills the cells to the right of the object colored 2, highlighting the spaces adjacent to it.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
        for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj)):
          if index(I, (i, j)) == 2:
            if j + 1 < width(I) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0:
              I = fill(I, 1, {(i, j + 1)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** We loop through each object in the grid identified using `objects(I, True, False, True)`.
2. **Filter by color:** We focus on objects with color 2 using `if color(obj) == 2`.
3. **Iterate within object:**  We loop through each cell within the object using its bounding box coordinates obtained from `uppermost`, `lowermost`, `leftmost`, and `rightmost`.
4. **Check right neighbor:** For each cell of the object, we check if its right neighbor exists within the grid bounds (`j + 1 < width(I)`) and if it's empty (`index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0`).
5. **Fill:** If both conditions are met, we fill the right neighbor cell with color 1 using `fill(I, 1, {(i, j + 1)})`.
6. **Return:** Finally, we return the modified grid `I`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(1, mfilter(product(range(height(I)), range(width(I))), lambda x: index(I, x) == 0 and index(I, (x[0], x[1]-1)) == 2)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Generate all indices:** We create a set of all possible indices in the grid using `product(range(height(I)), range(width(I)))`.
2. **Filter by condition:** We keep only those indices where the cell is empty (`index(I, x) == 0`) and its left neighbor is of color 2 (`index(I, (x[0], x[1]-1)) == 2`) using `mfilter`.
3. **Recolor and paint:** We recolor the filtered indices with color 1 using `recolor(1, ...)` and paint them onto the original grid using `paint(I, ...)`.
4. **Return:** The modified grid `I` is returned.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  neighbors = mfilter(product(range(height(I)), range(width(I))), lambda x: index(I, x) == 0 and (x[0], x[1] - 1) in toindices(obj))
  return paint(I, recolor(1, neighbors))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract target object:** We isolate the object with color 2 using `extract(objects(...), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)`.
2. **Find neighboring cells:** We identify all empty cells (`index(I, x) == 0`) whose left neighbor belongs to the extracted object (`(x[0], x[1] - 1) in toindices(obj)`) using `mfilter`.
3. **Recolor and paint:**  The identified neighboring cells are recolored with color 1 (`recolor(1, neighbors)`) and painted onto the original grid (`paint(I, ...)`).
4. **Return:**  We return the modified grid `I`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)-1):
      if index(I, (i,j)) == 2 and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0:
        I = fill(I, 1, {(i, j + 1)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:**  We iterate through each cell in the grid except the last column.
2. **Check for condition:** We check if the current cell has color 2 and its right neighbor is empty.
3. **Fill:** If the condition is met, we fill the right neighbor with color 1.
4. **Return:** Finally, we return the modified grid `I`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(1, frozenset((i, j+1) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(width(I)-1) if index(I, (i,j)) == 2 and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find target cells:** We identify all cells whose left neighbor has color 2 and are themselves empty. 
2. **Recolor and paint:** We recolor the identified cells with color 1 and paint them onto the original grid.
3. **Return:** The modified grid `I` is returned.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressive power of the DSL. Each version utilizes a distinct combination of functions and logic, offering diverse solutions to the problem.
