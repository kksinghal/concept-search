## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects with color '2' and extending them to the right by filling empty cells with '1'. However, the extension only occurs if the object is connected to another '2' on its left within the same row.

**Input 0:** 
- No change as the single '2' object isn't connected to another '2' on its left.

**Input 1:**
- The top-right '2' extends right, filling one cell with '1' due to its connection to the left '2'.
- The bottom '2' object extends right, filling three cells with '1' due to its connection to the left '2's.

**Input 2:**
- The transformation follows the same pattern as Input 1, extending '2' objects rightward with '1's only if connected to a '2' on their left. 

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def extend_object(obj, grid):
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj)):
        if index(grid, (i, j)) == 2 and index(grid, (i, j - 1)) != 2:
          return fill(grid, 1, {(i, k) for k in range(j + 1, len(grid[0])) if index(grid, (i, k)) == 0}) 
    return grid
  return fold(extend_object, grid, colorfilter(objects(grid, True, False, False), 2))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`extend_object(obj, grid)` Function:**
   - Iterates through each cell of a given object.
   - Checks if a cell is '2' and not connected to a '2' on its left.
   - If true, fills all empty cells to the right of this cell with '1'.
2. **Main Program:**
   - Extracts all objects with color '2'.
   - Uses `fold` (not defined in the provided DSL, but crucial for this approach) to apply `extend_object` to each extracted object and the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for i in range(len(grid)):
    for j in range(1, len(grid[0])):
      if index(grid, (i, j)) == 2 and index(grid, (i, j - 1)) == 2:
        grid = fill(grid, 1, {(i, k) for k in range(j + 1, len(grid[0])) if index(grid, (i, k)) == 0})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**
- Iterates through each cell in the grid.
- Checks if a cell contains '2' and has a '2' to its left.
- If true, fills all empty cells to the right with '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def extend_right(grid, obj):
    return fill(grid, 1, {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)
                           for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, len(grid[0]))
                           if index(grid, (i, j - 1)) == 2 and index(grid, (i, j)) == 0})
  return fold(extend_right, grid, colorfilter(objects(grid, True, False, False), 2))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`extend_right(grid, obj)` Function:**
   - Fills empty cells to the right of an object with '1' only if the cell's left neighbor is '2'.
2. **Main Program:**
   - Extracts '2' colored objects and applies `extend_right` to them using `fold`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for obj in colorfilter(objects(grid, True, False, False), 2):
    rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      if index(grid, (i, rightmost_j)) == 2 and index(grid, (i, rightmost_j - 1)) == 2:
        grid = fill(grid, 1, {(i, j) for j in range(rightmost_j + 1, len(grid[0])) if index(grid, (i, j)) == 0})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**
- Iterates through each '2' colored object.
- Checks if the rightmost cell of the object is '2' and connected to another '2' on its left. 
- If true, fills empty cells to the right of this cell with '1'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def process_row(grid, i):
    for obj in colorfilter(objects(crop(grid, (i, 0), (1, len(grid[0]))), True, False, False), 2):
      if any(index(grid, (i, j)) == 2 and index(grid, (i, j-1)) == 2 for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj))):
        grid = fill(grid, 1, {(i, j) for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, len(grid[0])) if index(grid, (i, j)) == 0})
    return grid
  return fold(process_row, grid, range(len(grid)))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`process_row(grid, i)` Function:**
   - Processes one row of the grid at a time.
   - Checks if any cell in the '2' colored objects within that row has a '2' to its left.
   - If true, fills empty cells to the right of the object with '1'.
2. **Main Program:**
   - Uses `fold` to apply `process_row` to each row of the grid.


**Note:** The function "fold" is not provided in the given DSL. However, its functionality is crucial for implementing some of these solutions. It would need to be defined or provided externally to achieve the desired output.
