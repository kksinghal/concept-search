## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects made of the digit '2' and fills in specific background ('0') cells adjacent to these objects with the digit '1'. 

* **Horizontal Fill:** A background cell is filled if it's horizontally sandwiched between '2's. 
* **Rightward Expansion:** The fill expands rightwards from the leftmost '2' of the object, stopping at the object's right boundary or an existing non-background cell.

**Let's visualize this with Input_1's transformation:**

**Input_1:**
```
1 1 1 2 0 0 0 0
1 2 1 2 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 2 0 0 0 0
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0
0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0
0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0
0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0
0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 
```

**Output_1:**
```
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0
0 0 2 1 1 1 2 0
0 0 2 1 2 1 2 0
0 0 2 1 1 1 2 0
0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 
```

Notice how the '1's fill the space to the right of the leftmost '2' in each row where the object exists.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 2)
  filled = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + 1):
        if index(I, (i, j)) == 0 and index(I, (i, j - 1)) == 2:
          filled = insert((1, (i, j)), filled)
  return paint(I, filled)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '2' Objects:** `colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 2)` extracts objects formed by the digit '2'.
2. **Iterate within Objects:** It iterates over each object's bounding box.
3. **Horizontal Fill Condition:** `index(I, (i, j)) == 0 and index(I, (i, j - 1)) == 2` checks if a cell is background ('0') and has a '2' to its left.
4. **Fill and Return:** If the condition is met, the cell is marked for filling with '1'. Finally, `paint` applies the changes to the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def fill_condition(loc):
    i, j = loc
    return index(I, (i, j)) == 0 and j > 0 and index(I, (i, j - 1)) == 2
  
  target_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), fill_condition)
  return paint(I, recolor(1, target_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Fill Condition Function:**  `fill_condition(loc)` encapsulates the check for a background cell with a '2' to its left.
2. **Identify Fill Locations:** `mfilter(asindices(I), fill_condition)` finds all indices satisfying the fill condition.
3. **Recolor and Return:** `recolor(1, target_indices)` creates an object with '1' at the target indices. `paint` then applies this object to the grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_fill(grid, start_j, i):
    j = start_j + 1
    while j < len(grid[0]) and grid[i][j] == 0:
      grid = fill(grid, 1, {(i, j)})
      j += 1
    return grid

  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 2:
        I = right_fill(I, j, i)
        break 
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Right Fill Function:** `right_fill` takes a grid, a starting column index, and a row index. It fills rightward from the start until a non-background cell is encountered.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** The program iterates through the grid. Upon finding a '2', it calls `right_fill` to perform the rightward fill on that row, starting from the '2's position.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def should_fill(grid, loc):
    i, j = loc
    return j > 0 and grid[i][j] == 0 and grid[i][j - 1] == 2

  new_grid = [[I[i][j] for j in range(len(I[0]))] for i in range(len(I))] 
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if should_fill(I, (i, j)):
        new_grid[i][j] = 1
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Should Fill Function:**  `should_fill` checks the fill condition for a given location.
2. **Create New Grid:**  A new grid is created as a copy of the input.
3. **Iterate and Apply Fill:** The program iterates over the grid, and if `should_fill` returns True for a location, it modifies the new grid accordingly.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_fill_indices(obj):
    return frozenset(
      (i, j)
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)
      for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + 1)
      if index(I, (i, j)) == 0 and index(I, (i, j - 1)) == 2
    )

  objs = colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 2)
  fill_indices = merge(apply(right_fill_indices, objs))
  return paint(I, recolor(1, fill_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Right Fill Indices Function:** `right_fill_indices` determines the indices to be filled within a given object.
2. **Find Objects and Fill Indices:**  It first identifies the '2' objects. Then, `apply(right_fill_indices, objs)` maps the `right_fill_indices` function to each object to find fill indices within them. These indices are then merged.
3. **Paint and Return:** Finally, it recolors the merged indices with '1' and paints them onto the input grid.


Each of these program versions provides a distinct way of implementing the desired transformation using the given DSL. They showcase different strategies for identifying the target cells and applying the fill operation.
