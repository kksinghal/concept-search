## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects made of the digit '2' and extending them to the right, filling the space with the digit '1' until they reach the right edge of the grid. The original shape of the '2' objects is preserved.

**Example:**

Input:
```
1 1 1 2 0 0 0 0
1 2 1 2 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 2 0 0 0 0
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0
0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0
0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0
0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0
0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0
```

Output:
```
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0
0 0 2 1 1 1 2 0
0 0 2 1 2 1 2 0
0 0 2 1 1 1 2 0
0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0
```

## Program_to_be_generated:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def program_v1(grid):
  def extend_object(obj, grid):
    return fill(grid, 1, {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) 
                           for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, len(grid[0])) 
                           if index(grid, (i, j)) == 0 and hmatching({(i, j)}, obj)})
  return fold(extend_object, grid, colorfilter(objects(grid, True, False, False), 2))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(grid, True, False, False)`:**  Identifies all connected objects in the grid.
2. **`colorfilter(..., 2)`:** Filters the objects to only include those made of the digit '2'.
3. **`fold(extend_object, grid, ...)`:**  Iterates over the '2' objects and applies the `extend_object` function to each, accumulating the changes in the `grid`.
4. **`extend_object(obj, grid)`:** 
    -  For each object `obj`:
        - It finds all empty cells (`index(grid, (i, j)) == 0`) to the right of the object's rightmost column (`j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, len(grid[0]))`).
        - It checks if the cell is horizontally aligned with the object (`hmatching({(i, j)}, obj)`), ensuring it's an extension of the object and not a separate area.
        - It fills those cells with the digit '1' (`fill(grid, 1, ...)`).

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def program_v2(grid):
  def process_row(grid, i):
    for obj in colorfilter(objects(crop(grid, (i, 0), (1, len(grid[0]))), True, False, False), 2):
      grid = fill(grid, 1, {(i, j) for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, len(grid[0]))})
    return grid
  return fold(process_row, grid, range(len(grid)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`range(len(grid))`:** Creates a sequence of row indices.
2. **`fold(process_row, grid, ...)`:** Iterates through each row index and applies the `process_row` function.
3. **`process_row(grid, i)`:**
    - For each row `i`:
        - It crops the grid to only include the current row (`crop(grid, (i, 0), (1, len(grid[0])))`).
        - It identifies '2' objects within this row.
        - It extends each object to the right edge of the row by filling with '1'.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def program_v3(grid):
  def extend_right(grid, obj):
    return fill(grid, 1, {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)
                           for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, len(grid[0]))
                           if index(grid, (i, j)) == 0})
  return fold(extend_right, grid, colorfilter(objects(grid, True, False, False), 2)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(grid, True, False, False)` and `colorfilter(..., 2)`:** Identifies '2' objects in the grid.
2. **`fold(extend_right, grid, ...)`:** Iteratively applies `extend_right` to each '2' object.
3. **`extend_right(grid, obj)`:** 
    - Finds all empty cells to the right of the object within the object's row span.
    - Fills those cells with '1', effectively extending the object to the right edge.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def program_v4(grid):
  for obj in colorfilter(objects(grid, True, False, False), 2):
    grid = fill(grid, 1, product(range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1), range(rightmost(obj) + 1, len(grid[0]))))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. It iterates through each '2' object identified in the grid.
2. For each object:
    - It creates a cartesian product using `product` to generate all possible index pairs within the rectangle starting from the object's right edge and spanning its height.
    - It fills all those indices with '1', effectively extending the object to the right edge.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def program_v5(grid):
  def extend_column(grid, j):
    for i in range(len(grid)):
      if index(grid, (i, j)) == 2:
        return fill(grid, 1, {(i, k) for k in range(j + 1, len(grid[0])) if index(grid, (i, k)) == 0})
    return grid
  return fold(extend_column, grid, range(len(grid[0])))
```

**Explanation:**

1. It iterates through each column index of the grid.
2. **`extend_column(grid, j)`:**
    - For each column `j`:
        - It checks if there is a '2' in that column. 
        - If found, it extends a '1' fill from the right of that '2' to the edge of the grid within the same row.
        - This ensures that any '2' encountered in a column triggers the rightward extension for its entire row.


These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation. Each utilizes different combinations of DSL functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL.
