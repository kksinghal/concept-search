## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of value '2' and extending them to the right by one cell, but only if the target cell has a value of '0'.  Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** 
No change occurs as there are no cells with value '2' that have a '0' immediately to their right.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
* The top three rows: The rightmost '2' in each row extends one cell to the right, filling the '0'.
* The fifth to seventh rows: The '2's extend to the right, filling the '0's.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
*  The '2' objects in the third, fourth, fifth and sixth rows extend one cell to the right. 

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(1, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda x: index(I, x) == 2 and x[1] + 1 < width(I) and index(I, (x[0], x[1] + 1)) == 0)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asindices(I)`:** Creates a set of all cell indices in the grid `I`.
2. **`lambda x: ...`:**  Defines an anonymous function that checks if a cell at index `x`:
   -  Has a value of '2' (`index(I, x) == 2`).
   -  Is not on the rightmost edge of the grid (`x[1] + 1 < width(I)`).
   -  Has a '0' to its right (`index(I, (x[0], x[1] + 1)) == 0`).
3. **`mfilter(...)`:** Filters the indices from `asindices(I)` keeping only those that satisfy the conditions of the anonymous function.
4. **`recolor(1, ...)`:** Creates an object from the filtered indices, assigning a color of '1' to each cell.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the object onto the original grid `I`, effectively extending the '2' objects to the right. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for x in range(height(I)):
    for y in range(width(I) - 1):
      if index(I, (x, y)) == 2 and index(I, (x, y + 1)) == 0:
        I = fill(I, 1, {(x, y + 1)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`for x in range(height(I))` and `for y in range(width(I) - 1)`:** Iterates through each cell in the grid, excluding the rightmost column.
2. **`if index(I, (x, y)) == 2 and index(I, (x, y + 1)) == 0`:** Checks if the current cell has a value of '2' and the cell to its right has a value of '0'.
3. **`I = fill(I, 1, {(x, y + 1)})`:** If the conditions are met, the cell to the right is filled with a value of '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(1, product(range(height(I)), range(width(I) - 1))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`product(range(height(I)), range(width(I) - 1))`:** Generates all possible cell indices in the grid, excluding the rightmost column.
2. **`recolor(1, ...)`:** Creates an object from the generated indices, assigning a color of '1' to each cell.
3. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the object onto the original grid `I`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return fill(I, 1, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda x: x[1] + 1 < width(I) and index(I, (x[0], x[1] + 1)) == 0 and index(I, x) == 2))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mfilter(asindices(I), lambda x: ...)`:** Filters the indices of grid `I` to get the indices of cells which are not on the rightmost column (`x[1] + 1 < width(I)`) and the cell to the right is 0 (`index(I, (x[0], x[1] + 1)) == 0`) and the current cell value is 2 (`index(I, x) == 2`)
2. **`fill(I, 1, ...)`:** Fills the grid `I` with value 1 at the indices returned by the previous `mfilter` call.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
        for i in range(height(I)):
            if index(I, (i, j)) == 2 and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0:
                I = fill(I, 1, {(i, j + 1)})
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`for j in range(width(I) - 1)` and `for i in range(height(I))`:** Iterates through each column first and then rows in the grid, excluding the rightmost column.
2. **`if index(I, (i, j)) == 2 and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0`:** Checks if the current cell has a value of '2' and the cell to its right has a value of '0'.
3. **`I = fill(I, 1, {(i, j + 1)})`:** If the conditions are met, the cell to the right is filled with a value of '1'.


These five program versions offer diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation while adhering to the provided DSL. Each version leverages different function combinations and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the language.
