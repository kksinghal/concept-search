## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects with the color "2" and extending them to the right by one cell, filling those cells with the color "1".

**Input_0:**
- The object "2" has empty cells to its right.
- The program fills those cells with "1", effectively extending the object.

**Input_1:**
- Similar to Input_0, the object "2" is extended to the right with "1"s.

**Input_2:**
- The pattern repeats, extending the "2" object rightward with "1"s.

## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(1, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda x: index(I, x) == 2 and x[1] + 1 < width(I) and index(I, (x[0], x[1] + 1)) == 0)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asindices(I)`:** Generates all indices of the input grid `I`.
2. **`mfilter(...)`:** Filters the indices based on the following conditions:
   - **`index(I, x) == 2`:**  The cell at the current index contains the color "2".
   - **`x[1] + 1 < width(I)`:** Checks if there is a cell to the right of the current index within the grid boundaries.
   - **`index(I, (x[0], x[1] + 1)) == 0`:**  Checks if the cell to the right is empty (color "0").
3. **`recolor(1, ...)`:** Recolors the filtered indices (representing the cells to be filled) with the color "1".
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the re-colored indices onto the original grid `I`, producing the final output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, frozenset((1, (i, j + 1)) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, val in enumerate(row) if val == 2 and j + 1 < width(I) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`for i, row in enumerate(I)`:** Iterates over each row (`row`) and its index (`i`) in the input grid `I`.
2. **`for j, val in enumerate(row)`:** Iterates over each cell value (`val`) and its index (`j`) in the current row.
3. **`if val == 2 and j + 1 < width(I) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0`:** Checks for cells with color "2" that have an empty cell to their right within the grid boundaries.
4. **`frozenset((1, (i, j + 1)) ...)`:** Creates a new object containing only the cells to the right of the identified "2" cells, recolored to "1".
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the new object onto the original input grid `I`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
    return paint(I, recolor(1, frozenset((i, j + 1) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j + 1 < width(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)`:**  Extracts the object with color "2" from the input grid.
2. **`frozenset((i, j + 1) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j + 1 < width(I))`:** Generates indices of cells immediately to the right of the extracted object, ensuring they are within grid boundaries.
3. **`recolor(1, ...)`:** Recolors the generated indices to "1".
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the re-colored indices onto the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, recolor(1, mfilter(product(range(height(I)), range(width(I) - 1)), lambda x: index(I, x) == 2 and index(I, (x[0], x[1] + 1)) == 0)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`product(range(height(I)), range(width(I) - 1))`:** Generates all possible cell indices within the grid, excluding the rightmost column.
2. **`mfilter(...)`:** Filters the indices based on two conditions:
   -  The cell at the current index contains "2".
   -  The cell to its right contains "0".
3. **`recolor(1, ...)`:** Recolors the filtered indices (the cells to the right of "2") to "1".
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the re-colored indices onto the original grid `I`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  return paint(I, recolor(1, toindices(shift(obj, (0, 1)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)`:** Extracts the object with color "2".
2. **`shift(obj, (0, 1))`:** Shifts the extracted object one cell to the right.
3. **`toindices(...)`:** Extracts the indices of the shifted object.
4. **`recolor(1, ...)`:** Recolors the extracted indices to "1".
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the re-colored indices onto the original grid `I`.
