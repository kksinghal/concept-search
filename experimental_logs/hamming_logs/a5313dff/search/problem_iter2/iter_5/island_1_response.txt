## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects with the color '2' and extends a "tail" of '1's to the right from their bottom-right corner. Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
* No change is observed as there are no '0's to the right of the bottom-right corner of the '2' object.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
* The bottom '2' object gets a tail of three '1's extending to the right.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
* The large '2' object gets a tail of two '1's on the fourth row.
* The bottom-most '2' object gets a single '1' as a tail.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions utilizing the DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  filled = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), objs) # Blank canvas with objects
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      i = lowermost(obj)
      j = rightmost(obj) + 1
      while j < len(I[0]) and index(I, (i, j)) == 0:
        filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j)})
        j += 1
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a blank canvas:** `paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), objs)` creates a grid of the same size as input `I` filled with '0's and then paints the objects from `I` onto it.
2. **Iterate through objects:**  Iterate through each object (`obj`) in the grid.
3. **Find tail start:** For objects with color '2', find the starting point of the tail `(i, j)`, which is the cell to the right of the object's bottom-right corner.
4. **Extend the tail:**  While staying within the grid bounds and encountering '0's, fill the current cell `(i, j)` with '1' and move to the right.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_tail(grid, obj):
    tail_start = (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)
    tail_indices = sfilter(hfrontier(tail_start), lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(grid[0]) and index(grid, loc) == 0)
    return fill(grid, 1, {(loc[0], loc[1]) for loc in tail_indices})
  
  return apply(lambda obj: extend_tail(I, obj) if color(obj) == 2 else I, objects(I, True, False, False))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `extend_tail` Function:** This function takes the grid and an object as input and returns the grid with the extended tail for that object if its color is 2.
2. **Find tail start and indices:** Determine `tail_start` and filter the `hfrontier` to get the indices where the tail should be extended.
3. **Fill tail indices:** Fill the `tail_indices` with '1' using the `fill` function.
4. **Apply to objects:** Apply the `extend_tail` function to all objects with color '2' in the grid. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  filled = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), objs)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      tail_length = len(extract(sfilter(hfrontier((lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)), lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0])), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0))
      filled = fill(filled, 1, {(lowermost(obj), j) for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + 1 + tail_length)})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a blank canvas:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Calculate tail length:** For each '2' object, calculate the `tail_length` using `extract` and `sfilter` on the horizontal frontier.
3. **Fill the tail:**  Fill the `filled` grid with '1's for the calculated `tail_length`.

**Program Version 4:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def paint_tail(grid, start):
    j = start[1]
    while j < len(grid[0]) and index(grid, (start[0], j)) == 0:
      grid = paint(grid, {(1, (start[0], j))})
      j += 1
    return grid

  return apply(lambda obj: paint_tail(I, (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)) if color(obj) == 2 else I, objects(I, True, False, False)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `paint_tail` function:** This function takes the grid and starting point of the tail and paints '1's to extend the tail.
2. **Iterate and paint:** Iterate along the horizontal frontier from the `start` and paint '1's as long as '0's are encountered.
3. **Apply to objects:** Apply `paint_tail` to all objects with color '2'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def get_tail(obj, grid):
    i = lowermost(obj)
    j = rightmost(obj) + 1
    tail = set()
    while j < len(grid[0]) and index(grid, (i, j)) == 0:
      tail.add((i, j))
      j += 1
    return tail
  
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  tails = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: get_tail(obj, I) if color(obj) == 2 else set())
  return fill(I, 1, tails)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `get_tail` function:** This function finds the tail indices for a given object and grid.
2. **Find all tail indices:**  Use `mfilter` to get a set of all tail indices from all objects with color '2'.
3. **Fill the tails:** Fill the original grid `I` with '1's at the collected `tails` indices.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL. Each utilizes various functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL and the potential for diverse solutions.
