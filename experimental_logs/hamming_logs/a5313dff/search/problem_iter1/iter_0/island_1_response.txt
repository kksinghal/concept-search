## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to focus on filling the internal space of objects with the value '1'. Let's break down the pattern for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**  The single '2' object in the input grid has its internal empty spaces filled with '1' in the output grid.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  Both '2' objects in the input grid, including the L-shaped one, have their internal spaces filled with '1' in the output.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** All '2' objects in the input have their internal spaces filled with '1' in the output, maintaining the overall structure of the objects.

**Transformation Logic:** The transformation identifies objects formed by connected cells of the same value (excluding the background color '0'). For each object, it then fills any internal space surrounded by object cells with the value '1'.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if size(palette(obj)) == 1:
      for i in range(uppermost(obj) + 1, lowermost(obj)):
        for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj)):
          if index(I, (i, j)) == 0:
            O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  `O = I` creates a copy of the input grid to modify.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** `for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):` iterates through each object in the grid (excluding background).
3. **Single Color Check:** `if size(palette(obj)) == 1:` ensures only objects of a single color are considered.
4. **Iterate within Object:** Nested loops iterate through the potential internal space of each object.
5. **Fill Condition:** `if index(I, (i, j)) == 0:` checks if the cell is empty (background color).
6. **Fill:** `O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})` fills the identified empty cell with '1'.
7. **Return:** `return O` returns the modified grid. 

This version iterates through each object and fills its internal spaces if it's a single-color object, effectively achieving the desired transformation.



## Program Version 2: 

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  filled = I
  for obj in colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 2):
    for i in range(uppermost(obj) + 1, lowermost(obj)):
      for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj)):
        if index(filled, (i, j)) == 0:
          filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j)})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Filter Objects by Color:** `colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 2)` first extracts all objects and then filters them to only include objects of color '2'.
3. **Iterate and Fill:** The remaining logic is identical to version 1, focusing on filling internal spaces of the selected objects.

This version optimizes the process by only iterating through objects of color '2', potentially improving efficiency.



## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if numcolors(obj) == 1:
      box_indices = difference(backdrop(obj), toindices(obj))
      for i, j in box_indices:
        if index(O, (i, j)) == 0:
          O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Iterates through all objects in the grid.
3. **Single Color Check:** `if numcolors(obj) == 1:` verifies if the object has only one color.
4. **Calculate Internal Indices:** `box_indices = difference(backdrop(obj), toindices(obj))` calculates the indices within the bounding box of the object but not part of the object itself. 
5. **Fill Internal Spaces:** It then iterates through `box_indices` and fills those that are background color ('0') with '1'. 

This version efficiently identifies and fills internal spaces using `backdrop` and `toindices` functions, leading to more concise code.



## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    I = underfill(I, 1, inbox(obj))
  return I
```
**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** `for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):` iterates through each object in the grid (excluding the background).
2. **Fill the Inbox:** For each object, it directly fills its "inbox" (the area within the object's outer boundary) with the value '1' using `underfill`. 
3. **Return:** `return I` returns the modified grid.

This version is even more concise and avoids nested loops by leveraging the `underfill` and `inbox` functions to achieve the same outcome.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(1, delta(obj)), objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Internal Indices:** `delta(obj)` calculates the indices within the bounding box of each object but not part of the object itself.
2. **Recolor Internal Indices:** `recolor(1, delta(obj))` creates a new object with the internal indices colored with '1'.
3. **Merge Internal Objects:** `merge(...)` combines all the recolored internal spaces into a single object.
4. **Paint on Original Grid:**  `paint(I, ...)` paints the merged internal object onto the original grid, filling the spaces.

This version uses a functional approach, utilizing `recolor`, `delta`, and `merge` to achieve the transformation in a single line of code.



These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to solving the problem, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
