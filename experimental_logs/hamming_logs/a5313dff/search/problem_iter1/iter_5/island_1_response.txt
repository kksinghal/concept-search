## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '2' and filling the spaces within these objects with the digit '1'. However, the filling process only occurs if the space is directly connected to another '2' on its left side. 

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 
- The single object formed by '2's gets its internal space filled with '1's.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** 
- Two separate objects are present. 
- The spaces within the horizontal object are filled with '1's since they have a '2' to their left.
- The spaces within the vertical object remain unchanged because they don't have a '2' to their left.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** 
- This example further reinforces the pattern observed in the previous ones.
- Only spaces within objects and connected to a '2' on their left are filled. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1 (Building on Program_B):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  filled = I
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2: 
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1): 
        for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj)):
          if index(filled, (i, j)) == 0 and index(filled, (i, j - 1)) == 2:
            filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j)}) 
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

- This version closely follows Program_B but corrects a minor error. 
- It iterates through all rows and columns within an object's bounding box.
- The `if` condition ensures that a cell is filled only if it's empty (`== 0`) and has a '2' to its immediate left (`index(filled, (i, j - 1)) == 2`).

**Version 2 (Using `sfilter` and `apply`):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  twos = sfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: {(1, (i, j)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj)) if index(I, (i, j)) == 0 and index(I, (i, j - 1)) == 2}, twos))) 
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses a more functional approach.
- `sfilter` extracts objects with color '2'.
- `apply` then processes each object to generate the indices to be filled with '1' based on the specified condition.
- Finally, `paint` is used to modify the original grid with the generated indices.

**Version 3 (Leveraging `hsplit` and `hconcat`):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return hconcat(*(
      ((r[:lm] + tuple(1 if v == 0 and r[j - 1] == 2 else v for j, v in enumerate(r[lm:])) + r[rm:]) 
      if 2 in r else r) 
      for r in I 
      for lm in [next((j for j, v in enumerate(r) if v == 2), len(r))] 
      for rm in [next((j for j, v in enumerate(r) if j > lm and v != 2), len(r))]
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates through each row and identifies segments that need to be filled.
- `hsplit` is implicitly used by finding the leftmost (`lm`) and rightmost (`rm`) indices of '2' in each row.
-  It fills segments with '1' if they are empty and have a '2' to their left.
- `hconcat` then combines the modified rows back into a grid.

**Version 4 (Exploiting `dmirror` for Left-Right Check):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  mirrored = dmirror(I)
  filled = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 0 and I[i][j - 1] == 2 and mirrored[j][i - 1] == 2:
        filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j)})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses `dmirror` to create a mirrored copy of the grid.
-  It checks for the '2' on the left in the original grid (`I[i][j - 1] == 2`) and on the right (mirrored left) in the mirrored grid (`mirrored[j][i - 1] == 2`).
-  If both conditions are true, the cell is filled.

**Version 5 (Combining `ofcolor` and `dneighbors`):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  filled = I
  twos = ofcolor(I, 2)
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 0 and {(i, j - 1)} & twos and {(i, j + 1)} & twos:
        filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j)})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

- This version identifies all indices of '2's using `ofcolor`.
- It iterates through every cell in the grid and checks if it's empty and has '2's as direct neighbors on both its left and right sides using set intersection (`&`) with `dneighbors`.
- If the conditions are met, the cell is filled.


Each version provides a distinct approach to achieve the desired transformation while adhering to the provided DSL. They highlight the flexibility and power of the DSL in expressing the same logical transformation in various ways.
