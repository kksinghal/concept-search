## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves filling the interior spaces of objects with the color '1'.  However, the filling logic is not as straightforward as simply filling any '0' within the object's boundaries. Here's a breakdown:

**General Logic:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The code first identifies all distinct objects within the grid. An object is defined as a connected group of cells with the same color, excluding the background color (usually '0').
2. **Target Color:**  The transformation specifically targets objects with the color '2'. 
3. **Interior Filling:** The interior spaces of the targeted objects are filled with the color '1'. An "interior" space is a '0' cell that's connected to a '2' cell on its left and is not on the outer boundary of the object.

**Example Breakdown:**

Let's analyze how the transformation works on Input_1:

```
Input_1:
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0
0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0
0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0
0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0
0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 
```

```
Output_1:
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0
0 0 2 1 1 1 2 0
0 0 2 1 2 1 2 0
0 0 2 1 1 1 2 0
0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 
```

* The large '2' object is the target. 
* The '0's completely enclosed within the object are filled with '1'.
* The '0's that are connected to the outer boundary of the object remain unchanged.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  filled = I
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      for i, j in toindices(obj):
        if index(filled, (i, j)) == 0 and any(index(filled, (i, k)) == 2 for k in range(j)):
          filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j)})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**
* Iterates through each cell within a '2' colored object.
* Checks if the cell is '0' and if there's a '2' to its left in the same row.
* If both conditions are met, it fills the cell with '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  filled = I
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      for i in range(uppermost(obj) + 1, lowermost(obj)):
        for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj)):
          if index(filled, (i, j)) == 0 and (i, j - 1) in toindices(obj):
            filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j)})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**
* Similar to Version 1, but checks if the left neighbor is part of the same object using `toindices`. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  filled = I
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      box_indices = inbox(obj)
      for i, j in box_indices:
        if index(filled, (i, j)) == 0:
          filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j)})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**
* Calculates the 'inbox' of each '2' colored object, which excludes the outer boundary.
* Fills all '0' cells within the 'inbox' with '1'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  filled = canvas(0, shape(I)) 
  for obj in objs:
    filled = paint(filled, obj)
    if color(obj) == 2:
      filled = underfill(filled, 1, inbox(obj))
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**
* Creates a blank canvas and paints all objects onto it.
* For '2' colored objects, it uses `underfill` to fill their 'inbox' with '1', ensuring only background cells are changed.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)
  filled = I
  for obj in twos:
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
    for i in range(uppermost(obj) + 1, lowermost(obj)):
      for j in range(leftmost_j + 1, rightmost(obj)):
        if index(filled, (i, j)) == 0 and index(filled, (i, leftmost_j)) == 2:
          filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j)})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**
* Directly filters for '2' colored objects.
* Optimizes by remembering the leftmost column of the object and checking if it's '2' before filling.
