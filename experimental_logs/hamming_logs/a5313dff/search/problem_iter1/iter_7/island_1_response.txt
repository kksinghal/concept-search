## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects with the value '2' and filling the empty space within these objects horizontally, but only if the cell to the left also contains the value '2'.

**Input_0:**

* The '2' object is detected.
* Empty cells within the object, having '2' to their left, are filled with '1'. 

**Input_1:**

* Two '2' objects are detected.
* The transformation is applied to both objects independently.

**Input_2:**

* The transformation is applied consistently to all '2' objects, preserving the overall structure. 


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: {(1, (i, j)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj)) if index(I, (i, j)) == 0 and index(I, (i, j - 1)) == 2}, colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 2))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, False)` identifies all connected objects in the grid.
2. **Filter by Color:** `colorfilter(objs, 2)` selects objects with color value '2'.
3. **Iterate and Fill:** `apply` iterates over each '2' object, applying a lambda function:
    * The lambda function iterates over the object's bounding box.
    * `index(I, (i, j)) == 0` checks for an empty cell.
    * `index(I, (i, j - 1)) == 2` checks if the cell to the left is part of the object.
    * If both conditions are true, the cell is filled with '1' using `{(1, (i, j))}`.
4. **Merge and Paint:** `merge` combines the filled cells from all objects. `paint(I, ...)` applies these filled cells onto the original grid.


**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def fill_object(obj):
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj)):
        if index(I, (i, j)) == 0 and index(I, (i, j - 1)) == 2:
          I = fill(I, 1, {(i, j)})
    return I
    
  return merge(apply(fill_object, colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 2)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Filter Objects:**  Same as Version 1.
2. **`fill_object` Function:**  This function iterates over the bounding box of an object and fills empty cells (value 0) having a '2' to their left with the value '1'.
3. **Apply and Merge:**  Applies the `fill_object` function to each object and then merges the results.


**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  new_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in colorfilter(objs, 2):
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      start_j = leftmost(obj)
      for j in range(start_j, rightmost(obj)):
        if index(I, (i, j)) == 2:
          new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(2, (i, j))})
          start_j = j
        elif start_j != leftmost(obj):
          new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(1, (i, j))})
  return paint(I, new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Create Canvas:** Similar to previous versions, but creates an empty canvas.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** Iterates over '2' objects and their bounding boxes. 
    * Paints '2's directly onto the new canvas.
    * For empty cells, checks if a '2' was encountered on the same row within the object. If so, fills it with '1', effectively filling the space between '2's. 
3. **Combine Grids:** Finally, paints the transformed objects onto the original input grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: {(1, (i, j)) for i, j in product(interval(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1, 1), interval(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj), 1)) if index(I, (i, j)) == 0 and index(I, (i, j - 1)) == 2}, colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 2)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version is very similar to Version 1, but it utilizes the `product` function to generate indices for the bounding box iteration, making it slightly more concise.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def fill_condition(obj, i, j):
    return index(I, (i, j)) == 0 and index(I, (i, j - 1)) == 2
  
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: {(1, (i, j)) for i, j in prapply(astuple, interval(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1, 1), interval(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj), 1)) if fill_condition(obj, i, j)}, colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 2))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_condition` Function:** This function encapsulates the logic for determining whether a cell should be filled.
2. **Cartesian Product and Filtering:** Utilizes `prapply` and `astuple` to achieve a similar iteration over the bounding box as in Version 4.
3. **Apply, Merge, and Paint:** The rest of the logic remains consistent with previous versionsâ€”apply the filling logic, merge the results, and paint onto the original grid.
