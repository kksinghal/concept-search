## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by connected '2's in the input grid and filling the inner area of these objects with '1's in the output grid. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

- A single rectangular object of '2's is present.
- The output fills the inside of this rectangle with '1's.

**Input_1:**

- Two objects of '2's are present: a horizontal line and a 'C' shaped object.
- The output fills the space enclosed by the 'C' with '1's, leaving the horizontal line unchanged.

**Input_2:**

- Multiple objects of '2's are present with various shapes and sizes.
- The output fills the internal spaces within each object with '1's, while the outline of the objects remains formed by '2's.

## Program Versions & Explanations:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False) # Get connected objects of same color
  filled = I 
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2: # Consider only objects made of '2'
      for i in range(uppermost(obj) + 1, lowermost(obj)):
        for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj)):
          if index(filled, (i, j)) == 0: # Fill empty cells within object boundary
            filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j)})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** It identifies connected objects of the same color using `objects(I, True, False, False)`.
2. **Filter by Color:** It focuses only on objects formed by the digit '2' using `color(obj) == 2`.
3. **Iterate within Boundaries:**  It iterates through the rows and columns within the boundaries of each identified object.
4. **Fill Empty Cells:** It fills empty cells (`index(filled, (i, j)) == 0`) within the object's boundaries with the digit '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  filled = I
  for i in range(1, height(I) - 1):
    for j in range(1, width(I) - 1):
      if index(I, (i, j)) == 0 and any(index(I, (i + di, j + dj)) == 2 for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]):
        filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j)})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** Iterates through each cell of the grid, excluding the borders.
2. **Check for Empty Cell:** Checks if the current cell is empty (`index(I, (i, j)) == 0`).
3. **Check for Adjacent '2':** Checks if any directly adjacent cell (up, down, left, right) contains the digit '2'.
4. **Fill if Condition Met:**  If both conditions are met, it fills the current cell with the digit '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  filled = I
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      box_indices = inbox(obj) # Get indices inside the object boundary
      for i, j in box_indices:
        if index(filled, (i, j)) == 0: # Fill if the cell is empty
          filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j)})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Identifies connected objects formed by the digit '2'.
2. **Get Inbox Indices:** Calculates the indices inside the object's bounding box using the `inbox(obj)` function.
3. **Fill Empty Cells:** Iterates through the inbox indices and fills empty cells with '1'. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  filled = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Create an empty canvas
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      filled = paint(filled, recolor(1, inbox(obj))) # Paint the inbox of '2' objects with '1'
    else:
      filled = paint(filled, obj) # Paint other objects as they are
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:**  Creates an empty canvas of the same size as the input grid.
2. **Iterate through Objects:**  Iterates through all connected objects in the input.
3. **Paint Based on Color:** If the object is formed by '2', it paints the inbox of the object with '1' on the canvas. Otherwise, it paints the object directly onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  filled = I
  twos = ofcolor(I, 2)  # Get indices of all '2's
  for i in range(1, height(I) - 1):
    for j in range(1, width(I) - 1):
      if index(I, (i, j)) == 0 and any((i + di, j + dj) in twos for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]):
        filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j)})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get '2' Indices:**  Gets the indices of all cells containing '2' using `ofcolor(I, 2)`.
2. **Iterate and Check:** Iterates through the grid (excluding borders). For each empty cell, it checks if any adjacent cell's index is present in the 'twos' set.
3. **Fill if Condition Met:**  If an adjacent cell contains '2', it fills the current empty cell with '1'.
