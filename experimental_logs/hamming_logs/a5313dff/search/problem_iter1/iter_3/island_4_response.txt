## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the interior regions of objects (excluding the background) and filling them with the value '1'. The original object boundaries are preserved. 

* **Input_0:** The single object's interior is filled with '1'.
* **Input_1:** The interior of the '2' shaped object is filled, leaving the connecting line unaffected.
* **Input_2:**  Interiors of all objects are filled, showcasing the transformation's consistency across multiple objects.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)  # Extract objects excluding background
  interiors = mapply(inbox, objs)  # Find all object inboxes (interiors)
  return paint(fill(I, 1, interiors), mfilter(objs, identity))  # Fill interiors, repaint objects
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Extracts objects from the input grid `I` excluding the background color.
2. **`mapply(inbox, objs)`:** Applies the `inbox` function to each object, which returns the indices of the object's interior. These interior indices are then merged into a single set.
3. **`fill(I, 1, interiors)`:** Fills the `interiors` indices with the value '1' in the input grid `I`.
4. **`mfilter(objs, identity)`:** Merges all the objects back together without modification.
5. **`paint(..., ...)`:**  Overlays the merged objects onto the grid with filled interiors.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True) # Get objects without background
  interiors = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: sfilter(dneighbors(centerofmass(obj)), lambda loc: index(I, loc) != mostcommon(I)))
  return paint(fill(I, 1, interiors), mfilter(objs, identity)) # Fill interiors, repaint objects 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid `I` excluding the background, allowing for multi-valued objects and diagonal connections.
2. **`mfilter(...)`:** This part identifies the interior indices of each object. It checks if any directly adjacent neighbor of the object's center of mass has a different color than the background. If so, the object's interior indices are included.
3. **`paint(fill(I, 1, interiors), ...)`:**  Fills the identified interior indices with '1' and paints the original objects back onto the grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)  # Extract objects excluding background
  interiors = frozenset({loc for obj in objs for loc in toindices(obj) if len(intersection(dneighbors(loc), toindices(obj))) < 4})
  return paint(fill(I, 1, interiors), mfilter(objs, identity)) # Fill interiors, repaint objects
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Extracts objects from the input grid `I`, excluding the background color.
2. **`interiors = ...`:** Identifies interior cells by checking if each cell within an object has less than four directly adjacent neighbors belonging to the same object. If so, it's considered an interior cell.
3. **`paint(...)`:** Fills the identified interior cells with '1' and overlays the original objects back onto the grid.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  changed = True
  while changed:
    changed = False
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    for obj in objs:
      for loc in toindices(obj):
        if len(intersection(dneighbors(loc), toindices(obj))) == 4:
          I = fill(I, 1, {loc})
          changed = True
  return paint(I, mfilter(objs, identity))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterative Filling:** The program iteratively identifies and fills interior cells.
2. **`fgpartition(I)`:** In each iteration, it extracts objects excluding the background.
3. **Interior Cell Check:** For every cell in each object, it checks if all four directly adjacent neighbors belong to the same object. If yes, it's filled with '1'.
4. **`changed` Flag:** The `changed` flag tracks if any filling occurred in an iteration. If no filling happens, the loop terminates.
5. **`paint(...)`:** Finally, the original objects are painted back onto the modified grid.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)  # Extract objects
  filled_grid = I 
  for obj in objs:
      for loc in toindices(obj):
          if len(intersection(neighbors(loc), delta(obj))) == 0:
              filled_grid = fill(filled_grid, 1, {loc})
  return paint(filled_grid, mfilter(objs, identity))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** It first identifies objects in the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Iterative Filling:**  The program iterates through each object and its constituent cells.
3. **Interior Cell Check:** For every cell, it verifies if none of its neighboring cells (including diagonals) belong to the 'delta' of the object. The 'delta' refers to cells directly surrounding the object but not part of it.
4. **`fill(...)`:** If a cell's neighbors are all part of the object or the background, it's considered an interior cell and filled with '1'.
5. **`paint(...)`:** Finally, the original objects are painted back onto the filled grid.
