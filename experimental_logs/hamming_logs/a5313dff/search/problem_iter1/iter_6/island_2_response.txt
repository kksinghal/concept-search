## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of a specific color (in this case, 2) and filling the inner pixels of these objects with a different color (in this case, 1). Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The single object formed by the digit '2' has its inner pixels replaced with '1'. Pixels on the boundary of the object remain unchanged.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  Similar to Input_0, the inner pixels of each object formed by the digit '2' are replaced with '1', while the boundary pixels are preserved. 

**Input_2 to Output_2:**  The pattern continues - inner pixels of '2' objects become '1', and boundary pixels remain as '2'.

## Program to be generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Extract objects excluding background
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, 2) # Filter objects with color 2
  inner_indices = mfilter(target_objs, inbox) # Find inner indices of each object
  return paint(I, recolor(1, inner_indices)) # Fill inner indices with color 1
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:**  We first extract all objects from the input grid (`I`) excluding the background, considering only directly adjacent pixels (not diagonal) for object formation.
2. **Filter target objects:** We then filter out the objects that have the color '2'.
3. **Find inner indices:** For each target object, we find the indices of its inner pixels using the `inbox` function. 
4. **Paint inner indices:** Finally, we paint the identified inner indices with color '1' on the original grid to produce the output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_inner_pixel(i, j):
    return index(I, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I) and any(index(I, n) != mostcolor(I) for n in neighbors((i, j)))

  inner_indices = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(1, height(I)-1) for j in range(1, width(I)-1) if is_inner_pixel(i, j))
  return fill(I, 1, inner_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define inner pixel check:** This version defines a helper function `is_inner_pixel` that checks if a given pixel is an inner pixel of an object. An inner pixel is defined as a pixel with the background color and having at least one non-background neighbor.
2. **Iterate and fill:** The program iterates over all pixels (excluding the border) and fills those identified as inner pixels by `is_inner_pixel` with the color '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def fill_object_inbox(obj):
    return recolor(1, inbox(obj)) if color(obj) == 2 else obj

  filled_objs = apply(fill_object_inbox, objects(I, True, False, True))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(filled_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define object filling:**  A helper function `fill_object_inbox` is defined to fill the inbox of an object with color '1' if the object's color is '2'. Otherwise, the object is returned unchanged.
2. **Apply filling to objects:** This function is applied to all objects in the input grid.
3. **Paint filled objects:** Finally, all filled objects are painted onto a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input grid to generate the output.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_cell(v, loc):
    return (1, loc) if v == mostcolor(I) and any(index(I, n) != mostcolor(I) for n in neighbors(loc)) else (v, loc)

  return tuple(tuple(v for v, _ in row) for row in apply(lambda row: papply(process_cell, row, repeat(toivec(row[0][1]), width(I))), enumerate(asobject(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define cell processing:** This version defines a function `process_cell` to process each cell. If a cell has the background color and at least one non-background neighbor, its value is changed to '1'. 
2. **Apply to each cell:** The `process_cell` function is applied to every cell in the input grid by first converting the grid to an object and then back to a grid after processing.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def fill_if_inner(i, j):
    return 1 if index(I, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I) and any(index(I, (ni, nj)) != mostcolor(I) for ni, nj in neighbors((i, j))) else index(I, (i, j))

  new_grid = tuple(tuple(fill_if_inner(i, j) for j in range(width(I))) for i in range(height(I)))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define inner pixel filling:** A function `fill_if_inner` is defined to check if a pixel is an inner pixel (background color with at least one non-background neighbor). If it is, it returns '1'; otherwise, it returns the original pixel value.
2. **Apply and create new grid:** This function is applied to all pixel locations, and a new grid is constructed with the processed values.
