## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation can be described as follows:

**For each object composed of the digit '2':**

1. **Identify empty cells (containing '0') within the object's bounding box.** This bounding box includes all cells from the object's top-leftmost '2' to its bottom-rightmost '2'. 
2. **Change the value of these empty cells to '1' if the cell to their immediate left is a '2'.**

Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:

* **Input_0 to Output_0:** The single '2' object has internal empty cells. The transformation fills these cells with '1' except for the leftmost column of the object.
* **Input_1 to Output_1:**  Similarly, internal empty cells of '2' objects are filled with '1', again avoiding the leftmost column.
* **Input_2 to Output_2:** The same logic applies here, demonstrating the rule's consistency across different input configurations.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False) # Identify all objects in the grid
  twos = colorfilter(objs, 2) # Filter for objects consisting only of '2'
  filled = I # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input
  for obj in twos:
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1): # Iterate over rows of each '2' object
      for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + 1): # Iterate over columns, excluding the leftmost one
        if index(filled, (i, j)) == 0 and index(filled, (i, j - 1)) == 2: # Check for empty cell with '2' to its left
          filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j)}) # Fill the cell with '1'
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:**  We identify all '2' objects in the grid.
2. **Iterative Filling:** For each object, we iterate over its cells (excluding the leftmost column) and check if a cell is empty ('0') and has a '2' to its left. If so, we fill it with '1'.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: {(1, (i, j)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj)) if index(I, (i, j)) == 0 and index(I, (i, j - 1)) == 2}, colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 2))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Filtering:** Identify '2' objects using `colorfilter` and `objects`.
2. **Cell Selection:** For each object, generate a set of indices representing empty cells with a '2' to their left. 
3. **Painting:** Use `paint` to directly modify the input grid by merging the generated indices and coloring them with '1'.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda obj: {(1, (i, j)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj)) if index(I, (i, j)) == 0 and index(I, (i, j - 1)) == 2}, colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 2)))), I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Target Grid:** Create a blank canvas of the same size as the input, representing the desired output.
2. **Selective Painting:**  Paint the '1's onto the blank canvas based on the transformation logic.
3. **Cellwise Merging:** Utilize `cellwise` to combine the input grid and the modified canvas, preserving the original values except where '1's were painted.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for x in colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 2):
    for i in range(uppermost(x), lowermost(x) + 1):
      for j in range(leftmost(x) + 1, rightmost(x)):
        if index(O, (i, j)) == 0 and index(O, (i, j - 1)) == 2:
          O = paint(O, {(1, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly modifies the input grid (`O`) using `paint` within nested loops iterating through each cell of the '2' objects. The conditional checks for an empty cell ('0') with a '2' to its left and paints a '1' at that location.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def transform_object(obj):
    return {(1, (i, j)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj)) if index(I, (i, j)) == 0 and index(I, (i, j - 1)) == 2}

  return paint(I, merge(apply(transform_object, colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 2))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Abstraction:** Defines a helper function `transform_object` to encapsulate the logic of identifying and generating indices for cells to be filled with '1' within a single object.
2. **Application and Merging:** Applies this function to each '2' object using `apply`, merges the results, and then paints the final output onto the input grid.


These five versions offer distinct approaches using various combinations of DSL functions, demonstrating the flexibility and power of this approach. Each version accomplishes the desired transformation while adhering to the constraints of the provided DSL.
