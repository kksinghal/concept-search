## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying objects of a specific color (likely '2') and then filling the interior space of those objects with a different color (likely '1').  Let's break down each input-output pair to be more precise:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- Identify the object formed by the digit '2'.
- Fill the interior space of this object with the digit '1'. The perimeter of the object remains '2'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- Similar to the previous transformation, identify the object formed by the digit '2'.
-  Fill the interior space of this object with the digit '1', but only the portions directly connected horizontally. This creates a "filled rectangle" effect within the object's boundaries.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

- Again, identify the object formed by the digit '2'.
-  The fill logic is similar to Input_1, filling the interior with '1' but only the directly horizontally connected areas. The distinction here is the more complex shape of the object, highlighting that the fill likely operates on a row-by-row basis within the object.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False) # Get all objects in the grid
  filled = I
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:  # Only process objects with color '2'
      for i in range(uppermost(obj) + 1, lowermost(obj)): # Iterate rows within object
        for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj)): # Iterate columns within object
          if index(filled, (i, j)) == 0 and index(filled, (i, j-1)) == 2: # Check if cell is empty and connected to 2 on left
            filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j)}) # Fill with '1' if conditions met
  return filled
```

**Explanation:** 

This version utilizes object detection to isolate objects of color '2'. It iterates through each object's interior, filling empty cells with '1' only if the cell is connected to a '2' on its left. This creates the horizontal fill pattern observed in the outputs.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I 
  for i in range(1, len(I) - 1):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == 0 and I[i][j - 1] == 2 and I[i][j + 1] == 2:
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly iterates through the grid, looking for empty cells (value '0') flanked by the target color ('2') on both sides horizontally. This identifies potential fill locations within the objects and fills them with '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  filled = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
      rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
      for i in range(uppermost(obj) + 1, lowermost(obj)):
        for j in range(leftmost_j + 1, rightmost_j):
          if index(filled, (i, j)) == 0:
            filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j)})
          else:
            break  # Stop filling horizontally once a non-zero cell is encountered
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

This version finds objects of color '2' and iterates through their rows. It fills empty cells from the leftmost edge towards the right. It stops filling for a row upon encountering a non-zero value, ensuring only contiguous horizontal spaces within the object are filled.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create a canvas filled with the background color
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
        start_j = None
        for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1):
          if index(I, (i, j)) == 2 and start_j is None:
            start_j = j # Mark the start of a horizontal '2' segment
          elif index(I, (i, j)) != 2 and start_j is not None:
            O = fill(O, 1, connect((i, start_j + 1), (i, j - 1))) # Fill between consecutive '2's on the same row
            start_j = None
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a separate canvas initially filled with the background color. It identifies horizontal segments of '2's in each row of the object and fills the space between them on the canvas with '1's. This indirectly fills the object's interior while preserving the original grid. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      for i in range(uppermost(obj) + 1, lowermost(obj)):
        j = leftmost(obj) + 1
        while j < rightmost(obj) and index(I, (i, j)) == 0:
          O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
          j += 1 # Move to the next column within the row
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version identifies the '2'-colored objects and iterates through their rows. Within each row, it starts from the leftmost interior cell and keeps filling with '1' as long as it encounters empty cells, effectively filling horizontal segments within the object.
