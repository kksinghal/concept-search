## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to fill the empty spaces (represented by '0') within and to the right of '2' objects with the digit '1'.  Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** 
- The single '2' object gets its interior and the spaces to its right filled with '1's until the boundary of the grid or another object is reached.

**Input_1:**
- Similar to Input_0, both '2' objects are independently filled with '1's in their interior and to their right.

**Input_2:**
- The pattern continues. Each '2' object, regardless of its shape or position, gets filled with '1's in its interior and to its right until a boundary is encountered.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" in the provided DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 2:
        for k in range(j + 1, len(row)):
          if O[i][k] == 0:
            O = fill(O, 1, {(i, k)})
          else:
            break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates through each cell in the grid.
- If a cell contains '2', it iterates through the cells to its right.
- It fills empty cells ('0') with '1' until it encounters a non-empty cell, ensuring it doesn't overwrite existing objects.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)
  filled = I
  for obj in twos:
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      j = leftmost(obj)
      while j < len(filled[0]) and (index(filled, (i, j)) == 2 or index(filled, (i, j)) == 1):
        filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j)})
        j += 1
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

- Identifies '2' objects in the grid.
- For each object, it iterates through its rows.
- Starting from the leftmost point of each row, it fills cells with '1' as long as it encounters '2' or '1'.
- This ensures both the interior and rightward spaces within the object are filled.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if O[i][j] == 2:
        O = fill(O, 1, hfrontier((i, j + 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Identifies cells containing '2'.
- For each such cell, it uses `hfrontier` to get the indices of a horizontal line extending to the right from the next column.
- It fills these indices with '1', effectively filling the space to the right of the '2' object.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      start = (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj) + 1)
      end = (lowermost(obj), len(I[0]) - 1)
      O = fill(O, 1, backdrop(frozenset({start, end})))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version identifies '2' objects.
- It defines a rectangular area from the column to the right of the object's leftmost point to the grid's right edge.
- It fills this entire area with '1', effectively handling both interior and rightward spaces.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  filled = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    started = False
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 2:
        started = True
      if started and I[i][j] == 0:
        filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j)})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

- Iterates through each row, using a flag (`started`) to indicate when a '2' is encountered.
- Once a '2' is found, it starts filling subsequent '0's with '1'.
- The flag ensures that filling occurs only within and to the right of a '2' object.

These five program versions demonstrate various approaches to achieve the same transformation using the DSL functions. Each version employs distinct logic and function combinations, showcasing the flexibility and diversity possible within the DSL.
