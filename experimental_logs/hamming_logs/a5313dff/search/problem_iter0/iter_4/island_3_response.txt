## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same color, excluding the background color) and drawing a border within each object using the color "1". 

**Input 0:**

* The input has a single object formed by the digit "2". 
* The output draws a "1" border inside the object, leaving the outermost layer of "2"s intact.

**Input 1:**

* This input features multiple disconnected objects formed by the digit "2".
* The output similarly draws inner borders within each object.

**Input 2:**

* This input presents a more complex arrangement of objects with varying sizes and shapes.
* The output consistently maintains the inner border pattern for each object.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct programs to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Extract objects
  inboxes = mapply(lambda obj: inbox(toindices(obj)), objs) # Generate inboxes for each object
  O = underpaint(I, recolor(ONE, merge(inboxes))) # Paint inboxes with "1"
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies and separates all objects (connected components of non-background color) in the input grid `I`.
2.  **Generate Inboxes:** For each object, `inbox(toindices(obj))` determines the indices that form the inner border of that object. `mapply` applies this operation to all objects.
3.  **Paint Inboxes:** `merge(inboxes)` combines all inner border indices. `recolor(ONE, ...)` assigns the color "1" to these indices. Finally, `underpaint(I, ...)` paints these "1"s onto the input grid `I` only where the background color exists.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Extract objects
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = underfill(O, ONE, inbox(toindices(obj))) # Directly fill inboxes within the loop
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Extract Objects:** Similar to version 1, this identifies all objects in the grid.
2.  **Iterative Filling:**  Instead of merging inboxes, this version iterates through each object. `underfill(O, ONE, inbox(toindices(obj)))` directly fills the inbox of each object with the color "1" on the grid `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(1, len(I)-1):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0])-1):
        if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and any(I[i+di][j+dj] == mostcolor(I) for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]):
          O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)}) # Check for background neighbors and fill
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Iterate and Check:** This version iterates through each cell of the grid (excluding the border).
2.  **Neighbor Check:** For each non-background cell, it checks if any of its direct neighbors (up, down, left, right) are background color.
3.  **Fill Border:** If a non-background cell has a background neighbor, it's considered part of the inner border and is filled with the color "1" using `fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Extract objects
  border_cells = mfilter(lambda obj: adjacent(toindices(obj), delta(toindices(obj))), objs) # Identify border cells
  O = underpaint(I, recolor(ONE, merge(border_cells))) # Paint border cells with "1"
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Extract Objects:** Similar to previous versions, this extracts all objects from the grid.
2.  **Identify Border Cells:** This version identifies border cells by checking adjacency between an object's indices (`toindices(obj)`) and the indices surrounding the object (`delta(toindices(obj))`). `mfilter` applies this condition to all objects and merges the results.
3.  **Paint Border Cells:** Similar to version 1, this paints the identified border cells with the color "1".

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        for cell in toindices(obj):
            if any((i,j) not in toindices(obj) for (i,j) in dneighbors(cell)):
                O = fill(O, ONE, {cell}) # Check for each cell if it has a neighbor outside the object
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Extract Objects:** Like previous versions, it identifies all objects in the grid.
2.  **Iterate and Check Neighbors:** For each cell within each object, this version iterates through its direct neighbors.
3.  **Fill Border:** If any direct neighbor of a cell is not part of the same object (meaning it's outside the object or background), the cell is considered a border cell and is filled with "1".
