## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the "interior" of each object (excluding the background) in the grid and filling it with the value '1'. The exterior of the objects retains its original color.

**Here's how the transformation works for each example:**

* **Input_0:** The large '2' object has its inner '0's replaced with '1's, while the outer '2's remain unchanged.
* **Input_1:**  The '2' shaped object has its inner space filled with '1's. The isolated '2's remain unchanged as they have no defined interior.
* **Input_2:**  Similar to the previous examples, the interior spaces of both '2' shaped objects are filled with '1's. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct programs using the provided DSL that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I) # Partition the grid into objects, excluding background
  interiors = mfilter(objs, lambda o: sfilter(inbox(o), lambda i: index(I, i) == mostcommon(I))) # Find interiors of objects
  return paint(fill(I, 1, interiors), objs) # Fill interiors with 1 and repaint objects
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Partitions the input grid `I` into separate objects, excluding the background color.
2. **`mfilter(objs, lambda o: sfilter(inbox(o), lambda i: index(I, i) == mostcommon(I)))`:** Identifies the interior indices of each object. This is done by checking if all indices within the object's `inbox` have the background color (most common color).
3. **`fill(I, 1, interiors)`:** Creates a new grid where all interior indices from `interiors` are filled with the value '1'.
4. **`paint(filled_grid, objs)`:**  Paints the original objects back onto the `filled_grid`, effectively replacing the '1's in the background and keeping the object colors intact. 


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I) # Partition the grid into objects, excluding background
  filled = I 
  for obj in objs:
    filled = underfill(filled, 1, inbox(obj)) # Fill the inbox of each object with 1, only if it was originally background
  return paint(filled, objs) # Repaint the original objects onto the filled grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Same as in Version 1.
2. **Iterate through objects:** Iterates through each object `obj` in `objs`.
3. **`underfill(filled, 1, inbox(obj))`:** Fills the `inbox` area of the current object `obj` with '1's, but only if the original cell color in `filled` is the background color. This avoids overwriting object pixels.
4. **`paint(filled, objs)`:** Same as in Version 1.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcommon(I)  # Identify the background color
  filled = tuple(tuple(1 if v == bg else v for v in row) for row in I) # Create a new grid with all background cells replaced by '1's
  return paint(filled, fgpartition(I)) # Repaint the original objects onto the filled grid 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mostcommon(I)`:** Identifies the background color in the input grid `I`.
2. **List comprehension:** Creates a new grid `filled` where each cell is checked: If the cell is the background color, it's replaced with '1'; otherwise, the original value is kept.
3. **`paint(filled, fgpartition(I))`:** Same as in Version 1.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I) # Partition the grid into objects, excluding background
  not_interiors = mfilter(objs, lambda o: box(o)) # Find the outlines of all objects
  return paint(fill(I, 1, difference(asindices(I), not_interiors)), objs)  # Fill everything except the outlines with '1' and then repaint the objects
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Same as in Version 1.
2. **`mfilter(objs, lambda o: box(o))`:**  Calculates the outline (`box`) of every object and stores them in `not_interiors`.
3. **`difference(asindices(I), not_interiors)`:**  Calculates the difference between all indices of the grid and the outline indices, effectively giving us all the interior indices. 
4. **`fill(I, 1, difference_indices)`:** Fills the identified interior indices with '1's.
5. **`paint(filled_grid, objs)`:**  Same as in Version 1.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I) # Partition the grid into objects, excluding background
  interior_cells = set()
  for obj in objs:
      for i, j in inbox(obj): # Iterate through indices within the object's inbox
          if index(I, (i, j)) == mostcommon(I): # Check if the cell at the current index has the background color
              interior_cells.add((i, j)) # If yes, add the index to the set of interior cells
  return paint(fill(I, 1, frozenset(interior_cells)), objs) # Fill the interior cells with 1 and repaint the original objects
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Same as in Version 1.
2. **Nested loops:** Iterates through each object `obj` and then through each index `(i, j)` within the object's `inbox`.
3. **`index(I, (i, j)) == mostcommon(I)`:** Checks if the cell at the current index in the input grid `I` has the background color.
4.  **`interior_cells.add((i, j))`:**  If the condition is true, the current index is added to the `interior_cells` set.
5. **`paint(fill(I, 1, frozenset(interior_cells)), objs)`:** Same as in Version 1.

These are five distinct code versions that achieve the desired transformation using different logic and function combinations.
