## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the background cells surrounding non-background objects and changing their value to 1.

**Input_0:**

- **Input:** A single 2x6 object (value 2) on a 0 background.
- **Output:** The background cells directly surrounding the object are changed to 1.

**Input_1:**

- **Input:** Two objects (value 2), one 2x4, one 1x7, on a 0 background.
- **Output:** The background cells directly surrounding both objects are changed to 1.

**Input_2:**

- **Input:**  A more complex arrangement of objects (value 2) of varying sizes on a 0 background.
- **Output:**  The background cells directly surrounding all objects are changed to 1.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract non-background objects
    surrounding_cells = mfilter(apply(delta, objs), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == mostcolor(I))  # Get surrounding cells that are background
    O = fill(I, 1, surrounding_cells)  # Fill those cells with 1
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all non-background objects in the grid.
2. **Find Surrounding Cells:** `apply(delta, objs)` finds the cells surrounding each object. `mfilter` with `lambda loc: index(I, loc) == mostcolor(I)` filters these cells, keeping only those with the background color.
3. **Fill with 1:** `fill(I, 1, surrounding_cells)` fills the selected surrounding cells with the value 1.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)  # Get background color
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects
    modified_grid = I
    for obj in objs:
        modified_grid = fill(modified_grid, 1, delta(toindices(obj)))  # Fill surrounding cells for each object
    O = cellwise(I, modified_grid, bg)  # Combine changes, keeping original values for non-surrounding cells
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Background Color:**  `mostcolor(I)` finds the background color.
2. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts the objects.
3. **Iterate and Fill:** The code iterates through each object and uses `fill` to change the surrounding cells of each object to 1 in a temporary grid `modified_grid`.
4. **Combine Changes:** `cellwise` merges the changes from `modified_grid` onto the original grid `I`, using the background color `bg` as a fallback for unchanged cells.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)  # Get background color
    O = I
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] != bg and any((abs(i-ni) <= 1 and abs(j-nj) <= 1) for ni, nj in toindices(objects(I, T, F, T)) if I[ni][nj] != bg):
                O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Background Color:** `mostcolor(I)` determines the background color.
2. **Iterate through Cells:** The program iterates through each cell of the grid.
3. **Check for Proximity to Non-Background:** For each cell, it checks if it's background and adjacent to a non-background cell that is part of an object.
4. **Fill Surrounding Cells:** If the conditions are met, the cell is filled with 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    surrounding_indices = set()
    for obj in objs:
        for i, j in toindices(obj):
            surrounding_indices.update((i + di, j + dj) for di in range(-1, 2) for dj in range(-1, 2))
    surrounding_indices = frozenset(loc for loc in surrounding_indices if 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, loc) == mostcolor(I))
    O = fill(I, 1, surrounding_indices)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  It first identifies all objects in the input grid.
2. **Collect Surrounding Indices:** It iterates over each cell of each object and adds the indices of its neighboring cells (including itself) to a set.
3. **Filter for Background Cells:**  The collected indices are filtered to retain only those that are within the grid boundaries and have the background color.
4. **Fill with Target Value:** Finally, it fills all the filtered indices with the desired value (1 in this case) to generate the output grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(1, shape(I))  # Create a canvas filled with 1s
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    for obj in objs:
        O = underpaint(O, toobject(toindices(obj), I))  # Paint the original object on top of the 1s canvas
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** `canvas(1, shape(I))` generates a grid of the same size as the input, filled entirely with 1s.
2. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts all non-background objects.
3. **Overlay Objects:** For each object, `toobject` reconstructs the object from its indices and the original grid, and then `underpaint` paints this object onto the 1s canvas. This effectively overwrites the 1s with the original object, leaving the surrounding 1s intact.
