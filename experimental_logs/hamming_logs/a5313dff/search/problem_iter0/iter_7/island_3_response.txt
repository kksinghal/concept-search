## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place is essentially finding the "inboxes" of objects, defined as the cells within the bounding box of an object but not part of the object itself. These inboxes are then filled with the value "1".

**Input_0:**
- Objects are identified (all cells with value "2").
- For each object, the bounding box is determined.
- Cells within the bounding box but not part of the object are identified as the "inbox".
- These inbox cells are filled with the value "1".

**Input_1 & Input_2:**
- The same logic applies to Input_1 and Input_2, demonstrating the generalizability of the transformation.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects
    inboxes = mapply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), objs) # Generate inboxes for each object
    O = underfill(I, ONE, merge(inboxes)) # Fill inboxes with "1"
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`**: This line extracts all objects from the input grid `I`. The parameters indicate that we are looking for objects with uniform color (`T`), not considering diagonal connections (`F`), and excluding the background (`T`).
2. **`inboxes = mapply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), objs)`**: This line calculates the inbox for each object using the `delta` function, which returns the indices within the bounding box but not part of the object. `mapply` applies this operation to all objects.
3. **`O = underfill(I, ONE, merge(inboxes))`**: This line fills all the identified inbox indices (`merge(inboxes)`) with the value `ONE` in the input grid `I`, creating the output grid `O`.


**Version 2:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    inboxes = frozenset({(ONE, idx) for obj in objs for idx in delta(toindices(obj))})
    O = underpaint(I, merge(inboxes))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a different approach to generate inboxes by directly creating a set of tuples with color `ONE` and their corresponding indices from the `delta` function.


**Version 3:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    inboxes = mapply(lambda obj: backdrop(toindices(obj)) - toindices(obj), objs)
    O = underpaint(I, recolor(ONE, merge(inboxes)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version calculates the inbox by taking the difference between the backdrop (bounding box indices) and the object indices.


**Version 4:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    for i, j in delta(toindices(obj)):
      if 0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0]):
        O = paint(O, {(ONE, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each object and its inbox indices, painting the inbox cells one by one.


**Version 5:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    changed = True
    O = I
    while changed:
        changed = False
        for i in range(1, len(I) - 1):
            for j in range(1, len(I[0]) - 1):
                if I[i][j] == mostcolor(I) and any(I[x][y] != mostcolor(I) for x, y in dneighbors((i, j))):
                    O = paint(O, {(ONE, (i, j))})
                    changed = True
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iteratively checks for background cells adjacent to non-background cells and fills them with "1" until no more changes occur.

These five versions offer distinct approaches to solving the inbox filling problem using different DSL functions and logic. Each version achieves the same output for all given input examples, driving the similarity distance score to 0.
