## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (clusters of connected, non-background pixels) and filling their interiors while preserving a one-pixel border.

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 
The single object formed by the '2's has its interior filled with '1's, leaving a one-pixel border of '2's.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** 
The interior of the larger object (formed by '2's) is filled with '1's, maintaining a one-pixel '2' border. The smaller, single-pixel objects remain unchanged.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
 Similar to the previous examples, the interior of each object formed by '2's is filled with '1's. The one-pixel '2' border and single-pixel objects remain unchanged.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  interiors = mfilter(apply(inbox, objs), lambda x: size(x) > 0)
  return paint(fill(I, 1, interiors), objs) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:**  Identifies objects (excluding background) in the input grid.
2. **`interiors = mfilter(apply(inbox, objs), lambda x: size(x) > 0)`:** Calculates the "inbox" (interior area) for each object and filters out empty inboxes.
3. **`return paint(fill(I, 1, interiors), objs)`:** Fills the identified interiors with '1's and then paints the original objects back onto the grid, preserving the one-pixel border.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  filled_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(1, inbox(obj)), objs)
  return paint(I, merge(filled_objs)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`:** Extracts objects from the input grid, considering only directly adjacent pixels and excluding background.
2. **`filled_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(1, inbox(obj)), objs)`:**  Fills the inbox of each object with the value '1'.
3. **`return paint(I, merge(filled_objs))`:** Paints the filled objects back onto the original input grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  filled = mfilter(apply(lambda obj: recolor(1, delta(obj)), fgpartition(I)), identity)
  return paint(I, filled)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`filled = mfilter(apply(lambda obj: recolor(1, delta(obj)), fgpartition(I)), identity)`:** This line first identifies the objects in the input grid using `fgpartition(I)`. Then, for each object, it calculates the `delta`, which represents the indices within the object's bounding box that are not part of the object itself. Finally, it recolors these delta indices to '1' and merges the results.
2. **`return paint(I, filled)`:** This line takes the original input grid (`I`) and paints the filled delta indices onto it, effectively filling the interiors of the objects.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: toobject(inbox(obj), replace(I, color(obj), 1)), objs))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:** Extracts objects from the input grid, excluding background.
2. **`return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: toobject(inbox(obj), replace(I, color(obj), 1)), objs)))`:**  This line does the following for each object: 
    * Calculates its inbox.
    * Replaces all occurrences of the object's color with '1' in the input grid.
    * Uses 'toobject' to create a new object with '1's at the inbox locations. 
    * Finally, it merges these new objects and paints them onto the original input.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  modified_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(1, difference(backdrop(obj), obj)), fgpartition(I))
  return paint(I, merge(modified_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`modified_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(1, difference(backdrop(obj), obj)), fgpartition(I))`:**
   - `fgpartition(I)`: Partitions the input grid into foreground objects.
   - For each `obj`:
     - `backdrop(obj)`: Finds the indices of the bounding box containing the object.
     - `difference(backdrop(obj), obj)`: Calculates the difference between the bounding box and the object itself, effectively getting the interior border indices.
     - `recolor(1, ...)`:  Recolors the obtained interior border indices to 1.
2.  `return paint(I, merge(modified_objs))`: Paints the modified objects (with filled interiors) back onto the original input grid.

These five program versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation within the DSL constraints.
