## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the background color and then filling in the cells immediately surrounding the non-background objects with the value '1'. 

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
- Background color: 0
- The cells directly above, below, left, and right of the '2' object are filled with '1'.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- Background color: 0
- Similar to Input_0, the surrounding cells of both '2' objects are filled with '1'.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
- Background color: 0
- The surrounding cells of all '2' objects are filled with '1', maintaining the same pattern.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct program versions:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract non-background objects
  surrounding_cells = mfilter(apply(delta, objs), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == mostcolor(I))  # Get surrounding cells that are background
  O = fill(I, 1, surrounding_cells)  # Fill those cells with 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies and isolates each non-background object in the input grid `I`.
2. **Find Surrounding Cells:** `apply(delta, objs)` finds the cells directly surrounding each object. `mfilter(..., lambda loc: index(I, loc) == mostcolor(I))` then filters these surrounding cells, keeping only those that are the background color.
3. **Fill Cells:** `fill(I, 1, surrounding_cells)` fills the identified surrounding cells with the value '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I) # Identify the background color
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Extract non-background objects
  dilated_objs = mfilter(apply(lambda obj: apply(dneighbors, toindices(obj)), objs), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == bg) # Dilate objects by one unit with background color
  O = fill(I, 1, dilated_objs) # Fill dilated cells with 1
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background:** `mostcolor(I)` determines the most frequent color, representing the background.
2. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts the non-background objects from the input grid.
3. **Dilate with Background:**  For each object, its cells are expanded using `dneighbors` to include directly adjacent cells. `mfilter` then ensures only background-colored cells are included in this dilation.
4. **Fill Dilated Cells:** `fill(I, 1, dilated_objs)` fills the dilated cells with the value '1'.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Find non-background objects
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = fill(O, 1, delta(toindices(obj))) # Fill the delta of each object with 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts the non-background objects from the input.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** It iterates through each object, and for each object, it fills the cells immediately surrounding it (`delta`) with the value '1'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I)) # Create a canvas of background color
  for i in range(1, len(I)-1):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0])-1):
      if I[i][j] != bg: # For each non-background cell
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i-1, j),(i+1, j),(i, j-1),(i, j+1)})  # Fill its adjacent cells with 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Background Canvas:** Generates a new grid `O` filled with the background color, matching the input's size.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** It iterates through each cell of the input grid (excluding the borders). If a cell isn't the background color, its four adjacent cells on the new grid are filled with '1'.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and any((abs(i-ni) <= 1 and abs(j-nj) <= 1) for ni, nj in toindices(objects(I, T, F, T)) if I[ni][nj] != mostcolor(I)):
                O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:** It iterates over each cell in the input grid.
2. **Check for Non-Background and Adjacent Non-Background:** For each cell, it verifies if it's a non-background color and has at least one directly adjacent non-background cell. 
3. **Fill if Condition Met:** If both conditions are met, the cell is filled with '1'.

These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation using the provided DSL functions. Each leverages different combinations of object identification, cell manipulation, and logical operations.
