## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same color, excluding the background) and filling their "inboxes" with the value "1". The inbox of an object is defined as the area enclosed by the object's outer boundary, excluding the boundary itself. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** 

* The input has a single object formed by the digit "2". 
* The output fills the inner area of this object with "1" while leaving the "2" border intact.

**Input_1:**

* The input has two objects formed by the digit "2", one on top and a larger one at the bottom.
* The output fills the inbox of both objects with "1." Notice how the inbox of the bottom object includes the area surrounded by the top object.

**Input_2:**

* Similar to Input_1, the input has two objects formed by the digit "2."
*  The output again fills the inboxes of both objects with "1," demonstrating the consistency of the transformation.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects
  inboxes = mapply(lambda obj: inbox(toindices(obj)), objs) # Generate inboxes
  O = underfill(I, ONE, merge(inboxes)) # Fill inboxes with "1"
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Generate Inboxes:** For each object, `inbox(toindices(obj))` calculates the indices representing its inbox. `mapply` applies this operation to all objects and combines the results.
3. **Fill Inboxes:** `underfill(I, ONE, merge(inboxes))` fills the combined inboxes with the value `ONE` (which is 1).


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    inboxes = frozenset({idx for obj in objs for idx in inbox(toindices(obj))})
    O = underfill(I, ONE, inboxes)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Generate Inboxes:** Uses a set comprehension to directly collect all indices within the inbox of each object.
3. **Fill Inboxes:**  Similar to Version 1.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  filled_grid = I
  for obj in objs:
    filled_grid = underfill(filled_grid, ONE, inbox(toindices(obj)))
  return filled_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Iterative Filling:** Iterates through each object. For each object, it fills its inbox with `ONE` in the `filled_grid`, updating the grid in each iteration.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    filled_grid = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        for i, j in inbox(toindices(obj)):
            if index(filled_grid, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I):  
                filled_grid = fill(filled_grid, ONE, {(i, j)})
    return filled_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** Iterates through each object and each index within its inbox. 
2. **Conditional Filling:** It checks if the current index in the `filled_grid` contains the background color (`mostcolor(I)`). If so, it fills that specific cell with `ONE`.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  inboxes = mapply(lambda obj:  toobject(inbox(toindices(obj)), I), objs)
  O = paint(I, {(ONE, idx) for obj in inboxes for idx in toindices(obj) if index(I, idx) == mostcolor(I)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Generate Inboxes as Objects:** Instead of indices, this version gets the inbox indices and converts them into objects using `toobject`.
3. **Paint Inboxes:**  It then paints the `ONE` value onto the input grid `I` only at those inbox object indices that initially had the background color.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. Each version utilizes various DSL functions in unique combinations, providing distinct logic flows for solving the problem.
