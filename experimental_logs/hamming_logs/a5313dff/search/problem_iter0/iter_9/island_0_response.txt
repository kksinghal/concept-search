## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the "interior" cells of each object in the grid (excluding the background) and changing their value to 1. An interior cell is defined as a cell surrounded by 4 cells of the same object in its direct north, south, east, and west directions. 

**Example Breakdown (Input_0):**

1. **Input:** The input grid contains a single object formed by the digit '2'.
2. **Identification:** The transformation identifies the interior cells of the '2' object. These are the cells that are not on the edge of the shape.
3. **Modification:** The identified interior cells have their value changed to '1'.
4. **Output:** The resulting output grid retains the original shape of the '2' object, but the interior cells are now filled with '1' instead of '2'.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions for achieving the desired transformation:


### **Program Version 1**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def is_interior(cell, obj):
    return len(dneighbors(cell) & toindices(obj)) == 4
  interior_indices = mfilter(objects(grid, True, False, True), lambda obj: sfilter(toindices(obj), rbind(is_interior, obj)))
  return fill(grid, 1, interior_indices) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_interior(cell, obj)`:** This helper function determines if a given `cell` is an interior cell within an `obj`. It checks if all four direct neighbors of the `cell` are also part of the `obj`.
2. **`objects(grid, True, False, True)`:**  This function extracts all objects from the grid, considering connected cells with the same value (univalued), ignoring diagonal connections, and excluding the background. 
3. **`sfilter(toindices(obj), rbind(is_interior, obj))`:** For each object, it iterates through its cell indices and uses `rbind` to create a partially applied `is_interior` function with the `obj` pre-filled. The `sfilter` keeps only those indices that satisfy the `is_interior` condition.
4. **`mfilter(...)`:** This function applies the lambda function to each object and then merges the resulting sets of interior indices into a single set. 
5. **`fill(grid, 1, interior_indices)`:** Finally, this function fills the `grid` with the value '1' at the indices specified by `interior_indices`.

### **Program Version 2**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def is_interior(obj):
    return frozenset({(1, cell) for cell in toindices(obj) if len(dneighbors(cell) & toindices(obj)) == 4})
  interior_objects = apply(is_interior, objects(grid, True, False, True))
  return paint(grid, merge(interior_objects))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_interior(obj)`:** This function now returns a new object containing only the interior cells of the input `obj`. It iterates through each cell of the object and includes it in the new object only if all its direct neighbors belong to the original object. 
2. **`apply(is_interior, objects(grid, True, False, True))`:** This applies the `is_interior` function to every object extracted from the `grid`.
3. **`merge(interior_objects)`:** This function merges the resulting set of interior objects into a single object containing all interior cells.
4. **`paint(grid, ...)`:** This function paints the `grid` with the values from the merged interior object, effectively replacing the original object cells with '1' at interior positions.

### **Program Version 3**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def interior_cells(obj):
    return frozenset({cell for cell in toindices(obj) if all((i,j) in toindices(obj) for i, j in dneighbors(cell))})
  return fill(grid, 1, merge(apply(interior_cells, objects(grid, True, False, True)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`interior_cells(obj)`:** This function, similar to `is_interior`, identifies interior cells. However, it uses an `all` condition to check if all direct neighbors are part of the same object, making the logic more concise. 
2. The rest of the code follows the same approach as Version 2, using `apply` to find interior cells of each object, merging them, and finally filling the `grid` with '1' at those positions. 

### **Program Version 4**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def get_interior(obj):
    return frozenset({c for c in toindices(obj) if len(dneighbors(c) - (dneighbors(c) - toindices(obj))) == 4})
  return paint(grid, merge(apply(get_interior, objects(grid, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`get_interior(obj)`:** This version offers another way to determine interior cells. It leverages set operations to find cells whose direct neighbors are all part of the object. It calculates the difference between the cell's neighbors and the set difference of its neighbors and the object's cells. If the resulting set has a size of 4, it means all neighbors belong to the object.
2. Similar to previous versions, it applies this function to all objects, merges the results, and paints the grid.

### **Program Version 5**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def is_not_border(cell, obj):
    return len(dneighbors(cell) - toindices(obj)) == 0 
  return fill(grid, 1, mfilter(objects(grid, True, False, True), lambda obj: sfilter(toindices(obj), rbind(is_not_border, obj))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_not_border(cell, obj)`:** This function takes a different approach, focusing on identifying non-border cells within an object. It checks if all the direct neighbors of a cell are part of the object. If any neighbor isn't, it implies the cell is on the border.
2. Similar to Version 1, it uses `mfilter` and `sfilter` with the `is_not_border` function to identify and collect all non-border cells from all objects.
3. Finally, it fills the grid with '1' at these non-border cell locations.
