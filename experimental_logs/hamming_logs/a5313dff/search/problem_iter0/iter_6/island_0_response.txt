## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the grid (clusters of the same digit) and filling the "interior" of these objects with the value '1'. The exterior and the original shape of the objects remain unchanged.

**Input_0:** The single '2' object has its interior filled with '1'.

**Input_1:** Both '2' objects have their interiors filled.

**Input_2:**  All '2' objects, regardless of size or shape, have their interiors filled.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if len(dneighbors((i, j)) & toindices(obj)) == 4:
        grid = fill(grid, 1, (i, j))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(grid, True, False, True)` identifies objects (connected regions of the same value) in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate and fill:** The code iterates through each object and its cells. If a cell has all four direct neighbors within the same object, it's considered an interior cell and filled with '1'.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  return paint(grid, merge({recolor(1, delta(obj)) for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects and find deltas:**  Similar to version 1, it identifies objects. Then, for each object, it finds the `delta`, which represents the cells within the object's bounding box but not part of the object itself (effectively, the interior).
2. **Recolor and paint:**  It recolors the delta cells to '1' and then paints them onto the original grid, effectively filling the interiors.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(grid):
    objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)
    interior_cells = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: lambda c: len(dneighbors(c) & toindices(obj)) == 4)
    return fill(grid, 1, merge(interior_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects and interior cells:** Identifies objects and uses `mfilter` to find all cells within each object where all four direct neighbors belong to the same object (interior cells).
2. **Fill interior cells:** It then fills all the identified interior cells with the value '1'.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  def is_interior(obj, cell):
    return len(dneighbors(cell) & toindices(obj)) == 4
  return paint(grid, merge({recolor(1, sfilter(toindices(obj), rbind(is_interior, obj))) for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define interior check:** `is_interior` function checks if a cell is an interior cell within an object.
2. **Identify objects and interior cells:** Identifies objects and uses `sfilter` with the `is_interior` function to find the interior cells within each object.
3. **Recolor and paint:** It recolors the interior cells to '1' and paints them onto the original grid. 

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  for i in range(1, height(grid) - 1):
    for j in range(1, width(grid) - 1):
      if grid[i][j] != mostcolor(grid) and all(grid[i + di][j + dj] == grid[i][j] for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]):
        grid = fill(grid, 1, (i, j))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through inner cells:** Iterates through all cells in the grid except for the border cells.
2. **Check for interior:** For each cell, it checks if it's not the background color and if all its direct neighbors have the same color. If true, it's considered an interior cell.
3. **Fill interior cells:** Fills the identified interior cells with '1'. 

These programs demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL.
