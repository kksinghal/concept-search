## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the input grid and drawing a "border" around them. This border is drawn inside the object, effectively creating an outline.  The border color is represented by the digit "1".

**Input 0:**
- A single object formed by the digit "2".
- A border of "1" is drawn around the inner perimeter of this object.

**Input 1:**
- Multiple objects formed by the digit "2".
- Each object has an inner border of "1" drawn.

**Input 2:**
- Similar to Input 1, multiple "2" objects are present.
- Each object receives an inner border of "1".

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct program versions utilizing the DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Extract objects
  inboxes = mapply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)) & backdrop(toindices(obj)), objs) # Generate inboxes for each object
  O = underpaint(I, recolor(ONE, merge(inboxes))) # Paint inboxes with "1"
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies and separates objects formed by non-background colors.
2. **Generate Inboxes:** For each object `obj`, we calculate its `inbox`. The `inbox` represents the cells directly inside the object's boundary. We achieve this using set operations:
    - `delta(toindices(obj))`: Finds cells within the bounding box of the object but not part of the object itself.
    - `backdrop(toindices(obj))`: Gets all cells within the object's bounding box.
    - The intersection (`&`) of these two sets gives us the desired `inbox`.
3. **Paint Inboxes:**
    - `merge(inboxes)` combines all the calculated `inboxes` into a single set.
    - `recolor(ONE, ...)` assigns the value "1" to all indices within the combined `inbox`.
    - `underpaint(I, ...)` paints these recolored indices onto the original grid `I`, ensuring only background cells are overwritten.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  inboxes = frozenset({(ONE, idx) for obj in objs for idx in (delta(toindices(obj)) & backdrop(toindices(obj)))})
  O = underpaint(I, merge(inboxes))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a set comprehension for a more concise `inboxes` generation. It directly creates a frozenset of tuples, where each tuple represents the color "1" and its corresponding index from the calculated `inbox`. The rest of the logic remains identical to Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    inboxes = mapply(lambda obj: difference(box(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj)), objs)
    O = underpaint(I, recolor(ONE, merge(inboxes)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly calculates the `inboxes` by finding the difference between the `box` (outline) of an object and the object's indices.  

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    bordered_objs = mapply(lambda obj: toobject(delta(toindices(obj)) & backdrop(toindices(obj)), replace(I, next(iter(obj))[0], ONE)), objs)
    O = paint(I, merge(bordered_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version calculates the inbox indices for each object and directly modifies the object by replacing its color with "1" at those indices. Then, it paints the modified objects back onto the original grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        inbox_indices = delta(toindices(obj)) & backdrop(toindices(obj))
        O = fill(O, ONE, inbox_indices)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each object in the input grid. For every object, it calculates the `inbox` and fills those indices with "1" in the output grid. 

These five versions showcase different approaches and DSL function combinations to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
