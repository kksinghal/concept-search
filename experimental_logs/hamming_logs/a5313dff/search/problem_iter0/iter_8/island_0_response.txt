## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the "interior" cells of each object in the grid and changing their value to 1. An interior cell is defined as a cell that is surrounded by four cells of the same object (not diagonally).

**Input 0:**

* The single object formed by the digit '2' has a rectangular shape.
* The four corner cells and all the cells on the perimeter of the rectangle are not interior cells.
* All other cells within the rectangle are interior cells and their values are changed to 1.

**Input 1 & 2:**

* The same logic applies to all objects in these inputs as well. 
* Every cell that is part of an object and surrounded by four cells of the same object (horizontally and vertically) is changed to 1.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def is_interior(cell, obj):
    return len(dneighbors(cell) & toindices(obj)) == 4
  interior_cells = mfilter(objects(grid, True, False, True), lambda obj: sfilter(toindices(obj), lbind(is_interior, obj)))
  return fill(grid, 1, interior_cells)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_interior(cell, obj)`:** This helper function checks if a given `cell` is an interior cell within a given `obj`. It does this by checking if all four direct neighbors of the `cell` are also part of the `obj`.
2. **`objects(grid, True, False, True)`:** This function identifies all distinct objects in the grid. The parameters specify that objects are formed by connected cells with the same value (True), diagonals are not considered for connectivity (False), and the background should be excluded (True).
3. **`sfilter(toindices(obj), lbind(is_interior, obj))`:** For each object, this extracts its indices and then filters them to keep only the interior cells using the `is_interior` function. 
4. **`mfilter(...)`:** This function applies the previous filtering step to each object in the grid and merges the results into a single set of interior cells.
5. **`fill(grid, 1, interior_cells)`:** Finally, this function fills all the identified interior cells with the value 1 in the original grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def is_interior(obj):
    return {(1, cell) for cell in toindices(obj) if len(dneighbors(cell) & toindices(obj)) == 4}
  return paint(grid, merge(apply(is_interior, objects(grid, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_interior(obj)`:** This function takes an object and returns a set of cells that are interior to the object, represented as tuples of (1, cell_index).
2. **`objects(grid, True, False, True)`:** This identifies all objects in the grid, excluding the background.
3. **`apply(is_interior, ...)`:** This applies the `is_interior` function to each object, resulting in a set of sets of interior cells.
4. **`merge(...)`:** This merges all the sets of interior cells into a single set.
5. **`paint(grid, ...)`:** This paints the identified interior cells with value 1 onto the original grid. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def interior_cells(obj):
    return {cell for cell in toindices(obj) if all((i,j) in toindices(obj) for i, j in dneighbors(cell))}
  return fill(grid, 1, merge(apply(interior_cells, objects(grid, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`interior_cells(obj)`:** This function identifies interior cells within an object. It iterates through each cell of the object and checks if all its direct neighbors are also part of the object.
2. **`objects(grid, True, False, True)`:** This identifies all objects in the grid, excluding the background.
3. **`apply(interior_cells, ...)`:** The `interior_cells` function is applied to each object, resulting in a set of sets of interior cells.
4. **`merge(...)`:** This merges all the sets of interior cells into a single set.
5. **`fill(grid, 1, ...)`:**  This fills all identified interior cells in the grid with the value 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    def get_interior(obj):
        return {c for c in toindices(obj) if len(dneighbors(c) - (dneighbors(c) - toindices(obj))) == 4}
    return paint(grid, merge(apply(get_interior, objects(grid, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`get_interior(obj)`:** This function takes an object and identifies its interior cells. It checks if a cell's direct neighbors are all part of the object.
2. **`objects(grid, True, False, True)`:** Identifies all objects in the grid, excluding the background.
3. **`apply(get_interior, ...)`:**  This applies the `get_interior` function to each identified object.
4. **`merge(...)`:** This merges the results (sets of interior cells) into a single set.
5. **`paint(grid, ...)`:** Finally, this paints the identified interior cells onto the original grid with the value 1.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def interior(obj):
    return frozenset((1, cell) for cell in toindices(obj) 
                   if all([(cell[0] + i, cell[1] + j) in toindices(obj)
                           for i, j in [(0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0)]]))
  return paint(grid, merge(apply(interior, objects(grid, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`interior(obj)`:**  This function takes an object and returns a set of its interior cells. It checks for each cell if all its direct neighbors are part of the same object.
2. **`objects(grid, True, False, True)`:**  This function identifies all objects in the grid, excluding the background.
3. **`apply(interior, ...)`:** The `interior` function is applied to each object.
4. **`merge(...)`:** This merges the resulting sets of interior cells into a single set.
5. **`paint(grid, ...)`:** This paints the identified interior cells onto the original grid using the value 1.


These five program versions showcase different approaches to achieve the desired transformation, using various combinations of DSL functions. Each version efficiently identifies and modifies the interior cells of objects in the input grid to produce the correct output grid.
