## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by connected pixels of the same color (excluding the background color, 0) and filling the inner area of these objects with the value 1. Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**
- The input contains a single object formed by the digit '2'. 
- The output retains the outline of this object ('2') while filling its interior with '1'.

**Input_1:**
- The input contains two objects formed by the digit '2'.
- The output retains the outline of both objects while filling their interiors with '1'.

**Input_2:**
- Similar to previous examples, this input contains multiple objects formed by the digit '2'.
- The output again demonstrates the consistent pattern of preserving object outlines and filling their interiors with '1'.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

### Program Version 1:

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Extract objects, excluding background
  filled_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(ONE, inbox(toindices(obj))), objs) # Fill the inbox of each object with '1'
  O = paint(I, merge(filled_objs)) # Paint the filled objects onto the original grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Extracts all objects (connected pixels of the same color) from the input grid `I`. The parameters (`T, F, T`) specify that we want univalued objects (all pixels have the same value), not considering diagonal connections, and excluding the background.
2. **`mapply(lambda obj: recolor(ONE, inbox(toindices(obj))), objs)`**:  This part iterates through each extracted object (`obj`). For every object, it does the following:
    -  **`toindices(obj)`**: Gets the indices of the object's pixels.
    -  **`inbox(toindices(obj))`**: Computes the "inbox" of the object, which are the indices within the object's bounding box, excluding the border.
    -  **`recolor(ONE, ...)`**: Creates a new object where all pixels within the inbox are assigned the value '1'.
3. **`paint(I, merge(filled_objs))`**: Merges all the filled objects from the previous step and paints them onto a copy of the original grid `I`, effectively filling the interiors of the objects.


### Program Version 2:

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  outlines = mapply(lambda obj: difference(toindices(obj), inbox(toindices(obj))), objs)
  O = fill(I, ONE, merge(mapply(inbox, mapply(toindices, objs))))
  O = paint(O, merge(mapply(toobject, outlines, repeat(I, size(outlines)))))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Extracts objects from the input grid.
2. **`outlines = ...`**: Calculates object outlines by finding the difference between the object's indices and its inbox.
3. **`O = fill(...)`**: Fills the inboxes of all objects with '1'.
4. **`O = paint(...)`**: Paints the outlines extracted earlier back onto the grid, preserving the original object boundaries.

### Program Version 3:

```python
def solve(I):
  not_bg = lambda loc: index(I, loc) != mostcommon(I)
  O = apply(
      lambda row: apply(lambda j: ONE if any(not_bg((i, j)) for i in range(len(I))) else ZERO, range(len(I[0]))), 
      range(len(I))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`not_bg = ...`**:  Defines a lambda function to check if a cell is not the background color.
2. **`apply(lambda row: ..., range(len(I)))`**:  Iterates over each row of the input grid.
3. **`apply(lambda j: ..., range(len(I[0])))`**: Iterates over each column within the row.
4. **`ONE if any(not_bg((i, j)) for i in range(len(I))) else ZERO`**:  Checks if any cell in the current column (from top to bottom) is not the background color. If true, it sets the cell to '1'; otherwise, it sets it to '0'.

### Program Version 4:

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
      indices = toindices(obj)
      for i in range(uppermost(indices) + 1, lowermost(indices)):
        for j in range(leftmost(indices) + 1, rightmost(indices)):
          O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Extracts objects from the input.
2. **`for obj in objs: ...`**: Iterates through each object.
3. **`indices = toindices(obj)`**: Gets the indices of the object.
4. The nested loops iterate through the inner region of the object's bounding box and fill each cell with '1'. 

### Program Version 5:

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(1, len(I)-1):
        for j in range(1, len(I[0])-1):
            if any(I[ni][nj] != mostcommon(I) for ni, nj in neighbors((i, j))):
              O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`for i in range(1, len(I)-1): ...`**:  Iterates over each row, excluding the border rows.
2. **`for j in range(1, len(I[0])-1): ...`**: Iterates over each column, excluding the border columns.
3. **`if any(I[ni][nj] != mostcommon(I) for ni, nj in neighbors((i, j))): ...`**: Checks if any neighbor of the current cell is not the background color. If true, it fills the current cell with '1'.

These program versions showcase different approaches to achieve the desired transformation using the DSL. Each version provides a unique combination of functions and logic, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
