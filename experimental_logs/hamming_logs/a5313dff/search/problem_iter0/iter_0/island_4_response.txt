## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the "interior" of each connected object (excluding single-pixel wide lines) and changing its color to 1. 

* **Input 0:** The interior of the '2' object is filled with '1'.
* **Input 1:** Same as Input 0, the interior of the '2' object is filled.
* **Input 2:**  Again, the logic holds - only the interior cells of the '2' objects change color.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  interiors = mfilter(objs, lambda o: size(delta(o)) != size(o) + size(box(o)) - 1)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda o: recolor(1, o), interiors))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, F)` finds all connected objects in the grid `I`.
2. **Find Interiors:**  `mfilter` selects objects where the size of the delta (surrounding cells not part of the object) is not equal to the size of the object plus the size of its bounding box minus 1. This condition identifies objects with an "interior". 
3. **Recolor Interiors:** `apply(lambda o: recolor(1, o), interiors)` recolors the identified interior objects to value '1'.
4. **Paint to Grid:** `paint(I, ...)` applies the changes to the original grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  changed_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    if size(toindices(obj)) > size(box(obj)):
      changed_objs.add(recolor(1, inbox(obj)))
  return paint(I, merge(changed_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1, `objects` identifies all connected objects.
2. **Check for Interior:**  This version iterates through each object and checks if its size is greater than the size of its bounding box. This signifies an interior.
3. **Recolor Inbox:** If an interior is found, its `inbox` (cells within the bounding box excluding the box itself) is recolored to '1'.
4. **Paint to Grid:** `paint` applies the changes.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
  changed_cells = set()
  for i in range(1, height(I)-1):
    for j in range(1, width(I)-1):
      if index(I,(i,j)) != 0 and index(I,(i-1,j)) == index(I,(i+1,j)) == index(I,(i,j-1)) == index(I,(i,j+1)):
        changed_cells.add((1, (i,j)))
  return paint(I, frozenset(changed_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:**  This version iterates over each cell (excluding borders) and checks if its neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) have the same color as the cell itself.
2. **Recolor if Interior:** If the condition is met, the cell is considered an interior cell and recolored to '1'.
3. **Paint to Grid:**  `paint` applies the recoloring to the original grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
    interiors = mfilter(objs, lambda o: size(o) > 1 and any(lbind(equality, center(o))(center(delta(shift(o, d)))) for d in ((1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1))))
    return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda o: recolor(1, o), interiors)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects` identifies all connected objects in the grid.
2. **Find Interiors:** `mfilter` selects objects with size greater than 1 and those for which the center of the delta (surrounding cells) of the shifted object (in all four directions) is equal to the center of the original object. This condition identifies objects with an "interior".
3. **Recolor Interiors:**  Similar to Version 1, identified interior objects are recolored to '1'.
4. **Paint to Grid:** Changes are applied to the original grid using `paint`.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
  filled = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      for i in range(uppermost(obj) + 1, lowermost(obj)):
        for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj)):
          if (i, j) in toindices(obj):
            filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i,j)})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions, this version starts by identifying connected objects.
2. **Iterate within Objects:**  For each object larger than a single cell, the program iterates through the cells within its bounding box (excluding the border cells).
3. **Fill Interior Cells:** If the iterated cell is part of the object, it's filled with the value '1'.
4. **Return Filled Grid:**  The modified grid with filled interiors is returned.

These five program versions provide diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation using different logic and function combinations from the DSL.
