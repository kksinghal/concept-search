## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of a specific color (8) and replacing every other column within these objects with another color (2). 

**Let's break down the changes in each example:**

* **Input_0 to Output_0:** Every other column of 8s, starting from the second column within each object, is replaced with 2s.
* **Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to Input_0, every other column of 8s is replaced with 2s. Note how the transformation respects the object's shape.
* **Input_2 to Output_2:**  Again, every other column of 8s is replaced with 2s. The transformation works even with varying object widths.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = I  
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 8:
      for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + 1):
        if even(j - leftmost(obj)):
          O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Starts with the output `O` being a copy of the input `I`.
2. **Object Iteration:**  Iterates through each object in the input grid.
3. **Color Check:**  Processes only the objects with color 8.
4. **Column Iteration:** Iterates over columns of the object, starting from the second column (index `leftmost(obj) + 1`).
5. **Even Column Replacement:**  If the column index relative to the object's leftmost edge is even, fill the entire column within the object's height with the color 2.


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 8:
      for cell in obj:
        i, (j, k) = cell
        O = fill(O, i, {(j, k)} if even(k - leftmost(obj)) else {(j, k)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Creates an output grid `O` filled with the background color, having the same shape as the input `I`.
2. **Object and Cell Iteration:** Iterates through each object and its individual cells.
3. **Conditional Filling:** If the cell belongs to an object with color 8 and its column index (relative to the object's leftmost edge) is even, fill that cell in the output grid `O` with the object's color. Otherwise, retain the original color.


### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 8:
      start = leftmost(obj) + 1
      width = rightmost(obj) - start + 1
      for j in range(1, width // 2 + (width % 2)):
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, start + 2 * j - 1) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization and Iteration:** Similar to version 1, it copies the input to the output and iterates through objects of color 8.
2. **Optimized Column Filling:** Instead of checking even/odd in each iteration, it directly calculates the indices of every other column and fills them.


### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 8:
      indices = toindices(obj)
      O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j) for i, j in indices if even(j - leftmost(obj))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Index Filling:** This version directly identifies the indices of the cells to be changed and fills them in one go.


### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  return paint(
      cover(I, mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8 and even(leftmost(obj)))), 
      recolor(
          2, 
          mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8 and even(leftmost(obj)))
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Functional Approach:** This version takes a more functional approach, using nested functions to identify, cover, and repaint the specific cells. It first covers all cells belonging to the target objects with the background color and then repaints every other column within those objects with color 2.


Each of these programs achieves the same output as specified in the examples, but they do so with different logic and DSL function combinations, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
