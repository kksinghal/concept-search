## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all three examples involves identifying specific cells within objects and recoloring them. Let's break down each example:

**Example 0:** Every alternate column within the object (digit '8') is recolored to '2', starting from the second column of the object.

**Example 1:** Similar to Example 0, every alternate column within the object is recolored to '2'. However, in this case, the recoloring pattern starts from the second column of the object if the column index is even and from the first column if the column index is odd. 

**Example 2:**  Again, every alternate column within the object is recolored to '2'. Here, the recoloring pattern depends on the row index. If the row index is even, the recoloring starts from the second column; if the row index is odd, it starts from the first.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions that can achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  new_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    new_obj = frozenset()
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      new_obj = new_obj | {(2 if j % 2 != i % 2 else v, (i, j))} 
    new_objs = new_objs | {new_obj}
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), new_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate over objects:**  For each object `obj`:
   - **Create `new_obj`:**  Initialize an empty set to store the modified object.
   - **Iterate over cells:** For each cell `(v, (i, j))` in the object:
     - **Conditional recoloring:** If the column index `j` and row index `i` have different parity (one even, one odd), recolor the cell to '2'; otherwise, keep the original color `v`.
   - **Add to `new_objs`:** Add the modified object `new_obj` to the set of new objects.
3. **`paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), new_objs)`:** Create a blank canvas of the same size as the input and paint the modified objects onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v != mostcolor(I) and j % 2 != i % 2:
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initialize the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate over cells:**  Iterate over each cell `(i, j)` and its value `v` in the input grid.
3. **Conditional recoloring:** If the cell is not part of the background (most common color) and the column index `j` and row index `i` have different parity, fill the cell in the output grid with '2'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  recolor_fn = lambda j, i: j % 2 != i % 2
  new_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor_object(obj, recolor_fn), objs)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), new_objs)
  return O

def recolor_object(obj, recolor_fn):
  return frozenset((2 if recolor_fn(j, i) else v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `recolor_fn`:** Defines a lambda function that checks the parity of row and column indices for recoloring.
2. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Identifies objects in the input.
3. **`apply(lambda obj: recolor_object(obj, recolor_fn), objs)`:**  Applies the `recolor_object` function to each object, passing the `recolor_fn` as an argument.
4. **`recolor_object`:**  Takes an object and the `recolor_fn` as input, recolors the cells based on the function's logic, and returns the modified object.
5. **`paint`:** Paints the modified objects onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  indices = asindices(I)
  recolor_indices = sfilter(indices, lambda ij: ij[1] % 2 != ij[0] % 2)
  recolored_grid = fill(I, 2, recolor_indices)
  O = underpaint(recolored_grid, asobject(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asindices(I)`:** Get all cell indices of the input grid.
2. **`sfilter(indices, lambda ij: ij[1] % 2 != ij[0] % 2)`:** Filter indices where column and row indices have different parity.
3. **`fill(I, 2, recolor_indices)`:** Fill the filtered indices with '2' in the input grid.
4. **`asobject(I)`:** Convert the input grid to an object representation.
5. **`underpaint(recolored_grid, asobject(I))`:** Paint the original object over the recolored grid, ensuring only background cells are affected.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        O = paint(O, {(2 if j % 2 != i % 2 else I[i][j], (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shape(I)`:** Get the height and width of the input grid.
2. **`canvas(0, (h, w))`:** Create a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input.
3. **Iterate over cells:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
4. **Conditional painting:** If a cell is not part of the background, paint it onto the canvas with the appropriate color: '2' if the row and column indices have different parity, or the original cell color otherwise.


These five program versions provide distinct ways to achieve the desired transformation, demonstrating different logical approaches and DSL function combinations. They highlight the flexibility of the DSL in solving spatial reasoning problems.
