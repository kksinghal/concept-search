## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific patterns within the input grid and replacing some of the cells with the value '2' based on these patterns. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** The program replaces every other column of the '8' object with '2's, effectively creating a striped pattern.

**Pair 1:**  Similar to Pair 0, the transformation replaces every other column of the '8' object with '2's, preserving the original shape but with the striped pattern.

**Pair 2:** Again, the program introduces the striped pattern by replacing every other column of the '8' object with '2's. 

**Overall Logic:**  The transformation consistently applies a vertical striping pattern to objects composed of '8's within the grid, leaving other values untouched.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each employing different logic or DSL function combinations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects from the input grid
    striped_objs = frozenset() 
    for obj in objs:
        if color(obj) == 8: # Check if the object is composed of '8's
            new_obj = set()
            for v, (i, j) in obj:
                if even(j): # Apply striping pattern: replace every other column 
                    new_obj.add((2, (i, j))) 
                else:
                    new_obj.add((v, (i, j)))
            striped_objs = striped_objs.union(frozenset({frozenset(new_obj)}))
        else:
            striped_objs = striped_objs.union(frozenset({obj}))
    O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(striped_objs)) # Paint the modified objects onto a blank canvas
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Uses `objects(I, T, F, T)` to extract objects from the grid.
2. **Iterate and Modify:** Iterates through each object. If the object's color is 8, it applies the striping pattern by replacing the value in every other column with '2'.
3. **Paint to Canvas:**  Paints the modified objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Create an empty canvas of the same size as input
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] == 8 and even(j):  # Check for '8' and even column
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i,j)}) # Fill with '2' if condition met
      else:
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i,j)}) # Otherwise, retain original value
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Empty Canvas:** Creates an empty grid (`O`) with the same dimensions as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate and Fill:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid. If the cell contains an '8' and is in an even column, it fills the corresponding cell in the output grid with '2'. Otherwise, it fills the output grid cell with the original value from the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  new_objs = frozenset(frozenset((2 if even(j) else v, (i,j)) for v, (i,j) in obj) if color(obj) == 8 else obj for obj in objs)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(new_objs)) 
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **Extract Objects:**  Extracts objects from the input grid using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Conditional Modification:**  Uses a set comprehension to iterate through the objects. If an object's color is '8', it applies the striping pattern within the comprehension using a conditional expression (`2 if even(j) else v`).
3. **Paint to Canvas:**  Similar to version 1, it paints the modified objects onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I # Initialize output as input
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        if color(obj) == 8:
            for j in range(0, width(obj), 2): # Iterate over even columns of object
                O = fill(O, 2, {(i, leftmost(obj) + j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)}) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize and Iterate:** Initializes the output grid (`O`) as a copy of the input grid (`I`). Iterates through each object in the input.
2. **Conditional Filling:** If an object's color is '8', it iterates over every other column of that object and fills the corresponding cells in the output grid with '2'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  modified_grid = I
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 8:
      for (i,j) in toindices(obj):
        if even(j - leftmost(obj)): # Check even column relative to object start
          modified_grid = fill(modified_grid, 2, {(i,j)}) 
  return modified_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization and Extraction:** Initializes `modified_grid` with the input grid and extracts objects.
2. **Iterate and Modify:** Iterates through each object. If its color is '8', it iterates through the object's indices, checking for even columns relative to the object's leftmost boundary (`even(j - leftmost(obj))`) and modifies `modified_grid` accordingly.


These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the same grid transformation, fulfilling the prompt's requirements.
