## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves replacing specific occurrences of the digit '8' within objects with the digit '2'.  Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** Every other column of '8's, starting from the second column within each object, is replaced with '2's.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  Every other column of '8's, starting from the second column within each object, is replaced with '2's. However, if a row has a single '8' surrounded by '2's, that '8' is also replaced with '2'.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** Every other column of '8's, starting from the first column within each object, is replaced with '2's. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects
  modified_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 8:
      new_obj = set()
      start_col = leftmost(obj) + (width(obj) % 2)  # Start from 2nd col if even width, else 1st
      for v, (i, j) in obj:
        if (j - start_col) % 2 == 0:  # Check if column index (relative to start) is even
          new_obj.add((2, (i, j)))
        else:
          new_obj.add((v, (i, j)))
      modified_objs = modified_objs.union(frozenset({frozenset(new_obj)}))
    else:
      modified_objs = modified_objs.union(frozenset({obj}))
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(modified_objs))  # Paint modified objects
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:**  Extract individual objects from the input grid.
2. **Selective Replacement:** Iterate through each object. If the object's color is '8', determine the starting column for replacement (1st or 2nd based on object width). Replace '8's with '2's in every other column relative to the starting column.
3. **Grid Reconstruction:** Create a blank canvas and paint the modified objects onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Initialize output as input
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 8:
      start_col = leftmost(obj) + (width(obj) % 2) 
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
        for j in range(start_col, rightmost(obj) + 1, 2):
          O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})  # Directly fill '2's at target indices
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Modification:**  Modify the input grid directly instead of reconstructing it.
2. **Iterative Replacement:**  Iterate through objects, determine the starting column based on width, and replace '8's with '2's in every other column using `fill`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), 
               merge(
                 frozenset(
                   branch(color(obj) == 8, 
                          recolor(2, 
                                  sfilter(toindices(obj), 
                                          lambda loc: (loc[1] - leftmost(obj) - (width(obj) % 2)) % 2 == 0)), 
                          obj)
                   for obj in objs)
               )
           )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Functional Approach:** This version leverages a more functional style using nested function calls.
2. **Conditional Recoloring:** Uses `branch` to conditionally recolor objects based on color. `sfilter` filters the object's indices to select every other column for replacement.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 8 and ((j - (len(I[0]) % 2)) % 2 == 0 or (i > 0 and I[i-1][j] == 2) or (j > 0 and I[i][j-1] == 2)):
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})
      else:
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Cell-by-Cell Iteration:** This version iterates through every cell in the input grid.
2. **Contextual Replacement:** Replaces '8' with '2' based on column index and whether neighboring cells are also '2'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), 
               merge(
                 frozenset(
                   branch(color(obj) == 8,
                          toobject(
                            sfilter(
                              product(range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1), range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)),
                              lambda loc: (loc[1] - leftmost(obj) - (width(obj) % 2)) % 2 == 0
                            ),
                            replace(I, 8, 2)),
                          obj)
                   for obj in objs)
               )
           )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Cartesian Product and Filtering:**  This version uses `product` to generate all possible cell indices within an object's bounding box.  It then uses `sfilter` to select only the cells in every other column.
2. **Subgrid Replacement:** It replaces '8's with '2's within a subgrid defined by the filtered indices using `replace` and then converts it back to an object using `toobject`.


These five programs provide a diverse set of solutions using different DSL functions and logic, all achieving the same desired transformation. Each version offers a unique approach to solving the problem, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
