## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation modifies the input grids by changing the color of specific cells within objects to the value '2'.  The pattern of these modifications appears to be based on the cell's indices relative to the object's bounding box.

**Input 0:** Cells within the object where the column index (j) is odd and the row index (i) is even, or vice-versa, are recolored to '2'.

**Input 1:**  The same pattern applies as in Input 0.

**Input 2:**  The pattern remains consistent with the previous examples.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing the described transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Extract all objects
  new_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    new_obj = frozenset()
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      new_v = 2 if (i + j) % 2 else v # Apply recoloring logic
      new_obj = new_obj | {(new_v, (i, j))}
    new_objs = new_objs | {new_obj}
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), new_objs)  # Paint the modified objects
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** We begin by extracting all the objects from the input grid `I` using `objects(I, T, T, T)`.
2. **Iterate and Modify:** We iterate through each object (`obj`) and its cells (`v, (i, j)`). 
3. **Recoloring Logic:** For each cell, we check if the sum of its row and column indices (`i + j`) is odd. If it is, we recolor the cell to '2'; otherwise, we keep the original value (`v`).
4. **Construct New Objects:** The modified cells are used to construct new objects (`new_objs`).
5. **Paint Objects:** Finally, we create a blank canvas using `canvas(0, shape(I))` and paint the modified objects (`new_objs`) onto it.


**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Create a canvas
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if (i + j) % 2: # Check for alternating cell condition
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i,j)}) # Fill with '2' if condition met
      else:
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i,j)}) # Otherwise, fill with original value
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** A blank canvas of the same size as the input grid is created.
2. **Iterate Through Cells:** The program iterates through each cell of the canvas.
3. **Alternating Cell Logic:**  The condition `(i + j) % 2` checks if the sum of the row and column indices is odd.
4. **Conditional Filling:** If the condition is met, the cell is filled with '2'; otherwise, it is filled with the corresponding value from the input grid.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  new_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor_object(obj, lambda i, j: (i + j) % 2), objs)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), new_objs)
  return O

def recolor_object(obj, condition):
  return frozenset((2 if condition(i, j) else v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Recolor:** Similar to previous versions, objects are extracted. The `recolor_object` function applies the recoloring logic based on the provided `condition` function.
2. **Apply and Paint:** The `mapply` function applies `recolor_object` to each object. Finally, the modified objects are painted onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
  checkered = lambda i, j: (i + j) % 2
  O = prapply(lambda i, j: 2 if checkered(i, j) else I[i][j], range(height(I)), range(width(I)))
  return totuple(tuple(totuple(row) for row in (O[i * width(I):(i + 1) * width(I)] for i in range(height(I)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Checkered Pattern:** A lambda function `checkered` defines the alternating cell condition.
2. **Apply and Reshape:** The `prapply` function applies the recoloring logic based on `checkered` to every cell index pair. The result is then reshaped back into a grid.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
  return totuple(
    tuple(
      2 if (i + j) % 2 else I[i][j] for j in range(width(I))
    ) for i in range(height(I))
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Transformation:** This version directly constructs the output grid using nested list comprehensions.
2. **Recoloring Logic:** The recoloring logic is embedded within the comprehension, applying the alternating cell condition.

These five program versions demonstrate diverse ways to achieve the desired transformation in the DSL. They showcase different strategies for object manipulation, cell iteration, and conditional logic. Each version utilizes distinct combinations of DSL functions, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the language.
