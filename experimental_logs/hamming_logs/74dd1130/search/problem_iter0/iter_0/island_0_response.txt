## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place in all examples is a **transpose operation** along the main diagonal. This means mirroring the grid across the diagonal that runs from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program utilizing different DSL functions to achieve the transpose transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = dmirror(I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* `dmirror(I)` directly performs the diagonal mirroring operation on the input grid `I`, resulting in the transposed output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = rot90(hmirror(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* `hmirror(I)` first mirrors the input grid `I` horizontally.
* `rot90(...)` then rotates the horizontally mirrored grid 90 degrees clockwise, effectively transposing the original grid and storing it in `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = rot270(vmirror(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* `vmirror(I)` first mirrors the input grid `I` vertically.
* `rot270(...)` then rotates the vertically mirrored grid 270 degrees clockwise (or 90 degrees counter-clockwise), achieving the transpose and storing it in `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(ZERO, (w, h))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      O = fill(O, index(I, (i,j)), (j,i))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* `h, w = shape(I)` extracts the height and width of the input grid `I`.
* `O = canvas(ZERO, (w, h))` creates an empty canvas `O` with dimensions swapped compared to `I` (width becomes height and vice versa).
* The nested loop iterates through each cell of `I`, extracting the value at `(i, j)` using `index(I, (i,j))` and then filling the corresponding transposed location `(j, i)` in the output grid `O` with the extracted value.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    indices = asindices(I)
    transposed_indices = frozenset((j, i) for i, j in indices)
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    for i, j in transposed_indices:
        O = fill(O, index(I, (j, i)), (i, j))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* `indices = asindices(I)` gets all indices of the input grid `I`.
* `transposed_indices = ...` generates a set of transposed indices by swapping `i` and `j` for each index in `indices`.
* `O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))` creates an empty canvas `O` with the same dimensions as `I`.
* The loop iterates through each transposed index `(i, j)`, retrieving the value from the original location `(j, i)` in `I` using `index(I, (j, i))` and filling the current `(i, j)` location in `O`.


These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the transpose transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version utilizes different combinations of functions, demonstrating diverse paths to reach the desired outcome.
