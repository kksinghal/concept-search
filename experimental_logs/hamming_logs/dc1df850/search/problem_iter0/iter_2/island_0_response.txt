## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to "extend" the rightmost non-zero value in each row to the right, filling with '1's. However, if the rightmost non-zero value is '2', the extension also fills with '1's but stops one cell short.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The '2' in the first row extends rightward with '1's, stopping one cell short. The '2' in the second row extends similarly. The '6' in the fourth row extends rightward with '1's, filling the entire row. 
* **Input_1:**  The '2' in the first row extends rightward with a single '1'. The '3' in the third row extends rightward with '1's, filling the entire row. The '8' in the fifth row extends rightward with a single '1'.  The '2' in the seventh row extends rightward with a single '1'.
* **Input_2:** The '2' in the second row extends rightward with a single '1'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  new_grid = []
  for i in range(h):
    row = list(grid[i])
    for j in range(w - 1, -1, -1):
      if row[j] != 0:
        fill_value = 1
        if row[j] == 2:
          for k in range(j + 1, min(j + 2, w)):
            row[k] = fill_value
        else:
          for k in range(j + 1, w):
            row[k] = fill_value
        break
    new_grid.append(tuple(row))
  return tuple(new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**
1. Iterates through each row of the grid.
2. Finds the rightmost non-zero value in each row.
3. If the value is '2', fills the next cell with '1'.
4. If the value is not '2', fills all cells to the right with '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      1 if any(c != 0 for c in r[j:]) and (r[j] != 0 or (j > 0 and r[j - 1] != 2)) 
      else 0 
      for j in range(len(r))
    ) for r in grid
  )
```

**Explanation:**
1. Utilizes nested list comprehensions for conciseness.
2. For each cell, checks if there's a non-zero value to its right.
3. Fills the cell with '1' if the above condition is true and:
    * The current cell is non-zero.
    * OR the cell to the left is not '2'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      1 if j >= len(r) - r[::-1].index(next((x for x in r[::-1] if x != 0), 0)) and (r[j] != 0 or (j > 0 and r[j - 1] != 2)) 
      else 0 
      for j in range(len(r))
    ) for r in grid
  )
```

**Explanation:**
1. Uses `[::-1]` to reverse rows and find the index of the rightmost non-zero.
2. Calculates the index from the right end and compares it with the current cell's index.
3. Similar to Version 2, handles the special case for '2'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      1 if j >= next((len(r) - i for i, x in enumerate(r[::-1]) if x != 0), len(r)) and (r[j] != 0 or (j > 0 and r[j - 1] != 2))
      else 0 
      for j in range(len(r))
    ) for r in grid
  )
```

**Explanation:**
1. Uses a generator expression within `next` to find the index of the rightmost non-zero.
2.  Calculates the index from the right end and compares it with the current cell's index.
3. Similar to Version 2, handles the special case for '2'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h = len(grid)
  w = len(grid[0])
  new_grid = []
  for i in range(h):
    row = list(grid[i])
    rightmost_nonzero_index = -1
    for j in range(w - 1, -1, -1):
      if row[j] != 0:
        rightmost_nonzero_index = j
        break
    
    if rightmost_nonzero_index != -1:
      if row[rightmost_nonzero_index] == 2:
        fill_end = min(rightmost_nonzero_index + 2, w)
      else:
        fill_end = w
      
      for j in range(rightmost_nonzero_index + 1, fill_end):
        row[j] = 1

    new_grid.append(tuple(row))

  return tuple(new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**
1. Iterates through each row, finding the index of the rightmost non-zero value.
2. Determines the fill end index based on whether the rightmost value is '2'.
3. Fills the cells from the rightmost non-zero index plus one to the calculated fill end index.


These five program versions showcase distinct approaches to solving the problem while utilizing the functions available in the provided DSL. Each version leverages different techniques to identify the rightmost non-zero value and apply the specific fill logic, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
