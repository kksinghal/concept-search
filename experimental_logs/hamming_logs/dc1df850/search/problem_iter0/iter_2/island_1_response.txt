## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to "flood fill" areas of the grid based on the following rules:

* **Non-zero values trigger flood fill:**  When a non-zero value is encountered, it starts a flood fill operation.
* **Flood fill direction:** The flood fill primarily spreads horizontally to the right.
* **Flood fill stops at existing non-zero values:** The fill stops upon hitting another non-zero value.
* **Flood fill uses value '1':** The flood fill always uses the value '1'. 

Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The '2' at (0,0) fills horizontally until the right edge.
* The '2' at (1,3) fills horizontally to the right edge.
* The '6' at (3,1) does not trigger a fill as it's not blocked horizontally.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The '2' at (0,7) fills one cell to the left.
* The '3' at (2,3) does not trigger a fill.
* The '8' at (4,6) does not trigger a fill.
* The '2' at (6,2) fills leftwards until the edge and upwards until a non-zero value.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The '2' at (1,1) fills horizontally to the right and vertically downwards until edges or non-zero values.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" function:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = height(grid), width(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if grid[i][j] != 0:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, 1, connect((i,j), (i,w-1)))
        break 
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates a new grid filled with zeros, similar to the provided examples.
2. **Iterate through rows:** Iterates over each row of the input grid.
3. **Find first non-zero:**  For each row, finds the first non-zero value.
4. **Horizontal fill:** If a non-zero value is found, fills the new grid horizontally from that position to the right edge using the 'connect' function. 
5. **Stop at row end:** After filling, the inner loop breaks, moving to the next row. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = height(grid), width(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for obj in objects(grid, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    start_j = leftmost(obj)
    for j in range(start_j, w):
      new_grid = fill(new_grid, 1, {(uppermost(obj), j)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates a new grid filled with zeros.
2. **Iterate through objects:** Uses `objects` to find connected components (objects) in the grid.
3. **Find starting column:** Gets the leftmost column (`start_j`) of each object.
4. **Horizontal fill:** Fills the new grid horizontally from the starting column to the right edge of the grid at the object's row.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = height(grid), width(grid)
  new_grid = apply(lambda row: tuple(1 if any(row[:i+1]) else 0 for i in range(w)), grid)
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Apply to each row:** Uses `apply` to process each row of the grid.
2. **Check for previous non-zero:** For each cell in the row, it checks if there's any non-zero value before it (including itself) using `any(row[:i+1])`. 
3. **Fill accordingly:** If a non-zero value was found before, it fills with '1', otherwise with '0'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = height(grid), width(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != 0:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, 1, {(i, k) for k in range(j, w)})
        break
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Creates a new grid filled with zeros.
2. **Iterate through cells:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
3. **Fill on non-zero:** Upon finding a non-zero value, it fills the new grid horizontally from that cell to the right edge.
4. **Break to next row:** After filling, breaks the inner loop to process the next row.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = height(grid), width(grid)
  def fill_right(row):
    for j in range(w):
      if row[j] != 0:
        return tuple(1 if k >= j else 0 for k in range(w))
    return tuple(0 for _ in range(w))
  return tuple(fill_right(row) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define inner function `fill_right`:**  This function processes each row individually.
2. **Find non-zero in row:**  Finds the first non-zero value in the row.
3. **Fill based on position:** Creates a new row, filling with '1' from the non-zero position onwards, and '0' before it.
4. **Apply to all rows:**  The main function applies `fill_right` to each row of the grid using a list comprehension. 

These are five distinct approaches to solve the given transformation, showcasing different ways to leverage the provided DSL functions.
