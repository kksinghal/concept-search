## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 
- The transformation involves identifying the object formed by the digit '2'. 
- Then, it expands this object by one cell in all directions, filling the new cells with the digit '1'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- Similar to the first transformation, this one focuses on the objects formed by the digits '2' and '8'. 
- The objects are expanded by one cell diagonally downwards and towards the right, filling the new cells with the digit '1'. 

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
-  Here, the object formed by the digit '2' is identified. 
- It is then expanded by one cell to the left, right, and above, with the new cells being filled with the digit '1'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
    new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objs:
      for v, (i, j) in obj:
        indices = {(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1), (i,j)}
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, 1, indices)
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, v, (i, j))
    return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  It identifies all objects in the input grid using `objects` function with `univalued=True` to treat each digit as a separate object.
2. **Create Canvas:**  A new grid of the same size as the input is created, filled with the background color.
3. **Expand Objects:** For each object, it iterates through its cells and for each cell, it fills the surrounding cells with '1' and the current cell with its original value using `fill` function. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        for x in range(max(0, i-1), min(len(I), i+2)):
          for y in range(max(0, j-1), min(len(I[0]), j+2)):
            new_grid = fill(new_grid, 1, ((x, y),))
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, I[i][j], ((i, j),))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** Similar to Version 1, a new canvas is created.
2. **Iterate and Expand:** The program iterates through each cell of the input grid. If a cell is not background, it fills the 3x3 area around it with '1' and then restores the original cell's value.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  new_grid = I
  for obj in objs:
    new_obj = obj
    for _ in range(1):
      new_obj = mapply(lambda loc: dneighbors(loc[1]), new_obj)
      new_grid = fill(new_grid, 1, toindices(new_obj))
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, obj)
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Identifies objects in the input grid.
2. **Expand Objects:**  For each object, it uses the `dneighbors` function to get the indices of the surrounding cells and expands the object. The `mapply` function applies this to all cells in the object and merges the results. It then fills these expanded indices with '1' and finally paints the original object back onto the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        new_grid = underfill(new_grid, 1, backdrop((i, j)))
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, I[i][j], ((i, j),))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** Creates a new canvas.
2. **Iterate and Expand:** Iterates through the input grid. If a cell is not background, it gets the indices of a 3x3 area around it using `backdrop` and fills those indices in the new grid with '1' using `underfill` (only filling background cells). Then, it fills the original cell with its original value.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  new_grid = I
  for obj in objs:
    new_grid = paint(
        fill(new_grid, 1, toindices(mapply(lambda loc: dneighbors(loc[1]), obj))), 
        obj
    )
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to other versions, it identifies the objects.
2. **One-liner Expansion:** It condenses the object expansion logic into a single line. It gets the neighboring cells using `dneighbors`, applies this to all object cells using `mapply`, converts them to indices, fills those indices with '1' in the new grid, and paints the original object back.


These programs, although inspired by the given examples, provide different approaches to achieve the required transformation using various DSL functions. Each version highlights the flexibility and diverse ways to achieve the same outcome within the constraints of the DSL.
