## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying non-background objects and expanding them by one cell in all directions, but only filling in cells that were initially background (value 0). This creates a one-cell border around each object.

**Input 0:**

- The objects (2 and 6) are identified.
- A border of 1s is added around each object.
- Note how the border doesn't overwrite existing non-zero values.

**Input 1:**

- Similar to Input 0, borders are added around the 2s, 3, and 8.

**Input 2:**

- The object (2) is identified.
- A border of 1s is added, extending to the top and bottom edges.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve this transformation:

**Version 1:** (Inspired by Program_B's iterative approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    changed = set()
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I)):
            if index(I, (i, j)) != 0:  # If cell is part of an object
                for di in range(-1, 2):
                    for dj in range(-1, 2):
                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                        if 0 <= ni < height(I) and 0 <= nj < width(I) and index(I, (ni, nj)) == 0:
                            changed.add((ni, nj))
    return fill(I, 1, frozenset(changed))
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterates through each cell of the grid.
2. If the cell is not background (value != 0), it iterates through its 8 neighboring cells.
3. If a neighbor is background (value == 0), its coordinates are added to the `changed` set.
4. Finally, the grid is filled with 1s at the indices stored in `changed`.

**Version 2:** (Using DSL functions for a more concise solution)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expanded_objs = apply(lambda obj: toindices(obj) | dneighbors(centerofmass(obj)), objs)
  expansion_area = mfilter(expanded_objs, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < height(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < width(I) and index(I, loc) == 0)
  return fill(I, 1, expansion_area)
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identifies all non-background objects using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. For each object:
   - Calculates its center of mass using `centerofmass(obj)`.
   - Finds the indices of its directly adjacent neighbors using `dneighbors(...)`.
   - Combines the object's indices and its neighbors' indices.
3. Filters the combined indices to keep only those within the grid bounds and having the value 0 in the original grid.
4. Fills the identified cells with 1.

**Version 3:** (Leveraging `delta` for bordering cells)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    expansion_area = mfilter(apply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), objs), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0)
    return fill(I, 1, expansion_area)
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identifies objects in the grid.
2. For each object:
   - Finds the bordering cells using `delta(toindices(obj))`.
3. Collects all bordering cells and filters them, keeping only those with value 0 in the original grid.
4. Fills the selected bordering cells with value 1.

**Version 4:** (Combining objects for a single `delta` call)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    combined_objects = merge(objects(I, T, F, T))
    expansion_area = delta(toindices(combined_objects))
    return fill(I, 1, frozenset((i, j) for i, j in expansion_area if 0 <= i < height(I) and 0 <= j < width(I) and index(I, (i, j)) == 0))
```

**Explanation:**

1. Merges all non-background objects into a single object.
2. Finds the bordering cells of the combined object using `delta`.
3. Filters the bordering cells, keeping only valid indices within the grid bounds and having value 0 in the original grid.
4. Fills the selected bordering cells with value 1.

**Version 5:** (Directly iterating over object cells)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        for _, (i, j) in obj:
            for di in range(-1, 2):
                for dj in range(-1, 2):
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < height(I) and 0 <= nj < width(I) and index(I, (ni, nj)) == 0:
                        I = fill(I, 1, {(ni, nj)})
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterates over each object.
2. For each cell in the object, it iterates over its 8 neighboring cells.
3. If a neighbor is within grid bounds and has value 0, it's filled with 1.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
