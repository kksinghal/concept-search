## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on extending a "trail" of `1`s from each non-background object towards the right edge of the grid. 

**Specific Observations:**

* **Input_0:** The `2`s have a trail of `1`s extending to the right edge of the grid.
* **Input_1:** Similarly, the `2`s and `8` have trails of `1`s to the right edge, but there's also a single `1` extending downwards from the bottom left corner of the bottom `2`.
* **Input_2:**  The `2` has a trail of `1`s to the right edge and a single `1` extending downwards. This suggests the trail also extends downwards if the object is touching the bottom edge.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, True) # Extract non-background objects
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      for k in range(j + 1, w): # Extend trail from j+1 to right edge
        grid = fill(grid, 1, {(i, k)})
      if i == h - 1: # Extend downwards if touching bottom
        for k in range(i + 1, h):
          grid = fill(grid, 1, {(k, j)})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identifies all non-background objects.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** For each cell in each object:
   - Extends a trail of `1`s horizontally from the cell's column to the grid's right edge.
   - If the cell is on the bottom row, extends a trail of `1`s downwards to the grid's bottom edge.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if grid[i][j] != mostcommon(grid): # If cell is not background
        grid = fill(grid, 1, product({i}, range(j+1, w))) # Horizontal trail
        if i == h - 1:
          grid = fill(grid, 1, product(range(i+1, h), {j})) # Vertical trail
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Grid:**  Examines each cell in the grid.
2. **Non-Background Action:** If the cell isn't the background color:
   - Fills a horizontal line of `1`s from the cell's right edge to the grid's right edge.
   - If the cell is on the bottom row, fills a vertical line of `1`s from the cell's bottom edge to the grid's bottom edge.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  trail = lambda i, j: frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j + 1, w)) # Horizontal trail function
  return paint(grid, merge([recolor(1, trail(i,j)) for i in range(h) for j in range(w) if grid[i][j] != mostcommon(grid)] +
                           [recolor(1, {(k, j)}) for i in range(h) for j in range(w) if grid[i][j] != mostcommon(grid) and i == h - 1 for k in range(i + 1, h)])) # Apply trails
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Trail Function:** Defines a lambda function `trail` to generate indices for a horizontal trail of `1`s.
2. **Apply Trails:** Iterates through the grid and for each non-background cell, creates horizontal and (if applicable) vertical trails using `trail` and `recolor` and paints them onto the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for j in range(len(grid[0])-1, 0, -1): # Iterate columns right-to-left
    for i in range(len(grid)):
      if grid[i][j] == 1: # If a '1' is found
        grid = fill(grid, 1, {(i, k) for k in range(j, len(grid[0]))}) # Fill rightwards from that point
  for i in range(len(grid)-1, 0, -1): # Iterate rows bottom-to-top
    if grid[i][0] == 1: # If a '1' is found on the left edge
      grid = fill(grid, 1, {(k, 0) for k in range(i, len(grid))}) # Fill downwards from that point
  return grid 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Horizontal Trails:** Iterates through the grid columns right-to-left. If it finds a `1`, it fills a horizontal line of `1`s to the right edge of the grid from that point onwards.
2. **Vertical Trails:** Iterates through the leftmost column bottom-to-top. If it finds a `1`, it fills a vertical line of `1`s downwards to the bottom edge of the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    def extend_trail(i, j):
        return frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j, w)) 
    trails = [extend_trail(i, j) for i in range(h) for j in range(w) if grid[i][j] != mostcommon(grid)] 
    return paint(grid, recolor(1, merge(trails)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_trail` Function:** Defines a function `extend_trail` that, given a starting position, generates indices for a horizontal trail to the right edge of the grid.
2. **Generate Trails:** Creates a list `trails` by applying `extend_trail` to every non-background cell's coordinates.
3. **Paint Trails:** Merges all trails in the `trails` list and paints them onto the grid using the color `1`.
