## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- Identify all non-zero digits in the input grid.
- Replace all zero-valued cells connected to a non-zero digit with the value '1'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- Identify all non-zero digits in the input grid.
- Replace all zero-valued cells below and to the right of a non-zero digit with the value '1', effectively creating a right and downward shadow effect.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- Identify all non-zero digits in the input grid.
- Surround all non-zero digits with a border of '1's, except where the border would extend beyond the grid boundaries.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  filled_grid = grid
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      filled_grid = fill(filled_grid, 1, dneighbors((i, j)))
  return filled_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  We start by identifying all objects (connected components of non-zero digits) in the grid using `objects(grid, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** For each object, we iterate over its cells. For each cell, we get its directly adjacent neighbors using `dneighbors((i, j))` and fill them with '1' using `fill(grid, 1, neighbors)`.
3. **Return Filled Grid:** Finally, we return the modified grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  new_grid = list(list(row) for row in grid)
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if grid[i][j] != 0:
        for k in range(i, h):
          if j+1 < w:
            new_grid[k][j+1] = 1
        for k in range(j, w):
          if i+1 < h:
            new_grid[i+1][k] = 1
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Modifiable Grid:** Create a new grid that's a copy of the input grid but modifiable.
2. **Iterate and Shadow:** Iterate over each cell. If a cell is non-zero, iterate downwards and rightwards from that cell, setting each cell to '1'.
3. **Return Modified Grid:** Finally, return the modified grid.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  filled_grid = grid
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      neighbors = {(i - 1, j), (i + 1, j), (i, j - 1), (i, j + 1)}
      h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
      valid_neighbors = {(x, y) for x, y in neighbors if 0 <= x < h and 0 <= y < w}
      filled_grid = fill(filled_grid, 1, valid_neighbors)
  return filled_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1, identify objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate, Filter, and Fill:** Iterate over each object's cells. For each cell, get its four direct neighbors. Filter these neighbors to keep only those within the grid boundaries. Fill the valid neighbors with '1'.
3. **Return Filled Grid:** Return the modified grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  new_grid = canvas(1, shape(grid))
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != 0:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, val, {(i, j)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** Create a new grid filled entirely with '1's using `canvas(1, shape(grid))`.
2. **Copy Non-Zeros:** Iterate over the input grid. If a cell is non-zero, fill the corresponding cell in the new grid with the original value.
3. **Return Modified Grid:** Return the modified grid.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    def in_bounds(i, j):
        return 0 <= i < len(grid) and 0 <= j < len(grid[0])

    new_grid = list(list(row) for row in grid)
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[i][j] != 0:
                for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if in_bounds(ni, nj) and grid[ni][nj] == 0:
                        new_grid[ni][nj] = 1
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Modifiable Grid:** Similar to Version 2, create a modifiable copy of the input grid.
2. **Define Boundary Check:** Define a helper function `in_bounds` to check if a given cell index is within the grid's boundaries.
3. **Iterate and Fill Neighbors:** Iterate over each cell in the grid. If the cell is non-zero, get its four direct neighbors. For each neighbor, if it's within the grid boundaries and has a value of 0, set its value in the new grid to 1.
4. **Return Modified Grid:** Return the modified grid.
