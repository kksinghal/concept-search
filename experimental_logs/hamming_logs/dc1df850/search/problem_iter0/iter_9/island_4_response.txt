## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying non-zero digits in the input grid and extending a "trail" of 1s horizontally to the right until it encounters another non-zero digit. Let's break it down for each example:

**Input 0:**

- The '2' on the first row extends a trail of 1s to its right.
- The '2' on the second row extends a trail of 1s to its right.
- The '6' on the fourth row doesn't extend a trail as there are no 0s to its right.

**Input 1:**

- The '2' on the first row extends a trail of 1s to its right.
- The '3' on the third row doesn't extend a trail as there are no 0s to its right.
- The '8' on the fifth row doesn't extend a trail as there are no 0s to its right.
- The '2' on the seventh row extends a trail of 1s to its right.

**Input 2:**

- The '2' on the second row extends a trail of 1s to its right.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL provided in `dsl.py`:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def trail(i, j):
    if index(I, (i, j)) != 0:
        for k in range(j + 1, width(I)):
          if index(I, (i, k)) == 0:
            I = fill(I, 1, {(i, k)})
          else:
            break
    return I
  return tuple(tuple(trail(i, j) for j in range(width(I))) for i in range(height(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

- It iterates over each cell in the grid using nested loops.
- For each cell, if its value is not 0:
    - It iterates over the cells to its right.
    - If a cell is 0, it fills it with 1.
    - If a non-zero cell is encountered, the loop breaks.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def htrail(i, j):
    return frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j, width(I)) if index(I, (i, k)) == 0)
  trails = mfilter(prapply(htrail, range(height(I)), range(width(I))), lambda x: len(x) > 0)
  return fill(I, 1, merge(trails))
```

**Explanation:**

- `htrail` function: Given a starting position, it returns a set of indices representing a horizontal line of 0s to the right.
- `prapply` applies `htrail` to all cell positions, generating potential trails.
- `mfilter` filters out empty trails and merges the remaining indices.
- Finally, it fills the merged trail indices with 1s in the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def trail_end(i, j):
    if index(I, (i, j)) != 0:
      k = j + 1
      while k < width(I) and index(I, (i, k)) == 0:
        k += 1
      return i, k - 1
    return None
  trails = mfilter(prapply(trail_end, range(height(I)), range(width(I))), lambda x: x is not None)
  return fill(I, 1, merge(apply(lambda x: connect((x[0], x[1] + 1), x), trails)))
```

**Explanation:**

- `trail_end` function: Finds the rightmost end of a potential trail starting from a given position.
- It uses `prapply` and `mfilter` similarly to version 2 to identify trail ends.
- For each trail end, it uses `connect` to generate the trail indices.
- Finally, it fills the merged trail indices with 1s.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_fill(row):
    for j in range(1, len(row)):
      if row[j] == 0 and row[j-1] != 0:
        row = row[:j] + tuple(1 for _ in range(len(row) - j))
        break
    return row
  return tuple(right_fill(row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

- It iterates through each row in the grid.
- For each row:
    - It iterates through each cell starting from the second cell.
    - If it encounters a 0 preceded by a non-zero, it fills the rest of the row with 1s and breaks the loop.
- Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def htrail(i, j):
        if I[i][j] != 0:
            k = j + 1
            while k < width(I) and I[i][k] == 0:
                I = fill(I, 1, {(i, k)})
                k += 1
        return I
    return tuple(tuple(htrail(i, j) for j in range(width(I))) for i in range(height(I)))

```

**Explanation:**

- It utilizes nested loops to traverse each cell in the grid.
- `htrail` function: If a cell is non-zero, it extends a trail of 1s to the right until a non-zero cell is encountered.
- The function directly modifies the grid during iteration, leading to the desired transformation.
