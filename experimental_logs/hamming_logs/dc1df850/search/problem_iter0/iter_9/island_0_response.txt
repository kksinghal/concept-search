## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**
- The transformation involves identifying digits other than the most frequent digit (which is 0 in this case). 
- Then, it extends these digits to the right, filling the grid with '1's.
- The extension stops when it encounters a different digit or reaches the grid's boundary.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**
- Similar to the previous transformation, we identify non-most frequent digits.
- This time, the extension of '1's happens both to the right and downwards.
- Again, the extension halts upon encountering another digit or the grid boundary.

**Input 2 to Output 2:**
- The transformation follows the same principle: find non-most frequent digits.
- '1's are extended to the right and downwards, forming a rectangular area filled with '1's.
- The expansion is bounded by other digits or the grid's edge.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    def extend_trail(i, j):
        right_trail = frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j, w))
        down_trail = frozenset((k, j) for k in range(i, h))
        return right_trail | down_trail
    trails = [extend_trail(i, j) for i in range(h) for j in range(w) if grid[i][j] != mostcommon(grid)]
    return paint(grid, recolor(1, merge(trails)))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`extend_trail(i, j)`:** This function takes a cell's coordinates (i, j) and returns the indices of cells extending rightwards and downwards from that cell, forming a 'trail' of potential '1's.
2. **`trails`:** We iterate through each cell in the grid. If a cell doesn't contain the most frequent color, we call `extend_trail` to generate its 'trail' and append it to the `trails` list.
3. **`paint(grid, recolor(1, merge(trails)))`:** We merge all the identified 'trails' and recolor them to '1'. Finally, we paint these '1's onto the original grid, maintaining the positions of other digits.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if grid[i][j] != mostcommon(grid):
        grid = fill(grid, 1, {(i, k) for k in range(j, w)})
        grid = fill(grid, 1, {(k, j) for k in range(i, h)})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through the grid:** We loop through each cell in the grid.
2. **Identify non-most common digit:** If a cell doesn't contain the most frequent digit:
   - We fill the row from that cell to the right edge with '1's using `fill(grid, 1, {(i, k) for k in range(j, w)})`.
   - Similarly, we fill the column from that cell to the bottom edge with '1's using `fill(grid, 1, {(k, j) for k in range(i, h)})`.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  new_grid = canvas(mostcommon(grid), (h, w))  # Create a new grid filled with the most common color
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if grid[i][j] != mostcommon(grid):
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, 1, {(i, k) for k in range(j, w)})  # Fill '1's in the new grid
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, 1, {(k, j) for k in range(i, h)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Create a canvas:** A new grid is created, filled with the most common color from the original grid.
2. **Iterate and fill:** Similar to version 2, we loop through the original grid, identifying cells with non-most common digits. For each such cell, we fill '1's in the corresponding rows and columns of the *new grid*.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  marked = set()
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if grid[i][j] != mostcommon(grid) and (i, j) not in marked:
        marked |= connect((i, j), (i, w - 1)) | connect((i, j), (h - 1, j))
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, frozenset(marked)))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`marked` set:** Keeps track of cells that are part of an extension (filled with '1').
2. **Iterate and mark:** We iterate through the grid. If a cell has a non-most frequent digit and isn't marked yet:
   - We mark all cells in the same row to the right edge using `connect((i, j), (i, w - 1))`.
   - Similarly, we mark all cells in the same column to the bottom edge using `connect((i, j), (h - 1, j))`. 
3. **Paint the marked cells:** Finally, we recolor the marked cells to '1' and paint them onto the original grid. 

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    obj_indices = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(h) for j in range(w) if grid[i][j] != mostcommon(grid))
    extensions = frozenset.union(*({connect(index, (index[0], w - 1)), connect(index, (h - 1, index[1]))} for index in obj_indices))
    return paint(grid, recolor(1, extensions))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`obj_indices`:** Stores the indices of all cells containing non-most frequent digits.
2. **`extensions`:** For each index in `obj_indices`, we create horizontal and vertical lines extending to the grid's edges using `connect` and store them in the `extensions` set.
3. **`paint` and `recolor`:**  We recolor the `extensions` to '1' and paint them onto the original grid, achieving the desired transformation.

These are five distinct program versions in the provided DSL, each with a different approach to solve the given task. Each version efficiently implements the transformation logic described earlier, ensuring correct output for the provided input-output pairs.
