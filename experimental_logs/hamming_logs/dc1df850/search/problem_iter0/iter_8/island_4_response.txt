## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying non-zero digits in the input grid and extending a "trail" of 1s horizontally to the right. This trail continues until it encounters another non-zero digit or reaches the edge of the grid. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The '2' in the first row extends a trail of '1s' to the right. Similarly, the '2' in the second row and '6' in the fourth row extend their own trails.
* **Input_1:** The '2's in the first and seventh rows, the '3' in the third row, and the '8' in the fifth row each create their own horizontal trails of '1s'. 
* **Input_2:**  The '2' in the second row extends a trail of '1s'.  Notice how the trail stops before the right edge of the grid due to the presence of another non-zero digit.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def trail(i, j):
    if I[i][j] != 0:
      k = j + 1
      while k < width(I) and I[i][k] == 0:
        I = fill(I, 1, {(i, k)})
        k += 1
    return I
  return tuple(tuple(trail(i, j) for j, _ in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(I))

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`trail(i, j)` function:** 
   - Takes the row (`i`) and column (`j`) of a cell as input.
   - If the cell is non-zero, it iterates to the right (`k = j + 1`) as long as it encounters zero values within the grid's bounds.
   - For each zero encountered, it fills the cell with '1' using the `fill` function.
2. **Main program:**
   - Iterates through each cell of the grid using nested loops.
   - Applies the `trail` function to each cell.
   - Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def trail_indices(i, j):
    if I[i][j] != 0:
      return frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j + 1, width(I)) if I[i][k] == 0)
    return frozenset()
  indices = merge(prapply(trail_indices, range(height(I)), range(width(I))))
  return fill(I, 1, indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`trail_indices(i, j)` function:**
   - If the cell at (i, j) is non-zero, it generates a set of indices representing the trail of zeros to the right. 
   - Otherwise, it returns an empty set.
2. **Main program:**
   - Uses `prapply` to apply `trail_indices` to every cell's indices and merges the resulting index sets using `merge`.
   - Fills all the collected indices with '1' using a single `fill` operation.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val != 0:
                O = fill(O, 1, {(i, k) for k in range(j + 1, width(I)) if I[i][k] == 0})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Main program:**
   - Iterates through each cell in the grid.
   - If a cell is non-zero, it calculates the indices of the trail to the right within the same row.
   - Uses `fill` to replace the zero values in those indices with '1s' in a single operation. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_right(obj):
    return frozenset((color(obj), (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j + 1 < width(I) and I[i][j + 1] == 0)
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(extend_right, objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_right(obj)` function:**
   - Takes an object (set of cells with the same value) as input.
   - For each cell in the object, it checks if it can extend to the right (within grid bounds and if the right cell is zero). 
   - If it can, it creates a new cell with the same color as the object, shifted one position to the right.
2. **Main program:**
   - Extracts all objects from the grid using `objects`.
   - Applies `extend_right` to each object, generating sets of extended cells.
   - Merges all extended cells using `merge` and paints them onto the original grid using `paint`. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def htrail(i, j):
    line = {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))}
    return toindices(intersection(line, ofcolor(I, 0)))
  trails = merge(prapply(htrail, range(height(I)), range(width(I))))
  return fill(I, 1, trails)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`htrail(i, j)` function:** 
   - Creates a horizontal line of indices starting from (i, j) and extending to the right edge.
   - Finds the intersection of this line with the indices of all zero-valued cells in the grid using `ofcolor(I, 0)`. 
   - Returns the indices representing the trail of zeros. 
2. **Main program:**
   - Applies `htrail` to all cell indices using `prapply`, merging the resulting trail indices.
   - Fills all the collected trail indices with '1' using `fill`.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, offering various levels of efficiency and readability.
