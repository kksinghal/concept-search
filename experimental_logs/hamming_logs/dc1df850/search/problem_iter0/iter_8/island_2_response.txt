## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying objects with the color '2' and extending them horizontally to the right until they reach the right edge of their bounding box. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**
- The '2' at (0,0) is extended rightwards, filling the row with '1's.
- The '2' at (1,3) is similarly extended.

**Input_1:**
- The '2' at (0,7) is extended leftwards, filling the row with '1's. 
- The '2' at (6,2) is extended rightwards.

**Input_2:**
- The '2' at (1,1) is extended both leftwards and rightwards.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  def extend_right(obj):
    if color(obj) != 2:
      return obj
    start_j = leftmost(obj)
    end_j = rightmost(backdrop(obj))
    fill_indices = frozenset((i, j) for i, j in backdrop(obj) if j >= start_j and j <= end_j)
    return recolor(1, fill_indices)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(extend_right, objs))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  We get all objects in the input using `objects(I, T, T, T)`.
2. **Extend Right Function:** `extend_right` processes each object. 
   - If the object's color is not 2, it's returned unchanged.
   - Otherwise:
     - We find the starting and ending column indices for filling.
     - We create a set of indices within the object's bounding box, from the starting column to the right edge.
     - We recolor these indices to '1' and return the modified object.
3. **Apply and Paint:**  We apply `extend_right` to all objects, merge them, and paint the result onto the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_object(obj):
    if color(obj) != 2:
      return obj
    bbox = backdrop(obj)
    fill_area = frozenset((i, j) for i, j in bbox if j >= leftmost(obj))
    return recolor(1, fill_area)

  modified_objects = apply(process_object, objects(I, T, T, T))
  return paint(I, merge(modified_objects))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`process_object` Function:** This function handles each object:
   - Ignores objects not of color '2'.
   - Determines the object's bounding box.
   - Creates a fill area within the bounding box, starting from the object's leftmost point and extending to the right edge.
   - Recolors the fill area to '1'.
2. **Apply and Paint:** The `process_object` function is applied to all objects, the results are merged, and painted onto the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_object(obj):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      right_edge = rightmost(backdrop(obj))
      return recolor(1, frozenset((i, j) for i, j in backdrop(obj) if j <= right_edge and j >= leftmost(obj)))
    return obj

  return paint(I, merge(apply(extend_object, objects(I, T, T, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_object` Function:**
   - Checks if the object's color is '2'.
   - If so, it gets the rightmost column of the object's bounding box.
   - It then recolors all cells within the bounding box from the object's leftmost point to the right edge to '1'.
   - If the color isn't '2', the object is returned unchanged.
2. **Apply, Merge, and Paint:**  The `extend_object` function is applied to all objects, the modified objects are merged, and the result is painted onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def fill_right(obj):
    if color(obj) != 2:
      return obj
    ul = ulcorner(obj)
    return recolor(1, frozenset((i, j) for i, j in backdrop(obj) if j >= ul[1]))
  return paint(I, merge(apply(fill_right, objects(I, T, T, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_right` Function:** 
   - Checks for objects of color '2'.
   - Finds the upper-left corner of the object.
   - Recolors all cells within the bounding box to the right of the upper-left corner's column index to '1'.
   - Returns the original object if its color is not '2'.
2. **Apply, Merge, Paint:** Applies the `fill_right` function to all objects, merges the results, and paints them onto the input.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  modified_objs = set()
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      min_col = leftmost(obj)
      max_col = rightmost(backdrop(obj))
      new_obj = frozenset((1, (i, j)) for i, j in backdrop(obj) if min_col <= j <= max_col)
      modified_objs.add(new_obj)
    else:
      modified_objs.add(obj)
  return paint(I, merge(modified_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Modify:** This version iterates through each object in the input.
   - If an object's color is '2':
     - It finds the leftmost and rightmost column indices of the object's bounding box.
     - It creates a new object with color '1' covering the area from the leftmost to the rightmost column within the bounding box.
     - This new object is added to the `modified_objs` set.
   - If the object's color is not '2', it is added to `modified_objs` without modification.
2. **Paint Modified Objects:** Finally, it paints all the modified objects onto the input grid.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation, demonstrating the flexibility of the DSL.
