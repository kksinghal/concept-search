## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying non-zero digits in the input grid and then extending lines horizontally and vertically from these digits until they hit other non-zero digits or the edge of the grid. However, there is a key constraint: the horizontal line should only extend towards the right, and the vertical line should only extend downwards. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**
* The '2' at (0,0) extends a line rightwards to the edge and downwards until it hits the '6'.
* The '2' at (1,3) extends a line rightwards to the edge and downwards to the edge.
* The '6' at (3,1) doesn't extend any lines as it's already touching other non-zero digits.

**Input_1:**
* The '2' at (0,7) extends a line downwards until it hits the other '2'.
* The '3' doesn't extend any lines.
* The '8' doesn't extend any lines.
* The '2' at (6,2) extends a line rightwards and downwards to the edge.

**Input_2:**
* The '2' at (1,1) extends a line rightwards and downwards to the edge.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each with an explanation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = height(grid), width(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != 0:
        right_line = connect((i, j), (i, w - 1))
        down_line = connect((i, j), (h - 1, j))
        new_grid = paint(fill(fill(new_grid, 1, right_line), 1, down_line), {(val, (i, j))})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create a new grid (`new_grid`) filled with zeros, having the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. **Iteration:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
3. **Line Extension:** For each non-zero cell, create two lines: `right_line` extending to the right edge and `down_line` extending to the bottom edge.
4. **Painting:** Fill the `new_grid` with '1's along the `right_line` and `down_line`. Finally, paint the original value of the cell from the input grid onto the `new_grid`. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = height(grid), width(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != 0:
        for k in range(j, w):
          new_grid = fill(new_grid, 1, {(i, k)})
        for k in range(i, h):
          new_grid = fill(new_grid, 1, {(k, j)})
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(val, (i, j))})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Iteration:** Similar to Version 1.
3. **Line Extension:** Instead of using `connect`, this version iterates from the current cell's column to the right edge (`j` to `w`) and fills '1's horizontally. Similarly, it iterates from the current cell's row downwards (`i` to `h`) and fills '1's vertically. 
4. **Painting:** Similar to Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = height(grid), width(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != 0:
        new_grid = paint(fill(new_grid, 1, product(range(i, h), range(j, w))), {(val, (i, j))})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Iteration:** Similar to previous versions.
3. **Line Extension:** This version leverages the `product` function to generate all index pairs within the rectangle starting from the current cell and extending to the bottom-right corner. It fills this entire rectangle with '1's.
4. **Painting:** Similar to previous versions.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = height(grid), width(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for obj in objects(grid, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    i, j = ulcorner(obj)
    val = next(iter(obj))[0]
    new_grid = paint(fill(fill(new_grid, 1, connect((i, j), (i, w - 1))), 1, connect((i, j), (h - 1, j))), {(val, (i, j))})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Object Identification:** Instead of iterating through all cells, this version identifies objects (connected components) in the grid using `objects`.
3. **Line Extension and Painting:** For each object, it finds the upper-left corner (`ulcorner`) and extends lines horizontally and vertically from that point, similar to Version 1. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = height(grid), width(grid)
  new_grid = grid
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if new_grid[i][j] != 0:
        for k in range(j + 1, w):
          if new_grid[i][k] == 0:
            new_grid = fill(new_grid, 1, {(i, k)})
          else:
            break
        for k in range(i + 1, h):
          if new_grid[k][j] == 0:
            new_grid = fill(new_grid, 1, {(k, j)})
          else:
            break
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** This version initializes `new_grid` directly with the input grid.
2. **Iteration:** Iterates through each cell.
3. **Line Extension:** For each non-zero cell, it extends the line rightwards and downwards only until it encounters another non-zero cell. This is achieved by iterating and checking the value of the next cell in each direction.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version leverages various DSL functions and strategies, making them distinct solutions rather than just minor variations.
