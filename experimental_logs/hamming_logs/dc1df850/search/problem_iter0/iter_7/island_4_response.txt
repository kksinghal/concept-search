## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (defined as connected regions of non-background digits) and expanding these objects upwards and to the right by one cell. The expansion only occurs if the expansion cell is originally the background color (0).

**Input 0:**

* The '2' object expands up and right, filling three cells with '1'.
* The '6' object does not expand as the cells above and to its right are not background.

**Input 1:**

* The '2' object expands right, filling one cell with '1'.
* The '3' object does not expand.
* The '8' object does not expand.
* A new object '1' is formed below the '8' due to the expansion of an unseen object in the original input.

**Input 2:**

* The '2' object expands up and right, filling three cells with '1'.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def expand_right(obj):
    return {(v, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j + 1 < width(I) and I[i][j+1] == 0}
  
  def expand_up(obj):
    return {(v, (i - 1, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if i - 1 >= 0 and I[i-1][j] == 0}
  
  expanded_objs = mfilter(objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True), expand_right) | \
                  mfilter(objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True), expand_up)
  
  return paint(fill(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 1, expanded_objs), asobject(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`expand_right(obj)` and `expand_up(obj)`:** These functions take an object and return a set of cells representing the object's expansion to the right and up respectively. They only include cells that are within the grid bounds and contain the background color (0).
2. **`expanded_objs`:** This line identifies all objects in the grid and applies both expansion functions using `mfilter`. The results are then combined using set union (`|`).
3. **`paint(...)`:** A new canvas filled with the background color is created. Then, the `expanded_objs` are filled with '1' and finally, the original objects are painted back onto the canvas.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def expand_object(obj):
    expansion = set()
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      for di, dj in [(0,1),(1,0)]:
        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
        if 0 <= ni < height(I) and 0 <= nj < width(I) and I[ni][nj] == 0:
          expansion.add((v, (ni, nj)))
    return expansion
    
  expanded_objs = mfilter(objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True), expand_object)
  return paint(fill(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 1, expanded_objs), asobject(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`expand_object(obj)`:** This function iterates through each cell of an object and checks its right and upper neighbor. If the neighbor is within the grid bounds and contains the background color (0), it is added to the expansion set.
2. **`expanded_objs`:**  This line identifies all objects and applies the `expand_object` function using `mfilter`, gathering all expanded cells.
3. **`paint(...)`:** Similar to Version 1, a new canvas is created, expanded cells are filled with '1', and original objects are painted back on.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_border(obj):
    return {(v, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j + 1 < width(I) and I[i][j+1] == 0}

  def top_border(obj):
    return {(v, (i - 1, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if i - 1 >= 0 and I[i-1][j] == 0}

  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True):
    O = fill(O, 1, right_border(obj) | top_border(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`right_border(obj)` and `top_border(obj)`:**  Similar to previous versions, these functions identify the right and top bordering cells of an object that are background.
2.  Instead of creating a new canvas, this version iterates through each object in the input grid.
3. For each object, it identifies the right and top bordering background cells and fills them with '1' directly on the original grid.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def expand_area(i, j):
    if I[i][j] != 0:
      if j + 1 < width(I) and I[i][j+1] == 0:
        I = fill(I, 1, {(i, j + 1)})
      if i - 1 >= 0 and I[i-1][j] == 0:
        I = fill(I, 1, {(i - 1, j)})
    return I

  return tuple(tuple(expand_area(i,j) for j, _ in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`expand_area(i, j)`:** This function takes the indices of a cell. If the cell is not background, it checks its right and upper neighbor. If the neighbor is within grid bounds and contains background, it is filled with '1'. 
2. The program iterates through each cell of the grid and applies the `expand_area` function.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def expand_object(obj):
    return {(v, (i + di, j + dj)) for v, (i, j) in obj for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0)] 
            if 0 <= i + di < height(I) and 0 <= j + dj < width(I) and I[i + di][j + dj] == 0}

  return paint(I, merge(apply(expand_object, objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`expand_object(obj)`:** This function expands an object by one cell to the right and up, checking for grid boundaries and background color.
2. All objects in the grid are identified, and the `expand_object` function is applied to each object.
3. The expanded cells are merged and painted directly onto the original input grid.

These five versions demonstrate diverse ways to achieve the desired transformation using various DSL function combinations and logic. They highlight the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
