## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be expanding the boundaries of all non-background objects by one cell with the value '1'. However, the expansion only happens downwards and to the right. 

**Example:**

Input:
```
0 0 2 0
0 2 0 0
0 0 0 0 
```

Output:
```
0 0 2 0
0 2 1 0
0 1 1 0 
```

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

- The object formed by '2's expands downwards and rightwards by one cell, filling those cells with '1'.
- The object formed by '6' doesn't expand as it's on the bottom edge.

**Input_1:**

- The objects formed by '2', '3', and '8' expand downwards and rightwards by one cell, filling those cells with '1'.

**Input_2:**

- The object formed by '2' expands downwards and rightwards by one cell, filling those cells with '1'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program `Program_to_be_generated` that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    expanded_indices = mpapply(lambda o: mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0] + 1, loc[1]), (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)}, toindices(o)), objs)
    return fill(I, 1, expanded_indices - toindices(objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objs = objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies all non-background objects.
2. **Expand Indices:** `expanded_indices = ...`  calculates the indices to be filled. For each object, it takes its indices, generates the indices one step down and one step right, and merges them.
3. **Fill Grid:** `return fill(I, 1, expanded_indices - toindices(objs))` fills the `expanded_indices` with '1', excluding the original object indices.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda o: recolor(1, shift(toindices(o), DOWN)), objects(I, True, False, True)) | apply(lambda o: recolor(1, shift(toindices(o), RIGHT)), objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies non-background objects.
2. **Shift and Recolor:**  For each object:
    - `shift(toindices(o), DOWN)` shifts the object's indices one cell down.
    - `recolor(1, ...)` recolors the shifted indices to '1'.
    - The same logic applies for the rightward shift using `RIGHT`.
3. **Merge and Paint:** `merge(...)` combines the shifted and recolored objects. `paint(I, ...)` paints these combined objects onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  return fill(I, 1, merge(mpapply(lambda o: {(i + 1, j) for i, j in toindices(o)}, objs), mpapply(lambda o: {(i, j + 1) for i, j in toindices(o)}, objs)) - toindices(objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies non-background objects.
2. **Generate Expansion Indices:** 
   - `{(i + 1, j) for i, j in toindices(o)}`: Generates downward expansion indices for each object.
   - `{(i, j + 1) for i, j in toindices(o)}`: Generates rightward expansion indices for each object.
3. **Merge and Fill:**
   - `merge(...)` combines the downward and rightward expanded indices.
   - `fill(I, 1, ...)` fills the combined indices with '1', excluding the original object indices.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
        for i, j in toindices(obj):
            if i + 1 < height(I):
                I = fill(I, 1, {(i + 1, j)})
            if j + 1 < width(I):
                I = fill(I, 1, {(i, j + 1)})
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:**  Iterates through each non-background object in the grid.
2. **Expand Downwards and Rightwards:** For each cell within an object:
   - Checks if a cell exists below (`i + 1 < height(I)`) and fills it with '1'.
   - Checks if a cell exists to the right (`j + 1 < width(I)`) and fills it with '1'.
3. **Return Modified Grid:** Returns the grid after processing all objects.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_down = paint(canvas(1, shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda o: shift(o, DOWN), objects(I, True, False, True))))
  shifted_right = paint(canvas(1, shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda o: shift(o, RIGHT), objects(I, True, False, True))))
  return cellwise(I,  cellwise(shifted_down, shifted_right, 0), 1)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Objects:** 
   - `shifted_down`: Creates a canvas of '1's and paints the downward shifted objects onto it.
   - `shifted_right`: Creates a canvas of '1's and paints the rightward shifted objects onto it.
2. **Combine Shifted Grids:** `cellwise(shifted_down, shifted_right, 0)` combines the two shifted grids, prioritizing values from `shifted_down` and using '0' where both are '1'.
3. **Merge with Original:**  `cellwise(I, ..., 1)` combines the combined shifted grid with the original grid, prioritizing values from the original and using '1' where both are '0'.

These five programs offer distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and power of the DSL.
