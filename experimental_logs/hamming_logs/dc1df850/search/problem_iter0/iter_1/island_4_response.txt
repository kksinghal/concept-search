## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation expands non-zero valued cells horizontally to fill the empty space within their respective objects. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The '2' at (0, 0) expands rightward, filling the empty spaces until the next '2'.
* The '2' at (1, 3) expands leftward for the same reason.
* The '6' at (3, 1) does not expand as there are no empty spaces within its object.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The '2's and '8' expand to fill empty spaces within their objects.
* Notably, the '2' at (6, 2) expands downwards to fill the space below it.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The '2' expands in all directions to fill the surrounding empty space.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions in the DSL, improving upon the given programs:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify objects, no diagonals, exclude background
  def expand_object(obj):
    if len(obj) == 1:
      return obj
    else:
      first_cell = first(obj)
      last_cell = last(obj)
      return obj | frozenset((1, (i, first_cell[1][1])) for i in range(first_cell[1][0], last_cell[1][0]))
  expanded_objs = apply(expand_object, objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))  # Paint expanded cells onto original grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Like Program_A & Program_B, we start by identifying individual objects in the input grid (`objs`).
2. **Expand Object Function:** This function checks if an object has more than one cell. If so, it retrieves the first and last cells of the object and expands the object horizontally by adding cells with value '1' between them. 
3. **Apply and Paint:** The `expand_object` function is applied to each object, and the resulting expanded objects are merged and painted onto the original grid to produce the output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def expand_row(row):
    start = None
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != 0:
        if start is not None:
          row = tuple(1 if start < k < j else v for k, v in enumerate(row))
          start = None
        else:
          start = j
    return row
  O = tuple(expand_row(row) for row in I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Expand Row Function:** This function iterates through each row, identifying non-zero values. If it finds a non-zero value and `start` is not None, it fills the values between `start` and the current index with '1'.
2. **Apply to Rows:** The `expand_row` function is applied to each row in the input grid, effectively expanding the objects horizontally.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j in range(1, width(I)):
      if row[j] != 0 and row[j-1] == 0:
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j - 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Fill:** This version iterates through each cell of the grid. If a cell is non-zero and its left neighbor is zero, it fills the left neighbor with '1'. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify objects, no diagonals, exclude background
    def expand_obj(obj):
        min_j = leftmost(obj)
        max_j = rightmost(obj)
        return frozenset((1, (i, j)) for (v, (i, _)) in obj for j in range(min_j, max_j + 1))
    expanded_objs = apply(expand_obj, objs)
    O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Similar to version 1, this version identifies individual objects in the input grid.
2. **Expand Object Function:**  This function identifies the leftmost and rightmost columns of an object. It then creates a new object by placing a '1' at every position within those boundaries for each row the original object occupies.
3. **Apply and Paint:** Similar to version 1, it applies `expand_obj` to each object, merges them, and paints the result on the original grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
    rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
      for k in range(leftmost_j, rightmost_j + 1):
        if index(I, (i, k)) == 0:
          O = fill(O, 1, {(i, k)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** This version iterates through each object in the input.
2. **Find Boundaries:** It identifies the leftmost and rightmost column indices (`leftmost_j`, `rightmost_j`) of the current object.
3. **Fill Empty Space:** It iterates through each cell within the object's boundaries and checks if the cell in the original grid is empty (value 0). If it's empty, it fills that cell in the output grid with '1'.

Each of these code versions utilizes different DSL functions and logic to achieve the same transformation. They highlight the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL in solving spatial reasoning problems.
