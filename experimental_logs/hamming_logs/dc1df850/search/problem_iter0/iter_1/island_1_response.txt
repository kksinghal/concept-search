## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying objects (groups of connected non-zero digits) and then extending them horizontally to the right until they hit another object or the edge of the grid. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:**

- The '2' object at (0,0) extends rightward, filling the row with '1's.
- The '2' object at (1,3) extends rightward, filling the rest of the row with '1's. 
- The '1' filling stops when it encounters the existing '2' objects.

**Pair 1:**

- The '2' object at (0,7) extends leftward, filling with '1's.
- The '8' object at (4,6) remains unchanged as it has no space to extend.
- The '2' object at (6,2) extends both leftward and rightward, filling with '1's.

**Pair 2:**

- The '2' object at (1,1) extends both leftward and rightward, filling with '1's.

## Code Improvement:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = height(grid), width(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for obj in objects(grid, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
    rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
    color_val = color(obj)
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      for j in range(leftmost_j, rightmost_j + 1):
        if (i, j) in toindices(obj) or new_grid[i][j] == 0:
          new_grid = fill(new_grid, color_val, {(i,j)})
        else:
          break
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas (`new_grid`) with the same dimensions as the input `grid`.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each object (`obj`) in the input `grid`.
3. **Horizontal Extension:** For each object, it determines the leftmost and rightmost column indices. 
4. **Filling:**  It fills the `new_grid` with the object's color (`color_val`) horizontally, starting from the leftmost column and stopping when it encounters a non-zero value or the edge of the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = height(grid), width(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    current_color = 0
    for j in range(w):
      if grid[i][j] != 0:
        current_color = grid[i][j]
      if current_color != 0:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, current_color, {(i,j)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1, creates an empty canvas `new_grid`.
2. **Row-wise Iteration:** Iterates through the `grid` row by row.
3. **Color Tracking:**  Maintains a `current_color` variable. If it encounters a non-zero value, it updates `current_color`.
4. **Filling:** Fills the `new_grid` with the `current_color` as long as it's non-zero.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = height(grid), width(grid)
  new_grid = apply(lambda row: tuple(accumulate(row, lambda a, b: b if b != 0 else a, initial=0)), grid)
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to previous versions, creates an empty canvas `new_grid`.
2. **Functional Approach:** Uses `apply` to iterate through each row of the `grid`.
3. **Accumulation:** For each row, it uses `accumulate` to propagate the last non-zero value to the right.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(tuple(next((v for v in row if v != 0), 0) for _ in row) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **One-liner:** A more concise version using list comprehension.
2. **Row-wise Iteration:** Iterates through each row.
3. **Finding Non-zero:** Finds the first non-zero value in the row.
4. **Filling:** Replaces the entire row with the first non-zero value found. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  new_grid = [list(row) for row in grid] 
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(1,w):
      if new_grid[i][j] == 0 and new_grid[i][j-1] != 0:
        new_grid[i][j] = new_grid[i][j-1]
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Creates a nested list `new_grid` as a copy of the input `grid`.
2. **Iteration and Filling:** Iterates through the `new_grid`, and for each cell, if it's zero and the cell to its left is non-zero, it fills the current cell with the left cell's value.
3. **Conversion:** Converts the final nested list `new_grid` back to a tuple of tuples. 

Each of these program versions utilizes different DSL functions and logic to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the versatility of the provided DSL.
