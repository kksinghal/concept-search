## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on creating a "border" of 1s around objects present in the input grid. However, this border only extends downwards and to the right, stopping at the edges of existing objects or the grid boundary.

**Input 0:**

- A border of 1s is added below and to the right of the '2' at (0,0).
- The same happens for the '2' at (1,3) and '6' at (3,1).

**Input 1:**

- Similar border generation around the '2' at (0,7), '3' at (2,3), and '8' at (4,6).

**Input 2:**

-  Border generated for the '2' at (1,1).

## Program_to_be_generated:

### Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  border = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      border.update({(i+1, j), (i, j+1)})
  return fill(I, 1, border & asindices(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies all objects (connected regions of the same value) excluding the background.
2. **Generate Border:** For each cell in each object, the indices directly below and to the right are added to the `border` set.
3. **Intersect with Grid:** `border & asindices(I)` ensures only valid indices within the grid are considered.
4. **Fill Border:**  `fill(I, 1, ...)` fills the identified border indices with the value '1'.

### Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcommon(I):
        I = fill(I, 1, {(i+1, j), (i, j+1)} & asindices(I))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** The code iterates through each cell, checking if its value is different from the background (most common color).
2. **Fill on Condition:** If a non-background cell is found, the indices below and to the right are filled with '1', again using intersection to stay within grid bounds.

### Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge({recolor(1, {(i+1, j), (i, j+1)} & asindices(I)) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(width(I)) if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcommon(I)}))
```

**Explanation:**

This version condenses the logic into a single line using nested comprehensions and the `merge` function for efficient border generation and painting.

### Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def border_cell(i, j):
    return {(i+1, j), (i, j+1)} & asindices(I)
  return fill(I, 1, merge(apply(lambda c: border_cell(*c), ofcolor(I, leastcommon(I)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`border_cell` Function:** Defines a function to get valid border indices for a given cell.
2. **Find Non-Background Cells:** `ofcolor(I, leastcommon(I))` identifies indices of non-background cells (assuming least common color represents objects).
3. **Apply and Merge:** The `border_cell` function is applied to each non-background cell's index, and the resulting border indices are merged.
4. **Fill Border:**  The merged border indices are filled with '1'.

### Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_down = shift(asobject(I), (1, 0))
  shifted_right = shift(asobject(I), (0, 1))
  border = ((v, idx) for v, idx in shifted_down | shifted_right if index(I, idx) == mostcommon(I))
  return paint(I, frozenset(border))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift and Combine:** The grid is converted to an object, shifted down and right, and the results are combined.
2. **Filter Border:** The combined object is filtered to keep only cells that correspond to background cells in the original grid.
3. **Paint Border:** The filtered border cells are painted onto the original grid.

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the same transformation using different DSL function combinations and logic flow.
