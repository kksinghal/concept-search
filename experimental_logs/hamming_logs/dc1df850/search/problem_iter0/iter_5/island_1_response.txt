## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying all non-zero digits in the input grid and drawing horizontal and vertical lines of '1's extending from each non-zero digit until they encounter another non-zero digit or the grid boundary. Here's a breakdown of the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**
* The '2' at (0,0) results in a horizontal line of '1's to its right and a vertical line of '1's below it.
* Similarly, the '2' at (1,3) and '6' at (3,1) produce horizontal and vertical lines.
* Note how lines terminate when they meet another non-zero digit or reach the grid boundary.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**
* This example demonstrates the transformation on a larger grid with more scattered non-zero digits.
* Observe that each non-zero digit independently generates its horizontal and vertical lines.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**
* A smaller grid further illustrating the principle of line extension until a non-zero digit or boundary is encountered.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL, each with an explanation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = height(grid), width(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if grid[i][j] != 0:
        new_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j] 
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, 1, connect((i, j), (i, w - 1)))
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, 1, connect((i, j), (h - 1, j)))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** It initializes a new grid (`new_grid`) of the same dimensions as the input grid (`grid`) filled with zeros using `canvas(0, (h, w))`.
2. **Iteration:** It iterates through each cell of the input grid using nested loops.
3. **Non-Zero Check:** If a cell contains a non-zero value (`grid[i][j] != 0`):
    * It copies the non-zero value to the corresponding cell in the new grid (`new_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]`).
    * It draws a horizontal line of '1's from the current cell to the right edge of the grid using `fill(new_grid, 1, connect((i, j), (i, w - 1)))`.
    * It draws a vertical line of '1's from the current cell to the bottom edge of the grid using `fill(new_grid, 1, connect((i, j), (h - 1, j)))`.
4. **Return:** Finally, it returns the transformed grid (`new_grid`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = height(grid), width(grid)
  painted = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if grid[i][j] != 0:
        painted = paint(painted, recolor(1, shoot((i, j), RIGHT)))
        painted = paint(painted, recolor(1, shoot((i, j), DOWN)))
        painted = paint(painted, {(grid[i][j], (i, j))}) 
  return painted 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas (`painted`) of the same size as the input `grid`.
2. **Iteration:** Iterates over each cell in the input `grid`.
3. **Non-Zero Processing:**  If a cell value is non-zero:
    * Draws a horizontal line of '1's to the right using `shoot` and `recolor`.
    * Draws a vertical line of '1's downwards using `shoot` and `recolor`.
    * Paints the original non-zero value back onto the canvas at its original position.
4. **Return:**  Returns the modified canvas `painted`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = height(grid), width(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if grid[i][j] != 0:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, 1, connect((i, j), (i, w - 1)))
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, 1, connect((i, j), (h - 1, j)))
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(grid[i][j], (i, j))})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to version 1, but instead of directly assigning the non-zero value to the new grid, it uses the `paint` function to achieve the same.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = height(grid), width(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for obj in objects(grid, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
      new_grid = fill(new_grid, 1, connect((i, j), (i, w - 1)))
      new_grid = fill(new_grid, 1, connect((i, j), (h - 1, j)))
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(v, (i, j))})
  return new_grid 
```

**Explanation:**

This version first identifies all distinct objects in the grid using `objects` and then iterates through each object and its cells to draw the horizontal and vertical lines.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = height(grid), width(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, 1, connect((i, j), (i, w - 1)))
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, 1, connect((i, j), (h - 1, j)))
        new_grid[i][j] = val
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a slightly different iteration approach using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each cell in the grid.

Each of these programs uses a different combination of DSL functions, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the language in achieving the desired transformation.
