## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying non-background objects in the input grid and extending a "border" of value '1' around them. This border extends to the adjacent cells of the object, including diagonals.

**Example:**

Input:

```
0 0 2 0 0
0 0 2 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 
```

Output:

```
0 0 1 2 1
0 0 1 2 1
0 0 1 1 1
```

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    surrounding_indices = mapply(lambda x: neighbors(x[1]), obj)
    new_grid = underfill(new_grid, 1, surrounding_indices)
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, obj)
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We use `objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` to find all non-background objects in the input grid.
2. **Create Canvas:** We initialize a new grid `new_grid` with the same shape as the input and filled with the background color using `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`.
3. **Iterate and Expand:** We iterate over each identified object `obj`.
    - **Find Surrounding Indices:** For every cell in the object, we find its neighboring indices (including diagonals) using `neighbors(x[1])` and merge them using `mapply`.
    - **Fill Border:** We fill the `surrounding_indices` with the value '1' on `new_grid`, only if they are currently the background color, using `underfill`.
    - **Paint Object:** Finally, we paint the original object `obj` onto `new_grid` using `paint`, ensuring the object itself retains its original values. 
4. **Return:** The modified `new_grid` now contains the desired output with borders around the objects.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  border_indices = set()
  for obj in objs:
    border_indices.update(mapply(lambda x: neighbors(x[1]), obj))
  return paint(underfill(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 1, frozenset(border_indices)), asobject(I)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Borders:** Similar to version 1, we find all non-background objects. However, instead of iterating over them individually, we directly calculate all border indices using `mapply` and `neighbors` and store them in a `border_indices` set.
2. **One-step Fill and Paint:** We then perform the border filling and object painting in a single step:
    - `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`: Creates a new grid with the background color.
    - `underfill(..., 1, frozenset(border_indices))`: Fills the identified border indices with '1'.
    - `paint(..., asobject(I))`:  Paints the original objects from the input grid onto the modified grid.
3. **Return:** This condensed version returns the final grid with borders.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
           underfill(
               canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
               1,
               mapply(
                   neighbors, 
                   toindices(
                       merge(objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))
                   )
               )
           ),
           asobject(I)
       )
```

**Explanation:**

This version further compresses the code by combining multiple operations into nested function calls:

1. **Object Identification and Merging:**  `objects(...)` identifies the non-background objects. `merge(...)` combines all the objects into a single set of cells. 
2. **Border Calculation:** `toindices(...)` extracts the indices from the merged object, and `mapply(neighbors, ...)` finds all neighboring indices, representing the border.
3. **Grid Creation, Filling, and Painting:** These operations are similar to version 2, but written as nested function calls for conciseness.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def add_border(grid, obj):
    return underfill(grid, 1, mapply(lambda x: neighbors(x[1]), obj))
  return paint(reduce(add_border, objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))), asobject(I))
```

**Explanation:**

This version introduces a helper function and utilizes `reduce` for a functional approach:

1. **Helper Function `add_border`:** Takes a grid and an object as input and returns the grid with the border added around the object.
2. **`reduce` for Border Addition:** `reduce(add_border, ...)` iteratively applies the `add_border` function to each object identified by `objects(...)`, starting with an initial canvas created by `canvas(...)`.
3. **Painting:**  Similar to previous versions, `paint(...)` adds the original objects onto the modified grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      fill(
          canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
          1,
          difference(
              mapply(lambda x: backdrop(shift(x, (1,1))), objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)),
              mapply(lambda x: backdrop(x), objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))
          )
      ),
      asobject(I)
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version takes a different approach by calculating the border region directly:

1. **Calculate Expanded and Original Backdrops:** For each object, it calculates the `backdrop` (bounding box indices) of the object and a slightly shifted version (`shift(x, (1,1))`). 
2. **Find Difference for Border:**  The `difference` between the expanded backdrops and the original backdrops represents the border indices.
3. **Fill, Paint, and Return:** The rest of the process remains similar to previous versions - filling the border indices with '1' and then painting the original objects onto the grid. 

These five versions provide distinct approaches to solve the transformation task, demonstrating the flexibility and expressive power of the provided DSL.
