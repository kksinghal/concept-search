## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve extending lines horizontally from non-zero digits until they hit other non-zero digits or the edge of the grid. Let's break it down by input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- A horizontal line of '1's extends to the right from the '2' at (0,0) until it reaches the grid edge.
- Similarly, a horizontal line of '1's extends to the right from the '2' at (1,3).
- A vertical line of '1's extends downwards from the '2' at (1,3).

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- A horizontal line of '1's extends to the left from the '2' at (0,7) until it hits the grid edge.
-  A vertical line of '1's extends upwards from the '2' at (6,2) until it hits the grid edge.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- A horizontal line of '1's extends to the left from the '2' at (1,1) until it hits the grid edge.
-  A vertical line of '1's extends upwards from the '2' at (1,1) until it hits the grid edge. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = height(grid), width(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if grid[i][j] != 0:
        new_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]
        for k in range(j + 1, w):
          if grid[i][k] != 0:
            break
          new_grid[i][k] = 1
        for k in range(i + 1, h):
          if grid[k][j] != 0:
            break
          new_grid[k][j] = 1
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize:** Create a new grid (`new_grid`) filled with '0's, with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. **Iterate:** Loop through each cell in the input grid.
3. **Copy Non-Zeros:** If a cell in the input grid is not '0', copy its value to the corresponding cell in `new_grid`.
4. **Extend Horizontal Line:** Extend a line of '1's to the right from the non-zero cell until another non-zero cell or the edge of the grid is encountered. 
5. **Extend Vertical Line:** Extend a line of '1's downwards from the non-zero cell until another non-zero cell or the edge of the grid is encountered.
6. **Return:** Return the transformed grid (`new_grid`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = height(grid), width(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for obj in objects(grid, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    for cell in obj:
      i, j = cell[1]
      new_grid[i][j] = cell[0]
      for k in range(j + 1, w):
        if index(grid, (i, k)) != 0:
          break
        new_grid[i][k] = 1
      for k in range(i + 1, h):
        if index(grid, (k, j)) != 0:
          break
        new_grid[k][j] = 1
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses the `objects` function to identify connected components (objects) within the grid.  The logic remains similar to Version 1, but instead of iterating through individual cells, it iterates through objects and then cells within those objects.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = height(grid), width(grid)
  painted = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if grid[i][j] != 0:
        painted = paint(painted, recolor(1, shoot((i, j), RIGHT)))
        painted = paint(painted, recolor(1, shoot((i, j), DOWN)))
        painted[i][j] = grid[i][j]
  return painted
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages the `shoot` function to draw lines. It iterates through each cell, and if the cell is not '0', it paints horizontal and vertical lines of '1's originating from that cell. Finally, it overwrites the starting cell with its original value from the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = height(grid), width(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if grid[i][j] != 0:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, 1, connect((i, j), (i, w - 1)))
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, 1, connect((i, j), (h - 1, j)))
        new_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the `connect` function to draw lines between two points. For each non-zero cell, it draws a horizontal line from that cell to the right edge and a vertical line from that cell to the bottom edge. Finally, it overwrites the starting cell with its original value.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = height(grid), width(grid)
  new_grid = list(list(row) for row in grid)
  for i in range(h):
    current_val = 0
    for j in range(w):
      if grid[i][j] != 0:
        current_val = grid[i][j]
      else:
        new_grid[i][j] = current_val
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each row of the grid and maintains a `current_val` variable. If it encounters a non-zero cell, it updates `current_val`. Otherwise, it fills the cell in the `new_grid` with the `current_val`. This effectively extends horizontal lines until a new non-zero value is encountered or the edge of the grid is reached. Vertical extension is not directly implemented in this version.

Each of these program versions offers a different approach to solving the transformation problem using the provided DSL. They highlight the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for image manipulation tasks.
