## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation identifies objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid, excluding the most frequent digit (assumed to be background). It then expands these objects by one layer in all directions, filling the expanded area with the digit '1'.

**Input_0:**

* Objects: '2' and '6'
* Expansion: Both objects are expanded by one layer, filled with '1'.

**Input_1:**

* Objects: '2', '3', and '8'
* Expansion: All objects are expanded by one layer, filled with '1'.

**Input_2:**

* Object: '2'
* Expansion: The object is expanded by one layer, filled with '1'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Identify objects
  expanded_indices = mpapply(lambda o: mapply(dneighbors, toindices(o)), objs) # Expand each object by one layer
  return fill(I, 1, expanded_indices - toindices(objs)) # Fill expanded area with '1'
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` extracts objects from the input grid (`I`). `True, False, True` specifies univalued objects, no diagonal connections, and background exclusion.
2. **Expand Objects:** `mpapply(lambda o: mapply(dneighbors, toindices(o)), objs)` iterates over each object (`o`) and applies `dneighbors` to each cell's indices, effectively expanding it by one layer. `mpapply` merges the results.
3. **Fill Expanded Area:** `fill(I, 1, expanded_indices - toindices(objs))` fills the expanded indices with '1', excluding the original object indices.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(1, delta(toindices(obj))), objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1, `objects(I, True, False, True)` extracts objects from the grid.
2. **Calculate Delta:**  For each object, `delta(toindices(obj))` finds indices surrounding the object.
3. **Recolor Delta:**  `recolor(1, delta(toindices(obj)))` recolors the delta indices to '1', creating the expanded layer.
4. **Merge and Paint:**  The deltas of all objects are merged using `merge` and then painted onto the original grid with `paint`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
        for i, j in toindices(obj):
            for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
                ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                if 0 <= ni < height(I) and 0 <= nj < width(I) and index(I, (ni, nj)) == 0:
                    O = fill(O, 1, {(ni, nj)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over objects and cells**: This version iterates over each cell of each object in the input grid.
2. **Check neighbors**: For each cell, it checks its four neighbors (up, down, left, right).
3. **Fill with 1**: If a neighbor is within the grid bounds and has a value of 0, it is filled with 1.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I,  paint(canvas(1, shape(I)), merge(objects(I, True, False, True))), I)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Create Canvas:** Creates a canvas of '1's with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  **Paint Objects:** Paints all identified objects onto the canvas, essentially inverting the object-background relationship.
3.  **Cellwise Comparison:** Compares the original grid with the painted canvas cell by cell. If the cells match, the original value is kept; otherwise, the original value is used (effectively expanding the objects in the original grid).

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    expansion_area = mpapply(lambda o: outbox(toindices(o)), objs)
    return fill(I, 1, expansion_area - toindices(objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2.  **Calculate Outbox:** `outbox(toindices(o))` calculates the outer boundary of each object.
3.  **Merge and Subtract:** `mpapply` applies `outbox` to all objects and merges the result. Then, it subtracts the original object indices to get only the expansion area.
4.  **Fill Expansion Area:** `fill(I, 1, expansion_area - toindices(objs))` fills the calculated expansion area with '1'.


These versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
