## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) and then expanding those objects to the right until they encounter another object or the edge of the grid. The expansion fills the cells with the digit '1'. Let's break down each example:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The '2' at (0,0) expands rightwards, filling three cells with '1'.
- The '2' at (1,3) expands rightwards, filling one cell with '1'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The '2' at (0,7) expands leftwards, filling one cell with '1'.
- The '2' at (6,2) expands rightwards, filling three cells with '1'.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- The '2' at (1,1) expands rightwards, filling two cells with '1'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions in the provided DSL, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return paint(fill(I, 1, mpapply(lambda obj: difference(
      product(interval(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1, 1), interval(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj), 1)), 
      toindices(obj)), 
    objs)), objects(I, T, F, T))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Calculate Expansion Area:** For each object, `product(interval(...), interval(...))` generates all indices within the object's bounding box, and `difference(..., toindices(obj))` removes the object's own indices, leaving only the expansion area.
3. **Fill Expansion Area:** `mpapply(...)` applies the above logic to all objects and merges the resulting indices. `fill(I, 1, ...)` fills the merged indices with '1'.
4. **Paint Original Objects:** `paint(..., objects(I, T, F, T))` overlays the original objects back onto the filled grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, mpapply(lambda obj: recolor(1, difference(
      product(interval(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1, 1), interval(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj), 1)),
      toindices(obj))), objects(I, T, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Calculate Expansion Area:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Recolor Expansion Area:** `recolor(1, ...)` directly recolors the expansion area indices to '1'.
4. **Paint Expansion:** `mpapply(...)` applies the recoloring to all objects and merges the results. `paint(I, ...)` paints the merged expansion onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, 1, mpapply(lambda obj: difference(
      frozenset((i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for j in range(leftmost(obj), len(I[0]))),
      toindices(obj)), objects(I, T, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Calculate Expansion Area:**  This version directly iterates through the bounding box from the object's leftmost position to the grid's rightmost edge, excluding the object's own indices. 
3. **Fill Expansion Area:** Same as Version 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expansion = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      for j in range(leftmost(obj), len(I[0])):
        if (i, j) not in toindices(obj):
          expansion.add((i, j))
  return fill(I, 1, frozenset(expansion))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Iterative Expansion:** This version uses explicit loops to iterate through each object's potential expansion area and add indices to the `expansion` set.
3. **Fill Expansion Area:** `fill(I, 1, frozenset(expansion))` fills the collected expansion indices with '1'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(1, difference(
      frozenset((i, j) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(leftmost(obj), len(I[0]))),
      toindices(obj))), objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Calculate Expansion Area:**  This version simplifies the expansion calculation by considering the entire grid area to the right of each object's leftmost position. 
3. **Recolor and Paint:**  Similar to Version 2, it recolors the expansion area and then paints it onto the original grid.


These five versions showcase different approaches to achieving the desired transformation using various DSL function combinations. They demonstrate the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for tackling spatial reasoning tasks.
