## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the grid (considering connected cells of the same value as a single object) and then extending these objects to the left until they encounter another object or the grid boundary. The extension uses the value '1', except when extending an object with the value '2', in which case the extension uses the value '1'.

**Input 0:**

* The '2' object extends left with '1's.
* The '6' object remains unchanged.

**Input 1:**

* The '2' object extends left with a '1' followed by '2'.
* The '3' object remains unchanged.
* The '8' object remains unchanged.

**Input 2:**

* The '2' object extends left with '1's.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(grid):
    objs = objects(grid, True, False, False)
    for obj in objs:
        value = color(obj)
        leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
        extension_value = 1 if value != 2 else 1
        extension = frozenset(((extension_value, (i, j)) for i, j in product(range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1), range(0, leftmost_j))))
        grid = paint(grid, recolor(extension_value, extension))
    return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(grid, True, False, False)` extracts connected components (objects) from the grid.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** For each object:
    * Determine object color (`value`).
    * Find the leftmost column index (`leftmost_j`).
    * Set the `extension_value` to '1'.
    * Generate indices for the extension (`extension`).
    * Paint the extension onto the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  for j in range(1, len(grid[0])):
    for i in range(len(grid)):
      if grid[i][j] == 0:
        if j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] != 0:
          grid = paint(grid, {(1 if grid[i][j-1] != 2 else 1, (i, j))})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Columns:** The code iterates through each column from left to right (starting from the second column).
2. **Check for Empty Cells:** For each cell in the column, it checks if the cell is empty (value 0).
3. **Extend Object:** If the cell is empty and the cell to its left is part of an object (value not 0), it extends that object to the left by painting the current cell with '1' (or '1' if the object's value is '2').

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(grid):
    new_grid = tuple(tuple(1 if c == 0 and j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] != 0 else c for j, c in enumerate(r)) for i, r in enumerate(grid))
    return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **List Comprehension:** Utilizes a nested list comprehension to efficiently iterate through the grid and create a new grid.
2. **Conditional Replacement:** Within the comprehension, it checks if a cell meets the extension criteria:
    * `c == 0`: The cell is empty.
    * `j > 0`: The cell is not in the first column.
    * `grid[i][j-1] != 0`: The cell to the left is part of an object.
3. **Extension:** If the criteria are met, the cell is replaced with '1' (or '1' if the left object's value is '2'), effectively extending the object.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  return tuple(tuple(1 if cell == 0 and any(grid[i][k] != 0 for k in range(j)) else cell for j, cell in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(grid))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **List Comprehension:** Uses a nested list comprehension for efficient grid traversal and new grid creation.
2. **Conditional Extension:** For each cell, it checks if it's empty (`cell == 0`) and if there's an object to its left (`any(grid[i][k] != 0 for k in range(j))`). 
3. **Value Assignment:** If both conditions are true, the cell is replaced with '1' (or '1' if the left object's value is '2'), extending the object.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  def extend_object(i, j):
    if j > 0 and grid[i][j - 1] != 0:
      return 1 if grid[i][j - 1] != 2 else 1
    return grid[i][j]
  return tuple(tuple(extend_object(i, j) for j in range(len(grid[0]))) for i in range(len(grid)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_object` Function:** Defines a helper function to encapsulate the object extension logic. 
2. **Grid Traversal and Extension:**  The main part of the code iterates through each cell of the grid and uses the `extend_object` function to determine the new value for each cell.

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieve the desired grid transformation. They demonstrate the flexibility of the DSL and offer various ways to express the same logical operation.
