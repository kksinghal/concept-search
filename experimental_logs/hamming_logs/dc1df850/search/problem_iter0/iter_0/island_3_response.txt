## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid and then expanding them outwards by one layer with the digit '1', except when expanding into another object.

**Input_0:**
* The '2' objects are expanded with a layer of '1's.
* Note how the expansion stops at the '6' object and the grid boundaries.

**Input_1:**
* Similar to Input_0, all objects ('2', '3', and '8') are expanded with '1's.
* The expansion again respects object boundaries and grid edges.

**Input_2:**
* The single '2' object is expanded with '1's, adhering to the same rules. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL, achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T) 
    expansion_area = mfilter(apply(delta, objs), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0) 
    return fill(I, 1, expansion_area)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects (connected regions of same digit) in the input grid `I`, excluding the background (most frequent color).
2. **Find Expansion Area:** `apply(delta, objs)` finds the indices adjacent to each object.  Then, `mfilter(..., lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0)` filters these indices to keep only those with a '0' in the original grid. 
3. **Fill with '1':** `fill(I, 1, expansion_area)` fills the identified expansion area with the digit '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: backdrop(obj) - toindices(obj), objs) 
    fill_area =  mfilter(expanded_objs, lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0)
    return fill(I, 1, fill_area)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Calculate Expanded Outlines:** For each object, `backdrop(obj) - toindices(obj)` calculates the indices forming the object's outline, effectively expanding it by one layer.
3. **Filter by Background:** `mfilter(expanded_objs, lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0)` keeps only outline indices that correspond to '0's in the original grid.
4. **Fill with '1':** Similar to Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    changed = set()
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I)):
            if index(I, (i, j)) != 0:
                for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < height(I) and 0 <= nj < width(I) and index(I, (ni, nj)) == 0:
                        changed.add((ni, nj))
    return fill(I, 1, frozenset(changed))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** This version iterates directly through each cell of the grid.
2. **Check for Non-Zero:** If a cell is not '0', it explores its four direct neighbors.
3. **Fill Neighbors:** If a neighbor is '0' (background), its index is added to the `changed` set.
4. **Fill with '1':** The `changed` set, now containing all indices to be changed, is used to fill the grid with '1's.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        O = underfill(O, 1, delta(obj)) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** This version iterates through each identified object.
2. **Underfill with '1':**  For each object,  `underfill(O, 1, delta(obj))`  fills the area around the object (`delta(obj)`) with '1's only if the current value is the background color.
3. **Update Grid:** The grid is updated after processing each object.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(1, delta(obj)), objects(I, T, F, T)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Recolor Outlines:** `recolor(1, delta(obj))` recolors the indices around each object  (`delta(obj)`) to '1', creating an object representation of the expansion.
3. **Merge and Paint:** All the recoloured outlines are merged and then painted onto the original grid using `paint(I, ...)`, overwriting any existing background values. 

## Conclusion:

These five programs demonstrate different approaches to achieving the target transformation. Some focus on identifying and expanding objects, while others directly manipulate the grid cells. Each approach utilizes the provided DSL functions in a unique combination, offering diverse solutions to the problem.
