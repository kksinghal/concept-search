## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid and expanding them by one layer with the digit '1'. This expansion only occurs within the existing grid boundaries and does not affect other objects or the background (digit '0').

**Input_0:**
- The '2' at (0,0) expands to include cells (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1).
- The '2' at (1,3) expands to include cells (0,3), (1,2), and (2,3).
- The '6' at (3,1) does not expand as it's surrounded by '0'.

**Input_1:**
- The '2' at (0,7) expands to include (0,6) and (1,7).
- The '3' at (2,3) does not expand.
- The '8' at (4,6) expands to include (3,6).
- The '2' at (6,2) expands to include (5,2), (6,1), and (7,2).

**Input_2:**
- The '2' at (1,1) expands to include (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), and (2,1). 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**
```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify objects, no diagonals, exclude background
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((1, n) for loc in obj for n in dneighbors(last(obj)[1]) if index(I, n) == 0), objs)  # Expand each object with '1' if neighbor is '0'
  O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))  # Paint expanded cells onto original grid
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` finds all connected regions of the same digit in the input grid ('I'), excluding the background digit '0'. 
2. **Expand Objects:** `mapply` applies a lambda function to each object. This function:
    - Iterates through each cell ('loc') of the object.
    - For each cell, it checks its direct neighbors ('dneighbors').
    - If a neighbor cell is '0' (background), it adds a new cell with value '1' to the `expanded_objs` set.
3. **Paint Grid:** `paint` takes the original grid ('I') and the `expanded_objs` and overlays the expanded cells onto the grid.

**Program Version 2:**
```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I)):
            if I[i][j] != 0:
                for n in dneighbors((i, j)):
                    if 0 <= n[0] < height(I) and 0 <= n[1] < width(I) and I[n[0]][n[1]] == 0:
                        O = fill(O, 1, {n})
    return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through Grid:** The program iterates over each cell in the grid.
2. **Check for Non-Zero:** If the cell value is not '0', it proceeds to check its neighbors.
3. **Expand if Neighbor is Zero:** For each neighbor, if it's within the grid boundaries and its value is '0', the program fills that neighbor with '1' in the output grid ('O').

**Program Version 3:**
```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    expanded_indices = mfilter(lambda obj: frozenset(n for loc in obj for n in dneighbors(last(loc)[1]) if index(I, n) == 0), objs)
    O = fill(I, 1, expanded_indices)
    return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:**  Similar to version 1, `objects` identifies the objects within the grid.
2. **Find Expansion Indices:** `mfilter` applies a lambda function to each object and merges the results. This function:
    - Iterates over each cell in the object.
    - For each cell, it checks its direct neighbors.
    - If the neighbor is within the grid bounds and its value is '0', its index is added to the `expanded_indices` set.
3. **Fill the Grid:** `fill` takes the input grid and fills the `expanded_indices` with the value '1' to create the output grid.

**Program Version 4:**
```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      for (ni, nj) in dneighbors((i, j)):
        if 0 <= ni < height(I) and 0 <= nj < width(I) and I[ni][nj] == 0:
          O = fill(O, 1, {(ni, nj)})
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through Objects:** This version iterates directly through each object identified in the grid.
2. **Iterate through Cells:** For each cell within an object, it checks its direct neighbors.
3. **Conditional Fill:** If a neighbor is within grid boundaries and its value is '0', the program fills that neighbor cell with '1' in the output grid.

**Program Version 5:**
```python
def solve(I):
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        O = paint(O, obj)  # Paint the original object
        for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
            for (ni, nj) in dneighbors((i, j)):
                if 0 <= ni < height(I) and 0 <= nj < width(I) and I[ni][nj] == 0:
                    O = fill(O, 1, {(ni, nj)})
    return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Create Empty Canvas:** An empty canvas ('O') is created with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Paint Objects:** The program iterates through each object, painting it onto the canvas in its original location.
3. **Expand Objects:** Similar to other versions, it expands each object cell by one layer with '1' if the neighboring cell is '0'.

These are five distinct program versions that achieve the desired transformation using different logic and combinations of DSL functions. Each version provides a unique approach to solving the problem while still adhering to the DSL constraints.
