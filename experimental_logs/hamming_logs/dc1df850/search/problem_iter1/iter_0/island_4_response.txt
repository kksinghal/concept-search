## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (clusters of non-background digits) within the input grid and extending them to the right and upwards by one cell with the value '1', effectively creating a border on those sides. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The '2' at (0,0) gets extended right and up, creating a border of '1's. Similarly, the '2' at (1,3) and '6' at (3,1) get extended.
* **Input_1:** The '2's at (0,7), (6,2) and '8' at (4,6) get extended with '1's on their right and top sides. Note that the existing '1's in the input grid remain unaffected.
* **Input_2:**  The '2' at (1,1) is extended to the right and top, resulting in a border of '1's.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" in the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    O = underfill(O, 1, shift(toindices(obj), (0,1)))  # Right extension
    O = underfill(O, 1, shift(toindices(obj), (-1,0))) # Top extension
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** A new grid `O` is created with the same shape as input `I` and filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate Objects:** The code iterates through each object (non-background digit cluster) in the input grid.
3. **Paint Object:**  The current object is painted onto the new grid `O`.
4. **Extend Right:** The object's indices are shifted one cell to the right and filled with '1' using `underfill`, ensuring only background cells are changed.
5. **Extend Top:** Similar to right extension, the object's indices are shifted upwards and filled with '1'. 
6. **Return Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned as the output.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    right_border = {(v, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j + 1 < width(I)}
    top_border = {(v, (i - 1, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if i - 1 >= 0}
    O = underfill(O, 1, toindices(right_border))
    O = underfill(O, 1, toindices(top_border))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** The output grid `O` is initialized as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Objects:**  Iterate over each object in the input grid.
3. **Calculate Borders:** For each object, two sets are generated: `right_border` containing the indices of cells immediately to the right of the object and `top_border` containing indices of cells immediately above.
4. **Fill Borders:** `underfill` is used to fill '1' in the calculated border locations, only modifying cells with the background color.
5. **Return Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned as output.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        if j + 1 < len(I[0]):
          O = underfill(O, 1, ((i, j + 1),)) # Right
        if i - 1 >= 0:
          O = underfill(O, 1, ((i - 1, j),)) # Top
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Output grid `O` is initialized as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Cells:** The code iterates through each cell in the grid.
3. **Check Non-Background:** If a cell doesn't contain the background color, it proceeds.
4. **Extend Right:** If the cell has a right neighbor within the grid bounds, it fills a '1' to its right using `underfill`.
5. **Extend Top:** If the cell has a top neighbor within the grid bounds, it fills a '1' above it using `underfill`.
6. **Return Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned as the output.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    extensions = toindices(obj)
    for i,j in toindices(obj):
      extensions = insert((i, j + 1), extensions) if j + 1 < width(I) else extensions
      extensions = insert((i - 1, j), extensions) if i - 1 >= 0 else extensions
    O = underfill(O, 1, extensions)
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:**  A new grid `O` is created, filled with the background color of input `I`.
2. **Iterate Objects:** The program iterates through each object in the input grid.
3. **Calculate Extensions:** For each object, its indices are stored in `extensions`. The code iterates over each cell in the object and adds the indices of its right and top neighbors to `extensions` if they are within the grid boundaries.
4. **Fill Extensions:** `underfill` is used to paint the cells in `extensions` with '1'.
5. **Paint Object:** The original object is then painted onto the grid `O`.
6. **Return Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_right(obj):
    return {(v, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j + 1 < width(I)}
  
  def extend_top(obj):
    return {(v, (i - 1, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if i - 1 >= 0}
  
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    O = underfill(O, 1, toindices(extend_right(obj)))
    O = underfill(O, 1, toindices(extend_top(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Helper Functions:** Two helper functions are defined: `extend_right` and `extend_top`. Each takes an object and returns a set of indices representing the cells to its right or top, respectively.
2. **Initialize Output:**  The output grid `O` is initialized with the input grid `I`.
3. **Iterate Objects:** Iterate through each object in the input.
4. **Apply Extensions:** For each object, `extend_right` and `extend_top` are called. Their results are converted to indices using `toindices` and used with `underfill` to paint '1's in the corresponding locations. 
5. **Return Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned as output.
