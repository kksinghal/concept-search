## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying digits adjacent to non-zero digits and replacing them with the digit '1'. However, the replacement process should propagate horizontally from the non-zero digit, filling the row until it encounters another non-zero digit.

**Input_0:**

* The '0's to the right of '2' in the first row are replaced by '1's until the end of the row.
* Similarly, '0's to the left and right of '2' in the second row are replaced by '1's.
* The '0' to the left of '6' in the fourth row is replaced by '1'.

**Input_1:**

*  A '1' is placed to the left of '2' in the first row.
*  The '0's to the left of '2' in the second row are replaced by '1's.
*  '1's are placed on both sides of '8' in the fifth row.
*  '0's to the left of '2' in the seventh row are replaced by '1's.

**Input_2:**

* The topmost row is filled with '1's except for the last element.
* '1's are placed on both sides of '2' in the second row.
* The third row is filled with '1's except for the last element.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL provided:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    start = next((j for j, v in enumerate(row) if v != 0), len(row))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, frozenset((i, j) for j in range(start))))
    for j in range(width(I)-1, -1, -1):
      if row[j] != 0:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j))))
  return paint(O, asobject(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. Create a blank canvas `O` of the same shape as the input grid `I`.
2. Iterate through each row `i` and find the first non-zero element's index `start`.
3. Paint the canvas `O` with '1's from the beginning of the row to `start`.
4. Iterate through the row in reverse and paint '1's from the non-zero element to the beginning.
5. Finally, paint the original objects from `I` onto the canvas `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != 0:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, connect((i,0), (i,j))))
        break
    for j in range(width(I)-1, -1, -1):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != 0:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, connect((i,j), (i, width(I)-1))))
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Start with output grid `O` same as input grid `I`.
2. Iterate through each row and find the first non-zero element. 
3. Connect the starting point of row to that element with '1's.
4. Iterate in reverse and connect that element to the end of the row with '1's.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != 0:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j))))
        break
    for j in range(width(I)-1, -1, -1):
      if row[j] != 0:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j, width(I)))))
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Initialize output grid `O` with input grid `I`.
2. Iterate through each row and paint '1's from the start of the row until encountering the first non-zero element.
3. Reverse iterate through each row and paint '1's from the non-zero element until the end of the row.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    found = False
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != 0:
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, k) for k in range(j)})
        found = True
        break
    if found:
      for j in range(width(I)-1, -1, -1):
        if index(I, (i, j)) != 0:
          O = fill(O, 1, {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))})
          break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Start with output `O` equal to input `I`.
2. For each row, find the first non-zero element.
3. If found, fill the row with '1's from the beginning to that element and from that element to the end.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != 0:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, k) for k in range(j)}))
        break
    for j in range(width(I)-1, -1, -1):
      if I[i][j] != 0:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))}))
        break
  return paint(O, asobject(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. Create a blank canvas `O` of the same size as input `I`.
2. Iterate through each row, finding the first and last non-zero element.
3. Fill the row in `O` with '1's from the start to the first non-zero element and from the last non-zero element to the end.
4. Finally, paint the original objects from `I` onto the canvas `O`.

These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation while adhering to the provided DSL. Each version uses a different combination of DSL functions and logic, making them diverse solutions to the problem.
