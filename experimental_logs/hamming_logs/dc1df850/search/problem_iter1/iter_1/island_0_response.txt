## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying non-background digits in the input grid and surrounding them with a border of '1's in the output grid. However, the border is only placed on empty (background) cells and does not overwrite existing digits.  Let's analyze each example:

**Example 0:**

* **Input:**  Digits '2' and '6' are considered non-background.
* **Output:** '1's border surrounds the '2' and '6', leaving the original digit positions unchanged. Notice the border doesn't extend to the last row as those cells were not empty in the input.

**Example 1:**

* **Input:**  Digits '2', '3' and '8' are considered non-background.
* **Output:** A similar '1's border surrounds each non-background digit. The border extends downwards for the digits '2' and '8' because the cells below were empty in the input.

**Example 2:**

* **Input:**  Digit '2' is considered non-background.
* **Output:** A '1's border surrounds the '2', stopping at the grid boundaries.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Iterates through the grid, filling a border around non-background digits.
  """
  J = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) 
  for i, j in asindices(I):
    if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
      for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]:
        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
        if 0 <= ni < height(I) and 0 <= nj < width(I) and J[ni][nj] == mostcolor(I):
          J = fill(J, 1, ((ni, nj),))
      J = fill(J, I[i][j], ((i, j),)) 
  return J
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:**  Create a canvas `J` of the same size as the input `I`, filled with the background color of `I`.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** Loop through each cell of the input `I`:
    * If the cell is not the background color, iterate through its four neighbors (up, down, left, right).
    * If a neighbor is within the grid bounds and is currently the background color on canvas `J`, fill it with '1'.
    * Finally, fill the current cell on canvas `J` with the value from the input `I`, ensuring the original digit is preserved.
3. **Return Output:**  Return the modified canvas `J`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Uses object and patch manipulation to achieve the transformation.
  """
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  J = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    J = underfill(J, 1, delta(toindices(obj)))
    J = paint(J, obj)
  return J
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extract non-background objects from the input grid `I` using `objects`.
2. **Initialize Output:**  Create a blank canvas `J`.
3. **Process Objects:** For each object:
    * Find the indices surrounding the object using `delta`.
    * Fill these surrounding indices on canvas `J` with '1's, but only if they are currently the background color (`underfill`).
    * Paint the object itself onto the canvas `J`.
4. **Return Output:**  Return the modified canvas `J`.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Leverages set operations to determine border cells.
  """
  J = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i, j in asindices(I):
    if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
      neighbors = {(i+di, j+dj) for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]}
      valid_neighbors = neighbors & asindices(I)
      border = valid_neighbors - ofcolor(I, I[i][j])
      J = fill(J, 1, border)
      J = fill(J, I[i][j], ((i, j),))
  return J
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Create a blank canvas `J`.
2. **Iterate and Calculate:** Loop through each cell of the input grid:
   *  If the cell is not background:
      * Calculate neighbor indices.
      * Find valid neighbors within the grid.
      * Determine the border cells (valid neighbors that are not the same color).
      * Fill the border cells on the canvas with '1'.
      * Fill the current cell on the canvas with the original digit.
3. **Return Output:**  Return the modified canvas `J`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Uses functional programming techniques for a concise solution.
  """
  return apply(
      lambda row: tuple(
          1 if any(I[i][max(0, j-1):min(width(I), j+2)].count(v) for i in range(max(0, r-1), min(height(I), r+2))) and v == mostcolor(I) else v 
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      ),
      I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Apply and Lambda:** Uses `apply` to apply a lambda function to each row of the input grid.
2. **Lambda Function:**  For each cell in the row:
    * Checks if any cell in its 3x3 neighborhood (considering grid boundaries) contains a non-background digit.
    * If the current cell is background and the condition above is true, it fills with '1', otherwise keeps the original value.
3. **Return Output:** Returns the transformed grid.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Employs a recursive approach to fill the border.
  """
  def fill_recursive(grid, i, j):
    if 0 <= i < height(grid) and 0 <= j < width(grid) and grid[i][j] == mostcolor(grid):
      grid = fill(grid, 1, ((i, j),))
      for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]:
        grid = fill_recursive(grid, i + di, j + dj)
      return grid
    return grid
  
  J = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i, j in asindices(I):
    if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
      J = fill_recursive(J, i, j)
      J = fill(J, I[i][j], ((i, j),))
  return J
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Recursive Function:** Defines a `fill_recursive` function that takes the grid and a starting cell.
    * If the cell is within bounds and is background:
       * Fills it with '1'.
       * Recursively calls itself for each neighbor.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** Loops through the input grid:
    *  If a cell is not background:
       * Calls `fill_recursive` to fill the surrounding background.
       * Places the original digit on the canvas.
3. **Return Output:** Returns the transformed canvas.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL. Each version offers unique advantages in terms of readability, conciseness, or algorithmic approach.
