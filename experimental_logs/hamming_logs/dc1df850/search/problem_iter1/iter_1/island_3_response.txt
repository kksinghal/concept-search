## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying non-background objects and expanding them downwards and to the right, filling the background space. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

- The '2' object expands down and right, filling the first row and the last column.
- The '6' object does not expand as it's already touching the bottom border.

**Input_1:**

- The '2' objects expand right and down, filling the last column and parts of the second-to-last row.
- The '3' and '8' objects don't expand as they are not touching any borders.

**Input_2:**

- The '2' object expands right and down, filling the first three columns and top three rows. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1: Iteration and Conditional Filling**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if i < h-1:
        I = fill(I, 1, {(i+1, j)}) # Fill below
      if j < w-1:
        I = fill(I, 1, {(i, j+1)}) # Fill right
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterates through non-background objects.
2. For each object cell, checks if it's not on the bottom or right edge.
3. If not, fills the cell below and/or right with '1'.

**Version 2: Set Operations and Shifting**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  fill_area = set()
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    fill_area.update(toindices(obj))
    fill_area.update(toindices(shift(obj, DOWN)))
    fill_area.update(toindices(shift(obj, RIGHT)))
  return fill(I, 1, fill_area & asindices(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a set `fill_area` to store indices for filling.
2. For each object, adds its indices, and the indices of its down and right shifted versions to `fill_area`.
3. Uses set intersection to keep only valid indices within the grid bounds.
4. Fills the identified `fill_area` with '1'.

**Version 3: Recursive Filling**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  visited = set()

  def fill_recursive(i, j):
    if (i, j) in visited or not (0 <= i < h and 0 <= j < w) or I[i][j] != bg:
      return
    visited.add((i, j))
    I = fill(I, 1, {(i, j)})
    fill_recursive(i + 1, j)
    fill_recursive(i, j + 1)
    return I
  
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      I = fill_recursive(i, j)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. Utilizes a recursive function `fill_recursive` to explore and fill the grid.
2. `fill_recursive` checks for visited cells, grid boundaries, and background color.
3. If conditions are met, fills the cell and recursively calls itself for the cell below and to the right.
4. Iterates through all grid cells to initiate the recursive filling.

**Version 4: Expansion using Frontiers**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  fill_area = set()
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      fill_area.update((i + k, j) for k in range(1, h - i)) # Downward frontier
      fill_area.update((i, j + k) for k in range(1, w - j)) # Rightward frontier
  return fill(I, 1, frozenset(fill_area) & asindices(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. Calculates downward and rightward frontiers for each object cell.
2. Adds these frontier indices to `fill_area`.
3. Intersects `fill_area` with grid indices to ensure validity.
4. Fills the final `fill_area` with '1'.

**Version 5: Combining Objects and Filling**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  combined_obj = set()
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    combined_obj.update(toindices(obj))
  fill_area = set()
  for i, j in combined_obj:
    fill_area.update((i + k, j) for k in range(1, h - i))
    fill_area.update((i, j + k) for k in range(1, w - j))
  return fill(I, 1, fill_area & asindices(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a combined set of all object indices.
2. Calculates downward and rightward frontiers for this combined object.
3. Fills the identified frontier indices within the grid boundaries with '1'. 

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation, utilizing different DSL functions and logic. Each version provides a unique solution, fulfilling the requirement for diversity in code generation.
