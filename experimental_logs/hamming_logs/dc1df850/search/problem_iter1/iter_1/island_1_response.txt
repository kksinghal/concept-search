## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying cells with the value '2' and then filling the cells horizontally to the right of it with the value '1'. The number of cells filled with '1' is equal to the original value of the cell containing '2'. 

**Input_0:**

* The cell at (0,0) has value '2', so the next two cells to its right, (0,1) and (0,2), are filled with '1'.
* Similarly, the cell at (1,3) with value '2' leads to cells (1,4) being filled with '1'.

**Input_1:**

* The cells at (0,7), (6,2) each have the value '2', leading to their respective horizontal neighbors being filled with '1'.

**Input_2:**

* The cell at (1,1) has value '2', leading to cells (1,2) and (1,3) being filled with '1'.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if grid[i][j] == 2:
        for k in range(j + 1, min(j + grid[i][j] + 1, w)):
          grid = fill(grid, 1, {(i, k)})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterate through each cell of the grid.
2. If the cell value is '2', fill the next '2' cells horizontally to the right with '1'. 
3. The `min(j + grid[i][j] + 1, w)` ensures we stay within the grid boundaries.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      1 if 0 < k - j <= row[j] and row[j] == 2 else v 
      for k, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(grid)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. Uses nested list comprehensions for concise code.
2. For each cell (j,v) in a row, it checks if the current index (k) is within the range of cells that should be filled with '1': `0 < k - j <= row[j]` and if the current cell value is '2': `row[j] == 2`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if v == 2:
        grid = fill(grid, 1, {(i, k) for k in range(j + 1, min(j + v + 1, len(grid[0])))})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Identifies objects within the grid (non-background).
2.  For each object, if its value is '2', it fills the cells to its right with '1' based on the object's value.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 2:
        grid = fill(grid, 1, connect((i, j + 1), (i, min(j + value, len(row) - 1))))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Finds cells with the value '2'.
2.  For each '2', it uses the `connect` function to create a horizontal line of '1's starting from the right neighbor of the '2' and extending to the right according to the value of the '2' cell.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  new_grid = tuple(list(row) for row in grid)
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 2:
        for k in range(1, value + 1):
          if j + k < len(row):
            new_grid[i][j + k] = 1
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Creates a mutable copy of the grid to allow direct modification.
2.  Iterates through the grid and when it finds a '2', fills the appropriate number of cells to the right in `new_grid` with '1'.
3.  Converts the modified `new_grid` back to a tuple of tuples before returning.
