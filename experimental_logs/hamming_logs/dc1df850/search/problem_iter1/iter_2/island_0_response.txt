## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to follow these rules:

* **Border Expansion:**  A border of '1's is drawn around each non-background digit in the input grid. 
* **Horizontal Connectivity:** The border extends horizontally until it either hits another non-background digit or the edge of the grid.
* **Vertical Limitation:** The border does not extend vertically beyond the immediate top and bottom neighbors of the non-background digit.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Creates a border around non-background digits, extending horizontally.
  """
  J = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v != mostcolor(I):
        J = fill(J, v, ((i, j),))
        # Horizontal Extension
        for dj in [-1, 1]:
          nj = j + dj
          while 0 <= nj < width(I) and I[i][nj] == mostcolor(I):
            J = fill(J, 1, ((i, nj),))
            nj += dj
        # Vertical Limitation (single cell border)
        for di in [-1, 1]:
          ni = i + di
          if 0 <= ni < height(I):
            J = fill(J, 1, ((ni, j),))
  return J
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates a blank canvas (`J`) of the same size as the input grid (`I`), filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
3. **Non-Background Handling:** If a non-background digit is found:
   - The corresponding cell in the output grid (`J`) is filled with the digit.
   - **Horizontal Extension:** It expands horizontally (left and right) from the digit's position, filling with '1's until a non-background digit or the grid edge is encountered.
   - **Vertical Limitation:** It fills the immediate top and bottom neighbor cells with '1's (if they exist within the grid). 
4. **Return Output:** Returns the modified grid `J`.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Uses object detection and manipulation for border creation.
  """
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  J = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      J = fill(J, v, ((i, j),))
      for dj in [-1, 1]:
        nj = j + dj
        while 0 <= nj < width(I) and index(I, (i, nj)) == mostcolor(I):
          J = fill(J, 1, ((i, nj),))
          nj += dj
      for di in [-1, 1]:
        ni = i + di
        if 0 <= ni < height(I):
          J = fill(J, 1, ((ni, j),))
  return J
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identifies all non-background objects in the input grid (`I`) using `objects` function.
2. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates a blank canvas (`J`) filled with the background color.
3. **Iterate Through Objects:** For each detected object:
   - **Fill Object:** Fills the corresponding cells in the output grid (`J`) with the object's color.
   - **Horizontal Extension:** Similar to version 1, extends the border horizontally.
   - **Vertical Limitation:** Similar to version 1, adds the single-cell vertical border.
4. **Return Output:**  Returns the modified output grid (`J`).

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Utilizes set operations for border generation.
  """
  J = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i, j in asindices(I):
    if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
      horizontal_line = frozenset((i, k) for k in range(max(0, j - 1), min(width(I), j + 2)))
      vertical_line = frozenset((k, j) for k in range(max(0, i - 1), min(height(I), i + 2)))
      border = horizontal_line | vertical_line
      J = fill(J, 1, border)
      J = fill(J, I[i][j], ((i, j),))
  return J
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:**  A blank canvas (`J`) is created, filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate and Define Lines:**  It iterates through each cell in the input grid (`I`). For each non-background digit:
   - **Horizontal Line:** A set of indices representing a horizontal line (one cell to the left and right) is created.
   - **Vertical Line:**  A set of indices representing a vertical line (one cell above and below) is created.
   - **Combine Lines:** The horizontal and vertical lines are combined into a single set (`border`).
3. **Fill Border and Digit:** 
   - The output grid (`J`) is filled with '1's at the indices defined by the `border` set.
   - The original digit from the input grid is placed in its corresponding location in the output grid.
4. **Return Output:** The modified output grid is returned.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Applies a convolution-like approach to find border cells.
  """
  def check_neighborhood(grid, i, j):
    for di in [-1, 0, 1]:
      for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:
        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
        if 0 <= ni < height(grid) and 0 <= nj < width(grid) and grid[ni][nj] != mostcolor(grid):
          return 1
    return mostcolor(grid)

  J = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      J = fill(J, check_neighborhood(I, i, j), ((i, j),))
  return J
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Neighborhood Check Function:**  Defines a function `check_neighborhood` which, given a grid and cell coordinates, checks if any cell in its 3x3 neighborhood (including itself) is a non-background color. If it finds one, it returns '1', otherwise the background color.
2. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates a blank canvas (`J`).
3. **Convolution-like Iteration:** Iterates through each cell in the input grid (`I`) and applies the `check_neighborhood` function to determine the value of the corresponding cell in the output grid (`J`).
4. **Return Output:** Returns the modified output grid.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Leverages map and lambda function for concise border generation.
  """
  def border_cell(i, j):
    return 1 if any(I[k][max(0, j-1):min(width(I), j+2)].count(v) > 0 for k in range(max(0, i-1), min(height(I), i+2)) for v in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}) else mostcolor(I)

  return tuple(
      tuple(border_cell(i, j) for j in range(width(I)))
      for i in range(height(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Border Cell Function:**  Defines a function `border_cell` that checks if a cell should be part of the border:
   - It iterates through the cell's 3x3 neighborhood (handling edge cases).
   - For each neighbor, it checks if any non-background color from the input grid is present in the horizontal slice of the neighborhood.
   - If a non-background color is found, the cell is marked as a border cell ('1'), otherwise it gets the background color.
2. **Map and Lambda:** Uses nested `tuple` and `for` comprehensions combined with the `border_cell` function to efficiently generate the output grid. This approach avoids explicit loops and relies on functional programming concepts for conciseness.

Each of these program versions provides a distinct approach to achieve the desired border generation transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
