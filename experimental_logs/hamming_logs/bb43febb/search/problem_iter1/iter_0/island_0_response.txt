## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to recolor the inner cells of each object in the grid to the value '2'.  The outer border of each object remains unchanged.

**Example:**

Input:
```
0 5 5 5 0
0 5 5 5 0
0 5 5 5 0
0 5 5 5 0
0 0 0 0 0 
```

Output:
```
0 5 5 5 0
0 5 2 5 0
0 5 2 5 0
0 5 2 5 0
0 0 0 0 0 
```

## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  recolored_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(2, inbox(obj)), objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all distinct objects in the grid `I`. 
2. **Recolor Inner Cells:**  For each object `obj`, `recolor(2, inbox(obj))` changes the color of its `inbox` (inner cells) to '2'. 
3. **Paint to Grid:** `paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))` paints the modified objects back onto the original grid `I`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  modified_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    border = difference(toindices(obj), inbox(obj))
    modified_obj = combine(recolor(2, obj), toobject(border, I))
    modified_objs = insert(modified_obj, modified_objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(modified_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Isolate Border:**  For each object, calculate the `border` by subtracting the `inbox` from its total indices.
3. **Combine Recolored Object and Border:** Recolor the entire object to '2', then combine it with the original border cells.
4. **Paint to Grid:** Similar to Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    O = underfill(O, 2, inbox(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Objects:** Loop through each object identified in the grid.
2. **Underfill Inner Cells:** For each object, `underfill` changes the color of cells within its `inbox` to '2', but only if those cells were originally the background color (most common color).

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  inner_cells = mapply(inbox, objs)
  O = fill(I, 2, merge(inner_cells))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Objects and Inner Cells:**  Identify all objects and extract the indices of their inner cells using `inbox`.
2. **Fill Inner Cells:** Directly fill all identified inner cells with color '2'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  modified_grid = tuple(tuple(2 if (i > 0 and i < len(I)-1) and (j > 0 and j < len(I[0])-1) else I[i][j] for j in range(len(I[0]))) for i in range(len(I)))
  return modified_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Directly Modify Grid:** This version directly iterates through each cell in the grid using nested loops.
2. **Conditional Recoloring:**  If a cell is not on the outer edge of the grid, its color is changed to '2'. This effectively recolors the inner cells of all objects.

This solution assumes that no object directly touches the grid boundary. 

## Code Extraction:

To extract the code for any of the program versions, simply copy the code within the `def Program_to_be_generated(I):` block and paste it into your programming environment.
