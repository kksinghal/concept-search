## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the "inner frame" of each object within the grid and recoloring it to the value '2'. The inner frame is defined as all cells within an object that are not part of its outer boundary. 

**Example:**

Consider the object:

```
5 5 5 5 5
5 0 0 0 5
5 0 0 0 5
5 5 5 5 5 
```

The outer boundary consists of all the '5' cells. The inner frame would be:

```
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

This inner frame is then filled with the value '2'.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    inner_frame = difference(toindices(obj), box(toindices(obj)))
    I = fill(I, 2, inner_frame)
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all distinct objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through objects:** The code iterates through each identified object.
3. **Calculate the inner frame:** For each object, `difference(toindices(obj), box(toindices(obj)))` calculates the difference between the object's indices and its outer box, effectively giving us the inner frame indices.
4. **Fill the inner frame:** `fill(I, 2, inner_frame)` fills the calculated inner frame with the value '2' on the input grid `I`.
5. **Return the modified grid:** The modified grid `I` (now `O`) is returned as the final output.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  inner_frames = mapply(lambda obj: difference(toindices(obj), box(toindices(obj))), objs)
  O = fill(O, 2, inner_frames)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies distinct objects in the input grid.
2. **Calculate all inner frames:** `mapply(lambda obj: difference(toindices(obj), box(toindices(obj))), objs)` calculates the inner frame indices for all objects simultaneously using `mapply`.
3. **Fill all inner frames:** `fill(O, 2, inner_frames)` fills all the calculated inner frames with the value '2' on a copy of the input grid (`O`).
4. **Return the modified grid:** The modified grid `O` is returned as the final output. 


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(2, difference(toindices(obj), box(toindices(obj)))), objs)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects in the input grid.
2. **Calculate and recolor inner frames:** `apply(lambda obj: recolor(2, difference(toindices(obj), box(toindices(obj)))), objs)` calculates the inner frame for each object and then recolors it to '2' within a single lambda function.
3. **Merge and paint:**  `merge(...)` combines all recoloured inner frames. `paint(I, ...)` paints these combined inner frames onto a copy of the input grid (`O`).
4. **Return the modified grid:** The modified grid `O` is returned.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def fill_inner_frame(obj):
    return recolor(2, difference(toindices(obj), box(toindices(obj))))
  O = paint(I, merge(apply(fill_inner_frame, objects(I, T, F, T))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `fill_inner_frame` function:**  A helper function `fill_inner_frame(obj)` is defined to encapsulate the logic of calculating and recoloring the inner frame of an object.
2. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects.
3. **Apply, merge, and paint:**  `apply(fill_inner_frame, ...)` applies the helper function to each object. `merge(...)` combines the recoloured inner frames, and `paint(I, ...)` paints them onto a copy of the input grid.
4. **Return the modified grid:** The modified grid `O` is returned.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(1, height(I) - 1):
    for j in range(1, width(I) - 1):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and any(index(I, (i + di, j + dj)) == mostcolor(I) for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]):
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through inner cells:** The code iterates through each cell of the grid, excluding the outer border.
2. **Check for inner frame condition:** For each cell, it checks if:
    * The cell is not the background color (`index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I)`).
    * At least one of its directly adjacent cells is the background color (indicating it's part of an object's inner boundary).
3. **Fill the inner frame:** If both conditions are met, the cell is filled with the value '2'.
4. **Return the modified grid:** The modified grid `O` is returned.
