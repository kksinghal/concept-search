## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in both input-output pairs focuses on objects that don't touch the grid borders. For these objects, the transformation involves coloring the cells within the object's "inbox" with the value `2`. The "inbox" is defined as the area enclosed by the outermost cells of the object, excluding the object itself.

**Example:**

Consider the object in Input_0:

```
5 2 2 2 5 
5 2 5 2 5 
5 2 2 2 5 
```

Its "inbox" would be:

```
. 2 2 2 .
. 2 . 2 .
. 2 2 2 .
```

The transformation fills these "inbox" cells with the value `2`. 


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(recolor(2, difference(inbox(obj), toindices(obj))) for obj in objects(I, T, T, T) if not bordering(obj, I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Identifies all objects in the grid `I`.
2. **`if not bordering(obj, I)`:** Filters for objects not touching the grid borders.
3. **`difference(inbox(obj), toindices(obj))`:** Calculates the "inbox" of each object by finding the difference between its bounding box (`inbox`) and its actual cells (`toindices`).
4. **`recolor(2, ...)`:** Colors the "inbox" cells with the value `2`.
5. **`merge(...)`:** Combines all the recolored "inboxes" into a single set of cells.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Applies the color changes to the original grid `I`.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(2, difference(inbox(obj), toindices(obj))), sfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I))))) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version achieves the same outcome as version 1 but uses a slightly different function combination. Instead of using generator expressions within `merge`, it employs `apply` and `sfilter`.

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **`sfilter(..., lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I))`:** Filters for objects not bordering the grid.
3. **`apply(lambda obj: recolor(2, difference(inbox(obj), toindices(obj))), ...)`:** Applies a lambda function to each object in the filtered set. The lambda function calculates and recolors the "inbox" with the value `2`.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the recolored "inboxes" from all objects.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Applies the color changes to the original grid.


**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  filtered_objs = frozenset(obj for obj in objs if not bordering(obj, I))
  recolored_inboxes = frozenset(recolor(2, difference(inbox(obj), toindices(obj))) for obj in filtered_objs)
  return paint(I, merge(recolored_inboxes))
```

**Explanation:**

This version explicitly separates each step of the transformation, making it more readable. 

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **`filtered_objs = ...`:** Filters objects not touching the grid borders.
3. **`recolored_inboxes = ...`:**  Calculates and recolors the "inbox" of each filtered object.
4. **`paint(I, merge(recolored_inboxes))`:** Merges the recolored inboxes and applies the changes to the original grid.


**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  result = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    if not bordering(obj, I):
      inbox_indices = difference(inbox(obj), toindices(obj))
      recolored_inbox = recolor(2, inbox_indices)
      result = paint(result, recolored_inbox)
  return result
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a `for` loop to iterate through the objects and modify the grid iteratively.

1. **`result = I`:** Initializes the `result` grid with the input grid.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):`:** Iterates through each object in the grid.
3. **`if not bordering(obj, I):`:**  Proceeds only if the object doesn't touch the borders.
4. **`inbox_indices = ...`:** Calculates the "inbox" indices.
5. **`recolored_inbox = ...`:** Recolors the "inbox" with the value `2`.
6. **`result = paint(result, recolored_inbox)`:** Paints the recolored "inbox" onto the `result` grid in each iteration. 
7. **`return result`:** Returns the modified grid.


**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_object(obj):
    return recolor(2, difference(inbox(obj), toindices(obj))) if not bordering(obj, I) else frozenset()
  return paint(I, merge(apply(process_object, objects(I, T, T, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a helper function `process_object` to encapsulate the logic for processing each object.

1. **`def process_object(obj): ...`:** Defines a function that takes an object as input. 
    - It calculates and recolors the "inbox" with value `2` if the object is not bordering the grid.
    - If the object touches the border, it returns an empty set.
2. **`apply(process_object, objects(I, T, T, T))`:** Applies the `process_object` function to each object identified in the grid.
3. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the resulting sets of recolored "inboxes".
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged set onto the original grid.
