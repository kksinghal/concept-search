## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently modifies the input grids by changing the color of specific cells within each object to the value '2'. The change targets cells that are not on the outer edges of the object, essentially creating a border effect.  The corners of the objects remain unchanged.

**Example:**

In both Input_0 and Input_1, the transformation identifies objects formed by the digit '5'. Within these objects, any '5' directly adjacent to the background (digit '0') remains unchanged. However, '5's' surrounded by other '5's' on all four sides (top, bottom, left, right) are changed to '2'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if all((i + di, j + dj) in toindices(obj) for di, dj in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]):
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objs = objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate Through Cells:** The program iterates through each cell `(i, j)` of every object.
3. **Check for Inner Cell:** It checks if all four neighbors (up, down, left, right) of the cell are also part of the same object using a list comprehension and the `all` function.
4. **Fill Inner Cells:** If a cell is identified as an inner cell, it is filled with the value '2'.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(2, merge(apply(lambda obj: difference(toindices(obj), box(obj)), objects(I, T, T, T)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Find Inner Cells:** For each object,  `difference(toindices(obj), box(obj))` finds the indices of cells that are inside the object's bounding box but not part of the box itself.
3. **Merge and Recolor:** These inner cell indices are merged from all objects using `merge` and recolored to '2' using `recolor`.
4. **Paint onto Grid:** Finally, the recolored indices are painted back onto a copy of the original grid using `paint`.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    inner_indices = difference(toindices(obj),  box(obj))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, inner_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Similar to previous versions, it identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Isolate Inner Cells:** For each object, it finds the indices of inner cells (cells within the object but not on its edges) by calculating the difference between the object's indices and its bounding box indices (`box`).
3. **Recolor and Paint:** It recolors the inner cells to '2' and paints them onto a copy of the input grid (`O`). This process is repeated for each object.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    if size(obj) > 4:
      O = underfill(O, 2, inbox(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** It identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Filter Small Objects:** It filters out objects that are too small to have inner cells (size <= 4).
3. **Underfill Inbox:** For the remaining objects, it uses the `inbox` function to find the indices within the object's bounding box, excluding the bounding box itself. It then uses `underfill` to change the color of these indices to '2' only if they were originally the background color.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I,  recolor(2, merge(apply(lambda obj: delta(obj) & toindices(obj), objects(I, T, T, T)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** It identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Find Inner Cells:** For each object, it calculates the intersection (`&`) between the object's indices (`toindices(obj)`) and the cells within its bounding box but not part of the object itself (`delta(obj)`). This intersection represents the inner cells of the object.
3. **Merge and Recolor:** It merges the inner cells from all objects and recolors them to '2'.
4. **Paint onto Grid:** Finally, it paints the recolored inner cells back onto a copy of the input grid.


All five program versions achieve the same transformation but utilize different DSL function combinations and logic, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL.
