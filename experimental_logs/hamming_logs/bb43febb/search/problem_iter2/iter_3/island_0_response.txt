## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on non-bordering objects within the grid. For each such object, the transformation identifies its "inbox" â€“ a bounding box excluding the outermost layer of cells. The cells within this "inbox" but not part of the original object are then recolored to the value '2'.

**Input 0:**

* The object formed by the value '2' is the only non-bordering object. 
* Its "inbox" includes the cells directly surrounding it.
* These surrounding cells are recolored to '2'.

**Input 1:**

* Two non-bordering objects exist: one formed by '2' and another by '5' at the bottom.
* The "inbox" of the '2' object is recolored similarly to Input 0.
* The bottom '5' object's "inbox" is also recolored to '2'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(recolor(2, difference(inbox(obj), toindices(obj))) for obj in objects(I, T, T, T) if not bordering(obj, I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Identifies all non-background objects in the grid `I`.
2. **`if not bordering(obj, I)`:** Filters for objects not touching the grid border.
3. **`difference(inbox(obj), toindices(obj))`:** For each object, calculates the set difference between its "inbox" and its actual cell indices, resulting in the surrounding cells.
4. **`recolor(2, ...)`:**  Recolors the identified surrounding cells to the value '2'.
5. **`merge(...)`:**  Combines all the recolored cells into a single set.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Applies the recoloring to the original grid `I`.


**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(recolor(2, difference(inbox(obj), toindices(obj))) for obj in objects(I, T, T, T) if not bordering(obj, I))), I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input grid.
2. **Steps 2-5 are identical to Version 1, but applied to the blank canvas instead of the original grid.**
3. **`cellwise(I, ..., I)`:**  Compares the original grid `I` with the modified canvas. For matching cells, the original value is kept; otherwise, the modified canvas value (recolored '2') is used. This ensures only the "inbox" cells are altered.


**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  filtered_objs = frozenset(obj for obj in objs if not bordering(obj, I))
  recolored_cells = merge(recolor(2, difference(inbox(obj), toindices(obj))) for obj in filtered_objs)
  return paint(I, recolored_cells)
```

**Explanation:**

This version separates the steps for clarity:

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Identifies all non-background objects.
2. **`filtered_objs = ...`:**  Filters for non-bordering objects.
3. **`recolored_cells = ...`:**  Calculates and merges the recolored cells for the filtered objects.
4. **`paint(I, recolored_cells)`:** Applies the changes to the original grid.


**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_inbox(obj):
    return recolor(2, difference(inbox(obj), toindices(obj)))
  return paint(I, merge(apply(recolor_inbox, sfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I))))) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version introduces a helper function for code conciseness:

1. **`recolor_inbox(obj)`:**  Helper function to recolor the "inbox" of a given object.
2. **`sfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I))`:**  Filters for non-bordering objects.
3. **`apply(recolor_inbox, ...)`:** Applies the `recolor_inbox` function to each filtered object.
4. **`merge(...)`:**  Merges the recolored cells from each object.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Applies the changes to the original grid.


**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_grid = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    if not bordering(obj, I):
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, recolor(2, difference(inbox(obj), toindices(obj))))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version iteratively modifies the grid:

1. **`new_grid = I`:**  Creates a copy of the original grid for modification.
2. **`for obj in ...`:**  Iterates through each non-background object.
3. **`if not bordering...`:**  Processes only non-bordering objects.
4. **`new_grid = paint(...`:**  For each qualifying object, recolors its "inbox" and updates `new_grid`.
5. **`return new_grid`:**  Returns the final modified grid.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches and DSL function combinations to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
