## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects within the grid that are not touching the border (we'll call these "inner objects"). For each inner object, the transformation changes the values of the cells directly surrounding the object to a specific value (in this case, '2'). 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

* **Inner Object:** The 2x2 square of '2's within the larger '5' object.
* **Transformation:** The cells directly surrounding the 2x2 square are changed to '2'.

**Input_1:**

* **Inner Objects:** There are two inner objects:
    * The 2x2 square of '2's within the upper '5' object.
    * The lower '5' object. 
* **Transformation:** The cells directly surrounding both inner objects are changed to '2'. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL functions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(
      recolor(2, outbox(obj))
      for obj in objects(I, T, T, T) 
      if not bordering(obj, I)
  )) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Identifies all objects within the input grid `I`.
2. **`if not bordering(obj, I)`:** Filters for objects that are not touching the grid border.
3. **`outbox(obj)`:**  Gets the indices of cells forming the outer boundary of each inner object.
4. **`recolor(2, ...)`:** Changes the value of the outer boundary cells to '2'.
5. **`merge(...)`:** Combines all the modified outer boundaries into a single set of indices.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Applies the color '2' to the specified indices on the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, 
                   paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
                         recolor(2, 
                                 merge(outbox(obj) for obj in objects(I, T, T, T) if not bordering(obj, I)))), 
                   I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)` & `bordering(obj, I)`:** Same as in Version 1, identifies inner objects.
2. **`outbox(obj)` & `merge(...)`:**  Same as in Version 1, gets indices of outer boundaries.
3. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates a blank canvas the same size and background color as the input grid.
4. **`paint(..., recolor(2, ...))`:** Colors the outer boundary indices on the blank canvas with '2'.
5. **`cellwise(I, ..., I)`:** Merges the input grid with the modified canvas, prioritizing the input grid's values in case of overlap. This ensures that only the outer boundaries are changed.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, merge(
        recolor(2, difference(outbox(obj), obj))
        for obj in objects(I, T, T, T) 
        if sum(1 for (i, j) in toindices(obj) if i in (0, len(I)-1) or j in (0, len(I[0])-1)) == 0
    ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`sum(1 for (i, j) in toindices(obj) if i in (0, len(I)-1) or j in (0, len(I[0])-1)) == 0`:**  This condition checks if the object is touching the border of the grid. It does this by iterating through all cells of the object and checking if any cell's row index (i) is either 0 or the last row index (len(I)-1) or if any cell's column index (j) is either 0 or the last column index (len(I[0])-1). If any cell satisfies this, it means the object is touching the border.
2. **`difference(outbox(obj), obj)`:**  Gets the indices of cells forming the outer boundary of each inner object and then subtracts the object indices to ensure only the surrounding cells are selected.
3.  Rest of the steps are same as version 1. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  modified_objs = frozenset({recolor(2, difference(outbox(obj), obj)) for obj in objs if not bordering(obj, I)})
  O = paint(I, merge(modified_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, T, T)`:** This line identifies all distinct objects within the input grid I. An object is defined as a connected group of cells with the same value, considering diagonal connections (T, T) and excluding the background (T).
2. **`if not bordering(obj, I)`:**  This condition filters for objects that are not touching the grid border. 
3.  Rest of the steps are same as version 3.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    inner_objs = frozenset(obj for obj in objects(I, T, T, T) if not bordering(obj, I))
    outer_boundaries = frozenset(difference(outbox(obj), obj) for obj in inner_objs)
    colored_boundaries = frozenset(recolor(2, boundary) for boundary in outer_boundaries)
    O = paint(I, merge(colored_boundaries))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`inner_objs = frozenset(obj for obj in objects(I, T, T, T) if not bordering(obj, I))`:** Identifies objects within the input grid `I` that are not touching the border and stores them in `inner_objs`.
2. **`outer_boundaries = frozenset(difference(outbox(obj), obj) for obj in inner_objs)`:** Calculates the outer boundaries of each inner object and stores them in `outer_boundaries`.
3. **`colored_boundaries = frozenset(recolor(2, boundary) for boundary in outer_boundaries)`:** Colors each outer boundary with the value 2.
4. **`O = paint(I, merge(colored_boundaries))`:** Applies the colored boundaries to the original input grid `I`, resulting in the final output grid `O`.

These program versions demonstrate different approaches and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the desired transformation. They highlight the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for solving grid-based tasks.
