## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on recoloring specific cells within objects to the value '2'. The pattern appears to target cells forming a "cross" shape within each object, excluding any cells on the outer perimeter of the object. 

**Example:**

Consider the object in Input_0:

```
5 5 5 5 5 
5 2 2 2 5
5 2 5 2 5
5 2 2 2 5 
5 5 5 5 5
```

The transformation recolors the central '5' to a '2', creating a cross pattern:

```
5 5 5 5 5 
5 2 2 2 5
5 2 2 2 5
5 2 2 2 5 
5 5 5 5 5
```

This pattern repeats for all objects in both input grids.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def gjfceebejdfjedehjhabbhechdafhbfd(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True)
  
  def recolor_cross(obj):
    # Find the center of the object
    center_i, center_j = centerofmass(obj)
    
    # Create indices for the horizontal and vertical lines of the cross
    horizontal_line = frozenset({(center_i, j) for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj))})
    vertical_line = frozenset({(i, center_j) for i in range(uppermost(obj) + 1, lowermost(obj))})
    
    # Combine the lines to form the cross
    cross_indices = horizontal_line | vertical_line
    
    # Recolor the cross indices within the object to '2'
    return recolor(2, cross_indices.intersection(toindices(obj)))

  return paint(I, merge(apply(recolor_cross, objs))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Program_A, this version first identifies all objects in the input grid using the `objects` function.
2. **Recolor Cross:** For each object, the `recolor_cross` function:
    - Calculates the object's center using `centerofmass`.
    - Generates indices for the horizontal and vertical lines of the cross, excluding the outermost cells.
    - Combines these indices and intersects them with the object's indices to ensure only cells within the object are recolored.
    - Applies the `recolor` function to change the color of the selected cells to '2'.
3. **Paint Objects:** Finally, the modified objects are merged and painted back onto the input grid using the `paint` function.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def gjfceebejdfjedehjhabbhechdafhbfd(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True)

  def recolor_cross(obj):
    # Get the bounding box of the object
    ul = ulcorner(obj)
    lr = lrcorner(obj)
  
    # Create indices for all cells within the bounding box
    all_indices = product(interval(ul[0], lr[0] + 1, 1), interval(ul[1], lr[1] + 1, 1))
  
    # Filter indices to keep only those forming the cross shape
    cross_indices = sfilter(all_indices, lambda idx: (idx[0] == centerofmass(obj)[0] or idx[1] == centerofmass(obj)[1]) and idx != ul and idx != (ul[0], lr[1]) and idx != (lr[0], ul[1]) and idx != lr)
  
    # Recolor the selected indices within the object
    return recolor(2, cross_indices.intersection(toindices(obj)))

  return paint(I, merge(apply(recolor_cross, objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Identifies objects like Version 1.
2. **Recolor Cross:** This version takes a different approach to identifying cross indices:
   - It determines the object's bounding box using `ulcorner` and `lrcorner`.
   - Generates indices for all cells within this bounding box using `product` and `interval`.
   - Filters these indices, keeping only those that align with the center row or column of the object, effectively selecting the cross shape while excluding corner and outer perimeter cells.
   - Recolors the selected indices within the object to '2'.
3. **Paint Objects:**  Similar to Version 1, modified objects are merged and painted back onto the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def gjfceebejdfjedehjhabbhechdafhbfd(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True)

  def recolor_cross(obj):
    center_i, center_j = centerofmass(obj)
    return frozenset(
        (2 if (i == center_i or j == center_j) and (i, j) != ulcorner(obj) and (i, j) != urcorner(obj) and (i, j) != llcorner(obj) and (i, j) != lrcorner(obj) else v, (i, j))
        for v, (i, j) in obj
    )

  return paint(I, merge(apply(recolor_cross, objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identifies objects like previous versions.
2. **Recolor Cross:** This version iterates directly through the object's cells:
    - For each cell, it checks if it belongs to the center row or column (forming the cross) and excludes corner cells.
    - If a cell meets the criteria, its color is changed to '2'; otherwise, the original color is retained.
3. **Paint Objects:**  Similar to previous versions, modified objects are merged and painted back onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def gjfceebejdfjedehjhabbhechdafhbfd(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True)

    def recolor_cross(obj):
        c = centerofmass(obj)
        shifted_obj = shift(obj, (-c[0], -c[1]))
        recolored_obj = frozenset(
            (2 if (i == 0 or j == 0) and abs(i) + abs(j) > 1 else v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in shifted_obj
        )
        return shift(recolored_obj, (c[0], c[1]))

    return paint(I, merge(apply(recolor_cross, objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identifies objects like previous versions.
2. **Recolor Cross:** This version simplifies the logic by shifting the object's center to the origin:
    - It shifts the object so its center aligns with (0, 0) using `shift`.
    - This simplifies the condition for recoloring: it checks if a cell lies on the x or y-axis and is not directly adjacent to the origin, effectively selecting the cross shape.
    - After recoloring, the object is shifted back to its original position.
3. **Paint Objects:**  Similar to previous versions, modified objects are merged and painted back onto the input grid.


**Program Version 5:**
```python
def gjfceebejdfjedehjhabbhechdafhbfd(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True)

    def recolor_cross(obj):
        indices = toindices(obj)
        h_line = {(i, j) for i, j in indices if i == centerofmass(obj)[0] and (i, j) not in corners(indices)}
        v_line = {(i, j) for i, j in indices if j == centerofmass(obj)[1] and (i, j) not in corners(indices)}
        return recolor(2, (h_line | v_line))
    
    return paint(I, merge(apply(recolor_cross, objs)))
```
**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Like before, it identifies all objects within the input grid.
2. **Recolor Cross:** This version emphasizes code readability:
    - It first converts the object into its set of indices.
    - It then generates two sets: one for the horizontal line and one for the vertical line of the cross. These sets specifically exclude the corner indices of the object.
    - Finally, it recolors the union of these two sets (representing the cross shape) to the value '2'.
3. **Paint Objects:** Similar to the previous versions, it merges the modified objects and paints them onto the input grid.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
