## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify objects within the grid and recolor the inner cells of these objects to the value '2'. The outer border of each object remains unchanged. 

**Example:**

Input:
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 5 5 5 0
0 5 8 5 0
0 5 5 5 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

Output:
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 5 5 5 0
0 5 2 5 0
0 5 5 5 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  modified_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    inner_indices = difference(toindices(obj), box(obj))
    modified_obj = recolor(2, inner_indices)
    modified_objs = insert(modified_obj, modified_objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(modified_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  `objects(I, T, T, T)` extracts all objects from the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate through objects:** The code iterates through each identified object (`obj`).
3. **Find inner indices:**  `difference(toindices(obj), box(obj))` calculates the indices of cells within the object but not on its border (using `box`).
4. **Recolor inner cells:** `recolor(2, inner_indices)` creates a new object with inner cells recolored to '2'.
5. **Combine modified objects:**  `modified_objs` stores all recolored objects.
6. **Paint onto the input:**  `paint(I, merge(modified_objs))` applies the modifications to the input grid, generating the output (`O`).

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if (i, j) not in box(obj):
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  `objects(I, T, T, T)` extracts all objects from the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate through objects and cells:** The code iterates through each object and its cells.
3. **Check for border cells:** It verifies if a cell belongs to the object's border using  `box(obj)`.
4. **Recolor non-border cells:** If a cell is not on the border, it's recolored to '2' directly on the output grid (`O`) using `fill`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if (i, j) not in box(objects(crop(I, (i, j), (2, 2)), T, T, T)[0]):
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** This version iterates directly through each cell of the grid.
2. **Extract local object:**  `objects(crop(I, (i, j), (2, 2)), T, T, T)[0]` extracts the object containing the current cell using a 2x2 crop.
3. **Check for border:**  Similar to Version 2, it checks if the cell is on the object's border using `box`.
4. **Recolor non-border cells:**  Recolors non-border cells to '2' directly on the output grid (`O`).

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  inner_cells = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: difference(toindices(obj), box(obj)))
  return paint(I, recolor(2, inner_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  `objects(I, T, T, T)` extracts all objects.
2. **Extract inner cells:** `mfilter` extracts and merges all inner cell indices from each object using `difference` and `box`.
3. **Recolor and paint:** It recolors all extracted inner cells to '2' and paints them onto the input grid (`I`) to produce the output.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(2, 
                           difference(
                               merge(apply(toindices, objects(I, T, T, T))), 
                               merge(apply(box, objects(I, T, T, T))))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Similar to previous versions, it starts by identifying all objects.
2. **Extract all indices and borders:**  `apply(toindices, ...)` and `apply(box, ...)` extract all object indices and their corresponding border indices, respectively. 
3. **Find the difference:**  `difference` finds the indices present in the set of all object indices but not in the set of border indices.
4. **Recolor and paint:** Finally, it recolors the resulting inner cell indices to '2' and paints them onto the input grid.

These five versions showcase diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation by leveraging different DSL function combinations and logic. Each version offers a unique way to process the input grid and achieve the desired recoloring effect.
