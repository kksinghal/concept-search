## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on recoloring the inner cells of objects within the grid. 

* **Input_0 to Output_0:** The inner cells of the '5' object are recolored to '2', leaving a one-cell thick border of '5'.
* **Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the previous transformation, the inner cells of both '5' objects are recolored to '2', preserving a one-cell thick border.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Extract objects from the grid
  modified_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    if size(obj) > 2:  # Only modify objects with more than two cells
      inner_indices = difference(toindices(obj), box(toindices(obj))) # Get indices of inner cells
      modified_obj = recolor(2, inner_indices) # Recolor inner cells to '2'
      modified_objs = insert(modified_obj, modified_objs) # Add modified object
  O = paint(I, merge(modified_objs)) # Paint modified objects onto the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify and separate individual objects within the grid.
2. **Filter Objects:** Focus on objects larger than two cells to avoid modifying single-cell or line objects.
3. **Identify Inner Cells:**  Determine the indices of cells within the object's bounding box but not part of the outer border.
4. **Recolor:** Change the color of the identified inner cells to '2'.
5. **Paint:**  Overlay the modified objects back onto the original grid, effectively recoloring the inner cells.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    ul = ulcorner(obj)
    lr = lrcorner(obj)
    for i in range(ul[0] + 1, lr[0]):
      for j in range(ul[1] + 1, lr[1]):
        if (i,j) in toindices(obj): # Check if the cell belongs to the object
          O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})  # Recolor inner cell to '2'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:**  Process each object in the grid individually.
2. **Define Bounding Box:** Determine the upper-left and lower-right corners of the object's bounding box.
3. **Iterate within Bounding Box:**  Visit each cell within the bounding box.
4. **Conditional Recoloring:** If a cell within the bounding box belongs to the object, recolor it to '2'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(1, height(I) - 1):
    for j in range(1, width(I) - 1):
      if (i, j) not in toindices(merge(frontiers(I))):  # Check if the cell is not on a frontier
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)}) # Recolor cell to '2'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** Systematically visit each cell within the inner region of the grid, excluding the outer border.
2. **Identify Non-Frontier Cells:** Determine if the current cell is part of a continuous single-colored row or column (a frontier).
3. **Recolor:** If the cell is not on a frontier, change its color to '2'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  inner_cells = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    if size(obj) > 4: # Modify objects with more than four cells
      inner_cells = combine(inner_cells, difference(backdrop(obj), box(obj))) # Collect inner cell indices 
  O = fill(I, 2, inner_cells) # Recolor collected inner cells to '2' 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify and isolate individual objects within the grid.
2. **Filter Objects:** Focus on objects larger than four cells for modification.
3. **Identify Inner Cells:**  Determine cells within each object's bounding box but not part of the outer border.
4. **Collect Inner Cells:**  Aggregate the indices of all identified inner cells from each object.
5. **Recolor:**  Change the color of all collected inner cells to '2'. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = paint(canvas(2, shape(I)), merge(frontiers(I)))  # Create a grid filled with '2' and paint frontiers from the original grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** Generate a new grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with the color '2'.
2. **Extract Frontiers:** Identify all continuous single-colored rows and columns (frontiers) from the input grid.
3. **Paint Frontiers:**  Overlay the extracted frontiers onto the '2'-filled canvas, effectively reconstructing the original object borders with the inner area filled with '2'.


These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieving the target transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
