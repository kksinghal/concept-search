## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on modifying the "surrounding" or "inner box" of objects within the grid. 

* **For objects directly touching the grid border:** The transformation leaves them unchanged.
* **For other objects:** The transformation replaces the cells directly surrounding the object with the color '2'.  The original object itself remains untouched. 

This applies to all input-output pairs provided.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  modified_objs = frozenset({recolor(2, outbox(obj)) for obj in objs if not bordering(obj, I)})
  O = paint(I, merge(modified_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Identifies all distinct objects within the input grid `I`.
2. **`modified_objs = frozenset({recolor(2, outbox(obj)) for obj in objs if not bordering(obj, I)})`:** 
    * `outbox(obj)`: Calculates the indices of the outer box surrounding each object.
    * `recolor(2, ...)`:  Colors those outer box indices with the value '2'.
    * `if not bordering(obj, I)`:  Only applies the recoloring to objects not touching the grid border.
3. **`O = paint(I, merge(modified_objs))`:**  Paints the modified outer boxes onto the original input grid `I` to generate the output `O`.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  modified_grid = I
  for obj in objs:
    if not bordering(obj, I):
      modified_grid = fill(modified_grid, 2, outbox(obj))
  O = modified_grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Finds all objects in the grid.
2. **`modified_grid = I`:** Initializes a grid to store modifications.
3. **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterates through each object.
4. **`if not bordering(obj, I):`:**  Checks if the object touches the border.
5. **`modified_grid = fill(modified_grid, 2, outbox(obj))`:** If not on the border, fills the outer box of the object with '2'.
6. **`O = modified_grid`:** Assigns the modified grid as the output.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, merge(
        recolor(2, outbox(obj)) 
        for obj in objects(I, T, T, T) 
        if sum(1 for (i, j) in toindices(obj) if i in (0, len(I)-1) or j in (0, len(I[0])-1)) == 0
    ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Extracts all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in ... if ...`:** Iterates over each object and applies a condition:
    * `sum(...) == 0`: This condition checks if the object touches the grid boundary. It sums up '1' for every cell of the object that lies on the first/last row or first/last column. If the sum is 0, the object doesn't touch the boundary.
3. **`recolor(2, outbox(obj))`:** For objects not touching the boundary, their outer box `outbox(obj)` is colored with value '2'.
4. **`merge(...)`:** All modified outer boxes are combined.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** The combined outer boxes are painted onto the original input grid `I` to generate the output. 

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    modified_indices = set()
    for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
        if not bordering(obj, I): 
            modified_indices.update(outbox(obj))
    return paint(I, recolor(2, frozenset(modified_indices)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`modified_indices = set()`:** Initialize an empty set to store indices to be modified.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):`:** Iterate through each object in the input grid.
3. **`if not bordering(obj, I):`:** Check if the object is not on the grid border.
4. **`modified_indices.update(outbox(obj))`:** If not on the border, add the indices of the object's outer box to the `modified_indices` set.
5. **`return paint(I, recolor(2, frozenset(modified_indices)))`:** 
    * Convert the `modified_indices` set to a frozenset to create a valid `Patch`.
    * Use `recolor` to change the color of all indices in the `modified_indices` set to '2'.
    * Finally, `paint` these modifications onto the original input grid `I` to generate the output grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return cellwise(I, paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(2, merge(outbox(obj) for obj in objects(I, T, T, T) if not bordering(obj, I)))), I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **`for obj in ... if not bordering(obj, I)`:** Iterates over each object and filters for objects not touching the border.
3. **`outbox(obj)`:**  Calculates the outer box for each eligible object.
4. **`merge(...)`:**  Combines all outer boxes into a single set of indices.
5. **`recolor(2, ...)`:**  Colors the combined outer box indices with '2'.
6. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates a blank canvas the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
7. **`paint(..., ...)`:** Paints the colored outer box onto the blank canvas.
8. **`cellwise(I, ..., I)`:**  Compares the input grid with the canvas containing the colored outer boxes. If the cells match (meaning the cell is part of the original object), it keeps the original color from the input. Otherwise, it takes the color from the canvas, which will be '2' for the outer boxes and the background color for everything else.


These different program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic structures.
