## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the "inbox" of each object in the grid and then changing the color of those cells within the inbox that don't belong to the object to the color '2'. The "inbox" of an object is defined by the smallest rectangle that encloses the object, excluding the outermost layer of cells. 

**Example:**

In Input_0, the object with color '2' has an inbox that includes the four corner cells of the object itself. These corner cells are recolored to '2'.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  return paint(I, merge(recolor(2, difference(inbox(obj), toindices(obj))) for obj in objects(I, T, T, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Identifies all objects in the grid `I`.
2. **`difference(inbox(obj), toindices(obj))`:** For each object `obj`, it calculates the difference between its inbox and the indices of the object itself. This results in the indices within the inbox that don't belong to the object.
3. **`recolor(2, ...)`:**  Recolors the cells at the calculated indices to color '2'.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the resulting sets of recolored cells for all objects.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged set of recolored cells onto the original grid `I`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  return paint(I, merge(prapply(lambda loc1, loc2: (2, loc2) if loc2 in inbox(obj) - toindices(obj) else (index(I, loc2), loc2), obj, obj) for obj in objects(I, T, T, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the grid `I`.
2. **`prapply(..., obj, obj)`:** For each object `obj`, applies the lambda function to each pair of locations within the object. 
3. **`lambda loc1, loc2: ...`:**  If `loc2` (the second location) is within the object's inbox but not part of the object, it recolors the cell at `loc2` to '2'; otherwise, it keeps the original color using `index(I, loc2)`.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the resulting sets of recolored cells for all objects.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged set of recolored cells onto the original grid `I`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda cell: (2, cell[1]) if cell[1] in inbox(obj) - toindices(obj) else cell, obj) for obj in objects(I, T, T, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the grid `I`.
2. **`apply(..., obj)`:** For each object `obj`, applies the lambda function to each cell within the object.
3. **`lambda cell: ...`:**  If the cell's location (`cell[1]`) is within the object's inbox but not part of the object, it recolors the cell to '2'; otherwise, it keeps the original cell.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the resulting sets of recolored cells for all objects.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged set of recolored cells onto the original grid `I`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  return paint(I, merge(recolor(2, mfilter(prapply(lambda loc1, loc2: loc2, obj, obj), lambda loc: loc in inbox(obj) - toindices(obj))) for obj in objects(I, T, T, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the grid `I`.
2. **`prapply(..., obj, obj)`:** For each object `obj`, applies the lambda function to each pair of locations within the object, effectively creating a set of all locations within each object.
3. **`mfilter(..., lambda loc: ...)`:**  Filters the locations from the previous step, keeping only those that are within the object's inbox but not part of the object itself.
4. **`recolor(2, ...)`:**  Recolors the cells at the filtered locations to color '2'.
5. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the resulting sets of recolored cells for all objects.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged set of recolored cells onto the original grid `I`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
    modified_objs = frozenset({recolor(2, difference(inbox(obj), toindices(obj))) for obj in objs})
    O = paint(I, merge(modified_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the grid `I` and stores them in the `objs` variable.
2. **`modified_objs = ...`:**  Creates a new frozenset called `modified_objs` by iterating through each `obj` in `objs` and applying the following transformation:
    - **`difference(inbox(obj), toindices(obj))`:**  Finds the cells within the object's inbox that aren't part of the object itself.
    - **`recolor(2, ...)`:** Recolors these cells to color '2'.
3. **`paint(I, merge(modified_objs))`:**  Merges the `modified_objs` and paints them onto the original grid `I` to produce the final output `O`.
4. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid `O`.

All five program versions achieve the desired transformation by identifying objects, calculating their inboxes, and recoloring the appropriate cells within the inboxes. However, they use different combinations of DSL functions, making them distinct solutions.
