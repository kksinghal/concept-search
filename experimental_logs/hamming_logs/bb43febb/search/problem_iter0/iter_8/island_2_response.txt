## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the grid and recoloring the inner cells of these objects to '2', while leaving the outer border of each object unchanged.

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The single connected object formed by the digit '5' has its inner cells recolored to '2', preserving the outer '5' border.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Both connected objects (one formed by '5' in the top half and the other by '5' in the bottom half) have their inner cells recolored to '2'. The outer borders of both objects retain the original '5' color. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(recolor(2, difference(toindices(obj), box(obj))) for obj in objects(I, T, T, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Identifies all connected objects in the grid `I`.
2. **`difference(toindices(obj), box(obj))`:**  For each object `obj`, this calculates the difference between the set of all indices within the object's bounding box (`box(obj)`) and the set of indices belonging to the object itself (`toindices(obj)`). This effectively selects the inner cells of the object.
3. **`recolor(2, ...)`:** Recolors the indices obtained in the previous step to the value '2'.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the sets of recolored indices from all objects into a single set.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the original grid `I` with the new color '2' at the indices obtained in the previous step.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(frozenset({(2, loc) for loc in difference(toindices(obj), box(obj))}) for obj in objects(I, T, T, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version is very similar to Version 1, with the main difference being how the recoloring is implemented. Instead of using `recolor`, it directly creates a frozenset of (value, index) pairs where the value is '2' and the index is taken from the inner cells of each object.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_inner(obj, loc):
    return not contained(loc, box(obj))
  return paint(I, merge(frozenset({(2, loc) for loc in filter(rbind(is_inner, obj), toindices(obj))}) for obj in objects(I, T, T, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version introduces a helper function `is_inner` that checks if an index `loc` is inside an object's bounding box. It uses `filter` and `rbind` to apply this function to each index within the object, effectively selecting the inner cells. The rest of the logic remains similar to Version 2.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  recolored_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    border = box(obj)
    recolored_obj = frozenset()
    for v, loc in obj:
      if not contained(loc, border):
        recolored_obj = insert((2, loc), recolored_obj)
      else:
        recolored_obj = insert((v, loc), recolored_obj)
    recolored_objs = insert(recolored_obj, recolored_objs)
  return paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each object and its cells individually. It checks if a cell belongs to the object's border. If it does, it keeps the original color; otherwise, it recolors the cell to '2'. 

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    for v, loc in obj:
      if contained(loc, box(obj)) and not contained(loc, inbox(obj)):
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(v, loc)})
      else:
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(2, loc)})
  return new_grid 
```

**Explanation:**

This version creates a new grid initialized with the background color. It then iterates through each object and its cells. If a cell is part of the object's outer border (in `box` but not in `inbox`), it paints the cell with its original color on the new grid. Otherwise, it paints the cell with '2'. This approach avoids modifying the original grid directly.
