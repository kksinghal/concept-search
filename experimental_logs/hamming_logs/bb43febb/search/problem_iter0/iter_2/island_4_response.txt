## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same color, excluding the background) and drawing a filled 3x3 square of color '2' within each object. The square is positioned so its upper-left corner aligns with the upper-left corner of the object's bounding box, shifted one cell to the right and one cell down.

**Input 0:** 
- Two objects are detected: a large '5' object and a smaller '5' object.
- For each object, a 3x3 square of '2's is drawn starting one cell down and one cell right from the object's top-left corner.

**Input 1:**
- Two objects are detected: a horizontal '5' object and a vertical '5' object.
- The same logic as in Input 0 is applied, drawing the 3x3 '2' squares within the bounding boxes of both objects.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  def inner_square(obj):
    ul = add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1)) 
    return shift(crop(canvas(2, (3, 3)), ORIGIN, (3, 3)), ul)
  inner_squares = mfilter(inner_square, objs) 
  O = paint(I, merge(inner_squares))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:** Identify all objects in the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **`inner_square(obj)`:**  Defines a function to calculate the inner square for a given object.
    - **`ul = add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1))`:** Calculate the upper-left corner of the inner square by adding (1,1) to the object's upper-left corner.
    - **`return shift(crop(canvas(2, (3, 3)), ORIGIN, (3, 3)), ul)`:** Create a 3x3 grid filled with '2's, crop it to the desired size (3x3), and then shift it to the calculated `ul` position.
3. **`inner_squares = mfilter(inner_square, objs)`:** Apply the `inner_square` function to each object and merge the resulting inner squares.
4. **`O = paint(I, merge(inner_squares))`:** Paint the merged inner squares onto the original input grid `I`.
5. **`return O`:** Return the modified grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  def paint_inner(obj):
    ul = add(ulcorner(obj), (1,1))
    return recolor(2, backdrop(shift(crop(canvas(0, (2,2)), ORIGIN, (2,2)), ul)))
  O = paint(I, merge(mpapply(paint_inner, objs)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version takes a slightly different approach to generating the inner squares:

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:** Same as in Version 1.
2. **`paint_inner(obj)`:** Defines a function that directly recolors the appropriate cells within the object's bounding box to '2'.
    - **`ul = add(ulcorner(obj), (1,1))`:**  Calculate the upper-left corner of the inner square.
    - **`shift(crop(canvas(0, (2,2)), ORIGIN, (2,2)), ul)`:**  Create a 2x2 temporary grid, shift it to the `ul` position.
    - **`backdrop(...)`:** Get all indices within the bounding box of the shifted 2x2 grid.
    - **`recolor(2, ...)`:**  Recolor the identified indices to '2'.
3. **`O = paint(I, merge(mpapply(paint_inner, objs)))`:** Similar to Version 1, apply the `paint_inner` function to each object, merge the results, and paint them onto the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def paint_square(obj):
    i, j = add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1))
    return frozenset({(2, (i + di, j + dj)) for di in range(3) for dj in range(3)})
  O = paint(I, merge(mpapply(paint_square, fgpartition(I))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on directly generating the cells for the inner square:

1. **`paint_square(obj)`:** Defines a function that constructs the set of cells for the inner square.
    - **`i, j = add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1))`:** Calculate the upper-left corner of the inner square.
    - **`return frozenset({(2, (i + di, j + dj)) for di in range(3) for dj in range(3)})`:**  Generate a set of cells with color '2' representing the 3x3 square, offset by `i` and `j`.
2. **`O = paint(I, merge(mpapply(paint_square, fgpartition(I))))`:**  Identify objects, apply `paint_square`, merge the resulting squares, and paint them onto the input.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def fill_inner(obj):
    start = add(ulcorner(obj), (1,1))
    return fill(canvas(0, (3, 3)), 2, shift(asindices(canvas(0, (3, 3))), start))
  inner_filled = mpapply(fill_inner, fgpartition(I))
  O = paint(I, merge(inner_filled))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes `fill` to generate the inner squares:

1. **`fill_inner(obj)`:** Defines a function to create a filled inner square for a given object.
    - **`start = add(ulcorner(obj), (1,1))`:** Calculate the starting position for the square.
    - **`fill(canvas(0, (3, 3)), 2, shift(asindices(canvas(0, (3, 3))), start))`:** Create a 3x3 canvas, get its indices, shift them to the `start` position, and fill the canvas with '2's at those indices.
2. **`inner_filled = mpapply(fill_inner, fgpartition(I))`:**  Identify objects, apply `fill_inner`, and merge the resulting squares.
3. **`O = paint(I, merge(inner_filled))`:**  Paint the merged squares onto the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def inner_rect(obj):
    ul = add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1))
    return toobject(shift(asindices(canvas(0, (3, 3))), ul), canvas(2, (3, 3)))
  inner_rects = mfilter(inner_rect, fgpartition(I))
  O = paint(I, merge(inner_rects))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses `toobject` to create the object representing the inner square:

1. **`inner_rect(obj)`:** Defines a function that generates the object for the inner square.
    - **`ul = add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1))`:** Calculate the upper-left corner.
    - **`toobject(shift(asindices(canvas(0, (3, 3))), ul), canvas(2, (3, 3)))`:** Create a 3x3 canvas filled with '2's, get its indices, shift them to the `ul` position, and convert the result to an object.
2. **`inner_rects = mfilter(inner_rect, fgpartition(I))`:**  Identify objects, apply `inner_rect`, and merge the resulting squares.
3. **`O = paint(I, merge(inner_rects))`:**  Paint the merged squares onto the input.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. Each version provides a distinct logic path while using valid functions and constructs from the DSL.
