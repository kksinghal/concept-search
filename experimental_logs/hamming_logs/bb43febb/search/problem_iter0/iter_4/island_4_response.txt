## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation modifies objects in the grid by recoloring a specific inner region. This region is a 3x3 square located within each object, offset by one cell from the object's upper-left corner.  However, the recoloring only occurs within the right half of each object.

**Let's illustrate with examples:**

* **Input_0:** The 5x5 square object has its inner 3x3 region (offset by one cell from the top and left) recolored to '2'. This recoloring happens only in the right half of the object.
* **Input_1:** Both 5x7 and 5x5 objects are modified. The 3x3 inner regions are recolored to '2' but only for cells on the right half of each object.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL:


**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  def recolor_half_inner(obj):
    if width(obj) <= 3 or height(obj) <= 3:
      return obj
    ul = add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1))
    inner = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(ul[0], ul[0] + 3) for j in range(ul[1] + width(obj)//2, min(ul[1] + width(obj)//2 + 3, width(obj))))
    return recolor(2, inner.intersection(toindices(obj)))
  recolored = apply(recolor_half_inner, objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(recolored))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Divides the input grid `I` into separate objects, excluding the background.
2. **`recolor_half_inner(obj)`:**  This function processes each object:
   - It handles cases where the object is too small (width or height <= 3).
   - Calculates the upper-left corner (`ul`) of the inner 3x3 region.
   - Defines `inner` as the indices within the 3x3 region but only for the right half of the object.
   - Recolors the `inner` indices to '2' if they are part of the object.
3. **`apply(recolor_half_inner, objs)`:** Applies the `recolor_half_inner` function to each object in `objs`.
4. **`merge(recolored)`:** Combines the modified objects back into a single object set.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the modified objects onto the original grid `I` to produce the output `O`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  def recolor_right(obj):
    if width(obj) <= 3 or height(obj) <= 3:
      return obj
    ul = add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1))
    right_half = frozenset((i, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j >= leftmost(obj) + width(obj)//2)
    inner_square = shift(asindices(canvas(0, (3, 3))), ul)
    return recolor(2, intersection(right_half, inner_square, toindices(obj)))
  O = paint(I, merge(apply(recolor_right, objs)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Same as Version 1.
2. **`recolor_right(obj)`:**
   - Handles small object cases.
   - Calculates the upper-left corner (`ul`) of the inner 3x3 region.
   - `right_half` selects indices belonging to the right half of the object.
   - `inner_square` defines indices of a 3x3 square at the calculated position.
   - Recolors the intersection of `right_half`, `inner_square`, and the object's indices to '2'.
3. The remaining steps are analogous to Version 1.


**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  def modify_obj(obj):
    if width(obj) <= 3 or height(obj) <= 3:
      return obj
    mid = leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2
    return frozenset(
        (2 if (i, j) in shift(asindices(canvas(0, (3, 3))), add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1))) and j >= mid
         else c, (i, j))
        for c, (i, j) in obj
    )
  O = paint(I, merge(apply(modify_obj, objs)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Same as previous versions.
2. **`modify_obj(obj)`:**
   - Handles small object cases.
   - Calculates the middle column (`mid`) of the object.
   - Iterates through each cell (`c`, `(i, j)`) of the object.
   - If the cell is inside the inner 3x3 region and on or to the right of the middle column, its color is changed to '2'.
3. The remaining steps are analogous to previous versions.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  def recolor_inner_right(obj):
    if width(obj) <= 3 or height(obj) <= 3:
      return obj
    ul = add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1))
    return recolor(2, frozenset(
        (i, j) for i in range(ul[0], ul[0] + 3) for j in range(max(ul[1], leftmost(obj) + width(obj)//2), min(ul[1] + 3, rightmost(obj) + 1))
    ).intersection(toindices(obj)))
  O = paint(I, merge(apply(recolor_inner_right, objs)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Same as previous versions.
2. **`recolor_inner_right(obj)`:** 
    - Handles small object cases.
    - Calculates the upper-left corner (`ul`) of the inner 3x3 region.
    - Defines the range of columns to recolor ensuring it stays within the right half of the object using `max(ul[1], leftmost(obj) + width(obj)//2)` and  `min(ul[1] + 3, rightmost(obj) + 1)`. 
    - Recolors the intersection of this region and the object's indices to '2'.
3.  The remaining steps are analogous to previous versions.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  def right_inner_recolor(obj):
    if width(obj) <= 3 or height(obj) <= 3:
      return obj
    offset = (1, 1 + width(obj) // 2)
    inner_right = shift(asindices(canvas(0, (3, 3))), add(ulcorner(obj), offset))
    return recolor(2, intersection(inner_right, toindices(obj)))
  O = paint(I, merge(apply(right_inner_recolor, objs)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Same as previous versions.
2. **`right_inner_recolor(obj)`:**
    - Handles small object cases.
    - Calculates an `offset` to position the inner square in the right half.
    - `inner_right` defines the indices for the inner 3x3 region shifted to the right half.
    - It recolors the intersection of `inner_right` and the object's indices to '2'.
3. The remaining steps are analogous to previous versions.

These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation. They demonstrate the flexibility and expressive power of the DSL by using various combinations of functions and logic.
