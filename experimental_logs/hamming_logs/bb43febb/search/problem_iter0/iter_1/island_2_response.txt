## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the grid and then recoloring the inner cells of these objects while leaving a one-cell border intact. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- The input grid contains a single object formed by the digit '5'.
- The output grid retains the shape of the '5' object but the cells within its boundary are recolored to '2', leaving a one-cell border of '5'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- The input grid contains two objects formed by the digit '5'.
- The output grid applies the same recoloring logic to both '5' objects independently. The inner cells are changed to '2' while maintaining a one-cell border of '5'.


## Program Versions & Explanations:

Here are five distinct code versions for "Program_to_be_generated" utilizing the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:** (Inspired by Program_A, utilizes `inbox`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  modified_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    inner_box = inbox(obj)
    modified_obj = recolor(2, intersection(toindices(obj), inner_box))
    modified_objs = insert(modified_obj, modified_objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(modified_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:** For each object, `inbox(obj)` gets the indices of its inner box.  Then, `intersection` finds the common cells between the object and its inner box, which are then recolored to '2' using `recolor`.
3. **Paint Modified Objects:** Finally, all modified objects are merged and painted back onto the original grid using `paint`.

**Program Version 2:** (Inspired by Program_A, utilizes `difference` and `box`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  modified_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    border = difference(toindices(obj), inbox(obj))
    modified_obj = recolor(2, difference(toindices(obj), border))
    modified_objs = insert(modified_obj, modified_objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(modified_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1, `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all objects.
2. **Calculate Border:** For each object, `difference` is used to find the border cells by subtracting the `inbox` (inner cells) from the object's indices.
3. **Recolor and Paint:**  The inner cells are then identified by subtracting the `border` cells from the object's indices and recolored to '2'. Finally, the modified objects are painted back onto the grid.

**Program Version 3:** (Inspired by Program_B, utilizes `delta` and object properties)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  modified_grid = I
  for obj in objs:
    if height(obj) > 2 and width(obj) > 2:
      modified_grid = fill(modified_grid, 2, delta(obj))
  return modified_grid 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, T, T)` is used to identify all objects.
2. **Filter and Recolor:** The code iterates through each object and checks if its height and width are greater than 2 (to exclude single-cell or line objects). If true, it uses `delta(obj)` to get the indices surrounding the object and fills them with '2' using `fill`.

**Program Version 4:** (Inspired by Program_A, utilizes list comprehension)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    ul = ulcorner(obj)
    lr = lrcorner(obj)
    O = tuple(
        tuple(
          2 if ul[0] < i < lr[0] and ul[1] < j < lr[1] and O[i][j] == color(obj) else O[i][j] 
          for j in range(len(O[0]))
        ) for i in range(len(O))
    )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions, `objects` identifies all objects.
2. **Recolor with List Comprehension:** This version directly modifies the grid `O`. It iterates through each object, gets its corners (`ulcorner`, `lrcorner`), and uses list comprehension to recolor cells within the object boundaries to '2' if their original color matches the object's color. 

**Program Version 5:** (Inspired by Program_A, utilizes `crop` and `paint`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  modified_grid = I
  for obj in objs:
    sub_grid = crop(I, ulcorner(obj), shape(obj))
    modified_sub_grid = tuple(
      tuple(2 if 0 < i < len(row)-1 and 0 < j < len(row[0])-1 else val for j, val in enumerate(row))
      for i, row in enumerate(sub_grid)
    )
    modified_grid = paint(modified_grid, asobject(modified_sub_grid))
  return modified_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Crop:** The code identifies objects and then uses `crop` to extract the smallest subgrid containing each object.
2. **Modify Subgrid:** It then iterates through each cell of the subgrid and recolors the inner cells (excluding the border) to '2'.
3. **Paint Back:** The modified subgrid is converted to an object using `asobject` and painted back onto the original grid. 


These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. Each version utilizes a different combination of DSL functions and logic, offering a range of solutions to the problem.
