## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the 'inbox' of each object in the grid, where the 'inbox' refers to the cells located one unit away from the object's border within the object's bounding box. 

* **For each object:**
    * The transformation identifies the object's 'inbox'.
    * It recolors the cells within the 'inbox' to the value '2'.

This effectively creates an inner border within each object, highlighting the cells just inside the object's boundary.


## Program Version 1: 

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    inbox_indices = inbox(toindices(obj))
    I = underfill(I, TWO, inbox_indices)
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies all distinct objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in objs:`:**  Iterates through each detected object.
3. **`inbox_indices = inbox(toindices(obj))`:** Calculates the indices of the 'inbox' for the current object.
4. **`I = underfill(I, TWO, inbox_indices)`:**  Fills the 'inbox' indices with the value '2' while preserving the original values of non-background cells.
5. **`O = I`:** Assigns the modified grid to the output grid `O`.
6. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = underfill(O, TWO, inbox(toindices(obj)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid `O` with the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):`:** Iterates over each object in the input grid.
3. **`O = underfill(O, TWO, inbox(toindices(obj)))`:**  For each object, it calculates its 'inbox' indices and fills those positions in the output grid `O` with the value '2', only if the cell was originally background. 
4. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid `O`.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(TWO, intersection(inbox(toindices(obj)), ofcolor(I, mostcolor(I)))), objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a more functional approach with nested function calls:

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: ..., objects(I, T, F, T))`:**  For each object, applies a lambda function.
3. **`lambda obj: recolor(TWO, intersection(inbox(toindices(obj)), ofcolor(I, mostcolor(I))))`:** This lambda function does the following for each object:
    *  **`inbox(toindices(obj))`:** Calculates the 'inbox' indices of the object.
    *  **`ofcolor(I, mostcolor(I))`:**  Gets the indices of all background cells in the grid.
    *  **`intersection(..., ...)`:**  Finds the common indices between the object's 'inbox' and the background cells.
    *  **`recolor(TWO, ...)`:** Recolors these common indices to the value '2'.
4. **`merge(...)`:**  Merges the results from all objects into a single object representing all 'inbox' cells to be recolored.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the identified 'inbox' cells in the input grid `I` with the value '2' and returns the result.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  fill_indices = set()
  for obj in objs:
    fill_indices.update(inbox(toindices(obj)))
  O = fill(I, TWO, fill_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **`fill_indices = set()`:** Initializes an empty set to store the indices that need to be filled.
3. **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterates through each object.
4. **`fill_indices.update(inbox(toindices(obj)))`:**  For each object, it calculates the 'inbox' indices and adds them to the `fill_indices` set.
5. **`O = fill(I, TWO, fill_indices)`:**  Fills all the indices in the `fill_indices` set with the value '2' in the input grid `I` and assigns the result to the output grid `O`.
6. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid `O`.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
    def process_object(obj):
        return recolor(TWO, inbox(toindices(obj)))
    
    new_objects = apply(process_object, objects(I, T, F, T))
    O = I
    for obj in new_objects:
        O = underpaint(O, obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def process_object(obj): ...`:** Defines a helper function `process_object` that takes an object as input, calculates its 'inbox', and recolors the 'inbox' cells to the value '2'.
2. **`new_objects = apply(process_object, objects(I, T, F, T))`:** Applies the `process_object` function to each object detected in the input grid, creating a new set of objects with modified 'inbox' colors.
3. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid `O` with the input grid `I`.
4. **`for obj in new_objects: ...`:** Iterates through the new set of objects.
5. **`O = underpaint(O, obj)`:**  For each object, it paints the object onto the output grid `O` but only where the output grid currently has the background color. This ensures that existing non-background cells are not overwritten. 
6. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid `O`.

These five programs demonstrate different ways to achieve the same grid transformation using the provided DSL functions. They highlight the flexibility of the DSL and the various approaches to problem-solving within its constraints.
