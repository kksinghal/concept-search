## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the smallest object in the grid (excluding the background) and changing the color of a specific cell within that object to '1'. The target cell to be changed is the bottom-rightmost cell of the smallest object.

**Example:**

Input_0:

```
0 2 2
0 2 2
2 0 0
```

The smallest object is represented by the digit '2' and consists of only one cell at position (2, 0). Therefore, the output is:

Output_0:

```
0 2 2
0 2 2
1 0 0 
```

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I) # Partition the grid into objects, excluding background
  smallest_obj = argmin(objs, size) # Find the smallest object
  target_cell = lrcorner(smallest_obj) # Get the lower right corner of the smallest object
  O = fill(I, 1, {target_cell}) # Change the target cell's color to '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`**: Partitions the input grid `I` into objects, excluding the background color.
2. **`argmin(objs, size)`**:  Finds the smallest object from the set of objects `objs` based on their size.
3. **`lrcorner(smallest_obj)`**:  Determines the indices of the lower-right corner cell of the `smallest_obj`.
4. **`fill(I, 1, {target_cell})`**:  Creates a new grid `O` by copying `I` and changing the color of the `target_cell` to '1'.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  smallest_obj = min(objs, key=lambda obj: len(obj)) # Find smallest object
  target_cell = max(toindices(smallest_obj)) # Get the maximum index (bottom-right) 
  return fill(I, 1, {target_cell})
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a different approach to find the smallest object and its target cell. It utilizes `min` with a lambda function to find the smallest object based on length. Then, it directly finds the maximum index within the object's indices, representing the bottom-rightmost cell, using the `max` function.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = [obj for obj in fgpartition(I) if len(obj) > 0] # Filter out empty objects
  min_size = min(len(obj) for obj in objs) # Find the size of the smallest object
  smallest_obj = next(obj for obj in objs if len(obj) == min_size) # Get the smallest object
  max_i = max(i for i, j in toindices(smallest_obj))
  target_cell = max((i, j) for i, j in toindices(smallest_obj) if i == max_i) # Get bottom-right cell
  return fill(I, 1, {target_cell}) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version explicitly filters out any empty objects before finding the smallest one. It then iterates through the objects to find the one with the minimum size and extracts the bottom-rightmost cell by first identifying the maximum row index (`max_i`) and then selecting the cell with the maximum column index within that row.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  def bottom_right(obj):
    return max(toindices(obj))
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  smallest_obj = min(objs, key=bottom_right) # Find smallest object with bottom-rightmost cell prioritized
  target_cell = bottom_right(smallest_obj)
  return fill(I, 1, {target_cell})
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a custom function `bottom_right` to find the bottom-rightmost cell of an object. It then utilizes this function within the `min` function to prioritize finding the smallest object that has the bottom-rightmost cell among all objects with the same size.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  def sort_key(obj):
    i, j = lrcorner(obj)
    return len(obj), i * 1000 + j # Prioritize bottom-rightmost cells 

  objs = fgpartition(I)
  smallest_obj = min(objs, key=sort_key)
  target_cell = lrcorner(smallest_obj)
  return fill(I, 1, {target_cell})
```

**Explanation:** 

This version uses a custom sorting key function `sort_key` that prioritizes objects based on size and then by the location of their bottom-right corner.  The  `i * 1000 + j`  calculation ensures that cells in lower rows and then further to the right are considered "larger," effectively prioritizing the bottom-rightmost cell.


Each of these program versions implements the same transformation logic described in the "Transformation Analysis" section using different combinations of DSL functions.
