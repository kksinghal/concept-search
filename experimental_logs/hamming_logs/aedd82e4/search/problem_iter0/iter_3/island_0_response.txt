## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the rightmost column of the input grid.  Here's a breakdown:

* **Identify Target Cells:** The transformation targets specific cells in the rightmost column based on these conditions:
    * **Condition 1:** The cell contains the value '2'.
    * **Condition 2:**  The cell is the bottom-most cell containing '2' in the rightmost column. 
* **Modification:** The targeted cells, along with the cell directly below the bottom-most targeted cell, are changed to the value '1'.

Let's illustrate with an example (Input_1):

```
Input_1:         
2 2 2 0      
0 2 0 0     
0 0 0 2  <-- Target Cell (bottom-most '2' in the rightmost column)   
0 2 0 0     
             
Output_1:
2 2 2 0
0 2 0 0
0 0 0 1 
0 1 0 0  <-- Cell below target also changed to '1'
```

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Find indices of '2' in the rightmost column
    rightmost_twos = frozenset((i,j) for i,row in enumerate(I) for j,v in enumerate(row) if v==2 and j==width(I)-1)
    # Get the index of the bottom-most '2'
    target_cell = argmax(rightmost_twos, lambda x: x[0])
    # Get the index of the cell below the target
    cell_below = (target_cell[0] + 1, target_cell[1])
    # Fill both target cells with '1'
    O = fill(I, 1, {target_cell, cell_below})
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Target Cells:**  We find the indices of all '2's in the rightmost column and then use `argmax` to get the index of the bottom-most one.
2. **Cell Below:** We calculate the index of the cell directly below the target cell.
3. **Fill:** We use the `fill` function to change the value of both the target cell and the cell below it to '1'.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Transpose the grid to work with columns as rows
  transposed_grid = dmirror(I) 
  # Find the last row that contains a '2'
  target_row_index = max((i for i, row in enumerate(transposed_grid) if 2 in row), default=0)
  # Get the index of the last '2' in that row
  target_col_index = max((j for j, v in enumerate(transposed_grid[target_row_index]) if v == 2), default=0)
  # Transpose back to original orientation
  O = dmirror(fill(transposed_grid, 1, {(target_row_index, target_col_index), (target_row_index + 1, target_col_index)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Transpose:** We transpose the grid using `dmirror` to make it easier to work with columns.
2. **Find Target Row & Column:** We iterate through the rows (now representing columns) to find the last one containing a '2', giving us the target row index. We then find the index of the last '2' in that row, giving us the target column index.
3. **Fill:** We fill the target cell and the cell below it (in the transposed grid) with '1'.
4. **Transpose Back:**  We transpose the grid back to its original orientation using `dmirror`.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Reverse the grid vertically to simplify finding the bottom-most '2'
  reversed_grid =  tuple(tuple(row[::-1]) for row in I[::-1])
  # Find the first occurrence of '2' in the first row 
  target_col_index = next((j for j, v in enumerate(reversed_grid[0]) if v == 2), len(reversed_grid[0]) - 1)
  # Fill and reverse back
  O = tuple(tuple(row[::-1]) for row in fill(reversed_grid, 1, {(0, target_col_index), (1, target_col_index)})[::-1])
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Reverse Grid:** The grid is reversed vertically using slicing and list comprehension to simplify finding the bottom-most '2', which is now the top-most.
2. **Find Target Column:**  We iterate through the first row of the reversed grid to find the first occurrence of '2', giving us the target column index.
3. **Fill:** We fill the target cell and the cell below (in the reversed grid) with '1'.
4. **Reverse Back:** We reverse the grid back to its original orientation.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for j in range(width(I)-1, -1, -1): # Iterate through columns from right to left
    found = False
    for i in range(height(I)-1, -1, -1): # Iterate through rows from bottom to top
      if I[i][j] == 2:
        I = fill(I, 1, {(i, j), (i + 1, j)})
        found = True
        break
    if found:
      break
  return I 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through Columns:** The program iterates through the columns of the grid from right to left.
2. **Iterate through Rows:** For each column, it iterates through the rows from bottom to top.
3. **Find & Fill:**  If a cell containing '2' is found, it's filled with '1' along with the cell below it. The loop then breaks to avoid modifying other cells in the same column.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      1 if (j == width(I) - 1 and v == 2 and any(val == 2 for val in row[j:])) or (j == width(I) - 1 and i > 0 and I[i-1][j] == 2 and any(val == 2 for val in I[i-1][j:])) else v 
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    ) 
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Nested List Comprehension:** This version uses nested list comprehension to iterate through each cell in the grid.
2. **Conditional Replacement:** It uses a conditional statement to check if a cell meets the criteria for replacement with '1':
  * The cell is in the last column (`j == width(I) - 1`).
  * The cell contains the value '2' (`v == 2`).
  * It's either the bottom-most '2' in the column (`any(val == 2 for val in row[j:])`) or the cell below it  (`i > 0 and I[i-1][j] == 2 and any(val == 2 for val in I[i-1][j:])`).
3. **In-Place Modification:** The list comprehension directly modifies the grid and returns the modified grid. 

These five versions showcase diverse approaches to achieving the same transformation using different DSL functions and logic.
