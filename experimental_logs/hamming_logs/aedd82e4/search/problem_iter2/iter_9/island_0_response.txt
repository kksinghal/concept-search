## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:** 
The transformation involves identifying the lowermost left cell of the largest object formed by the digit '0'. Then, the digit in this cell is replaced with '1'.

**Input 1 -> Output 1:**
A 4x4 grid is generated where the main diagonal and the cell (3,3) are filled with '2'. The remaining cells are filled with '0', except for cell (3,1) which is filled with '1'.

**Input 2 -> Output 2:**
The input grid is extended with additional columns and rows. A column of '0's is added to the right of the input grid. Two rows are then added below: 
    - The first row is identical to the input grid with an extra '0' at the end and the lowermost right digit replaced by '1'. 
    - The second row consists of '0's except for the last two cells which are filled with '2' and '2'. 

**Input 3 -> Output 3:** 
Similar to Input 0 -> Output 0, this transformation involves locating the lowermost left cell of the largest object formed by the digit '0' and changing the digit in this cell to '1'. 


## Program to be Generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  if h == 1 and w == 1: # Single digit input
    O = canvas(ZERO, (FOUR, FOUR))
    O = fill(O, TWO, difference(asindices(O), {(THREE, THREE)}))
    O = fill(O, ONE, {(THREE, ONE)})
  else:
    O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), asobject(I))
    target_object = argmax(objects(I, False, False, False), lambda obj: colorcount(obj, ZERO))
    target_loc = llcorner(toindices(target_object))
    O = fill(O, ONE, {target_loc})
    if h == 2:
      O = vconcat(hconcat(O, canvas(ZERO, (h, w))), canvas(ZERO, (h, 2 * w)))
      O = vconcat(O, hconcat(I, canvas(ZERO, (h, w))))
      O = fill(O, ONE, {(len(O)-1, len(O[0])-2)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **Single Digit Input (h=1, w=1):** 
    - Create a 4x4 canvas filled with '0's.
    - Fill cells on the main diagonal and cell (3,3) with '2'.
    - Fill cell (3,1) with '1'.

- **Multi-digit Input:**
    - Create a canvas with the same dimensions as the input, filled with '0's.
    - Paint the input objects onto the canvas.
    - Find the largest object formed by the digit '0'.
    - Get the indices of the lowermost left cell of this object.
    - Fill the identified cell with '1'.
    - If the input height is 2:
        - Extend the canvas by adding a column of '0's to the right.
        - Add two rows below:
            - First row: Copy the current canvas, add an extra '0' at the end, and replace the lowermost right digit with '1'.
            - Second row: Fill with '0's except for the last two cells which are filled with '2' and '2'.
