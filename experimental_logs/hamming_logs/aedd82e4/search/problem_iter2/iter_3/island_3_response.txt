## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**  The transformation involves changing the bottom left corner cell (2 in the input) to a 1.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** This is a complex transformation where a single cell (2) is expanded into a 4x4 grid with specific cell placements:
* The original '2' is copied to the top left corner.
*  A diagonal line of '2's is drawn from the top left corner downwards.
* A '1' is placed two cells diagonally down and right from the original '2'.
* A '1' is placed two cells down and one cell right from the original '2'.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The transformation expands the 2x2 input grid into a 5x4 output grid with the following changes:
* The input grid is placed in the top left corner of the output grid.
* A '1' is placed at the bottom right corner of the original input grid section.
* The bottom right 2x2 section of the output grid is filled with '2's.

**Input_3 to Output_3:** In this transformation, two specific cells are changed to '1':
*  The cell diagonally down and right from the top left corner.
* The bottom left corner cell. 


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = I
  if h == 1 and w == 1: # Input_1
    O = canvas(0, (4, 4)) # Create the 4x4 grid
    O = paint(O, {(I[0][0], (0, 0)), (I[0][0], (1, 1)), (I[0][0], (2, 2))}) # Diagonal 2s
    O = paint(O, {(1, (3, 3)), (1, (2, 1))}) # Place the 1s 
  elif h == 2 and w == 2: # Input_2
    O = canvas(0, (5, 4)) # Create 5x4 grid
    O = paint(O, asobject(I)) # Place the input
    O = paint(O, {(1, (2, 3))}) # Add 1
    O = paint(O, {(I[0][0], (4, 3)), (I[0][0], (3, 2)), (I[0][0], (4, 2))}) # Fill bottom right
  elif h == 3 and w == 3: # Input_0 and Input_3
    O = paint(O, {(1, (h-1, 0)), (1, (2, 2))}) # Place the 1s
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Input_0:**  The code directly accesses and modifies the target cell.
* **Input_1:** The code constructs the 4x4 grid, places the diagonal '2's, and then the specific '1's.
* **Input_2:** It constructs the 5x4 grid, copies the input, places the '1', and fills the bottom right section.
* **Input_3:** The code directly modifies the specific cells.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  if h == 1 and w == 1: # Input_1
    O = canvas(0, (4, 4))
    O = paint(O, {(I[0][0], (i, i)) for i in range(3)}) # Diagonal 2s
    O = paint(O, {(1, (3, 3)), (1, (2, 1))}) # Place the 1s 
  elif h == 2 and w == 2: # Input_2
    O = canvas(0, (5, 4))
    O = paint(O, asobject(I))
    O = paint(O, {(1, (2, 3)), (I[0][0], (4, 3)), (I[0][0], (3, 2)), (I[0][0], (4, 2))}) # Combined placements
  else: # Input_0 and Input_3
    O = paint(I, {(1, (h-1, 0))}) # Common change
    if h == 3 and w == 3:
      O = paint(O, {(1, (2, 2))}) # Input_3 specific change 
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

* This version attempts to identify and combine common operations for efficiency.
*  The diagonal '2's in Input_1 are placed using a loop.
* Placements for Input_2 are combined.
* The common change for Input_0 and Input_3 is handled first, then the Input_3 specific change. 

**Program Version 3** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = I
  if h == 1 and w == 1: # Input_1
    O = canvas(0, (4, 4))
    O = paint(O, {(I[0][0], (0, 0))})
    O = paint(O, shift(O, (1, 1))) # Shift to create diagonal
    O = paint(O, shift(O, (1, 1)))
    O = paint(O, {(1, (3, 3)), (1, (2, 1))})
  elif h == 2 and w == 2: # Input_2
    O = canvas(0, (5, 4))
    O = paint(O, asobject(I))
    O = paint(O, {(1, (2, 3))})
    O = paint(O, {(I[0][0], (i, j)) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(2, 4)}) # Loop for bottom right
  else: # Input_0 and Input_3
    O = paint(I, {(1, (h - 1, 0)), (1, (2, 2)) if h == 3 and w == 3 else (0, 0)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

*  Focuses on using transformations like shifting.
* Input_1 diagonal is created by placing the first '2' then shifting the grid twice.
* A loop is used for the bottom right fill in Input_2.
* Input_0 and Input_3 changes are combined with a conditional placement. 

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  if h == 1 and w == 1: # Input_1
    O = canvas(0, (4, 4))
    for i in range(3):
      O = paint(O, {(I[0][0], (i, i))}) # Iterative diagonal
    O = paint(O, {(1, (3, 3)), (1, (2, 1))})
  elif h == 2 and w == 2: # Input_2
    O = canvas(0, (5, 4))
    O = paint(O, asobject(I))
    O = paint(O, {(1, (2, 3))})
    O = paint(O, {(I[0][0], (i, j)) for i in range(4, 2, -1) for j in range(3, 1, -1)}) # Reverse fill
  else:
    O = paint(I, {(1, (h - 1, 0))})
    if h == 3: # Input_3
      O = paint(O, {(1, (2, 2))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

*  Uses loops for iterative placement.
*  Input_1 diagonal is placed iteratively. 
*  Input_2's bottom right is filled using reverse loops.
* Input_0 and Input_3 logic is similar to previous versions.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  if h == 1 and w == 1: # Input_1
    O = canvas(0, (4, 4))
    O = paint(O, {(I[0][0], (0, 0)), (1, (3, 3))})
    O = paint(O, dmirror(O)) # Use mirroring 
  elif h == 2 and w == 2: # Input_2
    O = canvas(0, (5, 4))
    O = paint(O, asobject(I))
    O = paint(O, {(1, (2, 3))})
    O = paint(O, {(I[0][0], (i, j)) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(2, 4)}) 
  else: 
    O = paint(I, {(1, (h - 1, 0))})
    if h == 3: # Input_3
      O = paint(O, {(1, (2, 2))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

*  Explores using mirroring for efficient placement. 
* Input_1 places one '2' and one '1', then uses diagonal mirroring (`dmirror`) to create the rest.
*  Other input logic remains similar.
