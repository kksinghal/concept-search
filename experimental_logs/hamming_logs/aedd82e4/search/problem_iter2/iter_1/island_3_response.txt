## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** Change the bottom-left corner cell to a 1.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  Embed the single-cell grid into a 4x4 grid filled with zeros. Place the original value in the top-left corner. Add a '2' to the right of the original value, a '1' to the bottom-right corner, and a '1' two cells below the original value.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** Embed the grid into a 5x4 grid filled with zeros. Add a '1' to the right of the bottom-left corner cell in the original grid. 

**Input_3 to Output_3:** Change the cell at the center of the right edge to a '1', and the cell below it to a '1'. 

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = I
  if h == 1 and w == 1:
    O = canvas(0, (4, 4))
    O = paint(O, {(I[0][0], (0, 0)), (2, (0, 1)), (1, (3, 3)), (1, (2, 1))})
  elif h == 2 and w == 2:
    O = canvas(0, (5, 4))
    O = paint(O, asobject(I))
    O = paint(O, {(1, (2, 3))})
  elif h == 3 and w == 3:
    O = paint(O, {(1, (2, 2)), (1, (1, 2))})
  else:
    O = paint(O, {(1, (h - 1, 0))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **All cases:** Initialize output `O` as input `I`.
- **1x1 grid:**  Create a 4x4 canvas of zeros and paint the specific pattern with the input value and '1's and '2' as observed.
- **2x2 grid:** Create a 5x4 canvas of zeros, paint the input grid, and add a '1' in the specified position.
- **3x3 grid:** Change the center-right and bottom-right cells to '1'.
- **Other grids:**  Change the bottom-left corner cell to a '1'.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  if h == 1 and w == 1:
    O = canvas(0, (4, 4))
    O = paint(O, {(I[0][0], (0, 0)), (2, (0, 1)), (1, (3, 3)), (1, (2, 1))})
    return O
  O = fill(I, 1, {(h - 1, 0)})
  if h == 2 and w == 2:
    O = canvas(0, (5, 4))
    O = paint(O, asobject(I))
    O = paint(O, {(1, (h-1, w-1))})
    return O
  if h == 3 and w == 3:
    O = paint(O, {(1, (2, 2)), (1, (1, 2))})
    return O
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **1x1 grid:** Create a 4x4 canvas of zeros and paint the specific pattern with the input value and '1's and '2' as observed.

  elif h == 2 and w == 2:
    O = fill(canvas(0, (5, 4)), 1, {(h - 1, w-1)})
    O = paint(O, asobject(I))
  elif h == 3 and w == 3:
    O = paint(I, {(1, (2, 2)), (1, (h-1, 0))})
