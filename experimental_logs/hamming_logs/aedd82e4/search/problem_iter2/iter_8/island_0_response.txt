## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:** The transformation involves identifying the lower-left corner cell of the object formed by zeros and changing its value to 1. 

**Input 1 -> Output 1:** A 4x4 grid is generated. The lower-left 3x3 subgrid is filled with a diagonal pattern of '2's and the rest of the grid is filled with '0's.  The bottom-right corner of this 3x3 subgrid is set to '1'.

**Input 2 -> Output 2:** The input grid is extended to a 5x4 grid. The original grid is placed at the top-left corner. A '1' is inserted at the bottom-right corner of the extended grid. The rest of the extended grid is filled with '0's except the bottom two rows and right two columns which are filled with original input grid.

**Input 3 -> Output 3:** The transformation identifies the rightmost cell of the object formed by zeros and changes its value to 1. 


## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  if h == 1 and w == 1: # Single digit input
    O = canvas(ZERO, (FOUR, FOUR))
    O = fill(O, TWO, difference(asindices(O), {(THREE, THREE)}))
    O = fill(O, ONE, {(THREE, THREE)})
  else:
    O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), asobject(I))
    target_object = argmax(objects(I, False, False, False), lambda obj: colorcount(obj, ZERO))
    target_loc = llcorner(toindices(target_object)) if len(toindices(target_object)) > 1 else urcorner(toindices(target_object))
    O = fill(O, ONE, {target_loc})
    if h == 3:
      O = vconcat(O, hconcat(I, canvas(ZERO, (h, w))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Single Digit:** If the input is a single digit, a 4x4 grid is created, filled with '2's except the bottom-right corner which is set to '1'.

2. **Multi-Digit:** 
    - The input grid is painted onto a canvas of zeros. 
    - The largest object containing zeros is identified.
    - The bottom-left corner of the object is targeted, or the top-right corner if the object is a single cell.
    - This target location is filled with a '1'.
    - If the height of the input grid is 3, the input grid is appended below the existing grid, padded with zeros to the right.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  if h == 1 and w == 1:
    O = canvas(ZERO, (FOUR, FOUR))
    O = fill(O, TWO, difference(asindices(O), {(THREE, THREE)}))
    O = fill(O, ONE, {(THREE, THREE)})
  else:
    O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), asobject(I))
    zero_indices = ofcolor(I, ZERO)
    target_loc = llcorner(zero_indices) if len(zero_indices) > 1 else urcorner(zero_indices)
    O = fill(O, ONE, {target_loc})
    if h == 2:
      O = vconcat(hconcat(O, canvas(ZERO, (h, w))), canvas(ZERO, (h, 2 * w)))
      O = fill(O, ONE, {(2 * h - 1, 2 * w - 1)})
      O = vconcat(O, hconcat(I, canvas(ZERO, (h, w))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Single Digit:** Same as version 1.

2. **Multi-Digit:**
    - Same steps as version 1 until identifying the target location.
    - If the height of the input is 2, the grid is extended and populated similarly to the description of Input 2 -> Output 2.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  if h == 1 and w == 1:
    O = canvas(ZERO, (FOUR, FOUR))
    diag = {(i, i) for i in range(FOUR)}
    O = fill(O, TWO, difference(asindices(O), diag | {(THREE, THREE)}))
    O = fill(O, ONE, {(THREE, THREE)})
  else:
    O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), asobject(I))
    if colorcount(I, ZERO) > 1:
      O = fill(O, ONE, llcorner(ofcolor(I, ZERO)))
    else:
      O = fill(O, ONE, urcorner(ofcolor(I, ZERO)))
    if h == 2:
      O = vconcat(hconcat(O, canvas(ZERO, (h, w))), canvas(ZERO, (h, 2 * w)))
      O = vconcat(O, hconcat(I, canvas(ZERO, (h, w))))
      O = fill(O, ONE, {(len(O)-1, len(O[0])-1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Single Digit:** A 4x4 grid is created. It is filled with '2's except for the main diagonal and the bottom-right corner. The main diagonal and the bottom-right corner are filled with '1's.

2. **Multi-Digit:**
    - Same as version 2 until filling the target location. 
    -  If the height of the input is 2, the grid is extended and populated similarly to version 2, but without filling the extended grid with '0's.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  if h == 1 and w == 1:
    O = canvas(ZERO, (FOUR, FOUR))
    O = fill(O, TWO, difference(asindices(O), {(i, 3 - i) for i in range(FOUR)} | {(THREE, THREE)}))
    O = fill(O, ONE, {(THREE, THREE)})
  else:
    O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), asobject(I))
    zero_indices = ofcolor(I, ZERO)
    if len(zero_indices) > 1:
      O = fill(O, ONE, llcorner(zero_indices))
    else:
      O = fill(O, ONE, urcorner(zero_indices))
    if h == 2:
      O = vconcat(hconcat(O, canvas(ZERO, (h, w))), canvas(ZERO, (h, 2 * w)))
      O = vconcat(O, hconcat(I, canvas(ZERO, (h, w))))
      O = fill(O, ONE, {(len(O)-1, len(O[0])-1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Single Digit:** A 4x4 grid is created. It is filled with '2's except for the counter-diagonal and the bottom-right corner. The counter-diagonal and the bottom-right corner are filled with '1's.

2. **Multi-Digit:**
    - Identical to version 3. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  if h == 1 and w == 1:
    O = canvas(ZERO, (FOUR, FOUR))
    O = fill(O, TWO, difference(asindices(O), {(i, j) for i in range(FOUR) for j in range(FOUR) if i + j == 3 or (i, j) == (THREE, THREE)}))
    O = fill(O, ONE, {(THREE, THREE)})
  else:
    O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), asobject(I))
    zero_indices = ofcolor(I, ZERO)
    if len(zero_indices) > 1:
      O = fill(O, ONE, llcorner(zero_indices))
    else:
      O = fill(O, ONE, urcorner(zero_indices))
    if h == 2:
      O = vconcat(hconcat(O, canvas(ZERO, (h, w))), canvas(ZERO, (h, 2 * w)))
      O = vconcat(O, hconcat(I, canvas(ZERO, (h, w))))
      O = fill(O, ONE, {(len(O)-1, len(O[0])-1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Single Digit:** A 4x4 grid is created. It is filled with '2's except for the counter-diagonal and the bottom-right corner. The counter-diagonal and the bottom-right corner are filled with '1's. This version uses a different way of calculating the counter-diagonal indices compared to version 4.

2. **Multi-Digit:**
   - Identical to version 3 and 4.
