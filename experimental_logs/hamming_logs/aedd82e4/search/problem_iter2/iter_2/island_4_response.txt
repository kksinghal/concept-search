## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The bottom-right corner of the largest object (color '2') is changed to '1'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** A new 4x4 grid is created with a specific pattern of '2's and a '1' on a background of '0's.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**  The grid is extended with a new column on the right. The bottom-right corner of the grid is filled with '1', and three '2's are placed diagonally above it. 

**Input_3 to Output_3:** The bottom-right corner of the largest object (color '2') is changed to '1', and the cell diagonally below it is also changed to '1'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcommon(I)  # Find the background color
  if size(I) == 1:
    # Handle the single-cell case
    I = canvas(bg, (4, 4)) 
    I = paint(I, {(2, (0, 1)), (2, (1, 1)), (2, (1, 2)), (2, (2, 3)), (1, (3, 3))})
  else:
    # Find the bottom-rightmost object
    obj = argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: lrcorner(obj))
    if color(obj) != bg:  # Only process if it's not the background
      corner = lrcorner(obj)
      I = fill(I, 1, {corner})  # Fill the corner with '1'
      # If applicable, fill diagonally as well
      if corner[0] < len(I) - 1 and corner[1] < len(I[0]) - 1: 
        I = fill(I, 1, {add(corner, (1, 1))}) 
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

- **Single-cell case:** Creates a predefined 4x4 grid if the input is a single cell.
- **Multi-cell case:** 
    - Finds the object with the bottom-rightmost corner.
    - Fills its bottom-right corner with '1'.
    - If the bottom-right corner isn't at the grid's edge, also fills the cell diagonally down-right with '1'.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcommon(I)
  if size(I) == 1:
    I = canvas(bg, (4, 4))
    I = paint(I, {(2, (0, 1)), (2, (1, 1)), (2, (1, 2)), (2, (2, 3)), (1, (3, 3))})
    return I
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  if objs:  # Check if there are any foreground objects
    obj = max(objs, key=lambda obj: lrcorner(obj)[0] * len(I[0]) + lrcorner(obj)[1])
    corner = lrcorner(obj)
    I = fill(I, 1, {corner})
    if corner[0] < len(I) - 1 and corner[1] < len(I[0]) - 1:
      I = fill(I, 1, {add(corner, (1, 1))})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

- **Single-cell case:** Same as Version 1.
- **Multi-cell case:**
    - Calculates a linear index for the bottom-right corner of each object to find the bottom-rightmost one.
    - Proceeds similarly to Version 1 to fill the corner and potentially the diagonal cell.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcommon(I)
  if size(I) == 1:
    I = canvas(bg, (4, 4))
    I = paint(I, {(2, (0, 1)), (2, (1, 1)), (2, (1, 2)), (2, (2, 3)), (1, (3, 3))})
    return I
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  if objs:
    obj = max(objs, key=lambda o: (lowermost(o), rightmost(o)))
    I = fill(I, 1, {lrcorner(obj)})
    if lrcorner(obj)[0] < len(I) - 1 and lrcorner(obj)[1] < len(I[0]) - 1:
      I = fill(I, 1, {add(lrcorner(obj), (1, 1))})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

- **Single-cell case:** Same as Version 1.
- **Multi-cell case:**
    - Finds the object with the maximum `(lowermost, rightmost)` tuple, effectively finding the bottom-rightmost object. 
    - Fills the corner and potentially the diagonal cell as in previous versions.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcommon(I)
  if size(I) == 1:
    I = canvas(bg, (4, 4))
    I = paint(I, {(2, (0, 1)), (2, (1, 1)), (2, (1, 2)), (2, (2, 3)), (1, (3, 3))})
    return I
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  max_row = max(lowermost(obj) for obj in objs) if objs else 0  # Find the maximum row index
  max_col = max(rightmost(obj) for obj in objs if lowermost(obj) == max_row) if objs else 0  # Find the maximum column index within the maximum row
  I = fill(I, 1, {(max_row, max_col)})  # Fill the corner
  if max_row < len(I) - 1 and max_col < len(I[0]) - 1:
    I = fill(I, 1, {(max_row + 1, max_col + 1)}) # Fill diagonally
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

- **Single-cell case:** Same as Version 1.
- **Multi-cell case:**
    - Iterates through objects to determine the maximum row and the maximum column index within that row.
    - Uses these indices to directly fill the corner and potentially the diagonal cell.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcommon(I)
  if size(I) == 1:
    I = canvas(bg, (4, 4))
    I = paint(I, {(2, (0, 1)), (2, (1, 1)), (2, (1, 2)), (2, (2, 3)), (1, (3, 3))})
    return I
  corners = mpapply(lrcorner, objects(I, T, F, T))  # Get all bottom-right corners
  if corners:
    corner = max(corners)  # Get the bottom-rightmost corner
    I = fill(I, 1, {corner})
    if corner[0] < len(I) - 1 and corner[1] < len(I[0]) - 1:
      I = fill(I, 1, {add(corner, (1, 1))})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

- **Single-cell case:** Same as Version 1.
- **Multi-cell case:**
    - Extracts all bottom-right corners of objects using `mpapply`.
    - Finds the maximum corner coordinates, representing the bottom-rightmost corner.
    - Fills the corner and potentially the diagonal cell as before.

These versions demonstrate different approaches to finding the target corner and filling cells, showcasing diversity in utilizing DSL functions.
