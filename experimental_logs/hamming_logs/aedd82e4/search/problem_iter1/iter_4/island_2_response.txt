## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the lowermost occurrence of the digit '2' within each column of the input grid. Once identified, this '2' is replaced with a '1' in the output grid. All other digits in the grid remain unchanged. 

### Input 0:
* In column 0, the lowermost '2' is at position (1,0). This '2' is replaced by '1' in the output.
* In column 1 and 2, the lowermost '2's remain unchanged as they are not at the bottom.

### Input 1:
* Column 0: Lowermost '2' at (3,0) replaced by '1'.
* Column 1: Lowermost '2' at (1,1) replaced by '1'.
* Column 3: Lowermost '2' at (2,3) replaced by '1'.

### Input 2:
* Column 3: Lowermost '2' at (2,3) replaced by '1'.

### Input 3:
* Column 1: Lowermost '2' at (1,1) replaced by '1'.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for i in range(height(I)-1, -1, -1):
      if O[i][j] == 2:
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates a copy of the input grid, `O`.
2. **Column Iteration:** Iterates through each column (`j`) of the grid.
3. **Row Iteration (Bottom-Up):** For each column, iterates through rows (`i`) from bottom to top.
4. **Condition Check:**  If a cell contains '2', it fills that cell with '1' using `fill` and breaks the inner loop (moves to the next column).
5. **Output:** Returns the modified grid `O`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for j in range(width(I)):
    found = False
    for i in range(height(I)-1, -1, -1):
      if I[i][j] == 2 and not found:
        I = fill(I, 1, {(i, j)})
        found = True
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Column Iteration:** Iterates through each column (`j`) of the grid.
2. **Initialization (per column):** Sets a flag `found` to False for each new column.
3. **Row Iteration (Bottom-Up):** Iterates through rows (`i`) from bottom to top.
4. **Condition Check:** If a cell contains '2' and the `found` flag is False, it fills that cell with '1' using `fill` and sets the `found` flag to True.
5. **Output:** Returns the modified grid `I`.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for (i, j) in asindices(I):
    if I[i][j] == 2 and (i == height(I)-1 or I[i+1][j] != 2):
      O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates a copy of the input grid, `O`.
2. **Cell Iteration:** Iterates through all cell indices (`i`, `j`) in the grid using `asindices`.
3. **Condition Check:** If a cell contains '2' and is either in the last row or the cell below it doesn't contain '2', it fills that cell in `O` with '1' using `fill`.
4. **Output:** Returns the modified grid `O`.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      bottom_cell = argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][0])
      I = fill(I, 1, {bottom_cell[1]})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:** Identifies all connected objects (groups of adjacent cells with the same value) in the grid using `objects`.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each identified object `obj`.
3. **Color Check:** If the object's color is '2':
    - Finds the bottom-most cell within the object using `argmax` and a lambda function that compares the row indices (`cell[1][0]`) of the cells.
    - Fills the bottom-most cell's index with '1' in the grid `I` using `fill`.
4. **Output:** Returns the modified grid `I`.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for j in range(width(I)):
    bottom_i = next((i for i in range(height(I)-1, -1, -1) if I[i][j] == 2), None)
    if bottom_i is not None:
      I = fill(I, 1, {(bottom_i, j)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Column Iteration:** Iterates through each column (`j`) of the grid.
2. **Find Bottom '2':** Uses a generator expression to iterate through rows in reverse and find the first (bottom-most) row index (`bottom_i`) where a '2' is encountered in the current column. If no '2' is found, `bottom_i` is set to `None`.
3. **Fill if Found:** If `bottom_i` is not None (meaning a '2' was found), fills the corresponding cell with '1' in the grid `I` using `fill`.
4. **Output:** Returns the modified grid `I`.
