## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all examples involves moving the object composed of the digit '2' to the bottom of the grid while maintaining its original shape and relative position of its components.  Other objects in the grid remain in their original positions.

**Input_0:**
- The object '2' is moved from the top rows to the bottom rows of the grid.

**Input_1:**
- The object '2' is moved down to occupy the bottom rows.

**Input_2:**
- The object '2' is moved down to the bottom rows. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

### Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def move_object_to_bottom(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False) # Identify all objects
  target_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2) # Extract the '2' object
  other_objs = difference(objs, {target_obj}) # Extract other objects
  target_height = height(target_obj) # Get height of the '2' object
  grid_height = height(I) # Get total grid height
  moved_obj = shift(target_obj, (grid_height - target_height - uppermost(target_obj), 0)) # Move '2' to bottom
  return paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), other_objs), moved_obj) # Paint all objects back on canvas
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all distinct objects within the grid.
2. **Extract Target:** Isolate the object consisting of the digit '2'.
3. **Calculate Position:** Determine the final position of the '2' object at the bottom of the grid.
4. **Shift Target:** Move the '2' object to its calculated bottom position.
5. **Reconstruct Grid:** Create a blank canvas and paint all objects, including the moved '2' object, back onto the canvas in their new positions.

### Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def move_object_to_bottom(I):
    two_obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)  # Find the '2' object
    bg_color = mostcolor(I)  # Get the background color
    return vconcat(  # Vertically concatenate two grids:
        crop(replace(I, 2, bg_color), (0, 0), (height(I) - height(two_obj), width(I))),  # Top part (without '2')
        crop(replace(I, bg_color, 2), (height(I) - height(two_obj), 0), (height(two_obj), width(I)))  # Bottom part (only '2')
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Object:** Locate the object composed of the digit '2'.
2. **Determine Background Color:** Identify the most frequent color, representing the background.
3. **Split and Modify Grid:**  Divide the grid into two sections: 
    - Top:  Remove the '2' object by replacing it with the background color.
    - Bottom: Isolate the '2' object by replacing the background color with '2'.
4. **Combine Sections:**  Vertically join the modified top and bottom sections to create the final output grid. 

### Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def move_object_to_bottom(I):
    obj_2 = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)  # Extract the object with color 2
    empty_grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create an empty grid with the background color
    return paint(shift(paint(empty_grid, obj_2), (height(I) - height(obj_2) - uppermost(obj_2), 0)), asobject(I))  # Paint the object at the bottom and then paint the original grid on top
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Isolate Target Object:**  Extract the object containing the digit '2'.
2. **Create Blank Canvas:** Generate an empty grid filled with the background color.
3. **Position Target:**  Calculate the target position for the '2' object at the bottom of the grid.
4. **Paint and Overlay:** Paint the '2' object onto the blank canvas at its calculated position. Then, overlay the original input grid on top. This effectively places the '2' object at the bottom while preserving other elements in their original positions.

### Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def move_object_to_bottom(I):
    return paint(
        canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), # Create a blank canvas
        merge(
            (
                {(v, (i + height(I) - height(extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)) if v == 2 else i, j)) for j, v in enumerate(row)} # Shift rows containing '2' to the bottom
                for i, row in enumerate(I)
            )
        )
    )
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Create Blank Canvas:** Generate an empty grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Identify and Shift Target:**  Iterate through each cell in the input grid. If a cell contains '2', calculate its new row position at the bottom and adjust its coordinates accordingly. Otherwise, keep its position unchanged.
3. **Paint onto Canvas:** Paint each modified cell onto the blank canvas to construct the final output grid.


### Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def move_object_to_bottom(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
        2 if any(v == 2 for v in row) and i >= height(I) - colorcount(I, 2) else v # Paint '2' at the bottom if present in the row 
        for j, v in enumerate(row)
    ) 
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Modify:** Loop through each cell in the input grid. 
2. **Identify Target Rows:** Check if the current row contains the digit '2'. 
3. **Conditional Painting:** If the current row contains '2' and the cell is at or below the calculated bottom boundary for the '2' object, paint the cell with '2'. Otherwise, retain the cell's original value.
