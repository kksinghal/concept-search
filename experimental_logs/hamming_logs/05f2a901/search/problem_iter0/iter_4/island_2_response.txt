## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving objects composed of specific values downwards, aligning them to the bottom of the grid without changing their horizontal position.

**Input_0:** The object made of "2"s is moved downwards to touch the bottom of the grid. The object made of "8"s remains unchanged.

**Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the object of "2"s is moved down to the bottom. The object of "8"s is unaffected.

**Input_2:**  Again, only the object formed by "2"s is moved downwards.  The object of "8"s remains in its original position.

## Code Generation:

**Program_to_be_generated:**

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  # Find the objects
  objects_list = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  
  # Move each object down
  for obj in objects_list:
    # Calculate shift distance
    shift_distance = height(I) - lowermost(obj) - 1
    
    # Conditionally move object downwards 
    I = paint(cover(I, obj), shift(obj, (shift_distance, 0))) if shift_distance > 0 else I
  
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies all distinct objects in the grid. `univalued=True` ensures each object consists of a single value.
2. **Iterate and Move:** The code iterates through each object.
3. **Calculate Shift:**  `shift_distance = height(I) - lowermost(obj) - 1` determines how far down the object needs to be moved to reach the bottom.
4. **Conditional Move:** The object is moved down only if `shift_distance > 0`.
5. **Paint and Cover:** `paint(cover(I, obj), shift(obj, (shift_distance, 0)))` first "covers" the original object's position (replaces with background color) and then "paints" the object at its new, shifted location.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  for value in palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}:  # Iterate over non-background colors
    indices = ofcolor(I, value)  # Find indices of the current color
    shift_distance = height(I) - lowermost(indices) - 1 # Calculate vertical shift
    I = paint(cover(I, indices), shift(indices, (shift_distance, 0))) if shift_distance > 0 else I # Move the object
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over Colors:** This version iterates directly over distinct colors (excluding background) in the grid.
2. **Find Indices:**  `ofcolor(I, value)` finds all indices occupied by the current color.
3. **Calculate Shift, Move, Paint & Cover:** These steps are identical to Version 1, but applied to indices directly instead of using the `objects` function.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
    return vconcat(canvas(mostcommon(I), (height(I) - height(compress(I)), width(I))), compress(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Compress:** `compress(I)` removes all complete rows and columns of the background color from both the top and bottom of the grid.
2. **Calculate Canvas Size:** `(height(I) - height(compress(I)), width(I))` calculates the size of the empty canvas needed above the compressed grid to restore the original grid's dimensions.
3. **Create Canvas:** `canvas(mostcommon(I), ...)` creates a new grid filled with the background color, matching the calculated size.
4. **Vertical Concatenation:** `vconcat(..., compress(I))` vertically concatenates the new canvas on top of the compressed grid, effectively pushing all objects down.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
    shifted_objects = []
    for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
        shift_distance = height(I) - lowermost(obj) - 1
        shifted_objects.append(shift(obj, (shift_distance, 0)))
    
    return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(shifted_objects))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Shift Objects:** Similar to Version 1, this version identifies individual objects and calculates their required downward shift distances. It stores the shifted objects in a list.
2. **Create Empty Canvas:**  `canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))` creates a new grid filled with the background color, having the same dimensions as the original grid.
3. **Merge and Paint:** All shifted objects are merged (`merge(shifted_objects)`) and then painted onto the empty canvas.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
    return rot180(program_v1(rot180(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version cleverly reuses the logic from `program_v1` but applies it in reverse:

1. **Rotate 180 Degrees:** The input grid is rotated by 180 degrees.
2. **Apply program_v1:** The previously defined `program_v1` is applied to the rotated grid. This effectively moves objects "upwards" in the rotated grid.
3. **Rotate Back:**  The resulting grid is rotated by 180 degrees again to return to the original orientation. This results in objects being moved downwards in the final output.

Each of these program versions provides a distinct approach to achieving the desired transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logical steps.
