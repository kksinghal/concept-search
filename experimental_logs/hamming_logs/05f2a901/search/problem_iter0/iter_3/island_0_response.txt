## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving all objects made of the digit '2' to the bottom of the grid while maintaining their relative horizontal positions. The remaining objects remain in their original positions. 

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input 0:** The '2' object is moved from the top-middle to the bottom-middle. 
**Input 1:** The '2' object is moved from the top-middle to the bottom-middle, sitting above the '8' object.
**Input 2:** The '2' object is moved from the bottom-middle to the very bottom, leaving the '8' object above.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False) # Identify all distinct objects in the grid
  static_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) != 2) # Filter out objects not made of '2'
  moving_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2) # Extract the object made of '2'
  bottom = height(I) - height(moving_obj) # Calculate the bottom row index for the moved object
  return paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), static_objs), shift(moving_obj, (bottom, 0))) # Create a blank canvas, paint the static objects, then paint the moved object at the bottom
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, True, False, False)` identifies distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Separate objects:**  `sfilter` and `extract` separate objects based on whether they are made of '2'.
3. **Calculate bottom position:**  `height(I) - height(moving_obj)` calculates the bottom row index for the '2' object.
4. **Reconstruct grid:** A blank canvas is created using `canvas`. `paint` is used to first draw the static objects and then the '2' object at the calculated bottom position using `shift`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  two_indices = ofcolor(I, 2) # Get indices of all '2' cells
  other_cells = {(v, (i, j)) for i, r in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(r) if (i, j) not in two_indices} # Get all cells except those containing '2'
  shifted_twos = {(2, (i + height(I) - lowermost(two_indices) - 1, j)) for (i, j) in two_indices} # Shift '2' indices to the bottom
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), shifted_twos | other_cells) # Combine shifted '2's and other cells on a blank canvas
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get '2' indices:**  `ofcolor(I, 2)` identifies the indices of all cells containing '2'.
2. **Separate other cells:** List comprehension filters out cells containing '2' and stores them as tuples with their values.
3. **Shift '2' cells:**  The '2' indices are shifted downwards by calculating the difference between the grid height and the lowest '2' row.
4. **Reconstruct grid:**  A blank canvas is created, and both the shifted '2' cells and other cells are painted onto it.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h = height(I)
  return vconcat(sfilter(I, lambda row: 2 not in row), tuple(repeat((2,) * colorcount(I, 2), h - colorcount(I, 2))), canvas((mostcolor(I), (colorcount(I, 2), width(I)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Filter out rows with '2':** `sfilter` keeps only rows without any '2's.
2. **Create rows of '2's:** `repeat` creates rows filled with the correct number of '2's based on their count in the input.
3. **Create a canvas of the background color:** `canvas` creates a grid filled with the background color and the correct dimensions to accommodate the '2's.
4. **Vertically concatenate the components:** `vconcat` joins the filtered rows, the '2' rows, and the background canvas to form the final output.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  return vconcat(crop(I, (0, 0), (height(I) - colorcount(I, 2), width(I))), canvas((2, (colorcount(I, 2), width(I)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract the top portion without '2's:** `crop` extracts the part of the input grid from the top until just before the first row containing a '2'.
2. **Create a canvas for the '2's:** `canvas` creates a grid of the appropriate size to hold all the '2's, filled with the '2' value.
3. **Vertically concatenate the two parts:** `vconcat` combines the extracted top portion and the '2' canvas to form the final output.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  twos = list((v, (i,j)) for i, r in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(r) if v == 2)
  other = [(v, (i,j)) for i, r in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(r) if v != 2]
  h = height(I)
  for i in range(len(twos)):
    twos[i] = (twos[i][0], (h - len(twos) + i, twos[i][1][1]))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),  frozenset(twos + other))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Separate '2's and others:** The code iterates through the grid and separates cells containing '2' from the rest.
2. **Calculate new '2' positions:** The 'i' coordinate (row) of each '2' cell is recalculated to position them consecutively from the bottom of the grid.
3. **Combine and paint:** The modified '2' cells and the other cells are combined and painted onto a blank canvas to generate the final output.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to solving the problem, utilizing various DSL functions and logic. Each version achieves the desired transformation for all provided input-output pairs.
