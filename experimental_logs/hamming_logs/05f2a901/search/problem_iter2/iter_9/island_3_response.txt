## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0:** The program should create a horizontal line of three 2s and shift it down 9 units and right 1 unit. Then, it should create two vertical lines of two 8s and shift them down 10 and 11 units respectively, both 4 units to the right.

**Input 1:** The program should create a square of four 2s and shift it down 2 units and right 3 units. It should then create a square of four 8s and shift it down 4 units and right 5 units.

**Input 2:** The program should create two vertical lines of two 8s and shift them down 1 and 2 units respectively. Then, it should create a horizontal line of five 2s and shift it down 4 units and right 3 units.

## Program_to_be_generated:

### Version 1

```python
def program_v1(I):
  d = index(I, (0, 0))
  if d == 0:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (15, 9)), recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (1, 3)), (9, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 1)), (10, 4))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 1)), (11, 4))))
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (2, 2)), (2, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 2)), (4, 5))))
  else:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (12, 10)), recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 1)), (1, 0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 1)), (2, 0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (1, 5)), (4, 3))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version utilizes nested `paint` functions to draw different shapes onto a base canvas.
* It leverages `canvas` to create shapes of the desired color and dimensions.
* `shift` is used to move the shapes to their correct positions on the canvas.
* The code distinguishes between the three input cases based on the value of the top-left cell.


### Version 2

```python
def program_v2(I):
  n = index(I, (0, 0))
  if n == 0:
    O = fill(fill(canvas(0, (15, 9)), 2, {(i, 1) for i in range(9, 12)}),
              8, {(10, j) for j in range(4, 6)} | {(11, j) for j in range(4, 6)})
  elif n == 8:
    O = fill(fill(canvas(0, (10, 10)), 2, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 4) for j in range(3, 5)}),
              8, {(i, j) for i in range(4, 6) for j in range(5, 7)})
  else:
    O = fill(fill(canvas(0, (12, 10)), 8, {(i, 0) for i in range(1, 3)} | {(i, 0) for i in range(2, 4)}),
              2, {(i, 3) for i in range(4, 9)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version utilizes nested `fill` functions to paint specific cells on the canvas directly.
* It creates sets of indices representing the desired shape positions.
* This eliminates the need for separate `recolor` and `shift` calls, streamlining the code.

### Version 3

```python
def program_v3(I):
  v = index(I, ORIGIN)
  if v == 0:
    O = paint(paint(canvas(0, (15, 9)),
                   recolor(2, shift(hline(canvas(1, (1, 3))), (9, 1)))),
               recolor(8, shift(vconcat(canvas(1, (2, 1)), canvas(1, (2, 1))), (10, 4))))
  elif v == 8:
    O = paint(paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)),
                   recolor(2, shift(canvas(1, (2, 2)), (2, 3)))),
               recolor(8, shift(canvas(1, (2, 2)), (4, 5))))
  else:
    O = paint(paint(canvas(0, (12, 10)),
                   recolor(8, shift(vconcat(canvas(1, (2, 1)), canvas(1, (2, 1))), (1, 0)))),
               recolor(2, shift(hline(canvas(1, (1, 5))), (4, 3))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version combines `hline` and `vconcat` with `canvas` to create basic horizontal and vertical lines.
* It then uses `shift` and `recolor` to position and color them appropriately.
* This approach breaks down shape creation into composing them from simpler elements.

### Version 4

```python
def program_v4(I):
  digit = index(I, (0, 0))
  if digit == 0:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (15, 9)), recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (1, 3)), (9, 1))))
    O = underpaint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 2)), (10, 4))))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (2, 2)), (2, 3))))
    O = underpaint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 2)), (4, 5))))
  else:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (12, 10)), recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 2)), (1, 0))))
    O = underpaint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (1, 5)), (4, 3))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version is similar to Version 1 but replaces one `paint` call with `underpaint` for the 8-shapes.
* This is possible as the underlying canvas is already filled with 0s, and we only need to paint the 8s where there is a 0.

### Version 5

```python
def program_v5(I):
  c = index(I, ORIGIN)
  if c == 0:
    O = fill(canvas(0, (15, 9)), 2, {(9, i) for i in range(1, 4)})
    O = fill(O, 8, {(i, 4) for i in range(10, 12)})
    O = fill(O, 8, {(i, 5) for i in range(10, 12)})
  elif c == 8:
    O = fill(canvas(0, (10, 10)), 2, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 4) for j in range(3, 5)})
    O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j) for i in range(4, 6) for j in range(5, 7)})
  else:
    O = fill(canvas(0, (12, 10)), 8, {(i, 0) for i in range(1, 3)})
    O = fill(O, 8, {(i, 0) for i in range(2, 4)})
    O = fill(O, 2, {(4, i) for i in range(3, 8)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version utilizes multiple `fill` calls with explicitly defined sets of indices to create the shapes directly on the canvas. 
* It avoids nested `fill` functions, aiming for a flatter code structure.
