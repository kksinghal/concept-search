## Transformation Analysis:

The task is to generate a program that takes a single-cell grid containing a digit as input and outputs a grid depicting a stylized version of that digit. The digits are formed by combining a "base" shape and an "extension" with specific colors and positions for each digit. Additionally, "lines" are added to some digits in particular positions.

**Input 0 (digit 0):**

- The base shape is a 2x2 square extended horizontally with an additional 2x1 rectangle, then horizontally mirrored.
- The base shape is placed in the bottom left of the output grid.
- Two horizontal lines are added to the right of the base shape.

**Input 1 (digit 8):**

- The base shape is a 2x2 square extended vertically with an additional 2x1 rectangle.
- The base shape is placed in the center of the output grid.
- Two horizontal lines are added to the right of the base shape.

**Input 2 (digit 2):**

- The base shape is a 2x2 square extended vertically with a horizontally mirrored additional 2x1 rectangle.
- The base shape is placed in the center of the output grid.
- Two horizontal lines are added to the left of the base shape.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  square = recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)})
  extension = recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0)})
  line = recolor(8, {(0, 0), (1, 0)})
  if d == 0:
    base = hconcat(hconcat(square, extension), hmirror(square))
    O = paint(O, shift(base, (8, 2)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (9, 6)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (10, 6)))
  elif d == 8:
    base = vconcat(square, shift(extension, (2, 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(base, (4, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (6, 5)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (6, 6)))
  else: # digit == 2
    base = vconcat(square, shift(hmirror(extension), (2, 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(base, (4, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (2, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (3, 4)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version directly constructs the base shape and lines for each digit using `hconcat`, `vconcat`, `hmirror`, `recolor`, and `shift` functions.
- The `if-elif-else` structure handles the different digit cases.
- It focuses on explicitly defining the shapes rather than relying on splitting like Program_A.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  base_parts = [
      recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)}),
      recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0)})
  ]
  line = recolor(8, {(0, 0), (1, 0)})
  if d == 0:
    base = hconcat(hconcat(base_parts[0], base_parts[1]), hmirror(base_parts[0]))
    O = paint(O, shift(base, (8, 2)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (9, 6)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (10, 6)))
  elif d == 8:
    base = vconcat(base_parts[0], shift(base_parts[1], (2, 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(base, (4, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (6, 5)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (6, 6)))
  else: # digit == 2
    base = vconcat(base_parts[0], shift(hmirror(base_parts[1]), (2, 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(base, (4, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (2, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (3, 4)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version builds upon version 1 by introducing a list `base_parts` to store the common components of the base shape.
- This approach enhances code readability and reduces redundancy in defining the shapes.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  square = recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)})
  extension = recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0)})
  line = recolor(8, {(0, 0), (1, 0)})
  if d == 0:
    base = hconcat(square, extension)
    base = hconcat(base, hmirror(square))
    O = paint(O, shift(base, (8, 2)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (9, 6)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (10, 6)))
  elif d == 8:
    base = vconcat(square, shift(extension, (2, 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(base, (4, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (6, 5)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (6, 6)))
  else: # digit == 2
    base = vconcat(square, shift(hmirror(extension), (2, 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(base, (4, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (2, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (3, 4)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version breaks down the base shape construction for digit 0 into two steps using `hconcat`. 
- This change improves code clarity by separating the construction into smaller, more manageable parts.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  base_shape = recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)})
  line = recolor(8, {(0, 0), (1, 0)})
  if d == 0:
    base = hconcat(hsplit(base_shape, 2)[0], hmirror(hsplit(base_shape, 2)[0]))
    O = paint(O, shift(base, (8, 2)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (9, 6)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (10, 6)))
  elif d == 8:
    base = vsplit(base_shape, 2)[0]
    O = paint(O, shift(base, (4, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (6, 5)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (6, 6)))
  else: # digit == 2
    base = vsplit(base_shape, 2)[0]
    O = paint(O, shift(base, (4, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (2, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (3, 4)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version utilizes a single `base_shape` and then splits it using `hsplit` or `vsplit` based on the digit.
- This approach reduces redundancy in defining individual parts of the shape.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  shape_data = {
      0: {
        'base': lambda b: hconcat(hsplit(b, 2)[0], hmirror(hsplit(b, 2)[0])),
        'base_pos': (8, 2),
        'lines': [(9, 6), (10, 6)]
      },
      8: {
        'base': lambda b: vsplit(b, 2)[0],
        'base_pos': (4, 3),
        'lines': [(6, 5), (6, 6)]
      },
      2: {
        'base': lambda b: vsplit(b, 2)[0],
        'base_pos': (4, 3),
        'lines': [(2, 4), (3, 4)]
      }
  }
  base_shape = recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)})
  line = recolor(8, {(0, 0), (1, 0)})
  base = shape_data[d]['base'](base_shape)
  O = paint(O, shift(base, shape_data[d]['base_pos']))
  for line_pos in shape_data[d]['lines']:
    O = paint(O, shift(line, line_pos))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version introduces a dictionary `shape_data` to store information about constructing each digit, including functions to generate the base shape, base position, and line positions.
- This approach promotes code organization, readability, and scalability for handling additional digits.


These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformation, showcasing different DSL function combinations and logical structures. Each version offers unique advantages in terms of code clarity, reusability, and scalability.
