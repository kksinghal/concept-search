## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to follow these rules:

* **Object Extraction:** The input grid always contains a single object formed by a unique digit different from the background (0). 
* **Object Upscaling:** The object is upscaled by a factor of 2.
* **Positional Mapping:** The position of the upscaled object in the output grid is determined by the value of the digit forming the object in the input grid.

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Pair 0 (Input: 0, Object: 2):**
* The object "2" is upscaled and placed in the bottom left corner of the output grid.

**Pair 1 (Input: 8, Object: 2):**
* The object "2" is upscaled and placed slightly higher and more to the right compared to Pair 0.

**Pair 2 (Input: 0, Object: 8):**
* The object "8" is upscaled and placed at the top left corner of the output grid.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  obj = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract the object
  upscaled_obj = upscale(merge(obj), 2) # Upscale the object
  d = index(I, (0, 0)) # Get the digit value
  if d == 0:
    offset = (9, 1)
  elif d == 8:
    offset = (1, 1)
  else:
    offset = (3, 6) 
  shifted_obj = shift(upscaled_obj, offset)  # Shift based on digit value
  O = paint(canvas(0, (14, 10)), shifted_obj)  # Paint on canvas
  return O
```
**Explanation:**

1. **Extract:**  We identify and extract the object from the input grid using `objects`.
2. **Upscale:**  We upscale the extracted object by a factor of 2 using `upscale`.
3. **Position:** We determine the shift offset based on the digit value using an `if-else` statement.
4. **Shift:** The upscaled object is shifted to its designated position using `shift`.
5. **Paint:** Finally, we paint the shifted object onto an empty canvas using `paint`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  obj = asobject(I) # Extract object as an object with cell indices
  upscaled_obj = upscale(obj, 2) # Upscale the object
  d = first(palette(obj)) # Get the digit value
  offset = ((d // 8) + 1, (d % 8) + 1) # Calculate offset based on digit
  shifted_obj = shift(upscaled_obj, offset) # Shift based on calculated offset
  O = paint(canvas(0, (14, 10)), shifted_obj) # Paint on canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract:** We extract the object along with cell indices using `asobject`.
2. **Upscale:** The extracted object is upscaled by a factor of 2 using `upscale`.
3. **Position:** We calculate the shift offset directly from the digit value using arithmetic operations.
4. **Shift:** We shift the upscaled object using the calculated offset and `shift`.
5. **Paint:** Finally, we paint the shifted object onto an empty canvas using `paint`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  d = I[0][0] # Get the digit value
  obj = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract the object
  if d == 0:
      O = paint(canvas(0, (14, 10)), shift(upscale(merge(obj), 2), (9, 1)))
  elif d == 8:
      O = paint(canvas(0, (14, 10)), shift(upscale(merge(obj), 2), (1, 1)))
  else:
      O = paint(canvas(0, (14, 10)), shift(upscale(merge(obj), 2), (3, 6)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Digit:** We directly obtain the digit value from the input grid.
2. **Conditional Transformation:**  Based on the digit value, we perform the upscaling, shifting, and painting within a single line using an `if-else` statement.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  obj = normalize(asobject(I)) # Extract and normalize the object
  d = first(palette(obj)) # Get the digit value
  x_offset = (d // 8) * 2 + 1 # Calculate x offset
  y_offset = (d % 8) + 1 # Calculate y offset
  O = paint(canvas(0, (14, 10)), shift(upscale(obj, 2), (x_offset, y_offset)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Normalize and Extract:**  We normalize the extracted object using `normalize` to simplify offset calculations.
2. **Offset Calculation:**  We separately calculate the x and y offsets from the digit value.
3. **Combined Transformation:** We combine upscaling, shifting, and painting into a single line for conciseness.


**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  obj = merge(objects(I, T, F, T)) # Extract and merge the object
  d = index(I, ulcorner(obj)) # Get the digit value
  offset_map = {0: (9, 1), 8: (1, 1)}  # Define offset mapping
  offset = offset_map.get(d, (3, 6))  # Get offset from mapping
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shift(upscale(obj, 2), offset))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Merge:**  We extract and merge the object into a single set of cells.
2. **Digit Extraction:** We use `index` and `ulcorner` to directly access the digit value from the object.
3. **Offset Mapping:** We predefine a dictionary to map digit values to shift offsets.
4. **Retrieve and Apply Offset:** We retrieve the appropriate offset from the dictionary and apply it to the upscaled object. 


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same outcome, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version uses a distinct combination of functions and logic, demonstrating their versatility in solving the given transformation task.
