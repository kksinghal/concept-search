## Transformation Analysis:

The task involves transforming an input digit (0, 2, or 8) into a stylized representation of that digit on a 14x10 grid. Let's break down the transformation logic for each digit:

**Digit 0:**

1. **Base Shape:** The core structure is a 2x3 rectangle formed by combining a 2x2 square and a 2x1 extension. This shape is then horizontally mirrored and the two halves are horizontally concatenated.
2. **Positioning:** The base shape is positioned at the bottom center of the grid (shifted by (8, 2)).
3. **Lines:** Two horizontal lines are drawn above the base shape, slightly offset to the right.

**Digit 8:**

1. **Base Shape:**  A 3x2 rectangle is formed by vertically concatenating a 2x2 square and a 1x2 extension.
2. **Positioning:** This shape is positioned slightly off-center (shifted by (4, 3)).
3. **Lines:** Two horizontal lines are drawn to the right of the base shape.

**Digit 2:**

1. **Base Shape:**  The core structure is a 3x2 rectangle formed by vertically concatenating a 2x2 square and a 1x2 extension. The extension is then horizontally mirrored.
2. **Positioning:** The base shape is positioned slightly off-center (shifted by (4, 3)).
3. **Lines:** Two horizontal lines are drawn above and to the left of the base shape.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions for achieving the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:** (Inspired by Program A's functional approach)

```python
def program_v1(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  base = lambda x, y: paint(O, recolor(2, {(x, y), (x + 1, y), (x, y + 1), (x + 1, y + 1)}))
  extension = lambda x, y: paint(O, recolor(2, {(x, y), (x + 1, y)}))
  line = lambda x, y: paint(O, recolor(8, {(x, y), (x + 1, y)}))
  if d == 0:
    O = hconcat(hconcat(base(8, 2), extension(8, 4)), hmirror(base(8, 2)))
    O = line(9, 4)
    O = line(10, 4)
  elif d == 8:
    O = vconcat(base(4, 3), extension(4, 5))
    O = line(6, 5)
    O = line(6, 6)
  else:  # digit == 2
    O = line(2, 4)
    O = line(3, 4)
    O = vconcat(base(4, 3), hmirror(extension(4, 5)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Uses lambda functions for reusable shape definitions.
* Directly constructs the digit shapes using `hconcat` and `vconcat` instead of individual cell painting.
* Positions the shapes using function arguments.


**Program Version 2:** (Focus on shape construction and positioning)

```python
def program_v2(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  square = recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)})
  extension = recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0)})
  line = recolor(8, {(0, 0), (1, 0)})
  if d == 0:
    base = hconcat(hconcat(square, shift(extension, (0, 2))), hmirror(square))
    O = paint(O, shift(base, (8, 2)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (9, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (10, 4)))
  elif d == 8:
    base = vconcat(square, shift(extension, (2, 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(base, (4, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (6, 5)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (6, 6)))
  else: # digit == 2
    base = vconcat(square, shift(hmirror(extension), (2, 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(base, (4, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (2, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (3, 4)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Defines basic shapes (`square`, `extension`, `line`) at the origin.
* Constructs complex shapes by positioning and combining these basic shapes.
* Shifts the final shapes to their correct locations on the canvas.


**Program Version 3:** (Leveraging grid transformations)

```python
def program_v3(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  base = recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)})
  line = recolor(8, {(0, 0), (1, 0)})
  if d == 0:
    O = paint(O, shift(hsplit(base, 2)[0], (8, 2)))
    O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(hsplit(base, 2)[0]), (8, 2)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (9, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (10, 4)))
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(O, shift(vsplit(base, 2)[0], (4, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (6, 5)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (6, 6)))
  else: # digit == 2
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (2, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (3, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(vsplit(base, 2)[0], (4, 3)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Defines the '0' and '8' base shapes as a single 2x3 rectangle.
* Uses `hsplit` and `vsplit` to extract the necessary portions for each digit.
* Utilizes `hmirror` for mirroring the base shape when constructing digit '0'.


**Program Version 4:** (Combining DSL functions for conciseness)

```python
def program_v4(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  base = recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)})
  ext = recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0)})
  ln = recolor(8, {(0, 0), (1, 0)})
  if d == 0:
    O = paint(O, shift(hconcat(hconcat(base, shift(ext, (0, 2))), hmirror(base)), (8, 2)))
    O = paint(O, shift(ln, (9, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(ln, (10, 4)))
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(O, shift(vconcat(base, shift(ext, (2, 0))), (4, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(ln, (6, 5)))
    O = paint(O, shift(ln, (6, 6)))
  else: # digit == 2
    O = paint(O, shift(ln, (2, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(ln, (3, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(vconcat(base, shift(hmirror(ext), (2, 0))), (4, 3)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Combines multiple DSL function calls within a single line for conciseness.
*  Directly embeds shape construction and positioning within the `paint` function calls.

**Program Version 5:** (Using conditional expressions for compactness)

```python
def program_v5(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  base = recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)})
  ext = recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0)})
  ln = recolor(8, {(0, 0), (1, 0)})
  O = paint(O, shift(
      hconcat(hconcat(base, shift(ext, (0, 2))), hmirror(base)) if d == 0 else
      vconcat(base, shift(ext, (2, 0))) if d == 8 else
      vconcat(base, shift(hmirror(ext), (2, 0))), 
      (8, 2) if d == 0 else (4, 3)
    ))
  O = paint(O, shift(ln, (9, 4) if d == 0 else (6, 5) if d == 8 else (2, 4)))
  O = paint(O, shift(ln, (10, 4) if d == 0 else (6, 6) if d == 8 else (3, 4)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

* Employs conditional expressions within the `paint` and `shift` function calls for a more compact representation. 
*  Reduces code duplication by conditionally applying transformations based on the input digit.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same output, utilizing various DSL functions and program structures. Each version offers a unique perspective on solving the problem while maintaining clarity and readability.
