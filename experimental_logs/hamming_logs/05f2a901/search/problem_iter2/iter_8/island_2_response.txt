## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to follow these rules:

* **Digit Placement:** The input digit determines the position of a "block" of digits on the grid.
* **Block Structure:** The block consists of '2's forming a specific shape and the input digit placed within the shape.
* **Block Movement:** As the input digit increases, the block moves diagonally downwards and rightwards.

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Pair 0 (Input 0):** 
The '0' input creates a block with a single '8' at its bottom center, surrounded by a '2' shape:
```
0 2 2 2 0
2 2 0 2 0
0 0 0 8 8
0 0 0 8 8
```

**Pair 1 (Input 8):** 
The '8' input shifts the block downwards and rightwards. The '8's now form the bottom-right corner of the shape:
```
0 0 0 0 2 2 
0 0 0 0 2 2
0 0 0 2 2 2
0 0 0 0 2 2 8 8
0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8
```

**Pair 2 (Input 2):**
The '2' input places the block in an intermediate position. The '2's form the right edge of the shape:
```
0 0 0 8 8
0 0 0 8 8
0 0 0 2 2 2
0 2 2 2 2 2
0 0 2 2 0 0
```

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions in the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  shape = {(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)} # Define the '2' shape
  digit_pos = {(2, 1), (3, 1)} # Define position of input digit within the shape
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(shape, (1 + digit, 2 + digit)))) # Shift and paint the '2' shape
  O = paint(O, recolor(digit, shift(digit_pos, (1 + digit, 2 + digit)))) # Shift and paint the input digit
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* We define the '2' shape and the input digit's position within the shape.
* We shift both the shape and the input digit's position diagonally based on the input digit's value.
* Finally, we paint the shifted shape and digit onto the canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (9, 8))
  base_block = {(2, (0, 1)), (2, (1, 1)), (2, (2, 0)), (2, (2, 1)), (2, (2, 2)), (2, (3, 2))} # Define the base block
  digit_block = {(digit, (3, 1)), (digit, (4, 1))} # Define the block for the input digit
  offset = (digit, digit) # Define the offset based on the input digit
  O = paint(O, shift(base_block, offset)) # Shift and paint the base block
  O = paint(O, shift(digit_block, offset)) # Shift and paint the input digit block
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* We define the base block containing '2's and a separate block for the input digit.
* We calculate an offset based on the input digit's value.
* We shift both the base block and the digit block by the calculated offset.
* Finally, we paint the shifted blocks onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (11, 10))
  square = {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)}
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(square, (1, 2))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(square, (1, 3))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(square, (2, 2))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(square, (3, 3))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(square, (2, 4))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(square, (3 + digit, 4 + digit)))) # Dynamically position the '8's
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* We build the shape by strategically placing 2x2 squares of '2's.
* The position of the final 2x2 square (containing the input digit '8') is dynamically calculated based on the input digit. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (10, 9))
  base_shape = {(2, (0, 1)), (2, (0, 2)), (2, (1, 0)), (2, (1, 1)), (2, (2, 1)), (2, (2, 2)), (2, (3, 2))} # Define the base '2' shape
  O = paint(O, shift(base_shape, (digit, digit + 1))) # Shift the base shape diagonally
  O = paint(O, {(digit, (3 + digit, 3 + digit)), (digit, (4 + digit, 3 + digit))}) # Place the input digit at the calculated position
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* We define the base '2' shape and calculate a diagonal offset based on the input digit.
* We shift the base shape by the calculated offset and paint it.
* We then directly paint the input digit at the specific location relative to the shifted shape.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (12, 11))
  two_positions = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), (2, 4)}  # Positions for '2's relative to the digit
  digit_positions = {(3, 4), (4, 4)}  # Positions for the digit relative to itself
  offset = (d, d + 1)  # Calculate the offset based on the input digit
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(two_positions, offset)))
  O = paint(O, recolor(d, shift(digit_positions, offset))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* We define relative positions for both the '2's and the input digit within the block.
* An offset is calculated based on the input digit, determining the block's position.
* We shift both the '2' positions and digit positions by the offset and paint them on the canvas.
