## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single-cell input grid containing a digit and produces a 14x10 output grid with specific shapes and positions based on the input digit. 

**Input 0:**

* An "L" shape formed by the digit '2' is placed near the bottom-left corner.
* Two horizontally adjacent squares formed by the digit '8' are placed above the "L". 

**Input 8:**

* An "L" shape formed by the digit '2' is placed near the top-right corner.
* Two horizontally adjacent squares formed by the input digit '8' are placed below the "L".

**Input other than 0 or 8:**

* An "L" shape formed by the digit '2' is placed slightly below the center.
* Two horizontally adjacent squares formed by the input digit are placed above the "L".


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated_v1(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  L_shape = frozenset({(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1)})  # Define L shape

  if d == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(L_shape, (8, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, hconcat(box(shift({(0, 0)}, (9, 2))), box(shift({(0, 0)}, (9, 3))))))
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(L_shape, (1, 6))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, hconcat(box(shift({(0, 0)}, (2, 4))), box(shift({(0, 0)}, (2, 5))))))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(L_shape, (3, 4))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, hconcat(box(shift({(0, 0)}, (4, 2))), box(shift({(0, 0)}, (4, 3))))))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   -  The input digit is extracted.
   -  A blank canvas of size 14x10 is created.
   -  The "L" shape is defined using indices relative to its upper-left corner.

2. **Conditional Placement:**
   -  Based on the input digit, the "L" shape (using '2' as its color) and two adjacent squares (using '8' or the input digit as their color) are placed at specific locations using `shift`, `recolor`, `hconcat`, and `box` functions.

3. **Output:**
    - The final grid with the placed shapes is returned. 

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated_v2(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  L_shape = frozenset({(-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, 0)})  # Define L shape

  if d == 0:
    square_position = (9, 2)
    L_position = (10, 1)
  elif d == 8:
    square_position = (2, 4)
    L_position = (1, 6)
  else:
    square_position = (4, 2)
    L_position = (3, 4)
  
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(L_shape, L_position)))
  O = paint(O, recolor(d if d != 0 else 8, hconcat(box(shift({(0, 0)}, square_position)), box(shift({(0, 0)}, (square_position[0], square_position[1] + 1))))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to version 1.

2. **Position Calculation:**
   -  Instead of directly specifying positions within each conditional branch, this version calculates the positions of the "L" shape and the squares based on the input digit.

3. **Shape Placement and Output:** Similar to version 1.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated_v3(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  base_L = objects(paint(canvas(0, (2, 3)), recolor(2, {(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1)})), T, F, T).pop()  # Generate L shape dynamically

  if d == 0:
    O = paint(O, shift(base_L, (8, 1)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, hconcat(box(shift({(0, 0)}, (9, 2))), box(shift({(0, 0)}, (9, 3)))))) 
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(O, shift(base_L, (1, 6)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, hconcat(box(shift({(0, 0)}, (2, 4))), box(shift({(0, 0)}, (2, 5)))))) 
  else:
    O = paint(O, shift(base_L, (3, 4)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, hconcat(box(shift({(0, 0)}, (4, 2))), box(shift({(0, 0)}, (4, 3)))))) 

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization and L Shape Generation:**
   - Similar to version 1, but the "L" shape is generated dynamically using `objects`, `paint`, and `recolor` functions instead of being defined by indices. 

2. **Placement and Output:** Similar to version 1.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated_v4(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  square = box({(0, 0)})
  L_shape = frozenset({(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1)})  # Define L shape

  if d == 0:
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(2, L_shape), (8, 1)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(hconcat(square, square), (9, 2))))
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(2, L_shape), (1, 6)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, shift(hconcat(square, square), (2, 4))))
  else:
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(2, L_shape), (3, 4)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, shift(hconcat(square, square), (4, 2))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization and Square Definition:**
   - Similar to version 1, but a `square` variable is defined to store the result of `box({(0, 0)})`, which represents a 1x1 square.

2. **Shape Placement:**
   -  The `hconcat` function is used with two `square` instances to create the two horizontally adjacent squares. 
   - This simplifies the code compared to using `box` and `shift` repeatedly for each square.

3. **Output:** Similar to version 1.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated_v5(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))

  L_shape = lambda x, y: paint(canvas(0, (2, 3)), recolor(2, {(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1)}))  # L shape as a lambda function

  if d == 0:
    O = paint(O, shift(L_shape(0, 0), (8, 1)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(hconcat(box({(0, 0)}), box({(0, 0)})), (9, 2))))
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(O, shift(L_shape(0, 0), (1, 6)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, shift(hconcat(box({(0, 0)}), box({(0, 0)})), (2, 4))))
  else:
    O = paint(O, shift(L_shape(0, 0), (3, 4)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, shift(hconcat(box({(0, 0)}), box({(0, 0)})), (4, 2))))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization and L Shape Lambda:**
    -  The "L" shape generation logic is encapsulated within a lambda function `L_shape`.  This improves code readability and reusability.

2. **Placement and Output:** Similar to version 4. 

Each of these program versions uses a different combination of DSL functions and approaches to achieve the same transformation, providing distinct solutions as requested.
