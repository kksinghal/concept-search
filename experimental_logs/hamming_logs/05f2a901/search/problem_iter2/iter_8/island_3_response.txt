## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the input digit and painting specific patterns on a canvas based on that digit. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input 0:**

* A single '2' shape (horizontal line) is drawn near the bottom of the canvas.
* Two '8' shapes (two vertical lines) are drawn above the '2' shape, slightly offset to the right.

**Input 8:**

* A '2' shape (square) is drawn slightly offset from the top left corner.
* An '8' shape (larger square) is drawn below and to the right of the '2' shape.

**Input 2:**

* An '8' shape (two vertical lines) is drawn near the top of the canvas, slightly offset from the left.
* A '2' shape (inverted L) is drawn below the '8' shape, with the corner touching the '8' shape. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = index(I, (0, 0))
  if digit == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (15, 9))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (1, 3)), (8, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 1)), (9, 4))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 1)), (11, 4))))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (2, 2)), (1, 4))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 2)), (3, 5))))
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 1)), (1, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 1)), (3, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (3, 2)), (3, 3))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version focuses on painting the shapes directly using `canvas`, `recolor`, and `shift`. 
* For each digit, it creates a canvas of appropriate size and then paints each part of the shape separately.
* `shift` is used to position the shapes correctly on the canvas.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = index(I, (0, 0))
  if d == 0:
    O = paint(paint(canvas(0, (15, 9)), recolor(2, shift(hline(canvas(1, (1, 3))), (8, 1)))),
              recolor(8, shift(vconcat(canvas(1, (2, 1)), canvas(1, (2, 1))), (9, 4))))
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(2, shift(canvas(1, (2, 2)), (1, 4)))), 
              recolor(8, shift(canvas(1, (2, 2)), (3, 5))))
  else:
    O = paint(paint(canvas(0, (12, 10)), recolor(8, shift(vconcat(canvas(1, (2, 1)), canvas(1, (2, 1))), (1, 1)))), 
               recolor(2, shift(hconcat(vline(canvas(1, (3, 1))), canvas(1, (3, 1))), (3, 3))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version utilizes `hline` and `vline` to create the basic line shapes.
* It then combines these lines using `vconcat` and `hconcat` to create the final shapes.
* Like version 1, it uses `recolor` and `shift` for color and positioning.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  n = index(I, (0, 0))
  if n == 0:
    base = canvas(0, (15, 9))
    two_shape = shift(canvas(2, (1, 3)), (9, 1))
    eight_shape = shift(vconcat(canvas(8, (2, 1)), canvas(8, (2, 1))), (10, 4))
    O = paint(paint(base, recolor(2, two_shape)), recolor(8, eight_shape))
  elif n == 8:
    base = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    two_shape = shift(canvas(2, (2, 2)), (1, 4))
    eight_shape = shift(canvas(8, (2, 2)), (3, 5))
    O = paint(paint(base, recolor(2, two_shape)), recolor(8, eight_shape))
  else:
    base = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    eight_shape = shift(vconcat(canvas(8, (2, 1)), canvas(8, (2, 1))), (1, 1))
    two_shape = shift(hconcat(vline(canvas(1, (3, 1))), canvas(1, (3, 1))), (3, 3))
    O = paint(paint(base, recolor(8, eight_shape)), recolor(2, two_shape))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version breaks down the shape creation into separate steps for better readability. 
* It first creates the base canvas and then defines variables for each shape using `canvas`, `vconcat`, `hconcat`, `shift`.
* Finally, it paints the shapes onto the base canvas.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  val = index(I, (0, 0))
  if val == 0:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (15, 9)), recolor(2, {(9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(10, 4), (11, 4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(10, 5), (11, 5)}))
  elif val == 8:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(2, {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6)}))
  else:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (12, 10)), recolor(8, {(1, 1), (2, 1)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(3, 1), (4, 1)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version directly specifies the indices of the cells to be colored for each shape.
* It creates the canvas and then paints the shapes by iterating through the defined index sets.
* This approach is less readable but potentially more efficient for simpler shapes.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = index(I, (0, 0))
  if d == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (15, 9))
    O = underpaint(O, recolor(2, shift(hline(canvas(1, (1, 3))), (8, 1))))
    O = underpaint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 2)), (9, 4))))
  elif d == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = underpaint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (2, 2)), (1, 4))))
    O = underpaint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 2)), (3, 5))))
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    O = underpaint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 2)), (1, 1))))
    O = underpaint(O, recolor(2, shift(hconcat(canvas(2, (3, 1)), canvas(2, (3, 1))), (3, 3))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version uses the `underpaint` function, which only paints on cells with the background color. 
* This approach simplifies the code by automatically handling overlapping shapes, as it only paints on empty cells.

These five program versions showcase different approaches and DSL function combinations to achieve the same transformation, illustrating the flexibility and diversity of solutions possible within the given DSL.
