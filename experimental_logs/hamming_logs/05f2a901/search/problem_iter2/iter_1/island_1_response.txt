## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single digit as input and creates a stylized representation of that digit, along with an "8" shape, on a larger canvas. Let's break down the transformation for each digit:

**Input 0:**

1. **"L" Shape:** The input "0" is transformed into an "L" shape formed by the digit "2" on the canvas. The "L" is positioned towards the bottom left corner.
2. **"8" Shape:** An "8" shape is drawn above the "L" shape. The outer part of the "8" is formed by the digit "2" while the inner part uses the digit "8".

**Input 8:**

1. **Shifted "8" Shape:** The "8" shape is shifted upwards compared to the "0" transformation. The outer part of the "8" is formed by the digit "2" and the inner part uses the digit "8". 
2. **No "L" shape:**  The "L" shape associated with the "0" input is not present in this transformation.

**Input 2:**

1. **Shifted & Extended "8" shape:** The "8" shape is further shifted upwards compared to the "8" input transformation. Additionally, the outer part of the "8" is extended downwards by one unit.
2. **Partial "L" shape:** Only the top horizontal bar of the "L" shape is present, formed by the digit "2".


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  n = index(I, (0, 0))
  C = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  if n == 0:
    C = paint(C, recolor(2, shift({(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)}, (8, 9)))) # L shape
    C = paint(C, recolor(2, shift({(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1)}, (8, 1)))) # Outer 8
    C = paint(C, recolor(8, shift({(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}, (8, 1)))) # Inner 8
  elif n == 8:
    C = paint(C, recolor(2, shift({(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1)}, (1, 1)))) # Outer 8
    C = paint(C, recolor(8, shift({(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}, (1, 1)))) # Inner 8
  else:
    C = paint(C, recolor(2, shift({(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1)}, (0, 0)))) # Extended Outer 8
    C = paint(C, recolor(8, shift({(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}, (0, 0)))) # Inner 8
    C = paint(C, recolor(2, shift({(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0)}, (4, 5)))) # Partial L
  return C
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to apply different transformations based on the input digit. It utilizes `recolor` and `shift` to create the shapes on the canvas. 

* **Input 0:** Draws both "L" and "8" shapes at their respective positions.
* **Input 8:** Draws only the "8" shape at a shifted position.
* **Input 2:** Draws a slightly extended "8" shape, along with the top bar of the "L" shape.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  v = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  eight_shape = recolor(2, {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1)}) | recolor(8, {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)})
  l_shape = recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)})
  if v == 0:
    O = paint(O, shift(eight_shape, (8, 1)))
    O = paint(O, shift(l_shape, (8, 9)))
  elif v == 8:
    O = paint(O, shift(eight_shape, (1, 1)))
  else:
    O = paint(O, shift(eight_shape, (0, 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(l_shape, (4, 5)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines the "8" and "L" shapes as separate variables using `recolor` and set notation. It then utilizes `shift` to position these shapes on the canvas based on the input digit.

* **Input 0:** Paints both pre-defined shapes at their designated positions.
* **Input 8:** Paints only the "8" shape at a shifted position.
* **Input 2:** Paints the "8" shape at the top, and a portion of the "L" shape lower down. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  d = index(I, (0, 0))
  canvas_dims = (14, 10)
  C = canvas(0, canvas_dims)
  eight_offset = {(0, 0): (0, 0), 8: (1, 1), 2: (0, 0)}[d]
  l_offset = {(0, 0): (8, 9), 8: (0, 0), 2: (4, 5)}[d]
  C = paint(C, recolor(2, shift({(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1)}, eight_offset)))
  C = paint(C, recolor(8, shift({(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}, eight_offset)))
  if d != 8:
    C = paint(C, recolor(2, shift({(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)}, l_offset)))
  return C
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses dictionaries to store the positional offsets for both the "8" and "L" shapes based on the input digit. This makes the code more concise and readable.

* **Input 0/8/2:** Retrieves the appropriate offset from the dictionary and applies it to the shape before painting.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  n = index(I, (0, 0))
  C = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  C = paint(C, recolor(2, shift({(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1)}, (1 - (n == 8), 1 - (n == 8)))))
  C = paint(C, recolor(8, shift({(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}, (1 - (n == 8), 1 - (n == 8)))))
  if n != 8:
    C = paint(C, recolor(2, shift({(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)}, (8 - 4 * (n != 0), 9 - 4 * (n != 0)))))
  return C
```

**Explanation:**

This version cleverly uses boolean expressions within the `shift` function to dynamically calculate offsets based on the input digit. It avoids conditional statements, making the code more compact.

* **Input 0/8/2:** The boolean expressions evaluate to different values depending on the input, leading to different offsets being applied.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  n = index(I, (0, 0))
  C = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  eight = lambda offset: paint(C, recolor(2, shift({(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1)}, offset)))
  inner_eight = lambda offset: paint(C, recolor(8, shift({(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}, offset)))
  l_shape = lambda offset: paint(C, recolor(2, shift({(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)}, offset)))
  
  if n == 0:
    C = eight((8, 1))
    C = inner_eight((8, 1))
    C = l_shape((8, 9))
  elif n == 8:
    C = eight((1, 1))
    C = inner_eight((1, 1))
  else:
    C = eight((0, 0))
    C = inner_eight((0, 0))
    C = l_shape((4, 5))
  return C
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines lambda functions for each shape, making the code more modular. Each lambda function takes an offset as an argument and paints the corresponding shape at that offset on the canvas.

* **Input 0/8/2:**  The code calls the appropriate lambda functions with the correct offsets based on the input digit.

These are just a few examples of how the provided DSL can be used to achieve the desired transformation. It's important to note that there are many other valid and creative solutions possible.
