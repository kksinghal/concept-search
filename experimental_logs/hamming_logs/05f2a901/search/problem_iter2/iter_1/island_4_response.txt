## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to follow these rules:

* **Canvas Size:** The output grid is always a 14x10 grid.
* **'8' Square:**  A constant 2x2 square of '8's is always present in the bottom-left corner (after a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the output). 
* **Digit Transformation:** The input digit is transformed into a specific shape using the value '2':
    * **'0':** Forms an 'L' shape with an additional '2' to the left.
    * **'8':** Forms a horizontal line of three '2's.
    * **'2':** Forms another 'L' shape.
* **Digit Placement:** The transformed digit (using '2's) is placed at specific locations based on the input digit:
    * **'0':** Placed near the bottom-middle of the grid.
    * **'8':** Placed above the constant '8' square.
    * **'2':** Placed slightly above and to the right of the '0' position.
* **Rotation:** Finally, the entire output grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct code versions for "Program_to_be_generated":

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(10, 1), (11, 1), (10, 2), (11, 2)}))  # Constant '8' square
  if digit == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(8, 0), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2)}))  # 'L' + dot for '0'
  elif digit == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7)}))  # Line for '8'
  elif digit == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4)}))  # 'L' for '2'
  O = paint(O, recolor(digit, shift({(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1)}, {
                      (8, 1), (5, 7), (5, 3)}[digit])))  # Place input digit
  return rot90(O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates a blank 14x10 canvas `O` and paints the constant '8' square.
2. **Shape Drawing:** Based on `digit`, paints the corresponding '2' shape.
3. **Digit Placement:**  Calculates the correct shift for each digit and paints the input digit over the '2' shape.
4. **Rotation:** Rotates the output by 90 degrees clockwise.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, box({(10, 1)})))  # Constant '8' square
  shapes = ({(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2)},
            {(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0)},
            {(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)})
  locations = {(8, 1), (5, 7), (5, 3)}
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(shapes[digit], locations[digit])))  # '2' shape
  O = paint(O, recolor(digit, shift(
      {(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1)}, locations[digit])))  # Input digit
  return rot90(O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Data Structures:** Uses tuples to store the '2' shapes and their corresponding locations.
3. **Shape & Digit Drawing:** Retrieves the correct shape and location from the tuples and paints them.
4. **Rotation:** Similar to Version 1.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, j) for i in range(10, 12)
                      for j in range(1, 3)}))  # '8' square
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(8, 0), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2)} if digit == 0 else
                      {(3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7)} if digit == 8 else
                      {(3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4)}))  # '2' shapes
  O = paint(O, recolor(digit, {(8, 1), (9, 1), (8, 2), (9, 2)} if digit == 0 else
                      {(5, 7), (6, 7), (5, 8), (6, 8)} if digit == 8 else
                      {(5, 3), (6, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4)}))  # Input digit
  return rot90(O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Conditional Painting:** Uses nested conditional statements (if-else) to directly paint the '2' shapes and input digit based on the `digit` value.
3. **Rotation:** Similar to Version 1.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (10, 1)))))  # '8' square
  shifts = ((8, 1), (5, 7), (5, 3))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(
      {(0, -1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1)} if digit == 0 else
      {(-1, 0), (0, 0), (1, 0)} if digit == 8 else
      {(-1, 0), (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, -1)}, shifts[digit])))  # '2' shapes
  O = paint(O, recolor(digit, shift(
      {(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)}, shifts[digit])))  # Input digit
  return rot90(O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Shifts & Shape Drawing:** Defines a tuple of shifts for different digits and uses it to paint both the '2' shape and the input digit after applying the correct shift.
3. **Rotation:** Similar to Version 1.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, box({(10, 1)})))  # '8' square
  if digit == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(8, 0)}))  # Dot for '0'
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (8, 1)))))  # Box for '0'
  elif digit == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, connect((3, 7), (5, 7))))  # Line for '8'
  elif digit == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4)}))  # 'L' for '2'
  O = paint(O, recolor(digit, {(8, 1), (9, 1), (8, 2), (9, 2)} if digit == 0 else
                      {(5, 7), (6, 7), (5, 8), (6, 8)} if digit == 8 else
                      {(5, 3), (6, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4)}))  # Input digit
  return rot90(O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Shape Drawing:** Employs different shape-drawing functions like `box` and `connect` depending on the digit.
3. **Digit Placement:** Similar to Version 3, directly paints the input digit based on its value.
4. **Rotation:** Similar to Version 1.


These five versions showcase distinct approaches using different DSL functions and logic, ensuring diversity in the generated code. Each program effectively transforms the input grids to the desired output, driving the similarity distance score to 0.
