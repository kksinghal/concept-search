## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on identifying the single-color digit present in the input grid and then constructing a specific output grid based on the digit's value.  The output grid always features the digits "2" and "8" arranged in distinct patterns. Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input 0 - Output 0:**
- Input: A single cell grid containing the digit "0".
- Transformation: The output is a 15x9 grid with the digit "2" forming two distinct shapes: a larger "C" shape at the bottom right and a smaller "C" shape in the middle right. 
- The rest of the grid is filled with "0".

**Input 1 - Output 1:**
- Input: A single cell grid containing the digit "8".
- Transformation: The output is a 10x10 grid with the digit "2" forming an "L" shape open to the right, and the digit "8" forming a square shape within the "L".
- The rest of the grid is filled with "0".

**Input 2 - Output 2:**
- Input: A single cell grid containing the digit "0".
- Transformation: The output is a 12x10 grid with the digit "8" forming a square shape at the top middle, and the digit "2" forming a larger "C" shape below it. 
- The rest of the grid is filled with "0".

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1: Using conditional statements and shape construction**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  value = color(digit)

  if value == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (15, 9))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2,  product(interval(8,11,1), interval(1,4,1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2,  product(interval(9,12,1), interval(5,8,1))))
  elif value == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, product(interval(3,7,1), interval(4,6,1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, product(interval(4,6,1), interval(5,7,1))))
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, product(interval(1,3,1), interval(3,5,1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, product(interval(3,6,1), interval(3,5,1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, product(interval(4,7,1), interval(5,8,1))))
  return O
```
**Explanation:**

- This version directly constructs the shapes of "2" and "8" using the `product` function to combine row and column intervals. 
- It utilizes conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to create different output grids based on the input digit value.

**Version 2: Predefined shapes and shifts**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  value = color(digit)

  shape_0_1 = {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)}
  shape_0_2 = {(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)}
  shape_8 = {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1)}

  if value == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (15, 9))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(shape_0_1, (8, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(shape_0_2, (9, 5))))
  elif value == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(shape_8, (3, 4))))
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(shape_0_2, (1, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(shape_0_1, (3, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(shape_0_2, (4, 5))))

  return O
```
**Explanation:**

- This version predefines the shapes of "2" and "8" as sets of coordinates.
- It then uses the `shift` function to move these shapes to their correct positions on the output grid. 
- This approach emphasizes code reusability and readability.

**Version 3: Using nested loops for shape generation**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  value = color(digit)

  if value == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (15, 9))
    for i in range(8, 11):
      for j in range(1, 4):
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, j)}))
    for i in range(9, 12):
      for j in range(5, 8):
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, j)}))
  elif value == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    for i in range(3, 7):
      for j in range(4, 6):
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, j)}))
    for i in range(4, 6):
      for j in range(5, 7):
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, j)}))
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    for i in range(1, 3):
      for j in range(3, 5):
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, j)}))
    for i in range(3, 6):
      for j in range(3, 5):
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, j)}))
    for i in range(4, 7):
      for j in range(5, 8):
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, j)}))

  return O
```
**Explanation:**

- This version utilizes nested loops to iterate over specific ranges of rows and columns, painting the "2" and "8" shapes cell by cell.
- While less concise than previous versions, it offers a more granular control over individual cell manipulation.

**Version 4: Combining shape construction and shifts**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  value = color(digit)

  two_shape = lambda w, h: {(i, j) for i in range(h) for j in range(w)}

  if value == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (15, 9))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(two_shape(3, 2), (8, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(two_shape(3, 3), (9, 5))))
  elif value == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(two_shape(2, 4), (3, 4))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(two_shape(2, 2), (4, 5))))
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(two_shape(2, 2), (1, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(two_shape(2, 3), (3, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(two_shape(3, 3), (4, 5))))
  return O
```
**Explanation:**

- This version defines a lambda function `two_shape` to generate rectangular shapes of specified width and height. 
- It then combines this function with the `shift` function to position these shapes on the output grid. 
- This approach balances code conciseness with shape generation flexibility.

**Version 5: Utilizing rotations and mirroring for shape variation**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  value = color(digit)

  base_shape = {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)}

  if value == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (15, 9))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(base_shape, (8, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(rot90(base_shape), (9, 5))))
  elif value == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(vconcat(base_shape, base_shape), (3, 4))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(base_shape, (4, 5))))
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(base_shape, (1, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(vconcat(base_shape, base_shape), (3, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(rot90(vconcat(base_shape, base_shape)), (4, 5))))
  return O
```
**Explanation:**

- This version introduces the use of `rot90` (rotation) and `vconcat` (vertical concatenation) to generate variations of a base square shape. 
- It then positions these transformed shapes using the `shift` function. 
- This approach demonstrates the use of geometric transformations for efficient shape manipulation. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to solving the given transformation task. Each version utilizes unique logic and DSL function combinations, ensuring diversity in the proposed solutions.
