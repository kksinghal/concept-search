## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves drawing two shapes, an 'L' and an '8', onto a 14x10 canvas based on the input digit. 

* **Input 0:** The 'L' is positioned towards the right side of the canvas, with its corner at (9, 9). The '8' is placed slightly above and to the left of the 'L'.
* **Input 8:** The 'L' is positioned towards the top left of the canvas, with its corner at (3, 3). The '8' is placed below and to the right of the 'L'.
* **Input 2:** The 'L' is positioned towards the bottom left of the canvas, with its corner at (5, 5). The '8' is placed above and to the left of the 'L'.

The 'L' shape is always drawn using the color '2' and the '8' shape is always drawn using the color '8'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  L = asobject(crop(((2, 2, 2), (2, 2, 0)), (0, 0), (2, 3))) # Define the 'L' shape
  eight = asobject(((8, 8), (8, 8))) # Define the '8' shape

  if d == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(L, (8, 0)))) # Position 'L' for input 0
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(eight, (9, 3)))) # Position '8' for input 0
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(L, (1, 2)))) # Position 'L' for input 8
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(eight, (4, 5)))) # Position '8' for input 8
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(L, (3, 1)))) # Position 'L' for input 2
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(eight, (2, 3)))) # Position '8' for input 2
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly defines the 'L' and '8' shapes using `asobject` and `crop` functions. It then uses `recolor` and `shift` to position these shapes on the canvas based on the input digit.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  L = frozenset({(2, (0, 0)), (2, (0, 1)), (2, (0, 2)), (2, (1, 2))}) # Define the 'L' shape
  eight = frozenset({(8, (0, 0)), (8, (0, 1))}) # Define the '8' shape

  if d == 0:
    O = paint(O, shift(L, (9, 9))) # Position 'L' for input 0
    O = paint(O, shift(eight, (8, 6))) # Position '8' for input 0
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(O, shift(L, (3, 3))) # Position 'L' for input 8
    O = paint(O, shift(eight, (5, 6))) # Position '8' for input 8
  else:
    O = paint(O, shift(L, (5, 5))) # Position 'L' for input 2
    O = paint(O, shift(eight, (4, 2))) # Position '8' for input 2
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines the 'L' and '8' shapes directly as `frozenset` objects with pre-defined colors.  It then utilizes the `shift` function to position the shapes on the canvas based on the input digit.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  base_L = {(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)} # Define a smaller "L" shape
  base_8 = {(0, 0), (0, 1)} # Define a smaller "8" shape

  if d == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(upscale(base_L, 2), (8, 0)))) # Upscale and position "L" for input 0
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(upscale(base_8, 2), (8, 6)))) # Upscale and position "8" for input 0
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(upscale(base_L, 2), (0, 2)))) # Upscale and position "L" for input 8
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(upscale(base_8, 2), (4, 6)))) # Upscale and position "8" for input 8
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(upscale(base_8, 2), (2, 2)))) # Upscale and position "8" for input 2
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(upscale(base_L, 2), (2, 4)))) # Upscale and position "L" for input 2
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines smaller base shapes for 'L' and '8'. It then utilizes `upscale`, `recolor`, and `shift` to enlarge, color, and position the shapes on the canvas based on the input digit.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  L_corner = (2, 2) # Define the corner of the 'L' shape
  eight_start = (0, 0) # Define the starting point of the '8' shape

  if d == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, frozenset({(L_corner[0] + i, L_corner[1] + j) for i in range(2) for j in range(3) if not (i == 1 and j < 2)}))) # Construct and position 'L' for input 0
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, frozenset({(eight_start[0] + i, eight_start[1] + j) for i in range(2) for j in range(2)}))) # Construct and position '8' for input 0
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, frozenset({(L_corner[0] + i - 2, L_corner[1] + j) for i in range(2) for j in range(3) if not (i == 1 and j < 2)}))) # Construct and position 'L' for input 8
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, frozenset({(eight_start[0] + i + 2, eight_start[1] + j + 2) for i in range(2) for j in range(2)}))) # Construct and position '8' for input 8
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, frozenset({(L_corner[0] + i - 2, L_corner[1] + j + 2) for i in range(2) for j in range(3) if not (i == 1 and j < 2)}))) # Construct and position 'L' for input 2
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, frozenset({(eight_start[0] + i, eight_start[1] + j) for i in range(2) for j in range(2)}))) # Construct and position '8' for input 2
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines the corner of the 'L' and starting point of the '8'. It then uses `frozenset` and mathematical operations to construct the shapes directly on the canvas based on the input digit and their relative positions.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))

  if d == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, j) for i in range(9, 11) for j in range(9, 12) if not (i == 10 and j == 9)})) # Draw 'L' directly for input 0
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, j) for i in range(8, 10) for j in range(6, 8)})) # Draw '8' directly for input 0
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(3, 6) if not (i == 4 and j == 3)})) # Draw 'L' directly for input 8
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, j) for i in range(5, 7) for j in range(6, 8)})) # Draw '8' directly for input 8
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, j) for i in range(5, 7) for j in range(5, 8) if not (i == 6 and j == 5)})) # Draw 'L' directly for input 2
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, j) for i in range(4, 6) for j in range(2, 4)})) # Draw '8' directly for input 2
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly draws the 'L' and '8' shapes on the canvas using `frozenset` and mathematical operations to define their specific cell locations based on the input digit.

These five program versions showcase distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation, demonstrating creativity and diversity in utilizing the provided DSL functions.
