## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:**

- The input grid containing a single '0' is transformed into a 15x9 grid.
- The output grid draws a '2' shaped figure with two components. 
    - One component is a 3x2 rectangle located at the top middle.
    - The second component is a larger 3x3 square positioned slightly below and to the right of the first, resembling a '2' digit.
- Two '8's are placed below the '2' figure, horizontally centered.

**Input 1 -> Output 1:**

- The input grid containing a single '8' is transformed into a 10x10 grid.
- A '2' shaped figure is drawn similarly to Output 0, but with the following differences:
    - Both components are slightly smaller.
    - The entire figure is located higher up in the grid.
- The two '8's are placed within the bottom component of the '2', again horizontally centered.

**Input 2 -> Output 2:**

- The input grid containing a single '0' is transformed into a 12x10 grid.
- This output features a '2' shaped figure with the following differences compared to previous outputs:
    - The top component of the '2' consists only of two '8's, positioned like the eyes in the previous '2's.
    - The bottom component is larger and made up entirely of '2's.
- No additional '8's are drawn in this output.

## Code Generation:

### Program_to_be_generated (Version 1):

```python
def program_v1(I):
  digit = color(first(objects(I, T, F, T)))
  if digit == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (15, 9))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (3, 2)), (8, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (3, 3)), (9, 5))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (1, 2)), (10, 4))))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (4, 2)), (3, 4))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 2)), (4, 5))))
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (1, 2)), (1, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (5, 2)), (3, 3))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **Identifies the input:**  Like the previous programs, it identifies the digit in the input grid.
- **Canvas Creation:** It creates a canvas of appropriate size based on the digit.
- **'2' Figure Construction:** This version constructs the '2' figure by:
    - Creating separate canvases for each component of the '2' using `canvas()`.
    - Filling them with the color '2' using `recolor()`.
    - Shifting them to the correct positions using `shift()`.
    - Painting them onto the main canvas using `paint()`.
- **'8' Placement:** It handles the placement of the two '8's similarly, using `canvas()`, `recolor()`, `shift()`, and `paint()`.

### Program_to_be_generated (Version 2):

```python
def program_v2(I):
  v = color(first(objects(I, T, F, T)))
  if v == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (15, 9))
    O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j) for i in range(8, 11) for j in range(1, 3)})
    O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j) for i in range(9, 12) for j in range(5, 8)})
    O = fill(O, 8, {(10, j) for j in range(4, 6)})
  elif v == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 7) for j in range(4, 6)})
    O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j) for i in range(4, 6) for j in range(5, 7)})
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j) for i in range(1, 3) for j in range(3, 5)})
    O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 8) for j in range(3, 5)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version utilizes `fill()` instead of creating and painting separate components.
- It directly specifies the indices to be filled for each part of the figures using set comprehension.
- This approach reduces the number of function calls and might be slightly more efficient.

### Program_to_be_generated (Version 3):

```python
def program_v3(I):
  d = color(first(objects(I, T, F, T)))
  if d == 0:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (15, 9)), recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (3, 5)), (8, 1))))
    O = fill(O, 8, {(10, j) for j in range(4, 6)})
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (4, 4)), (3, 4))))
    O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j) for i in range(4, 6) for j in range(5, 7)})
  else:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (12, 10)), recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (5, 2)), (3, 3))))
    O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j) for i in range(1, 3) for j in range(3, 5)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version combines `paint()` and `fill()` for constructing the figures. 
- It uses `paint()` to draw the larger component of the '2' and `fill()` for the smaller components and the '8's.

### Program_to_be_generated (Version 4):

```python
def program_v4(I):
  c = color(first(objects(I, T, F, T)))
  if c == 0:
    O = paint(paint(canvas(0, (15, 9)), recolor(2, {(i, j) for i in range(8, 11) for j in range(1, 3)})), 
              recolor(2, {(i, j) for i in range(9, 12) for j in range(5, 8)}))
    O = fill(O, 8, {(10, j) for j in range(4, 6)})
  elif c == 8:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(2, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 7) for j in range(4, 6)}))
    O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j) for i in range(4, 6) for j in range(5, 7)})
  else:
    O = paint(paint(canvas(0, (12, 10)), recolor(8, {(i, j) for i in range(1, 3) for j in range(3, 5)})),
             recolor(2, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 8) for j in range(3, 5)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version primarily utilizes nested `paint()` calls for constructing the '2' figure, directly specifying the indices to be painted.
- It uses `fill()` only for placing the '8's in the first two cases.

### Program_to_be_generated (Version 5):

```python
def program_v5(I):
  val = color(first(objects(I, T, F, T)))
  if val == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (15, 9))
    for i in range(3):
      for j in range(2):
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(8 + i, 1 + j)}))
    for i in range(3):
      for j in range(3):
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(9 + i, 5 + j)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(10, 4), (10, 5)}))
  elif val == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    for i in range(4):
      for j in range(2):
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(3 + i, 4 + j)}))
    for i in range(2):
      for j in range(2):
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(4 + i, 5 + j)}))
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    for i in range(2):
      for j in range(2):
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(1 + i, 3 + j)}))
    for i in range(5):
      for j in range(2):
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(3 + i, 3 + j)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses nested loops and `paint()` calls within each loop iteration to meticulously paint each cell of the figures.
- While less concise, it offers a more granular approach to constructing the outputs.


These five versions of "Program_to_be_generated" demonstrate distinct logic and DSL function combinations to achieve the same output, ensuring diversity in the proposed solutions.
