## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single digit as input and places a specific shape on a 14x10 canvas, with the digit itself embedded within the shape. The shape and its location depend on the input digit:

**Input 0:**

* **Shape:** An "L" shape formed by a 3-cell horizontal line and a 2-cell vertical line connected at their ends.
* **Location:** Bottom left corner at (8,8) on the canvas.
* **Digit Placement:**  Within a 2x2 square at the corner of the "L" shape.

**Input 8:**

* **Shape:** A 2x3 rectangle.
* **Location:**  Top right corner at (5,5) on the canvas.
* **Digit Placement:** Within the top left 2x2 square of the rectangle.

**Input 2:**

* **Shape:** A "T" shape formed by a 4-cell vertical line and a 3-cell horizontal line connected at their centers.
* **Location:**  Top left corner at (2,3) on the canvas.
* **Digit Placement:** Within the bottom 2x2 square of the vertical line of the "T". 

## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, box({(10,1)})))  # '8' square (unchanged)

  if d == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, combine(connect((8, 8), (10, 8)), connect((9, 8), (9, 9))))) # 'L' shape
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (8, 8))))) # Digit square
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (3, 5)), (2, 3)))) # Rectangle
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (3, 5))))) # Digit square
  elif d == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, combine(connect((2, 3), (5, 3)), connect((3, 3), (3, 5))))) # 'T' shape
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (4, 3))))) # Digit square
  
  return rot90(O)
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses `connect` to draw the lines of the shapes and `combine` to merge them. `box` with different dimensions and `shift` positions the shapes and digit squares correctly.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, box({(10,1)})))

  shapes = (
      combine(connect((0, 2), (0, 0)), connect((0, 0), (2, 0))),  # 'L' shape
      box((2, 3)),                                               # Rectangle
      combine(connect((0, 0), (0, 3)), connect((0, 1), (2, 1)))   # 'T' shape
  )
  locations = ((8, 8), (3, 5), (2, 3))

  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(shapes[d], locations[d]))) 
  O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, locations[d] if d != 2 else (locations[d][0] + 2, locations[d][1]))))) 

  return rot90(O)
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines the shapes and locations in separate tuples for clarity. It then uses indexing to select the correct shape and location based on the input digit.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, box({(10,1)})))

  shape_functions = (
      lambda: combine(connect((8, 8), (10, 8)), connect((9, 8), (9, 9))),
      lambda: box(shift({(0, 0)}, (3, 5)), (2, 3)),
      lambda: combine(connect((2, 3), (5, 3)), connect((3, 3), (3, 5)))
  )
  digit_locations = ((8, 8), (3, 5), (4, 3))

  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shape_functions[d]()))
  O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, digit_locations[d])))) 

  return rot90(O)
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines functions for each shape and uses a tuple of function references to select the correct shape. It also defines a separate tuple for digit locations. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, box({(10,1)})))

  if d == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, combine( {(i, 8) for i in range(8, 11)}, {(9, j) for j in range(8, 10)})))
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (8, 8)))))
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(5, 8)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (3, 5)))))
  elif d == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, combine( {(i, 3) for i in range(2, 6)}, {(3, j) for j in range(3, 6)})))
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (4, 3)))))
  
  return rot90(O)
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes set comprehensions to define the shapes directly within the conditional statements. It provides a more concise way to define simple shapes like rectangles and lines.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, box({(10,1)})))

  base_shape = box(shift({(0, 0)}, (8, 8))) # Default: square at (8,8)

  if d == 0:
    base_shape = combine(base_shape, {(9, 9)})  # Add a cell to form 'L'
  elif d == 8:
    base_shape = shift(base_shape, (-5, -3)) # Move to (3,5)
    base_shape = box(base_shape, (2, 3)) # Resize to 2x3 rectangle
  elif d == 2:
    base_shape = shift(base_shape, (-6, -5)) # Move to (2,3)
    base_shape = combine(base_shape, {(i, 4) for i in range(3, 6)}) # Add cells to form 'T'

  O = paint(O, recolor(2, base_shape))
  O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, ulcorner(base_shape))))) 

  return rot90(O)
```

**Explanation:**

This version starts with a base square shape and modifies it based on the input digit. It uses `ulcorner` to find the upper left corner of the shape for digit placement. 

Each of these program versions provides a different approach to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and diversity of the DSL.
