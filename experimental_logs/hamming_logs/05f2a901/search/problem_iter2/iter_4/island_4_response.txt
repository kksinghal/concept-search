## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking a single digit input and creating a larger output grid featuring the input digit and a specific shape associated with it. Additionally, there's always an '8' at position (10,1) in the output.

**Input 0:**
- **Digit:** 0
- **Shape:** L-shape formed by '2's 
- **Output Position:** Digit (8,8), shape attached to the digit, extending up and right.

**Input 1:**
- **Digit:** 8
- **Shape:** 2x3 rectangle formed by '2's
- **Output Position:** Digit (5,7), shape above the digit

**Input 2:**
- **Digit:** 2
- **Shape:**  T-shape formed by '2's
- **Output Position:** Digit (5,3), shape above the digit 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, box({(10,1)})))

  shapes = (
      combine(connect((8, 8), (10, 8)), connect((9, 8), (9, 9))), # L shape
      box(shift({(0, 0)}, (1, 2)), (2, 3)), # Rectangle shifted to start at (1,2)
      combine(connect((3, 3), (5, 3)), connect((4, 3), (4, 5))) # T shape 
  )
  locations = ((8, 8), (3, 5), (3, 3)) # Adjusted locations 

  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(shapes[d], locations[d]))) 
  O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, locations[d]))))

  return rot90(O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create a blank canvas (14x10), and paint the constant '8'.
2. **Shapes Definition:** Define the three shapes (L, rectangle, T) as objects using `connect` and `box` functions.
3. **Locations:** Store the starting positions of each shape relative to the digit.
4. **Painting:** Paint the correct shape with '2's at the correct location using `shift`.
5. **Painting Digit:** Paint the input digit at the corresponding location.
6. **Rotation:** Rotate the grid 90 degrees.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, box({(10,1)})))

  if d == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, combine(connect((8, 8), (10, 8)), connect((9, 8), (9, 9))))) # L shape
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (8, 8))))) # Digit square
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (3, 6)), (2, 3)))) # Rectangle shifted to (3,6) and then resized
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (3, 5))))) # Digit square
  elif d == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, combine(connect((3, 3), (5, 3)), connect((4, 3), (4, 5))))) # T shape
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (4, 3))))) # Digit square

  return rot90(O) 
```

**Explanation:**

- This version directly uses `if-elif-else` to handle each digit case separately.
- It defines and places each shape individually, utilizing `connect`, `box`, and `shift` functions for accurate placement and sizing.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (10, 14)) # Initial canvas with swapped dimensions

  shape_functions = (
      lambda: combine(connect((8, 1), (8, 3)), connect((8, 2), (9, 2))), # L shape
      lambda: box(shift({(0, 0)}, (6, 3)), (3, 2)), # Rectangle (rotated)
      lambda: combine(connect((3, 1), (3, 3)), connect((3, 2), (5, 2))) # T shape (rotated)
  )
  digit_locations = ((8, 8), (5, 3), (3, 4)) # Adjusted for swapped dimensions

  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shape_functions[d]()))
  O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, digit_locations[d])))) 

  return O # No rotation needed
```

**Explanation:**

- This version constructs the canvas with swapped dimensions (10x14) and avoids the final rotation.
- It uses lambda functions to define each shape, allowing dynamic construction.
-  Shapes are adjusted for the rotated canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, box({(1, 9)}))) # 8 placed directly after rotation

  shape_data = (
      (((8, 8), (10, 8)), ((9, 8), (9, 9))),  # L shape connection points
      (((0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)), (3, 6)),  # Rectangle points and location
      (((3, 3), (5, 3)), ((4, 3), (4, 5)))  # T shape connection points
  )

  if d == 0 or d == 2:
    p1, p2 = shape_data[d]
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, combine(connect(*p1), connect(*p2))))
  elif d == 8:
    points, loc = shape_data[d]
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(box(frozenset(points)), loc)))

  O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, ulcorner(ofcolor(O, 2)))))) 
  
  return rot90(O)
```

**Explanation:**

-  Pre-calculates the '8' position after rotation.
-  Uses tuples to store shape connection points or box points and location.
-  Dynamically constructs shapes based on the digit using `connect` or `box` with `shift`.
-  Finds the digit's location based on the upper-left corner of the '2' shape.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, box({(10, 1)})))

  base_shape = box(shift({(0, 0)}, (8, 8)))  # Default: square at (8,8)

  if d == 0:
    base_shape = combine(base_shape, {(9, 9)})  # Add a cell to form 'L'
  elif d == 8:
    base_shape = shift(base_shape, (-5, -3))  # Move to (3,5)
    base_shape = box(frozenset((0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)) # Construct a 2x2 box 
                      for _ in range(2)) # Repeat to get a 2x3 rectangle 
  elif d == 2:
    base_shape = shift(base_shape, (-6, -5))  # Move to (2,3)
    base_shape = combine(base_shape, {(i, 4) for i in range(3, 6)})  # Add cells to form 'T'

  O = paint(O, recolor(2, base_shape))
  O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, ulcorner(base_shape)))))

  return rot90(O)
```

**Explanation:**

- Starts with a default square shape and modifies it based on the digit.
- Uses set comprehension to add cells for the 'L' and 'T' shapes.
- Employs a clever technique of repeating a 2x2 box construction to achieve the 2x3 rectangle.
- Determines the digit's location using the upper-left corner of the final shape.


These five versions provide distinct approaches and logic for achieving the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. Each version offers a unique combination of functions, data structures, and control flow, highlighting the diverse ways to solve the same problem within the DSL's constraints.
