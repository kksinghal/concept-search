## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to interpret the input digit as an instruction to draw and position two specific shapes on a canvas: an "L" shape (using digit '2') and an "8" shape (using digit '8'). 

**Input 0 (Digit 0):**
* The "L" shape is upscaled and positioned at the bottom center of the canvas.
* The "8" shape is upscaled and positioned to the right of the "L" shape.

**Input 8 (Digit 8):**
* The "L" shape is upscaled and positioned on the left side of the canvas, slightly offset from the top. 
* The "8" shape is upscaled and positioned to the right of the "L" shape, also slightly offset from the top.

**Input 2 (Digit 2):**
* The "8" shape is upscaled and positioned slightly offset from the top center of the canvas.
* The "L" shape is upscaled and positioned below the "8" shape.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions utilizing different DSL functions and logic:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  L = asobject(((2, 2, 2, 0), (2, 0, 2, 0))) # Define L shape
  E = asobject(((0, 8, 8, 0), (0, 8, 8, 0))) # Define 8 shape
  if d == 0:
    O = paint(O, shift(upscale(L, 2), (8, 2)))
    O = paint(O, shift(upscale(E, 2), (8, 6)))
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(O, shift(upscale(L, 2), (0, 2)))
    O = paint(O, shift(upscale(E, 2), (6, 2)))
  else:
    O = paint(O, shift(upscale(E, 2), (2, 2)))
    O = paint(O, shift(upscale(L, 2), (2, 6)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Predefined Shapes:** This version predefines the "L" and "8" shapes as objects using `asobject` for clarity and reusability.
* **Conditional Placement:** It uses `if-elif-else` blocks to position the upscaled shapes based on the input digit.
* **Direct Shifting:** Shapes are positioned directly using `shift` after upscaling with `upscale`.


**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = index(I, ORIGIN)
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  if d == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(upscale(asindices(((2, 2, 2, 0), (2, 0, 2, 0))), 2), (8, 2))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(upscale(asindices(((0, 8, 8, 0), (0, 8, 8, 0))), 2), (8, 6))))
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(upscale(asindices(((2, 2, 2, 0), (2, 0, 2, 0))), 2), (0, 2))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(upscale(asindices(((0, 8, 8, 0), (0, 8, 8, 0))), 2), (6, 2))))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(upscale(asindices(((0, 8, 8, 0), (0, 8, 8, 0))), 2), (2, 2))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(upscale(asindices(((2, 2, 2, 0), (2, 0, 2, 0))), 2), (2, 6))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Indices-Based Shapes:** Instead of predefining objects, this version defines shapes using `asindices` and applies color during painting using `recolor`.
* **Chained Transformations:** It chains `upscale`, `shift`, and `recolor` within `paint` for a more compact representation.


**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  L = lambda s, p: paint(O, recolor(2, shift(upscale(asindices(s), 2), p)))  
  E = lambda s, p: paint(O, recolor(8, shift(upscale(asindices(s), 2), p))) 
  if d == 0:
    O = L(((2, 2, 2, 0), (2, 0, 2, 0)), (8, 2))
    O = E(((0, 8, 8, 0), (0, 8, 8, 0)), (8, 6))
  elif d == 8:
    O = L(((2, 2, 2, 0), (2, 0, 2, 0)), (0, 2))
    O = E(((0, 8, 8, 0), (0, 8, 8, 0)), (6, 2))
  else:
    O = E(((0, 8, 8, 0), (0, 8, 8, 0)), (2, 2))
    O = L(((2, 2, 2, 0), (2, 0, 2, 0)), (2, 6))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Lambda Functions:** This version defines lambda functions `L` and `E` to abstract the shape creation and positioning logic.
* **Shape and Position Parameters:**  The lambda functions take the shape indices and position as parameters, enhancing code reusability.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = index(I, ORIGIN)
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  shapes = {
      0: ((asindices(((2, 2, 2, 0), (2, 0, 2, 0))), (8, 2)), (asindices(((0, 8, 8, 0), (0, 8, 8, 0))), (8, 6))),
      8: ((asindices(((2, 2, 2, 0), (2, 0, 2, 0))), (0, 2)), (asindices(((0, 8, 8, 0), (0, 8, 8, 0))), (6, 2))),
      2: ((asindices(((0, 8, 8, 0), (0, 8, 8, 0))), (2, 2)), (asindices(((2, 2, 2, 0), (2, 0, 2, 0))), (2, 6)))
  }
  for shape, pos in shapes[d]:
    if shape[0][0] == 2:
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(upscale(shape, 2), pos)))
    else:
      O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(upscale(shape, 2), pos)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Shape Dictionary:**  This version introduces a dictionary `shapes` to store the shape indices and positions based on the input digit.
* **Data-Driven Approach:**  It iterates through the shapes in the dictionary, making the code more concise and adaptable to new shapes or positions.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  L = asobject(((2, 2, 2, 0), (2, 0, 2, 0)))
  E = asobject(((0, 8, 8, 0), (0, 8, 8, 0)))
  positions = {
      0: ((8, 2), (8, 6)),
      8: ((0, 2), (6, 2)),
      2: ((2, 2), (2, 6))
  }
  pos1, pos2 = positions[d]
  O = paint(O, shift(upscale(L, 2), pos1))
  O = paint(O, shift(upscale(E, 2), pos2))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Position Dictionary:** This version simplifies the logic by using a dictionary `positions` to store only the positions of the shapes based on the input digit. 
* **Direct Shape Placement:** It directly places the shapes using the retrieved positions after upscaling, resulting in cleaner code.

These five versions offer distinct approaches to the problem, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL while aiming to achieve the desired transformations.
