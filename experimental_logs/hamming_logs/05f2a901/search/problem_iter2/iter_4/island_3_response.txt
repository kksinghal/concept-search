## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the unique digit in the input grid and generating specific patterns of '2's and '8's on a larger output grid. 

* **Input 0 (Digit 0):** A '2' shape and an '8' shape are placed on a 15x9 grid.
* **Input 1 (Digit 8):** A larger '2' shape and a smaller '8' shape are placed on a 10x10 grid.
* **Input 2 (Digit 0):**  An '8' shape and a larger '2' shape are placed on a 12x10 grid.

The placement and size of the shapes vary depending on the input digit.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using different DSL function combinations:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = color(first(objects(I, T, T, T)))  # Extract the digit, allow diagonals
  if digit == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (15, 9))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (3, 2)), (8, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (3, 3)), (9, 5))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (1, 2)), (10, 4))))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (4, 2)), (3, 4))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 2)), (4, 5))))
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (1, 2)), (1, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (5, 2)), (3, 3))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Digit:** Extracts the unique digit from the input grid. This is done by allowing diagonal connections in `objects` function call.
2. **Conditional Pattern Generation:** Based on the extracted digit, constructs the output grid and paints the specific '2' and '8' shapes using `canvas`, `recolor`, and `shift`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = index(I, (0,0))  # Extract the digit directly
  if digit == 0:
    O = fill(fill(fill(canvas(0, (15, 9)), 2, {(i, j) for i in range(8, 11) for j in range(1, 3)}), 
                  2, {(i, j) for i in range(9, 12) for j in range(5, 8)}), 
              8, {(10, j) for j in range(4, 6)})
  elif digit == 8:
    O = fill(fill(canvas(0, (10, 10)), 2, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 7) for j in range(4, 6)}),
              8, {(i, j) for i in range(4, 6) for j in range(5, 7)})
  else:
    O = fill(fill(canvas(0, (12, 10)), 8, {(i, j) for i in range(1, 3) for j in range(3, 5)}),
             2, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 8) for j in range(3, 5)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Digit Extraction:** Uses `index` to directly access and store the digit at location (0, 0) of the input grid.
2. **Fill Based Pattern:** Employs nested `fill` functions to draw the '2' and '8' patterns directly on the canvas based on the extracted digit. 


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = color(first(objects(I, T, F, T)))  # Extract the digit
  if digit == 0:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (15, 9)), recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (3, 5)), (8, 1))))
    O = fill(O, 8, {(10, j) for j in range(4, 6)})
  elif digit == 8:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (4, 4)), (3, 4))))
    O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j) for i in range(4, 6) for j in range(5, 7)})
  else:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (12, 10)), recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (5, 2)), (3, 3))))
    O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j) for i in range(1, 3) for j in range(3, 5)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Digit Extraction:** Extracts the unique digit from the input.
2. **Combined Painting and Filling:** Uses a combination of `paint` and `fill` to draw the '2' and '8' patterns. `paint` is used for the '2' shapes with shifting, while `fill` is used for simpler '8' shapes. 


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  c = color(first(objects(I, T, T, T)))  # Extract the digit, allow diagonals
  if c == 0:
    O = paint(paint(canvas(0, (15, 9)), recolor(2, {(i, j) for i in range(8, 11) for j in range(1, 3)})), 
              recolor(2, {(i, j) for i in range(9, 12) for j in range(5, 8)}))
    O = fill(O, 8, {(10, j) for j in range(4, 6)})
  elif c == 8:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(2, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 7) for j in range(4, 6)}))
    O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j) for i in range(4, 6) for j in range(5, 7)})
  else:
    O = paint(paint(canvas(0, (12, 10)), recolor(8, {(i, j) for i in range(1, 3) for j in range(3, 5)})),
             recolor(2, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 8) for j in range(3, 5)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Digit Extraction (with Diagonals):** Extracts the digit, allowing for diagonal connections in objects.
2. **Nested Painting and Filling:** Uses nested `paint` calls to draw the more complex shapes, then utilizes `fill` for the simpler shapes.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  val = index(I, (0, 0))  # Directly access the digit
  if val == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (15, 9))
    for i in range(3):
      for j in range(2):
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(8 + i, 1 + j)}))
    for i in range(3):
      for j in range(3):
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(9 + i, 5 + j)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(10, 4), (10, 5)}))
  elif val == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    for i in range(4):
      for j in range(2):
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(3 + i, 4 + j)}))
    for i in range(2):
      for j in range(2):
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(4 + i, 5 + j)}))
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    for i in range(2):
      for j in range(2):
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(1 + i, 3 + j)}))
    for i in range(5):
      for j in range(2):
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(3 + i, 3 + j)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Digit Access:** Uses `index` to directly get the digit from the input grid at (0, 0).
2. **Iterative Painting:** Employs iterative `paint` calls within nested loops to meticulously draw each cell of the '2' and '8' patterns on the output grid. 

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation, using various DSL function combinations and logic. Each version should successfully generate the correct output grids for the given input grids, driving the similarity distance score to 0.
