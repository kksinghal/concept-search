## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be identifying the digit in the input grid and then creating a new output grid with a fixed size, where the digit from the input grid is placed at specific locations along with some additional shapes. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input 0 - Output 0:**

* Input: Single cell with digit '0'.
* Output: A 15x9 grid with:
    * The digit '0' from the input is placed at the bottom center (row 10, column 7).
    * Two 3x2 rectangles made of '2's are placed above the '0', slightly offset from each other.
    * The rest of the grid is filled with '0's. 

**Input 1 - Output 1:**

* Input: Single cell with digit '8'.
* Output: A 10x10 grid with:
    * The digit '8' from the input is placed in the middle (row 5, column 7).
    * A 4x2 rectangle of '2's is placed above the '8', centered.
    * A 2x2 square of '8's is placed within the rectangle of '2's. 
    * The rest of the grid is filled with '0's.

**Input 2 - Output 2:**

* Input: Single cell with digit '0'.
* Output: A 12x10 grid with:
    * The digit '0' from the input is placed near the top (row 1, column 5).
    * A 2x2 square of '8's is placed below the '0', slightly to the left.
    * A 3x3 square of '2's is placed below the square of '8's, centered.
    * A 3x2 rectangle of '2's is placed at the bottom of the square of '2's, slightly offset to the right.
    * The rest of the grid is filled with '0's.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  digit = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  value = color(digit)

  if value == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (15, 9))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(crop(O, (8, 1), (3, 2)), (0, 0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(crop(O, (9, 5), (3, 3)), (0, 0))))
  elif value == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(crop(O, (3, 4), (4, 2)), (0, 0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(crop(O, (4, 5), (2, 2)), (0, 0))))
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(crop(O, (1, 3), (2, 2)), (0, 0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(crop(O, (3, 3), (3, 3)), (0, 0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(crop(O, (4, 5), (3, 2)), (0, 0))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses the `crop` function to create rectangular shapes directly on the canvas at specific locations and then recolors them with the desired values.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  digit = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  value = color(digit)

  if value == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (15, 9))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, j) for i in range(8, 11) for j in range(1, 4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, j) for i in range(9, 12) for j in range(5, 8)}))
  elif value == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 7) for j in range(4, 6)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, j) for i in range(4, 6) for j in range(5, 7)}))
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, j) for i in range(1, 3) for j in range(3, 5)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 6) for j in range(3, 5)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, j) for i in range(4, 7) for j in range(5, 8)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly defines the indices of the cells that need to be painted with specific colors using set comprehensions.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  d = color(first(objects(I, T, F, T)))
  
  if d == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (15, 9))
    for i in range(3):
      for j in range(2):
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(8+i, 1+j)}))
    for i in range(3):
      for j in range(3):
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(9+i, 5+j)}))
  elif d == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    for i in range(4):
      for j in range(2):
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(3+i, 4+j)}))
    for i in range(2):
      for j in range(2):
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(4+i, 5+j)}))
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    for i in range(2):
      for j in range(2):
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(1+i, 3+j)}))
    for i in range(3):
      for j in range(2):
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(3+i, 3+j)}))
    for i in range(3):
      for j in range(3):
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(4+i, 5+j)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested loops to iterate through the desired cell indices and paint them with specific colors.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  digit = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  value = color(digit)

  if value == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (15, 9))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (3, 2)), (8, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (3, 3)), (9, 5))))
  elif value == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (4, 2)), (3, 4))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 2)), (4, 5))))
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 2)), (1, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (3, 2)), (3, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (3, 3)), (4, 5))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the `canvas` function to create separate grids of desired sizes and colors, then shifts and paints them onto the main canvas.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  digit = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  val = color(digit)

  if val == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (15, 9))
    O = fill(O, 2, product(interval(8, 11, 1), interval(1, 3, 1)))
    O = fill(O, 2, product(interval(9, 12, 1), interval(5, 8, 1)))
  elif val == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = fill(O, 2, product(interval(3, 7, 1), interval(4, 6, 1)))
    O = fill(O, 8, product(interval(4, 6, 1), interval(5, 7, 1)))
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    O = fill(O, 8, product(interval(1, 3, 1), interval(3, 5, 1)))
    O = fill(O, 2, product(interval(3, 6, 1), interval(3, 5, 1)))
    O = fill(O, 2, product(interval(4, 7, 1), interval(5, 8, 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages the `product` function to generate sets of indices representing rectangular regions and then uses `fill` to paint these regions with the required colors.

These five versions of the program showcase a variety of approaches and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating flexibility and creativity in code generation. Each version aims for clear logic and concise code, focusing on efficiently achieving the desired output for each input scenario.
