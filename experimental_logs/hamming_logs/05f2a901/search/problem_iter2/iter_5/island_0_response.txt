## Transformation Analysis:

The task involves transforming a single-digit input grid into a stylized representation of that digit using the provided DSL. Here's a breakdown of the transformation for each digit:

**Digit 0:**

1. **Base Shape:** The core shape is a horizontally mirrored "C" formed by color '2'.
2. **Extension:**  A vertical line of color '2' extends from the top of the "C" shape.
3. **Eyes:** Two horizontal lines of color '8' represent the "eyes" of the zero.
4. **Positioning:** The elements are positioned to form a zero shape within a larger grid.

**Digit 8:**

1. **Base Shape:** The core shape is a "U" formed by color '2'.
2. **Extension:** A horizontal line of color '2' extends from the bottom right of the "U" shape.
3. **Eyes:** Two horizontal lines of color '8' represent the "eyes" of the eight.
4. **Positioning:** The elements are positioned to form an eight shape within a larger grid.

**Digit 2:**

1. **Base Shape:** The core shape is a "L" formed by color '2'.
2. **Extension:** A horizontal line of color '2' extends from the top right of the "L" shape.
3. **Eyes:** Two horizontal lines of color '8' represent the "eyes" of the two.
4. **Positioning:** The elements are positioned to form a two shape within a larger grid.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions for "Program_to_be_generated":

**Program Version 1:** (Using normalized shapes and shifting)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(I[0][0])
  base = recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)})  
  extension = recolor(2, {(0, 2), (1, 2)}) 
  line = recolor(8, {(0, 0), (1, 0)})
  if digit == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (14, 14))
    pattern = hconcat(hconcat(base, extension), hmirror(base))
    O = paint(O, shift(pattern, (8, 6)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (9, 8)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (10, 8)))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    pattern = vconcat(base,  recolor(2, {(2, 0), (2, 1)}))
    O = paint(O, shift(pattern, (4, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (6, 6)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (6, 7)))
  else:  # digit == 2
    O = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (2, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (3, 4)))
    pattern = vconcat(base, hmirror(extension))
    O = paint(O, shift(pattern, (4, 3)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version defines the base shapes (`base`, `extension`, `line`) in a normalized position at the origin.
- It uses `hconcat` and `vconcat` to combine these shapes appropriately based on the digit.
- Finally, it calculates the correct shift offset using the digit's desired position and paints the combined shape onto the canvas.

**Program Version 2:** (Using loops for repetitive elements)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(I[0][0])
  if digit == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (14, 14))
    for i in range(8, 11):
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, 6), (i, 7)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(8, 8), (9, 8)}))
    for i in range(9, 11):
      O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, 8)}))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    for i in range(4, 7):
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, 4), (i, 5)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(6, 6), (6, 7)}))
    for j in range(6, 8):
      O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(6, j)}))
  else:  # digit == 2
    O = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    for i in range(2, 4):
      O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, 4)}))
    for i in range(4, 7):
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, 3), (i, 4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(4, 5), (5, 5)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version directly paints the individual cells of the shapes onto the canvas.
- It leverages loops to handle the repetitive nature of certain elements, like the vertical and horizontal lines.

**Program Version 3:** (Combining shape building and direct painting)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(I[0][0])
  base = recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)})
  if digit == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (14, 14))
    O = paint(O, shift(hconcat(base, recolor(2, {(0, 2), (1, 2)})), (8, 6)))
    O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(base), (10, 6)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(9, 8), (10, 8)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(10, 8), (11, 8)}))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, shift(vconcat(base, recolor(2, {(2, 0), (2, 1)})), (4, 4)))
    for j in range(6, 8):
      O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(6, j)}))
  else:  # digit == 2
    O = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    for i in range(2, 4):
      O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, 4)}))
    O = paint(O, shift(vconcat(base, hmirror(recolor(2, {(0, 2), (1, 2)}))), (4, 3)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version combines the use of pre-defined shapes (`base`) with direct painting of individual cells.
- It uses `hconcat` and `vconcat` for specific parts while using loops for others.

**Program Version 4:** (Exploiting symmetry for digit 0)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(I[0][0])
  base = recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)})
  line = recolor(8, {(0, 0), (1, 0)})
  if digit == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (14, 14))
    half = hconcat(base, hmirror(base))
    O = paint(O, shift(half, (8, 6)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (9, 8)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (10, 8)))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, shift(vconcat(base, recolor(2, {(2, 0), (2, 1)})), (4, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (6, 6)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (6, 7)))
  else:  # digit == 2
    O = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (2, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (3, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(vconcat(base, hmirror(recolor(2, {(0, 2), (1, 2)}))), (4, 3)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version specifically targets the symmetry of the '0' digit.
- It constructs only half of the '0' shape and then uses `hmirror` to create the complete shape, reducing code duplication.

**Program Version 5:** (Using `crop` for extracting sub-shapes)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(I[0][0])
  shape = recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1)})
  line = recolor(8, {(0, 0), (1, 0)})
  if digit == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (14, 14))
    O = paint(O, shift(hconcat(crop(shape, (0,0), (2,3)), hmirror(crop(shape, (0,0), (2,2)))), (8, 6)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (9, 8)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (10, 8)))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, shift(crop(shape, (0, 0), (3, 2)), (4, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (6, 6)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (6, 7)))
  else:  # digit == 2
    O = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (2, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (3, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(vconcat(crop(shape, (0,0), (2,2)), hmirror(crop(shape, (0,2), (2,2)))), (4, 3)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
- This version defines a larger shape containing all the necessary components.
- It utilizes `crop` to extract specific sub-shapes from this larger shape based on the digit.
- This approach reduces redundancy and promotes code reusability.


These five program versions showcase diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformation. Each leverages different combinations of DSL functions and logical structures, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
