## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single-cell input grid containing either the digit '0', '8', or any other digit, and generates an output grid depicting a stylized version of the input digit.  The stylized digits consist of blocks of '2's and '8's on a background of '0's.  Here's a breakdown for each digit:

**Digit 0:**

- Output grid size: 15x9
- A horizontal line of three '2's is placed near the bottom.
- Another horizontal line of three '2's is placed above, shifted two positions to the right.
- Two vertical lines of two '8's are placed to the right, forming an incomplete oval shape with the '2's.

**Digit 8:**

- Output grid size: 10x10
- A square of four '2's is placed slightly off-center.
- A smaller square of four '8's is placed to the right and slightly below, overlapping the '2's square.

**Other Digits:**

- Output grid size: 12x10
- Two vertical lines of two '8's are placed near the top left corner.
- A horizontal line of five '2's is placed below and to the right, forming a '7' shape.


## Program Version 1: (Object-Oriented Approach)

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = index(I, (0, 0))
  if digit == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (15, 9))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (1, 3)), (8, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (1, 3)), (9, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 1)), (10, 4))))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (2, 2)), (3, 4))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 2)), (4, 5))))
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 1)), (1, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (1, 5)), (3, 3))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version focuses on creating and positioning individual components of each digit as separate objects.
- `canvas(0, ...)` creates the base grid filled with '0's.
- `canvas(2, ...)` and `canvas(8, ...)` create the building blocks for each digit.
- `shift(...)` moves the building blocks to their correct positions.
- `recolor(...)` sets the desired color ('2' or '8') for each building block.
- `paint(...)` draws the building blocks onto the base grid.


## Program Version 2: (Line-Based Approach)

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = index(I, (0, 0))
  if digit == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (15, 9))
    O = fill(O, 2, connect((8, 1), (8, 3)))
    O = fill(O, 2, connect((9, 3), (9, 5)))
    O = fill(O, 8, connect((10, 4), (11, 4)))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = fill(O, 2, box(shift(canvas(0, (2, 2)), (3, 4))))
    O = fill(O, 8, box(shift(canvas(0, (2, 2)), (4, 5))))
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    O = fill(O, 8, connect((1, 3), (2, 3)))
    O = fill(O, 2, connect((3, 3), (7, 3)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version leverages the `connect(...)` function to draw lines, simplifying the code for horizontal and vertical components.
- `connect(...)` creates a set of indices representing a line between two points.
- `fill(...)` then paints the specified color at those indices.
- For the '8' digit, `box(...)` is used to draw the outline of squares.


## Program Version 3: (Mirroring and Combining)

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = index(I, (0, 0))
  if digit == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (15, 9))
    base = shift(canvas(2, (1, 3)), (8, 1))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, base))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(base, (1, 2))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, hmirror(shift(canvas(8, (2, 1)), (10, 4)))))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    square2 = shift(canvas(2, (2, 2)), (3, 4))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, square2))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(square2, (1, 1))))
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    vline = shift(canvas(8, (2, 1)), (1, 3))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, vline))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (1, 5)), (3, 3))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version aims to reduce redundancy by reusing and mirroring components.
- For the '0' digit, the first horizontal line is created and then shifted to form the second.
- The vertical lines for the '0' are created by mirroring a single line.
- For the '8' digit, the same square shape is reused for both '2's and '8's with slight shifts.

## Program Version 4: (Grid Manipulation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = index(I, (0, 0))
  if digit == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (15, 9))
    O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j) for i in range(8, 11) for j in range(1, 4)})
    O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j) for i in range(9, 12) for j in range(3, 6)})
    O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j) for i in range(10, 12) for j in range(4, 5)})
  elif digit == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(4, 6)})
    O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j) for i in range(4, 6) for j in range(5, 7)})
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j) for i in range(1, 3) for j in range(3, 5)})
    O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 8) for j in range(3, 5)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
- This version focuses on directly manipulating the grid coordinates to fill in the digit shapes.
- It utilizes set comprehensions to define rectangular regions within the grid.
- The `fill(...)` function then applies the specified color to all cells within these regions.
- This approach reduces the reliance on shifting and other spatial operations, making the code more concise.

## Program Version 5: (Functional Approach)

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = index(I, (0, 0))

  def draw_zero(O):
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (1, 3)), (8, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (1, 3)), (9, 3))))
    return paint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 1)), (10, 4))))

  def draw_eight(O):
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (2, 2)), (3, 4))))
    return paint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 2)), (4, 5))))

  def draw_other(O):
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 1)), (1, 3))))
    return paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (1, 5)), (3, 3))))

  return {0: draw_zero, 8: draw_eight}.get(digit, draw_other)(canvas(0, (15, 9) if digit == 0 else (10, 10) if digit == 8 else (12, 10)))
```
**Explanation:**

- This version takes a more functional approach, defining separate functions to draw each digit.
- It utilizes a dictionary to map the input digit to the corresponding drawing function.
- The `get(...)` method is used to retrieve the appropriate function based on the input.
- This approach promotes code reusability and modularity, making it easier to modify or extend the program for handling additional digits.
