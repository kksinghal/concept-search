## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single digit as input and places objects representing that digit and an "L" shape in a 14x10 grid (rotated to 10x14 in the output). The objects are placed at the bottom of the grid and stacked on top of each other. The "8" digit is represented by two horizontally adjacent squares, while other digits are represented by a single square.

**Here's a breakdown of the placement logic:**

* **Digit "0"**: 
    * An "L" shape is placed at the bottom of the grid.
    * No square is placed for the digit "0".
* **Digit "8"**:
    * An "L" shape is placed at the bottom of the grid. 
    * Two horizontally adjacent squares are placed on top of the "L" shape, representing the digit "8".
* **Digit "2"**:
    * An "L" shape is placed at the bottom of the grid.
    * A single square is placed on top of the "L" shape, representing the digit "2".

## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10)) 
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, box({(10, 1)}))) # Place the fixed "8"

  L_shape = combine(connect((8, 1), (10, 1)), connect((9, 1), (9, 2))) # Define the "L" shape

  if d == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, L_shape))  
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, L_shape))
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (8, 2)))))  # Place the first "8" square
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (9, 2)))))  # Place the second "8" square
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, L_shape))
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (9, 2)))))  # Place the digit square

  return rot90(O) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create a blank canvas `O` and place the fixed "8" at (10,1).
2. **Define L Shape:** Define the "L" shape using `connect` and `combine`.
3. **Conditional Placement:**
   * **Digit 0:** Only the "L" shape is placed.
   * **Digit 8:** The "L" shape is placed, followed by two squares representing "8".
   * **Other Digits:** The "L" shape is placed, followed by a single square representing the digit.
4. **Rotation:** Rotate the grid by 90 degrees.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, box({(10, 1)}))) 

  shape_locations = {
    0: (None, (8, 1)), # (Digit square location, L shape location)
    8: ((8, 2), (8, 1)),
    2: ((9, 2), (8, 1))
  }

  digit_loc, L_loc = shape_locations[d]

  O = paint(O, recolor(2, combine(connect((L_loc[0], L_loc[1]), (L_loc[0]+2, L_loc[1])), connect((L_loc[0]+1, L_loc[1]), (L_loc[0]+1, L_loc[1]+1)))))
  if digit_loc:
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, digit_loc))))
    if d == 8:
      O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (digit_loc[0] + 1, digit_loc[1])))))

  return rot90(O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Shape Locations Dictionary:** Store the locations of the digit square and "L" shape in a dictionary.
3. **Retrieve Locations:** Retrieve the locations based on the input digit.
4. **Place L Shape:** Place the "L" shape based on its retrieved location.
5. **Conditional Digit Placement:** 
   * If `digit_loc` is not None, place the digit square.
   * If the digit is "8", place the second "8" square.
6. **Rotation:** Rotate the grid by 90 degrees.

**Program Version 3 (Using `objects` and `shift`):**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, box({(10, 1)})))

  L_shape = objects(paint(canvas(0,(3,2)), recolor(1, {(1,0), (2,0), (1,1)})), T, F, T).pop()

  if d == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(L_shape, (7,1)))) 
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(L_shape, (7,1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (8, 2))))) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (9, 2))))) 
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(L_shape, (7,1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (9, 2))))) 

  return rot90(O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Construct and Extract L Shape:** 
    * Create a temporary 3x2 canvas and paint the "L" shape on it.
    * Use `objects` to extract the "L" shape as an object. 
3. **Conditional Placement:** Similar to previous versions, but uses `shift` to position the extracted "L" shape.
4. **Rotation:** Rotate the grid by 90 degrees.

**Program Version 4 (Using loops and offsets):**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, box({(10, 1)})))

  for i in range(8, 11): 
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, 1)})) # Draw the horizontal part of the "L"
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(9, 2)})) # Draw the vertical part of the "L"

  if d == 8:
    for i in range(8, 10):
      O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (i, 2)))))  # Place the two "8" squares
  elif d != 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (9, 2)))))  # Place the digit square

  return rot90(O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Draw L Shape:** Draw the "L" shape directly on the canvas using loops and offsets.
3. **Conditional Digit Placement:**
   * If the digit is "8", place the two squares representing "8" using a loop.
   * If the digit is not "0", place a single square representing the digit.
4. **Rotation:** Rotate the grid by 90 degrees.

**Program Version 5 (Functional Approach with `apply`):**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, box({(10, 1)})))

  L_shape_indices = [(i, 1) for i in range(8, 11)] + [(9, 2)]  # Define indices for the "L" shape
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, frozenset(L_shape_indices))) # Paint the "L" shape

  if d == 8:
    digit_indices = [(i, 2) for i in range(8, 10)]  # Indices for two "8" squares
  elif d != 0:
    digit_indices = [(9, 2)]  # Index for the digit square
  else:
    digit_indices = []

  O = paint(O, recolor(d, frozenset(apply(lambda x: (x[0], x[1]), digit_indices)))) # Paint the digit

  return rot90(O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Define Shape Indices:** Define the indices of the "L" shape and digit squares.
3. **Paint Shapes:** 
    * Use `apply` to convert the indices into a format suitable for `paint`.
    * Paint the "L" shape and digit squares based on the calculated indices.
4. **Rotation:** Rotate the grid by 90 degrees.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the desired transformation. They showcase the versatility of the DSL and provide diverse solutions to the problem.
