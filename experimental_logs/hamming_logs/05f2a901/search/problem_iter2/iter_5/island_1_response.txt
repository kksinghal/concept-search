## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single-cell input grid containing either a '0' or an '8' and creates an output grid featuring two distinct shapes: an 'L' shape and a square.  The position and color of these shapes depend on the input digit.

**Input 0:**

* An 'L' shape formed by the digit '2' is placed at the bottom left of the grid.
* A square formed by the digit '8' is placed above the 'L' shape, slightly offset to the right.

**Input 8:**

* An 'L' shape formed by the digit '2' is placed at the top right of the grid.
* A square formed by the digit '8' is placed to the left of the 'L' shape, slightly below.

**Input 2:**

* A square formed by the digit '2' is placed slightly below and to the right of the center of the grid.
* An 'L' shape formed by the digit '8' is placed above the square. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:** (Direct Placement)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = index(I, ORIGIN)  
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10)) 
  if d == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(8, 9), (9, 9), (10, 9), (10, 8)})) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(10, 11), (10, 12), (11, 11), (11, 12)})) 
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)})) 
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5)})) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 2), (6, 3)})) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly defines the coordinates of each cell in the 'L' shape and the square based on the input digit.  It then uses `recolor` to assign the correct color and `paint` to place the shapes on the canvas. 

**Version 2:** (Shape Functions)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = index(I, ORIGIN)
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))

  def L_shape(pos, color):
    i, j = pos
    return recolor(color, {(i, j), (i + 1, j), (i + 2, j), (i + 2, j + 1)})

  def square_shape(pos, color):
    i, j = pos
    return recolor(color, {(i, j), (i, j + 1), (i + 1, j), (i + 1, j + 1)})

  if d == 0:
    O = paint(O, L_shape((8, 9), 2))
    O = paint(O, square_shape((10, 11), 8))
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(O, L_shape((1, 1), 2))
    O = paint(O, square_shape((3, 3), 8))
  else:
    O = paint(O, L_shape((5, 4), 2))
    O = paint(O, square_shape((5, 2), 8))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines separate functions `L_shape` and `square_shape` to create the respective shapes at a given position and with a given color.  This approach improves code readability and modularity.

**Version 3:** (Shifting)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = index(I, ORIGIN)
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  L = recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)})
  S = recolor(8, {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)})
  if d == 0:
    O = paint(O, shift(L, (8, 9)))
    O = paint(O, shift(S, (10, 11)))
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(O, shift(L, (1, 1)))
    O = paint(O, shift(S, (3, 3)))
  else:
    O = paint(O, shift(L, (5, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(S, (5, 2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines the shapes at the origin and then uses `shift` to move them to their correct positions based on the input digit. This reduces code duplication compared to directly specifying coordinates.

**Version 4:** (Conditional Shifting)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = index(I, ORIGIN)
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  L = recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)})
  S = recolor(8, {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)})
  O = paint(O, shift(L, (8 if d == 0 else 1 if d == 8 else 5, 9 if d == 0 else 1 if d == 8 else 4)))
  O = paint(O, shift(S, (10 if d == 0 else 3 if d == 8 else 5, 11 if d == 0 else 3 if d == 8 else 2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version further condenses the code by using conditional statements within the `shift` function to determine the appropriate offsets based on the input digit.

**Version 5:** (Data-Driven Approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = index(I, ORIGIN)
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  shapes = {
    0: ((recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)}), (8, 9)), (recolor(8, {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)}), (10, 11))),
    8: ((recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)}), (1, 1)), (recolor(8, {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)}), (3, 3))),
    2: ((recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)}), (5, 4)), (recolor(8, {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)}), (5, 2)))
  }
  for shape, pos in shapes[d]:
    O = paint(O, shift(shape, pos))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version adopts a data-driven approach, storing the shape definitions and their respective positions in a dictionary keyed by the input digit. This separates the transformation logic from the data, improving flexibility and maintainability.
