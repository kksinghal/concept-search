## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single digit as input and generates a stylized representation of that digit on a 14x10 grid. The style resembles a digital display with segments formed by blocks of color '2' and '8'.

**Input 0:**
- A '0' shape is formed using blocks of color '2'.
- Two horizontal lines of color '8' are placed inside the '0'.

**Input 8:**
- An '8' shape is formed using blocks of color '2'.
- Two horizontal lines of color '8' are placed inside the '8'.

**Input 2:**
- A '2' shape is formed using blocks of color '2'.
- Two horizontal lines of color '8' are placed at the top of the grid, mirroring the top segment of the '2'.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  base = recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)})
  extension = recolor(2, {(0, 2), (1, 2)})
  line = recolor(8, {(0, 0), (1, 0)})
  if digit == 0:
    pattern = hconcat(hconcat(base, extension), hmirror(base))
    O = paint(O, shift(pattern, (8, 2)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (9, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (10, 4)))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = paint(O, shift(vconcat(base, recolor(2, {(2, 0), (2, 1)})), (4, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (6, 5)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (6, 6)))
  else:  # digit == 2
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (2, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (3, 4)))
    pattern = vconcat(base, hmirror(extension))
    O = paint(O, shift(pattern, (4, 3)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version defines basic shapes like `base`, `extension`, and `line`.
- It then uses conditional statements to construct the digit shapes by combining these basic shapes using `hconcat`, `vconcat`, and `hmirror`. 
- Finally, it positions the shapes on the canvas using `shift` and paints them using `paint`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  segments = {
    0: {(8, 2), (9, 2), (10, 2), (8, 3), (10, 3), (8, 4), (9, 4), (10, 4), (8, 5), (10, 5), (8, 6), (9, 6), (10, 6)},
    2: {(2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (4, 4), (6, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (4, 6), (6, 6)},
    8: {(4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (4, 4), (6, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (4, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (6, 7), (5, 7)}
  }
  lines = {
    0: {(9, 4), (10, 4)},
    8: {(6, 5), (6, 6)},
    2: {(2, 4), (3, 4)}
  }
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, segments[digit]))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, lines[digit]))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version directly defines the indices of segments for each digit and the lines within them. 
- It then uses these predefined sets of indices to paint the segments and lines on the canvas using `recolor` and `paint`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  base = recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)})
  if digit == 0:
    O = paint(O, shift(hconcat(hconcat(base, recolor(2, {(0, 2), (1, 2)})), hmirror(base)), (8, 2)))
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(8, {(0, 0), (1, 0)}), (9, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(8, {(0, 0), (1, 0)}), (10, 4)))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = paint(O, shift(vconcat(base, recolor(2, {(2, 0), (2, 1)})), (4, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(8, {(0, 0), (1, 0)}), (6, 5)))
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(8, {(0, 0), (1, 0)}), (6, 6)))
  else:  # digit == 2
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(8, {(0, 0), (1, 0)}), (2, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(8, {(0, 0), (1, 0)}), (3, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(vconcat(base, hmirror(recolor(2, {(0, 2), (1, 2)}))), (4, 3)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version defines a `base` shape and builds upon it using inline shape construction with `recolor`. 
- It then utilizes `hconcat`, `vconcat`, and `hmirror` to create digit shapes and positions them using `shift` and `paint`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  for i, r in enumerate(((8, 2, 2, 2, 0), (2, 2, 0, 2, 0), (0, 0, 0, 8, 8), (0, 0, 0, 8, 8), (0, 0, 0, 0, 0)) if d == 0 else
                    ((0, 0, 2, 2, 0), (0, 0, 2, 2, 0), (0, 2, 2, 2, 0), (0, 0, 2, 2, 8), (0, 0, 0, 8, 8)) if d == 8 else
                    ((0, 0, 8, 8, 0), (0, 0, 8, 8, 0), (0, 0, 2, 2, 2), (0, 2, 2, 2, 2), (0, 0, 2, 2, 0))):
    for j, v in enumerate(r):
      if v:
        O = paint(O, recolor(v, {(i + (8 if d == 0 else 4 if d == 8 else 2), j + 2)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version represents digit shapes using nested tuples, where each tuple corresponds to a row and values represent colors. 
- It then iterates through these tuples and paints the corresponding cells on the canvas using `recolor` and `paint`.
- The offset for positioning each digit is dynamically calculated based on the input digit.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  shapes = {
      0: lambda x, y: {(x + i, y + j) for i in range(5) for j in range(4) if (i, j) not in [(1, 0), (1, 3), (3, 0), (3, 3)]},
      8: lambda x, y: {(x + i, y + j) for i in range(3) for j in range(5) if (i, j) not in [(0, 1), (2, 1)]},
      2: lambda x, y: {(x + i, y + j) for i in range(5) for j in range(4) if (i, j) in [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)]}
  }
  lines = {
      0: lambda x, y: {(x + i, y) for i in range(2)},
      8: lambda x, y: {(x, y + i) for i in range(2)},
      2: lambda x, y: {(x + i, y) for i in range(2)}
  }
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shapes[digit](8 if digit == 0 else 4 if digit == 8 else 2, 2)))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, lines[digit](9 if digit == 0 else 6, 4 if digit == 0 else 5 if digit == 8 else 4)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version utilizes lambda functions to define shapes and lines for each digit dynamically. 
- It stores these lambda functions in dictionaries and uses the input digit as a key to access the appropriate function.
- This approach offers a more concise way to represent and position the shapes using `recolor` and `paint`.

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieving the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic, demonstrating the flexibility of the provided DSL.
