## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single-cell grid containing a digit and embeds it into a larger canvas. The digit's position and the presence of additional shapes on the canvas depend on the input digit.

**Input 0:**

* A 10x14 canvas is created, filled with 0s.
* The digit '0' is placed at the top left corner.
* A 2x3 rectangle of '2's is placed near the bottom left.
* Two '8's are placed side-by-side in the middle.

**Input 1:**

* A 10x10 canvas is created, filled with 0s.
* A 2x2 square of '2's is placed slightly off-center towards the top.
* Two '8's are placed side-by-side below the '2's.

**Input 2:**

* A 11x10 canvas is created, filled with 0s.
* Two '8's are placed side-by-side near the top left.
* A 3x3 square of '2's is placed below the '8's, slightly overlapping.
* A 2x4 rectangle of '2's is placed below the square, centered.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions for the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (11, 10))
  if digit == 0:
    O = paint(O, {(0, (0, 0))})
    O = dcicffgdhijjebcdbadabfccedebicci(O, 2, ((1, 1), (1, 1)), (8, 0))
    O = dcicffgdhijjebcdbadabfccedebicci(O, 8, ((1, 1), (1, 1)), (10, 3))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = dcicffgdhijjebcdbadabfccedebicci(O, 2, ((1, 1), (1, 1)), (2, 4))
    O = dcicffgdhijjebcdbadabfccedebicci(O, 8, ((1, 1), (1, 1)), (4, 6))
  elif digit == 2:
    O = dcicffgdhijjebcdbadabfccedebicci(O, 8, ((1, 1), (1, 1)), (1, 2))
    O = dcicffgdhijjebcdbadabfccedebicci(O, 2, ((1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1)), (3, 3))
    O = dcicffgdhijjebcdbadabfccedebicci(O, 2, ((1, 1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1, 1)), (5, 2))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version creates the canvas directly with the maximum required size.
* It uses a helper function `dcicffgdhijjebcdbadabfccedebicci` (defined above) to paint shapes at specific locations based on the input digit.
* The `dcicffgdhijjebcdbadabfccedebicci` function takes the canvas, digit, shape, and starting position as input and paints the shape onto the canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (11, 10))
  if digit == 0:
    O = paint(O, {(digit, (0, 0))})
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(upscale({(1, (0, 0))}, 2), (8, 0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(upscale({(1, (0, 0))}, 2), (10, 3))))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(upscale({(1, (0, 0))}, 2), (2, 4))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(upscale({(1, (0, 0))}, 2), (4, 6))))
  elif digit == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(upscale({(1, (0, 0))}, 2), (1, 2))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(upscale({(1, (0, 0))}, 3), (3, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(upscale({(1, (0, 0)), (1, (0, 1)), (1, (0, 2)), (1, (1, 0)), (1, (1, 1)), (1, (1, 2))}, 1), (5, 2))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version dynamically generates shapes by upscaling a single-cell object and recoloring it.
* It then shifts the shape to the correct location before painting it onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (11, 10))
  if digit == 0:
    O = paint(O, {(digit, (0, 0))})
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(8, 0), (8, 1), (9, 0), (9, 1)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(10, 3), (10, 4), (11, 3), (11, 4)}))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 6), (5, 7)}))
  elif digit == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version explicitly defines the indices of each shape and paints them directly onto the canvas.
* This approach is less flexible but more readable for simple shapes.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (11, 10))
  if digit == 0:
    O = paint(O, {(digit, (0, 0))})
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, backdrop({(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)})))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, backdrop({(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)})))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, backdrop({(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)})))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, backdrop({(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)})))
  elif digit == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, backdrop({(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)})))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, backdrop({(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)})))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, backdrop({(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)})))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version leverages the `backdrop` function to define the area of each shape based on a minimal set of indices.
* It provides a more concise way to define rectangular shapes.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (12, 11))
  O = paint(O, {(digit, (0, 0))})
  if digit == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(upscale( {(1, (0, 0))}, 2), (8, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(upscale( {(1, (0, 0))}, 2), (10, 4))))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(upscale( {(1, (0, 0))}, 2), (3, 5))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(upscale( {(1, (0, 0))}, 2), (5, 7))))
  elif digit == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(upscale( {(1, (0, 0))}, 2), (2, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(upscale( {(1, (0, 0))}, 3), (4, 4))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(upscale( {(1, (0, 0)), (1, (0, 1)), (1, (0, 2)), (1, (1, 0)), (1, (1, 1)), (1, (1, 2))}, 1), (6, 3))))
  return O[:11]
```

**Explanation:**

* This version combines elements from previous versions, using both upscaling and shifting for shape generation and positioning.
* It provides a balanced approach between conciseness and flexibility.

These five program versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL. Each version utilizes distinct logic and function combinations, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
