## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single digit as input and generates a stylized representation of that digit on a grid. The style uses the digits "2" and "8" to draw the shapes. Let's analyze each digit:

**Digit 0:** 
- The "0" is represented by a rectangular shape formed by the digit "2" with an opening on the right side. 
- Two "8" digits form horizontal lines inside the "0," slightly shifted downwards from the center.

**Digit 8:** 
- The "8" is represented by a "2" shaped like a "7" with an additional "2" digit at the bottom forming the bottom curve.
- Two "8" digits form horizontal lines positioned to the right and slightly below the center of the shape.

**Digit 2:** 
- The "2" is represented by two horizontal lines formed by "8" digits at the top. 
- A "2" shaped like a backwards "L" forms the main body of the digit. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))  # Adjusted canvas size
  base = recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)})
  extension = recolor(2, {(0, 2), (1, 2)})
  line = recolor(8, {(0, 0), (1, 0)})
  if digit == 0:
    pattern = hconcat(hconcat(base, extension), hmirror(base))
    O = paint(O, shift(pattern, (8, 2)))  # Adjusted position
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (9, 4)))    # Adjusted position
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (10, 4)))   # Adjusted position
  elif digit == 8:
    O = paint(O, shift(vconcat(base, recolor(2, {(2, 0), (2, 1)})), (4, 3)))  # Adjusted position
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (6, 5)))    # Adjusted position
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (6, 6)))    # Adjusted position
  else:  # digit == 2
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (2, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (3, 4)))
    pattern = vconcat(base, hmirror(extension))
    O = paint(O, shift(pattern, (4, 3)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses pre-defined shapes for "base," "extension," and "line."
- It then combines and positions these shapes based on the input digit.
- Adjustments to canvas size and element positions are made to match the desired output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  if digit == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(8, 2), (9, 2), (10, 2), (8, 3), (10, 3), (8, 4), (9, 4), (10, 4), (8, 5), (10, 5)}))  # Direct cell painting
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(9, 4), (10, 4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(9, 5), (10, 5)}))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(4, 3), (5, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 3), (6, 4)}))  # Direct cell painting
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(6, 5), (7, 5)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(6, 6), (7, 6)}))
  else:  # digit == 2
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(2, 4), (3, 4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(3, 4), (4, 4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(4, 3), (5, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)}))  # Direct cell painting
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version directly paints the desired cells on the canvas based on the input digit. 
- It avoids using pre-defined shapes, making the code more concise but less readable.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  for i, r in enumerate(((8, 2, 2, 2, 0), (2, 2, 0, 2, 0), (0, 0, 0, 8, 8), (0, 0, 0, 8, 8), (0, 0, 0, 0, 0)) if d == 0 else 
                    ((0, 0, 2, 2, 0), (0, 0, 2, 2, 0), (0, 2, 2, 2, 0), (0, 0, 2, 2, 8), (0, 0, 0, 8, 8)) if d == 8 else
                    ((0, 0, 8, 8, 0), (0, 0, 8, 8, 0), (0, 0, 2, 2, 2), (0, 2, 2, 2, 2), (0, 0, 2, 2, 0))):
    for j, v in enumerate(r):
      if v:
        O = paint(O, recolor(v, {(i + (4 if d else 8), j + 2)}))  # Adjusted offsets based on digit
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version encodes the digit shapes as nested tuples, directly mapping to grid positions.
- It iterates through the chosen tuple based on the input digit and paints the corresponding cells. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  base = recolor(2, {(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)})
  line = recolor(8, {(0, 0), (1, 0)})
  if digit == 0:
    O = paint(O, shift(hconcat(base, recolor(2, {(0, 2), (1, 2)})), (8, 2))) # Inline shape construction
    O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(base), (8, 4)))                            # Inline shape construction
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (9, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (10, 4))) 
  elif digit == 8:
    O = paint(O, shift(vconcat(base, recolor(2, {(2, 0), (2, 1)})), (4, 3))) # Inline shape construction
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (6, 5)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (6, 6)))
  else:  # digit == 2
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (2, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (3, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(vconcat(base, hmirror(recolor(2, {(0, 2), (1, 2)}))), (4, 3))) # Inline shape construction
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version is similar to version 1 but constructs some shapes directly within the `paint` function calls.
- It balances readability and conciseness by using pre-defined shapes for common elements.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  p = lambda x, y: paint(O, recolor(2, {(x, y), (x + 1, y), (x, y + 1), (x + 1, y + 1)})) # Function for base shape
  l = lambda x, y: paint(O, recolor(8, {(x, y), (x + 1, y)}))                     # Function for line shape
  if d == 0:
    O = p(8, 2)
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(8, 4), (9, 4), (8, 5), (9, 5)}))  # Direct cell painting for extension
    O = l(9, 4)
    O = l(9, 5)
  elif d == 8:
    O = p(4, 3)
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(6, 3), (6, 4)}))  # Direct cell painting for bottom curve
    O = l(6, 5)
    O = l(6, 6)
  else:  # digit == 2
    O = l(2, 4)
    O = l(3, 4)
    O = p(4, 3)
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(6, 5), (6, 6)})) # Direct cell painting for extension
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version defines functions `p` and `l` for painting the base square and line shapes.
- It then uses these functions along with some direct cell painting to construct the digits.
- This approach offers good readability and flexibility for potential modifications.
