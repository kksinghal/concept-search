## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 - Output 0:**

* A fixed shape resembling an "L" made of '2's is placed in the bottom left corner.
* Two squares of '8's are positioned above the "L" shape, slightly offset to the right.

**Input 1 - Output 1:**

* The "L" shape is placed in the middle-right of the grid.
* Two squares of '8's are placed to the right of the "L" shape.
* The digit '8' from the input is used to color the squares.

**Input 2 - Output 2:**

* Two squares of '8's are placed at the top center.
* The "L" shape is placed below the squares, slightly overlapping.
* The digit from the input ('0') is not used in the output.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))

  L_shape = objects(paint(canvas(0,(3,2)), recolor(1, {(1,0), (2,0), (1,1)})), T, F, T).pop()

  if d == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(L_shape, (7,1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (9, 2))))) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (10, 2))))) 
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(L_shape, (1,2))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (4, 4))))) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (5, 4))))) 
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (2, 1))))) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (3, 1))))) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(L_shape, (3, 3))))

  return rot90(O)
```

**Explanation:**

* **L_shape:** Defines the "L" shape using the `objects` function, similar to the previous examples.
* **Conditional Logic:**  The program uses `if-elif-else` statements to handle different input digits (d).
* **Positioning:** The `shift` function is used to move the "L" shape and the squares to their correct positions based on the input digit.
* **Coloring:** The `recolor` function is used to paint the shapes with the appropriate colors.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (10, 14)) 

  L_shape = frozenset({(2, (1, 0)), (2, (2, 0)), (2, (1, 1))})

  if d == 0:
    O = paint(O, shift(L_shape, (1, 7)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (2, 9)))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (2, 10)))))
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(O, shift(L_shape, (2, 1)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (4, 4)))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (4, 5)))))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (1, 2)))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, box(shift({(0, 0)}, (1, 3)))))
    O = paint(O, shift(L_shape, (3, 3)))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Direct Shape Definition:** Instead of generating the "L" shape using `objects`, this version defines it directly as a `frozenset`.
* **Canvas Rotation:** This version creates the canvas in portrait orientation (10x14) and doesn't require `rot90`.
* **Simplified Positioning:** The positioning logic is simplified by directly shifting the shapes without using intermediate variables.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))

  L_shape = {(1, 0), (2, 0), (1, 1)}

  if d == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(recolor(2, L_shape), (7, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(box({(0, 0)}), (9, 2))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(box({(0, 0)}), (10, 2))))
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(recolor(2, L_shape), (1, 2))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, shift(box({(0, 0)}), (4, 4))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, shift(box({(0, 0)}), (5, 4))))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(box({(0, 0)}), (2, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(box({(0, 0)}), (3, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(recolor(2, L_shape), (3, 3))))

  return rot90(O)
```

**Explanation:**

* **Combined Operations:** This version combines `recolor` and `shift` operations to reduce the code length.
* **Simplified "L" Shape:** The "L" shape is defined as indices only, and recolored during the painting process.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (10, 14))
  
  if d == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(1, 8), (2, 8), (1, 9)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, box({(2, 9)})))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, box({(2, 10)})))
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(2, 1), (3, 1), (2, 2)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, box({(4, 4)})))
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, box({(4, 5)})))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, box({(1, 2)})))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, box({(1, 3)})))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(3, 4), (4, 4), (3, 5)}))
  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Directly Painted Shapes:** This version directly defines and paints the shapes without using intermediate variables or functions like `objects`.
* **Canvas Rotation:** Similar to version 2, the canvas is created in portrait orientation, eliminating the need for `rot90`.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  
  L_shape = lambda x, y: {(1 + x, 0 + y), (2 + x, 0 + y), (1 + x, 1 + y)}

  if d == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, L_shape(7, 1)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, box({(9, 2)})))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, box({(10, 2)})))
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, L_shape(1, 2)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, box({(4, 4)})))
    O = paint(O, recolor(d, box({(5, 4)})))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, box({(2, 1)})))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, box({(3, 1)})))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, L_shape(3, 3)))
  
  return rot90(O)
```

**Explanation:**

* **Lambda Function for "L":** This version defines the "L" shape as a lambda function for reusability and concise code.
* **Direct Shape Positioning:** The shapes are positioned directly within the `paint` function calls by passing coordinates to the lambda function and `box` function. 

These five program versions demonstrate distinct approaches and DSL function combinations to achieve the desired transformation. They offer a range of options, from direct shape manipulation to functional programming techniques, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL and the diverse ways to solve the task.
