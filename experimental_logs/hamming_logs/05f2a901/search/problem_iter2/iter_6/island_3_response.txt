## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to extract digits from the input and arrange them in specific patterns within a larger output grid. The positioning and arrangement of the extracted digits vary depending on the input digit's value.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The digit '0' is extracted and forms two separate horizontal lines of '2's, one above the other, near the bottom of the grid. An '8' shape is placed above the lines, slightly offset to the right.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The digit '8' is extracted and forms two vertical lines of '2's near the top center.  The '8' itself is positioned below and slightly to the right of these lines.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

*  The digit '0' is extracted and forms a horizontal line of '2's slightly below the center. An '8' shape is placed above the line, centered horizontally.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions for the transformation, using only the DSL functions:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  digit = index(I, (0, 0))
  if digit == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (15, 9))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (3, 1)), (9, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (3, 1)), (10, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 1)), (10, 4))))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (2, 1)), (1, 4))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (2, 1)), (3, 4))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 2)), (4, 5))))
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (12, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 1)), (1, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 1)), (2, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (4, 1)), (3, 3))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version leverages `canvas`, `shift`, and `paint` for object placement. 
* It directly constructs the shapes using `canvas` with appropriate dimensions and color.
* The `shift` function then positions the shapes within the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  d = index(I, (0, 0))
  if d == 0:
    O = paint(paint(paint(canvas(0, (15, 9)),
                           recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (1, 3)), (9, 1)))),
                     recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (1, 3)), (10, 3)))),
               recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 1)), (10, 4))))
  elif d == 8:
    O = paint(paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)),
                     recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (2, 2)), (3, 4)))),
               recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 2)), (4, 5))))
  else:
    O = paint(paint(canvas(0, (12, 10)),
                     recolor(8, shift(canvas(8, (2, 1)), (1, 1)))),
               recolor(2, shift(canvas(2, (1, 5)), (3, 3))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Similar to Version 1, it constructs shapes directly and uses `shift` for positioning.
* It employs nested `paint` calls to sequentially draw each shape onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  v = index(I, (0, 0))
  if v == 0:
    O = fill(fill(fill(canvas(0, (15, 9)), 2, {(i, 1) for i in range(9, 12)}),
                  2, {(i, 3) for i in range(10, 13)}),
              8, {(10, j) for j in range(4, 6)})
  elif v == 8:
    O = fill(fill(canvas(0, (10, 10)), 2, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(4, 6)}),
              8, {(i, j) for i in range(4, 6) for j in range(5, 7)})
  else:
    O = fill(fill(canvas(0, (12, 10)), 8, {(i, 1) for i in range(1, 3)}),
             2, {(i, 3) for i in range(3, 8)})
  return O

```

**Explanation:**

* This version utilizes the `fill` function to place colors at specific indices.
*  It defines the indices for each shape using set comprehension.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  val = index(I, (0, 0))
  if val == 0:
    O = paint(paint(paint(canvas(0, (15, 9)), recolor(2, {(9, 1), (10, 1), (11, 1)})),
                     recolor(2, {(10, 3), (11, 3), (12, 3)})),
               recolor(8, {(10, 4), (10, 5)}))
  elif val == 8:
    O = paint(paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(2, {(3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 4), (4, 5)})),
               recolor(8, {(4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (5, 6)}))
  else:
    O = paint(paint(canvas(0, (12, 10)), recolor(8, {(1, 1), (2, 1)})),
               recolor(2, {(3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version explicitly lists the indices for each shape within the `recolor` function.
* It uses nested `paint` calls for sequential drawing.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  n = index(I, (0, 0))
  if n == 0:
    O = paint(paint(canvas(0, (15, 9)), 
                   recolor(2, shift({(0, i) for i in range(3)}, (9, 1)))),
                   recolor(2, shift({(0, i) for i in range(3)}, (10, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift({(0, i) for i in range(2)}, (10, 4))))
  elif n == 8:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), 
                   recolor(2, shift({(i, j) for i in range(2) for j in range(2)}, (3, 4))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift({(i, j) for i in range(2) for j in range(2)}, (4, 5))))
  else:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (12, 10)), 
                   recolor(8, shift({(i, 0) for i in range(2)}, (1, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift({(0, i) for i in range(5)}, (3, 3))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version constructs base shapes at the origin and utilizes `shift` to move them into position.
* It uses set comprehension to define the base shapes.


These five program versions demonstrate a variety of approaches to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing different DSL function combinations and logic while adhering to the specified constraints.
