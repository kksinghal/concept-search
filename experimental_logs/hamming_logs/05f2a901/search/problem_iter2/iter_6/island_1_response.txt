## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be encoding the input digit into a specific spatial arrangement of '2's and '8's on a 14x10 canvas. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input 0:** 

- A single '8' is drawn at the bottom center of the canvas (rows 10-11, columns 4-5).
- An 'L' shape of '2's is drawn above the '8', also centered (rows 8-9, columns 2-4). 

**Input 8:**

- The '8' from Input 0 is moved up one row (rows 9-10, columns 4-5).
- The 'L' shape from Input 0 is expanded into a larger 'L' shape encompassing the '8' (rows 1-6, columns 4-6).

**Input 2:**

- The '8' from Input 0 remains in the same position (rows 10-11, columns 4-5).
- The 'L' shape from Input 0 is moved up by two rows (rows 6-7, columns 2-4) and expanded to encompass the '8' similar to Input 8.


## Code Generation:

It's impossible to generate code without knowing the available functions in your DSL. However, I can provide conceptual code snippets and explanations based on the observed transformations. You'll need to adapt these using the actual functions from your DSL.

**Program Version 1: Conditional Shape Placement**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  canvas = create_canvas(14, 10, fill_value=0)  # Replace with your DSL function

  if digit == 0:
    canvas = draw_L(canvas, position=(2, 2), size=3)  # Replace with DSL functions
    canvas = draw_eight(canvas, position=(0, 0), size=2) 
  elif digit == 8:
    canvas = draw_L(canvas, position=(0, 4), size=7)
    canvas = draw_eight(canvas, position=(2, 4), size=2)
  else:
    canvas = draw_L(canvas, position=(0, 2), size=7)
    canvas = draw_eight(canvas, position=(0, 0), size=2)

  return canvas

# Placeholder functions - replace with DSL equivalents
def create_canvas(height, width, fill_value):
  # ...
  return canvas

def draw_L(canvas, position, size):
  # ...
  return canvas

def draw_eight(canvas, position, size):
  # ...
  return canvas
```

**Explanation:**

- The code first identifies the input digit.
- Based on the digit, it draws pre-defined shapes ('L' and '8') at specific locations and sizes on the canvas. 

**Program Versions 2-5:**

To create distinct versions, we can explore different approaches:

- **Version 2: Grid Manipulation:** Instead of drawing shapes directly, manipulate the grid by setting specific cells to '2' or '8' based on the input digit. 
- **Version 3: Transformations:** Define base shapes for '2' and '8' and apply transformations (translation, scaling) based on the input digit.
- **Version 4: Mathematical Encoding:**  Develop a mathematical formula that encodes the input digit into the positions of '2's and '8's. 
- **Version 5: Recursive Approach:** Define a recursive function that draws increasingly complex patterns based on the input digit. 


Remember, you'll need to translate these concepts into your DSL and ensure that each version produces the exact output grids specified.
