## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves mirroring objects with specific colors (2 and 8) along the horizontal axis and then moving all objects to the bottom of the grid while maintaining their relative horizontal positions. 

**Input 0:**

* The object composed of "2"s is mirrored horizontally and moved to the bottom of the grid.
* The object composed of "8"s is mirrored horizontally and moved to the bottom of the grid, to the right of the "2"s object.

**Input 1:**

* Same transformation logic as Input 0. The relative horizontal positions of the objects are maintained.

**Input 2:**

* Same transformation logic as Input 0 and Input 1. Notice how the larger object composed of "2"s is handled correctly.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  grid_h = height(I)
  grid_w = width(I)
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      merge(
        frozenset(
          (v, (grid_h - i - 1, grid_w - j - 1)) 
          if v in {2, 8} 
          else (v, (i, j)) 
          for v, (i, j) in obj
        ) 
        for obj in objs
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  We identify all objects in the input grid `I` using `objects(I, True, False, True)`. 
2. **Iterate and Transform:** We iterate over each object `obj`.
    * **Mirror and Move:** For objects with color 2 or 8, we mirror them horizontally by calculating new coordinates as `(grid_h - i - 1, grid_w - j - 1)` and move them to the bottom. 
    * **Keep Original:**  Other objects remain unchanged using their original coordinates `(i, j)`.
3. **Merge and Paint:** Finally, we merge all transformed objects and paint them onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    canvas(0, shape(I)),
    merge(
      apply(
        lambda obj: shift(hmirror(obj), (height(I) - height(obj) - 2*uppermost(obj), 0)),
        sfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) in {2, 8})
      ) | 
      sfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) not in {2, 8})
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Filter:**  Extract all objects. Filter them into two sets: one with colors 2 and 8, the other with remaining colors.
2. **Transform Target Objects:** Apply a lambda function to the first set (colors 2 and 8):
    * **Mirror:**  `hmirror(obj)` mirrors the object horizontally.
    * **Move Down:** `shift(...)` moves the mirrored object to the bottom row.
3. **Combine and Paint:**  Combine the transformed objects with the unchanged objects using `|`. Paint everything onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)
  return paint(
    canvas(0, shape(I)),
    merge(
      apply(
        lambda obj: frozenset(
          (c, (grid_h - 1 - i, grid_w - 1 - j)) if c in {2, 8} else (c, (i, j))
          for c, (i, j) in obj
        ),
        objects(I, True, False, True)
      )
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Extract all objects from the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Transform:** Iterate through each object and apply a transformation:
    * **Conditional Mirroring:** If the object's color is 2 or 8, mirror its coordinates by subtracting them from `(grid_h - 1, grid_w - 1)`. 
    * **Keep Original:**  Otherwise, retain the original coordinates.
3. **Merge and Paint:** Merge the transformed objects and paint them onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)
  transformed_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) in {2, 8}:
      transformed_obj = frozenset(
        (v, (grid_h - i - 1, grid_w - j - 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj
      )
    else:
      transformed_obj = obj
    transformed_objs = transformed_objs | {transformed_obj}
  return paint(canvas(0, (grid_h, grid_w)), transformed_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects and Initialize:**  Extract all objects and initialize an empty set for transformed objects.
2. **Iterate and Transform:**  Iterate through each object:
    * **Conditional Mirroring:** If the object's color is 2 or 8, calculate new mirrored coordinates.
    * **Add to Set:**  Add the transformed (or original) object to the `transformed_objs` set.
3. **Paint:**  Paint all transformed objects onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    canvas(0, shape(I)),
    mapply(
      lambda obj: branch(
        color(obj) in {2, 8}, 
        shift(hmirror(obj), (height(I) - height(obj) - 2 * uppermost(obj), 0)), 
        obj
      ), 
      objects(I, True, False, True)
    )
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extract all objects from the input grid.
2. **Apply Transformation:** Apply a lambda function to each object using `mapply`:
    * **Conditional Branching:**  `branch` checks if the object's color is 2 or 8.
        * **True:** Mirror and move the object to the bottom.
        * **False:** Keep the object unchanged.
3. **Paint:**  Paint the transformed objects onto a blank canvas.


Each version implements the same logic using different function combinations and approaches, demonstrating diversity in code generation.
