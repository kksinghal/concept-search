## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving specific objects within the input grid to achieve the output grid. Objects are defined as connected regions of the same digit. 

Here's a breakdown of the movement logic for each object type:

**Object Type 2:** This object is always moved to the bottom-left corner of the grid.

**Object Type 8:** This object is always moved to the bottom-center of the grid.

**Other Objects:** These objects remain in their original position.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj2 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)
  O = paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shift(obj2, (grid_h - height(obj2), 0))),
            shift(obj8, (grid_h - height(obj8), (grid_w // 2) - (width(obj8) // 2))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** We identify and extract the objects of color '2' and '8' from the input grid 'I'.
2. **Calculate Dimensions:** We determine the height and width of the input grid.
3. **Create Canvas:**  A new canvas 'O' is created with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros.
4. **Shift Object 2:** The extracted object '2' is shifted to the bottom-left corner using its height and the grid's height.
5. **Shift Object 8:** The extracted object '8' is shifted to the bottom-center using its height, width, and the grid's width.
6. **Paint Objects:** Both shifted objects are painted onto the canvas 'O'.
7. **Return Output:** The modified canvas 'O' is returned as the output grid.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (grid_h - height(obj), 0)))
    elif color(obj) == 8:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (grid_h - height(obj), (grid_w // 2) - (width(obj) // 2))))
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** All objects are extracted from the input grid 'I'.
2. **Calculate Dimensions:**  We get the height and width of the input grid.
3. **Create Canvas:** A new canvas 'O' is created, filled with zeros, having the same size as the input grid.
4. **Iterate Objects:** We iterate through each extracted object.
5. **Conditional Shifting:** Based on the object's color, we apply conditional shifting:
   - **Color 2:** Shift to the bottom-left corner.
   - **Color 8:** Shift to the bottom-center.
   - **Other Colors:** No shifting.
6. **Paint Objects:**  Each object (shifted or not) is painted onto the canvas 'O'.
7. **Return Output:** The final canvas 'O' becomes the output grid.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)
  def transform_object(obj):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      return shift(obj, (grid_h - height(obj), 0))
    elif color(obj) == 8:
      return shift(obj, (grid_h - height(obj), (grid_w // 2) - (width(obj) // 2)))
    else:
      return obj
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(apply(transform_object, objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate Dimensions:** We obtain the input grid's height and width.
2. **Define `transform_object` Function:** 
   - Takes an object as input.
   - Applies conditional shifting based on its color:
     - Color 2: Bottom-left corner.
     - Color 8: Bottom-center.
     - Other Colors: No shift.
   - Returns the transformed object.
3. **Extract, Transform, and Merge Objects:**
   - We extract all objects from the input grid.
   - Apply the `transform_object` function to each object.
   - Merge all transformed objects.
4. **Paint to Canvas:**
   - Create a canvas filled with zeros, matching the input grid's size.
   - Paint the merged, transformed objects onto the canvas.
5. **Return Output:**  The canvas becomes the output grid.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), 
               merge(
                   frozenset(
                       shift(obj, (grid_h - height(obj), 0)) if color(obj) == 2 
                       else shift(obj, (grid_h - height(obj), (grid_w // 2) - (width(obj) // 2))) if color(obj) == 8 
                       else obj 
                       for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)
                   )
               )
              )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate Dimensions:** Determine the height and width of the input grid.
2. **One-liner Transformation:** The code uses nested comprehensions and conditional expressions to achieve the transformation in a single line.
   - **Extract Objects:**  It iterates through all objects in the input grid.
   - **Conditional Shifting:** For each object:
     - **Color 2:** Shift to the bottom-left corner.
     - **Color 8:** Shift to the bottom-center.
     - **Other Colors:** No shift.
   - **Merge and Paint:**  The shifted objects are merged and painted onto a new canvas.
3. **Return Output:** The modified canvas is returned as the output grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def transform_cell(v, loc):
    grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)
    if v == 2:
      obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: contained((v, loc), obj))
      return shift(obj, (grid_h - height(obj), 0))
    elif v == 8:
      obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: contained((v, loc), obj))
      return shift(obj, (grid_h - height(obj), (grid_w // 2) - (width(obj) // 2)))
    else:
      return {(v, loc)}
  return asobject(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(mapply(transform_cell, asobject(I)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `transform_cell` Function:**
   - Takes a cell value 'v' and its location 'loc' as input.
   - Applies conditional transformations at the cell level:
     - **Value 2:** Extracts the entire object containing the cell and shifts it to the bottom-left corner.
     - **Value 8:**  Extracts the entire object containing the cell and shifts it to the bottom-center.
     - **Other Values:**  Keeps the cell in its original position.
   - Returns the transformed cell(s) as a set.
2. **Cell-wise Transformation:**
   - The input grid is converted into an object representation using `asobject`.
   - The `transform_cell` function is applied to each cell using `mapply`.
   - The transformed cells are merged back into a single object.
3. **Paint and Convert:**
   - The merged object is painted onto a zero-filled canvas.
   - The canvas is then converted back into a grid representation using `asobject`.
4. **Return Output:** The transformed grid is returned as the output.
