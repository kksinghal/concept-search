## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all three examples can be described as "moving all non-background objects to the bottom of the grid while maintaining their relative horizontal positions." Let's break it down:

* **Identifying Objects:** The transformation focuses on digits that are not the background color (most frequent color). These form the objects of interest.
* **Vertical Movement:**  Objects are shifted downwards to occupy the bottom rows of the grid. 
* **Horizontal Preservation:** The horizontal arrangement of objects within each row remains unchanged.
* **Background Fill:** The vacated spaces above the moved objects are filled with the background color. 

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_5582e5ca(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  y = height(I)
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (y - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Identifies background color (`bg`) and extracts objects (`objs`) from the input grid (`I`). A new canvas (`O`) is created, filled with the background color, and having the same dimensions as the input grid. 
2. **Object Placement:** Iterates through each object (`obj`). For each object, it calculates the vertical shift required to move it to the bottom and paints it onto the new canvas (`O`) at the calculated position.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_5582e5ca(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    column = tuple(I[i][j] for i in range(height(I)))
    non_bg = tuple(v for v in column if v != bg)
    O = paint(O, {(v, (i + height(I) - len(non_bg), j)) for i, v in enumerate(non_bg)})
  return O  
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to version 1, this version identifies the background color (`bg`) and creates a new canvas (`O`) with the background color.
2. **Column-wise Processing:** Instead of extracting objects, this version iterates through each column of the input grid. It collects non-background values in each column and paints them directly onto the new canvas at the bottom, maintaining their original order within the column.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_5582e5ca(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = list(list(bg for _ in range(w)) for _ in range(h))
  for j in range(w):
    k = h - 1
    for i in range(h-1, -1, -1):
      if I[i][j] != bg:
        O[k][j] = I[i][j]
        k -= 1
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to previous versions, it identifies the background color and creates a new canvas. This time the canvas is initialized as a nested list for in-place modification.
2. **Bottom-up Fill:** Iterates through each column from bottom to top. If a non-background value is encountered, it's placed at the current bottom-most available position (`k`) in the output column. The pointer `k` is then decremented to the next available position.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_5582e5ca(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  compressed = compress(I)
  return vconcat(canvas(bg, (height(I) - height(compressed), width(I))), compressed)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Compression:**  Identifies and removes all uniform color rows from the top and bottom of the input grid using the `compress` function.
2. **Concatenation:**  Creates a new canvas filled with the background color with the height difference between the original grid and the compressed grid. This canvas is then vertically concatenated with the compressed grid, placing the objects at the bottom.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_5582e5ca(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  transposed = rot90(I)
  O = tuple()
  for row in transposed:
    non_bg = tuple(v for v in row if v != bg)
    padding = tuple(bg for _ in range(len(row) - len(non_bg)))
    O = O + (padding + non_bg,)
  return rot270(O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transpose:** Rotates the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise using `rot90`, effectively treating columns as rows. 
2. **Row-wise Reordering:** Iterates through each row of the transposed grid. It separates non-background values and creates padding with the background color. The non-background values are placed at the end of each row, effectively moving them to the 'bottom' (which is now the right side due to rotation).
3. **Reverse Rotation:**  Rotates the resulting grid back to its original orientation using `rot270`.
