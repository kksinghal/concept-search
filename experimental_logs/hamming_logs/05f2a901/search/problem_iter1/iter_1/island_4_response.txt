## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving all non-background objects to the bottom of the grid, maintaining their relative horizontal positions and order.

**Input_0:** 
- The two objects (2s and 8s) are moved to the bottom rows of the grid, keeping their horizontal arrangement intact.

**Input_1:** 
- Similar to Input_0, both objects are shifted down to occupy the bottom rows while preserving their horizontal positions relative to each other.

**Input_2:** 
- Again, the objects (8s and 2s) are moved to the bottom, filling the grid from bottom to top while keeping their horizontal arrangement unchanged.


## Program Versions:

### Program Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract all non-background objects
    x2 = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create a canvas with background color
    O = x2  # Initialize output grid
    i = len(I) - 1  # Start from the bottom row
    for obj in x1:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (i - lowermost(obj), 0)))  # Paint each object to the bottom
        i -= height(obj)  # Update row index for the next object
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. Extract all non-background objects from the input grid (`x1`).
2. Create a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid and filled with the background color (`x2`).
3. Initialize the output grid (`O`) with the blank canvas.
4. Iterate through the objects (`x1`) in any order.
5. For each object, calculate the shift needed to move it to the bottom row (`i - lowermost(obj), 0`).
6. Paint the shifted object onto the output grid (`O`).
7. Update the row index (`i`) to accommodate the next object's height.

### Program Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract all non-background objects
    x2 = rbind(lowermost, I)  # Function to get the lowermost row index for an object
    x3 = order(x1, x2)  # Sort objects by their lowermost row index
    x4 = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create a canvas with background color
    O = x4  # Initialize output grid
    i = len(I) - 1  # Start from the bottom row
    for obj in x3:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (i - lowermost(obj), 0)))  # Paint each object to the bottom
        i -= height(obj)  # Update row index for the next object
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. Extract all non-background objects from the input grid (`x1`).
2. Create a function `x2` to get the lowermost row index of an object.
3. Sort the objects `x1` in ascending order based on their lowermost row index (`x3`).
4. Create a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid and filled with the background color (`x4`).
5. Initialize the output grid (`O`) with the blank canvas.
6. Iterate through the sorted objects (`x3`).
7. For each object, calculate the shift needed to move it to the bottom row (`i - lowermost(obj), 0`).
8. Paint the shifted object onto the output grid (`O`).
9. Update the row index (`i`) to accommodate the next object's height.

### Program Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract all non-background objects
    x2 = apply(lambda obj: (lowermost(obj), obj), x1)  # Pair each object with its lowermost row index
    x3 = order(x2, lambda pair: pair[0])  # Sort pairs by lowermost row index
    x4 = apply(lambda pair: pair[1], x3)  # Extract sorted objects
    x5 = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create a canvas with background color
    O = x5  # Initialize output grid
    i = len(I) - 1  # Start from the bottom row
    for obj in x4:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (i - lowermost(obj), 0)))  # Paint each object to the bottom
        i -= height(obj)  # Update row index for the next object
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. Extract all non-background objects from the input grid (`x1`).
2. Pair each object with its lowermost row index using a lambda function (`x2`).
3. Sort the pairs based on the first element (lowermost row index) of each pair (`x3`).
4. Extract the sorted objects from the sorted pairs (`x4`).
5. Create a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid and filled with the background color (`x5`).
6. Initialize the output grid (`O`) with the blank canvas.
7. Iterate through the sorted objects (`x4`).
8. For each object, calculate the shift needed to move it to the bottom row (`i - lowermost(obj), 0`).
9. Paint the shifted object onto the output grid (`O`).
10. Update the row index (`i`) to accommodate the next object's height.

### Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = fgpartition(I)  # Partition the grid into objects, excluding background
    x2 = rbind(lambda obj, grid: lowermost(toindices(obj)), I)  # Function to get the lowermost row index for an object
    x3 = order(x1, x2)  # Sort objects by their lowermost row index
    x4 = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create a canvas with background color
    O = x4  # Initialize output grid
    i = len(I) - 1  # Start from the bottom row
    for obj in x3:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (i - lowermost(obj), 0)))  # Paint each object to the bottom
        i -= height(obj)  # Update row index for the next object
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. Partition the input grid into objects, excluding the background (`x1`).
2. Create a function `x2` to get the lowermost row index of an object from the grid.
3. Sort the objects `x1` in ascending order based on their lowermost row index (`x3`).
4. Create a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid and filled with the background color (`x4`).
5. Initialize the output grid (`O`) with the blank canvas.
6. Iterate through the sorted objects (`x3`).
7. For each object, calculate the shift needed to move it to the bottom row (`i - lowermost(obj), 0`).
8. Paint the shifted object onto the output grid (`O`).
9. Update the row index (`i`) to accommodate the next object's height.

### Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract all non-background objects
    x2 = compose(lowermost, toindices)  # Function to get lowermost row index for an object
    x3 = [(x2(obj), obj) for obj in x1]  # Pair each object with its lowermost row index
    x4 = order(x3, lambda pair: pair[0])  # Sort pairs by lowermost row index
    x5 = [pair[1] for pair in x4]  # Extract sorted objects
    x6 = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create a canvas with background color
    O = x6  # Initialize output grid
    i = len(I) - 1  # Start from the bottom row
    for obj in x5:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (i - lowermost(obj), 0)))  # Paint each object to the bottom
        i -= height(obj)  # Update row index for the next object
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. Extract all non-background objects from the input grid (`x1`).
2. Create a function `x2` to get the lowermost row index of an object using function composition.
3. Pair each object with its lowermost row index (`x3`).
4. Sort the pairs based on the first element (lowermost row index) of each pair (`x4`).
5. Extract the sorted objects from the sorted pairs (`x5`).
6. Create a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid and filled with the background color (`x6`).
7. Initialize the output grid (`O`) with the blank canvas.
8. Iterate through the sorted objects (`x5`).
9. For each object, calculate the shift needed to move it to the bottom row (`i - lowermost(obj), 0`).
10. Paint the shifted object onto the output grid (`O`).
11. Update the row index (`i`) to accommodate the next object's height.

These program versions provide different approaches to achieve the desired transformation, using various DSL functions and logic while ensuring the objects are moved to the bottom of the grid, maintaining their horizontal arrangements and order.
