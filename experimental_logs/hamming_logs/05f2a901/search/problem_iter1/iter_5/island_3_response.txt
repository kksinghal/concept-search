## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving objects composed of specific colors (2 and 8) to a new location on the grid while preserving their shape and orientation. 

**Transformation Logic:**

1. **Identify Target Objects:**  Select objects composed of colors 2 and 8.
2. **Calculate New Position:**  Determine the target position for each object. The target seems to be the bottom center of the grid for all objects.
3. **Move Objects:** Shift the target objects to their new positions.
4. **Maintain Other Objects:**  Ensure that objects not composed of the target colors remain in their original positions.
5. **Blank Canvas:** Use a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid and paint the moved objects and other objects onto it.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def move_object(obj):
    grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)
    return shift(obj, (grid_h - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), (grid_w // 2) - (width(obj) // 2) - leftmost(obj)))

  target_objs = sfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) in {2, 8})
  other_objs = difference(objects(I, True, False, True), target_objs)
  moved_objs = apply(move_object, target_objs)
  return asobject(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(moved_objs | other_objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`move_object` function:** This function calculates the offset required to move an object to the bottom center of the grid and shifts the object accordingly.
2.  **`target_objs`:**  Filters and stores objects made of colors 2 and 8.
3.  **`other_objs`:** Stores the remaining objects in the grid.
4.  **`moved_objs`:** Applies the `move_object` function to each target object.
5.  **Final Output:** Creates a blank canvas, paints the moved and other objects onto it, and returns the result as an object.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def reposition(cell):
    v, (i, j) = cell
    grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)
    if v in {2, 8}:
      obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: contained(cell, obj))
      return (v, (grid_h - height(obj) + i - uppermost(obj), (grid_w // 2) - (width(obj) // 2) + j - leftmost(obj)))
    return cell
  return asobject(apply(reposition, asobject(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`reposition` function:** This function takes a cell and checks if its value is 2 or 8. 
    * If yes, it finds the object containing the cell, calculates the new position based on the bottom center logic, and returns the cell with updated coordinates. 
    * If not, it returns the cell unchanged.
2. The program applies the `reposition` function to every cell in the input grid, effectively moving target objects while leaving others untouched. 


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def handle_object(obj):
    grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)
    if color(obj) in {2, 8}:
      return shift(obj, (grid_h - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), (grid_w // 2) - (width(obj) // 2) - leftmost(obj)))
    return obj

  return asobject(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(apply(handle_object, objects(I, True, False, True)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`handle_object` function:** This function checks the color of each object.
    * If the color is 2 or 8, it calculates the offset to move the object to the bottom center and shifts the object. 
    * If not, it returns the object unchanged.
2. The program iterates through all objects in the grid, applies the `handle_object` function, merges the transformed objects, and paints them on a blank canvas.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def reposition_cell(v, loc):
    grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)
    if v in {2, 8}:
      obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: contained((v, loc), obj))
      return (v, (grid_h - height(obj) + loc[0] - uppermost(obj), (grid_w // 2) - (width(obj) // 2) + loc[1] - leftmost(obj)))
    return (v, loc)

  return asobject(frozenset(reposition_cell(v, (i, j)) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(row)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`reposition_cell` function:** This function directly takes the color and location of a cell as input. Similar to previous versions, it checks for target colors and recalculates the position accordingly. 
2.  Instead of using `asobject` and `apply`, this version iterates through the grid cell by cell, applies `reposition_cell`, and constructs the final object directly.


**Program Version 5:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)
  return asobject(frozenset({
    (v, (grid_h - height(obj) + i - uppermost(obj), (grid_w // 2) - (width(obj) // 2) + j - leftmost(obj))) 
    if v in {2, 8} else (v, (i, j))
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) 
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj
  }))
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version uses a nested set comprehension for a more compact representation. It iterates through each object and cell within the object.
2. For each cell, it checks if the color is 2 or 8 and applies the position transformation directly within the comprehension. 

Each of these program versions uses a slightly different approach with distinct logic and function combinations while achieving the desired outcome for the given transformation.
