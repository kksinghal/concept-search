## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving objects within their respective columns to the bottom of the grid, maintaining their relative order within the column. The background color remains unchanged.

**Example:**

Input:
```
0 0 2
0 2 2
2 0 0
```

Output:
```
0 0 0
0 2 2
2 2 2 
```

Here, the three '2' objects are moved to the bottom of their respective columns while preserving their order.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Extract all univalued, non-diagonal, non-background objects
  bg = mostcolor(I) # Get the background color
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I)) # Create a canvas with background color
  for j in range(width(I)): # Iterate over columns
    filtered_objs = sorted([obj for obj in objs if leftmost(obj) == j], key=lambda obj: -uppermost(obj)) # Filter and sort objects in the column
    bottom = height(I) # Start from the bottom row
    for obj in filtered_objs:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (bottom - height(obj), 0))) # Paint each object to the bottom
      bottom -= height(obj) # Update row index for the next object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** We extract all non-background objects from the input grid using `objects(I, True, False, True)`. 
2. **Iterate Columns:** We iterate through each column of the grid.
3. **Filter and Sort:**  For each column, we filter objects belonging to that column and sort them based on their vertical position (uppermost row index).
4. **Paint and Update:** We paint the sorted objects onto a new canvas starting from the bottom row, updating the starting row index for the next object in the column.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return dmirror(
        dhbfjgabeeecehffahdfbgfdeihaaaei(
            dmirror(I)
        )
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Mirror:** We mirror the input grid diagonally using `dmirror(I)`. This effectively swaps rows and columns.
2. **Apply Program A:** We apply the logic of `Program_A` (provided earlier), which effectively moves objects to the bottom row while maintaining relative order. However, due to the mirroring, this now happens along columns.
3. **Mirror Back:** We mirror the output of step 2 back diagonally using `dmirror()`, returning the grid to its original orientation with objects moved to the bottom of their respective columns.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I) # Get the background color
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I)) # Create a canvas with background color
  for j in range(width(I)): # Iterate over columns
    column = (I[i][j] for i in range(height(I))) # Extract the column
    filtered_column = [v for v in column if v != bg] # Filter out background values
    bottom = height(I) - len(filtered_column) # Calculate the bottom row for the first object
    for v in filtered_column:
      O = paint(O, {(v, (bottom, j))}) # Paint the value at the bottom row
      bottom += 1 # Update row index for the next value
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Columns:** The code iterates over each column of the input grid.
2. **Extract and Filter Column:** For each column, it extracts the values and filters out the background color.
3. **Calculate Bottom Row:** It calculates the bottommost row for placing the first non-background value in that column.
4. **Paint and Update:** It paints each filtered value onto a new canvas at the calculated bottom row and updates the row index for the next value in the column.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      v for v in r if v != mostcommon(r)
    ) + tuple(
      mostcommon(r) for i in range(len(r) - len([v for v in r if v != mostcommon(r)]))
    ) for r in dmirror(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transpose Grid:** The `dmirror(I)` function transposes the grid, effectively swapping rows and columns. 
2. **Process Rows (Original Columns):** The code then processes each row of the transposed grid, which represent the original columns.
3. **Separate Non-Background Values:** For each row, it separates the non-background values (`v for v in r if v != mostcommon(r)`), keeping their order.
4. **Add Background Values:** It then adds the background values (`mostcommon(r)`) to the end of the list, ensuring the row length remains the same.
5. **Return Transposed Grid:** The final output is the transposed grid with all non-background values moved to the end of each row (originally the bottom of each column).

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Extract objects
  bg = mostcolor(I)  # Get background color
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))  # Create canvas
  for obj in objs:
    j = leftmost(obj)  # Get column index
    other_objs_in_column = [o for o in objs if leftmost(o) == j and o != obj]  # Get other objects in same column
    new_i = height(I) - sum([height(o) for o in other_objs_in_column if uppermost(o) > uppermost(obj)]) - height(obj)  # Calculate new row index
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (new_i - uppermost(obj), 0)))  # Move object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects and Background:** Extracts objects from the input grid and identifies the background color.
2. **Iterate Through Objects:** Loops through each extracted object.
3. **Determine New Position:** For each object, it calculates its new vertical position based on the heights of other objects in the same column that were originally below it.
4. **Move Object:**  Shifts the object to its new position on the canvas.

Each of these programs represents a distinct approach to solving the object movement transformation, using different combinations of DSL functions and logic.
