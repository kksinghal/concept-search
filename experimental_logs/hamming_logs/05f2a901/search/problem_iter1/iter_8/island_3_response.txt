## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation centers the objects with color 2 and 8 to the bottom center of the grid while preserving their original color and shape. All other objects retain their original position and color. 

**Input 0:** Both the '2' object and the '8' object are moved downwards such that their upper left corner aligns with the 9th row. Then, they are both shifted horizontally to align their vertical center with the grid's vertical center.

**Input 1:** Similar to Input 0, both the '2' object and '8' object are shifted downwards and horizontally to be centered at the bottom of the grid. 

**Input 2:**  Both the '2' object and '8' object are shifted upwards and horizontally to be centered at the bottom of the grid.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1: Using object manipulation**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Extract objects
  grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)           # Get grid dimensions
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),              # Create an empty canvas
      merge([                               # Merge the following sets:
          frozenset(                     # 1. Objects with color 2 and 8, shifted
              (v, (grid_h - height(obj) + i - uppermost(obj), (grid_w // 2) - (width(obj) // 2) + j - leftmost(obj)))
              for v, (i, j) in obj
          )
          for obj in objs if color(obj) in {2, 8}
      ] + [
          frozenset(                     # 2. All other objects, unchanged
              (v, (i, j))
              for v, (i, j) in obj
          )
          for obj in objs if color(obj) not in {2, 8}
      ])
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:**  Extract all objects from the input grid using `objects(I, True, False, True)`.
2. **Get grid dimensions:** Obtain the height and width of the input grid using `shape(I)`.
3. **Create an empty canvas:** Generate a blank grid of the same size as the input grid filled with the value '0' using `canvas(0, shape(I))`.
4. **Shift objects with color 2 and 8:** 
    - Iterate through each object in `objs`.
    - If the object's color is 2 or 8, calculate its new position:
        - Vertical position: Bottom align the object by subtracting its height from the grid height (`grid_h - height(obj)`). 
        - Horizontal position: Center the object by subtracting half its width from half the grid width (`(grid_w // 2) - (width(obj) // 2)`).
    - Add the shifted object to the set of objects to be painted.
5. **Keep other objects unchanged:** 
    - For objects with colors other than 2 and 8, keep their positions unchanged.
6. **Merge and paint:** Combine the shifted objects and unchanged objects. Paint these objects onto the blank canvas to generate the output grid.

**Version 2: Using row-wise processing**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)
  def process_object(obj):
    if color(obj) in {2, 8}:
      return frozenset(
          (v, (grid_h - height(obj) + i - uppermost(obj), (grid_w // 2) - (width(obj) // 2) + j - leftmost(obj)))
          for v, (i, j) in obj
      )
    else:
      return obj

  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      merge(apply(process_object, objects(I, True, False, True)))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects and grid dimensions:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Define `process_object` function:** This function takes an object as input and:
   - If the object's color is 2 or 8, it calculates its new position (same logic as Version 1) and returns the shifted object.
   - If the object's color is not 2 or 8, it returns the object unchanged.
3. **Apply `process_object` to all objects:** Apply the `process_object` function to each object in the extracted object list using `apply`.
4. **Merge and paint:** Similar to Version 1.


**Version 3: Using conditional shifting**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      merge(
          frozenset(
              (v, 
               (grid_h - height(obj) + i - uppermost(obj) if v in {2, 8} else i,
                (grid_w // 2) - (width(obj) // 2) + j - leftmost(obj) if v in {2, 8} else j)
              )
              for v, (i, j) in obj
          )
          for obj in objs 
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects and grid dimensions:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Conditional shifting during painting:**
    - Iterate through each object and its cells.
    - For each cell, check if its color is 2 or 8:
        - If yes, calculate the new position (same logic as Version 1).
        - If not, keep the original position.
3. **Merge and paint:** Similar to Version 1.

**Version 4:  Using `shift` and conditional logic**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      merge(
          shift(obj, (grid_h - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), (grid_w // 2) - (width(obj) // 2) - leftmost(obj)))
          if color(obj) in {2, 8} else obj
          for obj in objs
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects and grid dimensions:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Conditional shifting:** Iterate through each object and directly apply the `shift` function with calculated offsets only if the object's color is 2 or 8. Otherwise, keep the object unchanged.
3. **Merge and paint:** Similar to Version 1.

**Version 5: Combining `apply` and conditional shifting**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)
  def conditional_shift(obj):
    return shift(obj, (grid_h - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), (grid_w // 2) - (width(obj) // 2) - leftmost(obj))) if color(obj) in {2, 8} else obj

  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      merge(apply(conditional_shift, objs))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects and grid dimensions:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Define `conditional_shift` function:** This function encapsulates the conditional shifting logic from Version 4, taking an object and returning either the shifted object (if its color is 2 or 8) or the unchanged object.
3. **Apply `conditional_shift` to all objects:** Use `apply` to apply the `conditional_shift` function to each object in the extracted object list.
4. **Merge and paint:** Similar to Version 1.

These five versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the same transformation using various DSL functions and logic constructs, highlighting the flexibility and expressive power of the provided DSL.
