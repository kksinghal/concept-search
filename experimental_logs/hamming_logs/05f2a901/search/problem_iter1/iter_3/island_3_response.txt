## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying objects of color '2' and '8' and moving them to specific positions on the grid. Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The '2' object is moved to the bottom-left corner.
* The '8' object is moved to the bottom center.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The '2' object is moved one row down from its original position and centered horizontally.
* The '8' object remains in its position.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The '2' object is moved to the bottom center.
* The '8' object remains in its position.


## Program Versions:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj2 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)
  O = paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), 
                  shift(obj2, (grid_h - height(obj2), (grid_w // 2) - (width(obj2) // 2)))),
            shift(obj8, (grid_h - height(obj8), (grid_w // 2) - (width(obj8) // 2))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identifies and extracts the objects with color '2' and '8'.
2. **Canvas Creation:** Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.
3. **Shift Objects:** 
    * Shifts the '2' object to the bottom center of the canvas.
    * Shifts the '8' object to the bottom center of the canvas.
4. **Paint Objects:** Paints the shifted objects onto the canvas.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def move_object(obj, color):
    grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)
    return shift(obj, (grid_h - height(obj), (grid_w // 2) - (width(obj) // 2)))
  
  return asobject(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), 
                          merge(mapply(lambda obj: move_object(obj, color(obj)), 
                                      sfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) in {2, 8})))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Filter Objects:** Filters objects with colors '2' and '8'.
2. **Move Objects:**  Defines a helper function 'move_object' to shift objects to the bottom center.
3. **Apply and Merge:** Applies the 'move_object' function to each filtered object and merges the results.
4. **Paint and Convert:** Paints the merged objects onto a blank canvas and converts it to an object. 

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def reposition(v, loc):
    grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)
    if v in {2, 8}:
      return (v, (grid_h - 1, (grid_w // 2) - 1 + loc[1] - leftmost(extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: contained((v, loc), obj)))))
    return (v, loc)
  return asobject(apply(lambda cell: reposition(*cell), asobject(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Reposition Function:** Defines a 'reposition' function that calculates the new position of each cell based on its color and original position.
2. **Apply to Each Cell:**  Applies the 'reposition' function to every cell in the input grid.
3. **Convert to Object:** Converts the transformed grid back into an object.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def handle_object(obj):
    grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)
    return shift(obj, (grid_h - height(obj), (grid_w // 2) - (width(obj) // 2)))

  filtered_objects = sfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) in {2, 8})
  transformed_objects = apply(handle_object, filtered_objects)
  return asobject(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(transformed_objects)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Handling:** Defines a 'handle_object' function to move objects to the bottom center.
2. **Filter and Transform:** Filters objects of color '2' and '8' and applies the 'handle_object' function.
3. **Merge and Paint:**  Merges the transformed objects and paints them onto a blank canvas.
4. **Object Conversion:** Converts the final grid to an object.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def reposition_cell(cell):
    v, (i, j) = cell
    grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)
    if v in {2, 8}:
      obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: contained(cell, obj))
      return (v, (grid_h - height(obj), (grid_w // 2) - (width(obj) // 2) + j - leftmost(obj)))
    return cell
  
  return asobject(apply(reposition_cell, asobject(I))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Cell Repositioning:** Defines a 'reposition_cell' function to calculate the new position of each cell, considering its object's dimensions.
2. **Apply to Cells:** Applies 'reposition_cell' to all cells in the input grid.
3. **Convert to Object:**  Converts the result back into an object.
