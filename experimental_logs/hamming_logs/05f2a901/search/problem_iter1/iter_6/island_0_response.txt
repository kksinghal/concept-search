## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves identifying individual objects within the grid and stacking them vertically at the bottom of the grid while maintaining their relative horizontal positions. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- Two objects are identified: one with value '2' and another with value '8'.
- Both objects are moved to the bottom of the grid.
- The relative horizontal positions of the objects are maintained.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- Same logic as Input_0 to Output_0, but with a different configuration of objects.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- Again, the same logic applies. Objects are stacked at the bottom while preserving their horizontal arrangement.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, each achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

**Code:**

```python
def stack_objects_bottom(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)  # Identify background color
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)  # Extract objects
  output = canvas(bg, shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas
  current_height = height(I)  # Start placing objects from the bottom
  for obj in objs:
    obj_height = height(obj)
    offset = (current_height - obj_height, 0)  # Calculate vertical offset
    output = paint(output, shift(obj, offset))  # Paint the shifted object
    current_height -= obj_height  # Update the current height for the next object
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background & Objects:**  Identify the background color (`bg`) and extract all objects (`objs`) from the input grid (`I`).
2. **Create Canvas:**  Generate an empty canvas (`output`) with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color.
3. **Iterate & Stack:** Iterate through each extracted object (`obj`). For each object:
   - Calculate its height (`obj_height`).
   - Determine the vertical offset (`offset`) to place the object at the bottom of the remaining canvas space.
   - Paint the shifted object onto the canvas.
   - Update the available canvas height (`current_height`) by subtracting the object's height.
4. **Return Output:**  Return the final transformed grid (`output`).

**Program Version 2:**

**Code:**

```python
def stack_objects_bottom(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (height(I) - height(obj) - sum(height(o) for o in objs if uppermost(o) < uppermost(obj)), 0)), objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a more functional approach, condensing the logic into a single line:

1. **Identify Background & Objects:** Same as version 1.
2. **Calculate Offsets & Shift:** For each object:
   - Calculate the vertical offset based on its position relative to other objects. This ensures proper stacking even without explicit sorting.
   - Shift the object using the calculated offset.
3. **Merge & Paint:** Merge all shifted objects and paint them onto a blank canvas with the background color.
4. **Return Output:**  Return the transformed grid.

**Program Version 3:**

**Code:**

```python
def stack_objects_bottom(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = sorted(objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), key=lambda obj: uppermost(obj))
  output = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  y = height(I)
  for obj in objs:
    output = vconcat(output[:y-height(obj)], paint(canvas(bg, (height(obj), width(I))), obj), output[y:])
    y -= height(obj)
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

This version explicitly sorts the objects based on their uppermost row before stacking:

1. **Identify Background & Objects:** Same as version 1.
2. **Sort Objects:** Sort the extracted objects based on their uppermost row index using `sorted` and a lambda function.
3. **Iterate, Slice, & Concatenate:** Iterate through the sorted objects and for each object:
   - Slice the output grid to create space for the object.
   - Create a new grid with the object painted on a background canvas.
   - Concatenate the sliced parts of the output grid with the new object grid.
   - Update the `y` coordinate for the next object placement.
4. **Return Output:** Return the transformed grid.


**Program Version 4:**

**Code:**

```python
def stack_objects_bottom(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  heights = [height(obj) for obj in objs]
  offsets = [sum(heights[i+1:]) for i in range(len(heights))]
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda obj, offset: shift(obj, (offset, 0)), pair(objs, offsets))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on pre-calculating offsets for each object based on the heights of objects below them:

1. **Identify Background & Objects:** Same as version 1.
2. **Calculate Heights & Offsets:** Create a list of object heights (`heights`) and pre-calculate the vertical offset (`offsets`) for each object by summing the heights of all objects below it.
3. **Shift & Paint:**  Use `pair` to combine `objs` and `offsets` and apply a lambda function to shift each object based on its corresponding offset. 
4. **Merge & Paint:** Merge all shifted objects and paint them onto a blank canvas with the background color.
5. **Return Output:**  Return the transformed grid.

**Program Version 5:**

**Code:**

```python
def stack_objects_bottom(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  output = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    output = paint(output, shift(obj, (height(I) - sum([height(o) for o in objs if objs.index(o) <= i]), 0)))
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

This version calculates the offset for each object on-the-fly during the iteration:

1. **Identify Background & Objects:** Same as version 1.
2. **Iterate, Calculate Offset, & Paint:** Iterate through each object:
   - Calculate the vertical offset by summing the heights of objects encountered so far.
   - Shift the object using the calculated offset.
   - Paint the shifted object onto the canvas.
3. **Return Output:** Return the transformed grid.


These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version offers a unique combination of logic and function calls, ensuring they are significantly different from each other.
