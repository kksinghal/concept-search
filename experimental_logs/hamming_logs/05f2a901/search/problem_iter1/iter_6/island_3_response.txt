## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving objects with specific colors (2 and 8) to the bottom center of the grid while maintaining their original shape and relative position. 

* **Input_0 to Output_0:** The two objects (one with color 2, another with color 8) are moved to the bottom center of the grid. 
* **Input_1 to Output_1:**  Similar to the previous example, both objects are moved to the bottom center, maintaining their relative positions.
* **Input_2 to Output_2:** Again, the objects with colors 2 and 8 are moved to the bottom center while preserving their shapes and relative placements.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def move_object(obj):
    grid_h = height(I)
    grid_w = width(I)
    obj_h = height(obj)
    obj_w = width(obj)
    return shift(obj, (grid_h - obj_h - uppermost(obj), (grid_w // 2) - (obj_w // 2) - leftmost(obj)))

  target_objs = sfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) in {2, 8})
  other_objs = difference(objects(I, True, False, True), target_objs)
  moved_objs = apply(move_object, target_objs)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(moved_objs | other_objs)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`move_object(obj)`:** This function takes an object and calculates its new position based on the grid's height and width. It then shifts the object to the bottom center.
2. **`target_objs`:**  Identifies objects with colors 2 and 8 using `sfilter`.
3. **`other_objs`:**  Selects all other objects besides the target objects.
4. **`moved_objs`:** Applies the `move_object` function to each target object.
5. Finally, the code paints the moved target objects and the other objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def reposition(cell):
    v, (i, j) = cell
    grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)
    if v in {2, 8}:
      obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: contained(cell, obj))
      obj_h = height(obj)
      obj_w = width(obj)
      return (v, (grid_h - obj_h + i - uppermost(obj), (grid_w // 2) - (obj_w // 2) + j - leftmost(obj)))
    return cell
  return asobject(apply(reposition, asobject(I))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`reposition(cell)`:** This function takes a cell and, if its color is 2 or 8, calculates its new position within the moved object.
2. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid.
3. **`extract(...)`:** Finds the object containing the current cell.
4.  The code calculates the new cell position based on the object's new bottom-center location.
5. Cells with other colors remain unchanged.
6. Finally, the transformed cells are combined back into an object representation of the output grid.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def handle_object(obj):
    grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)
    if color(obj) in {2, 8}:
      obj_h = height(obj)
      obj_w = width(obj)
      return shift(obj, (grid_h - obj_h - uppermost(obj), (grid_w // 2) - (obj_w // 2) - leftmost(obj)))
    return obj

  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(apply(handle_object, objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`handle_object(obj)`:** This function takes an object and, if its color is 2 or 8, calculates its new bottom-center position and shifts it. Other objects are returned unchanged.
2. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:**  Extracts all objects from the grid.
3. **`apply(handle_object, ...)`:** Applies `handle_object` to each object in the grid.
4. The transformed objects are merged and painted onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)

  def reposition_cell(v, loc):
    if v in {2, 8}:
      obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: contained((v, loc), obj))
      obj_h = height(obj)
      obj_w = width(obj)
      return (v, (grid_h - obj_h + loc[0] - uppermost(obj), (grid_w // 2) - (obj_w // 2) + loc[1] - leftmost(obj)))
    return (v, loc)

  return asobject(frozenset(reposition_cell(v, (i, j)) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(row)))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)`:**  Gets the height and width of the input grid.
2. **`reposition_cell(v, loc)`:** This function calculates a cell's new position if its color is 2 or 8, otherwise keeping its original position.
3. It iterates through each cell of the input grid, applying `reposition_cell` to each cell.
4. The transformed cells are collected and converted back into an object representing the output grid. 

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)
  return asobject(frozenset({
    (v, (grid_h - height(obj) + i - uppermost(obj), (grid_w // 2) - (width(obj) // 2) + j - leftmost(obj)))
    if v in {2, 8} else (v, (i, j))
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) 
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj
  }))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`grid_h, grid_w = shape(I)`:**  Gets the height and width of the input grid.
2. This version uses a set comprehension to iterate through all the cells in all objects of the input grid. 
3. For each cell belonging to an object with color 2 or 8, it calculates the new position based on the object's moved location at the bottom center.
4. Cells of other objects or colors retain their original positions.
5. Finally, the transformed cells are collected and converted into an object representing the output grid.
