## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation shifts all non-background objects to the bottom of the grid while maintaining their relative horizontal positions. The order of the objects from top to bottom in the output corresponds to their order in the input.

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The "2" object is shifted down to the bottom rows.
* The "8" object is shifted down so that it sits on top of the "2" object.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* The "8" object is shifted down to the bottom rows.
* The "2" object is shifted down so that it sits on top of the "8" object.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* The "2" object is shifted down to the bottom rows.
* The "8" object is shifted down so that it sits on top of the "2" object.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))
  current_top = h
  for obj in order(objs, uppermost):
    current_top -= height(obj)
    offset = (current_top - uppermost(obj), 0)
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, offset))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all unique objects (connected pixels with the same color) in the input grid (`I`), excluding the background.
2. **Initialize Output:** Create an empty output grid (`O`) of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
3. **Iterate and Shift:**
    - Iterate through the objects in the order of their appearance from top to bottom in the input.
    - Calculate the vertical offset required to shift each object to its new position stacked on top of previously placed objects.
    - Paint the shifted object onto the output grid.
4. **Return Output:** Return the transformed output grid.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  h = height(I)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), asobject(I))
  for i in range(h - 1, 0, -1):
    for obj in objs:
      if uppermost(obj) == i:
        space_below = h - lowermost(obj)
        O = move(O, obj, (space_below, 0))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all unique objects in the input grid (`I`), excluding the background.
2. **Initialize Output:** Create a copy of the input grid (`O`) as the initial output.
3. **Iterate and Move:**
    - Iterate through the rows of the grid from bottom to top.
    - For each row, identify objects whose top edge aligns with the current row.
    - Calculate the vertical space available below the object.
    - Move the object downwards by the calculated space, effectively shifting it to the bottom.
4. **Return Output:** Return the transformed output grid.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))
  bottom_edge = 0
  for obj in order(objs, uppermost):
    offset = (bottom_edge, 0)
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, offset))
    bottom_edge += height(obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all unique objects in the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Initialize Output:** Create an empty output grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
3. **Track Bottom Edge:** Maintain a variable `bottom_edge` to track the current bottom edge of placed objects on the output grid.
4. **Iterate and Place:**
    - Iterate through the objects in their order of appearance from top to bottom in the input.
    - For each object, calculate its position on the output grid by aligning its top edge with the `bottom_edge`.
    - Paint the object at the calculated position on the output grid.
    - Update the `bottom_edge` to the bottom of the newly placed object.
5. **Return Output:** Return the transformed output grid.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))
  used_rows = 0
  for obj in order(objs, lambda obj: uppermost(obj)):
    O = vconcat(O[:used_rows], paint(O[used_rows:], shift(obj, (used_rows - uppermost(obj), 0))))
    used_rows += height(obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all unique objects in the input, excluding the background.
2. **Initialize Output:** Create an empty output grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
3. **Track Used Rows:** Maintain a variable `used_rows` to track the number of rows occupied by placed objects on the output grid.
4. **Iterate and Concatenate:**
    - Iterate through the objects in their order of appearance from top to bottom in the input.
    - Calculate the vertical offset required to position the object's top edge at the `used_rows` position.
    - Paint the shifted object onto a slice of the output grid starting from `used_rows`.
    - Concatenate the portion of the output grid before `used_rows` with the newly painted slice, effectively placing the object.
    - Update `used_rows` to reflect the newly occupied rows.
5. **Return Output:** Return the transformed output grid.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))
  top_edges = sorted([uppermost(obj) for obj in objs])
  current_row = h - 1
  for i in range(len(top_edges) - 1, -1, -1):
    obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: uppermost(obj) == top_edges[i])
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (current_row - height(obj) + 1, 0)))
    current_row -= height(obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Top Edges:** Identify all unique objects in the input, excluding the background, and store their top edge row indices.
2. **Initialize Output:** Create an empty output grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
3. **Iterate from Bottom:** 
    - Iterate through the sorted top edge indices in reverse order, starting from the bottommost object.
    - Find the object corresponding to the current top edge index.
    - Calculate the object's new position on the output grid by aligning its bottom edge with the current row (`current_row`).
    - Paint the object at the calculated position.
    - Update `current_row` to the top edge of the newly placed object.
4. **Return Output:** Return the transformed output grid.
