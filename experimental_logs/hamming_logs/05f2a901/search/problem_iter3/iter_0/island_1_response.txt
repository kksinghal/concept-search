## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single digit and embeds it into a larger grid, creating a specific pattern with the digit and a filler value (2). Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input 0:** 
- **Input:** A single cell with value '0'.
- **Output:** A 14x9 grid. 
    - The '0' from the input is placed in a specific position within the grid.
    - The remaining cells are filled with '0'  in the top portion and a pattern of '2' and '8' in the bottom portion.

**Input 1:**
- **Input:** A single cell with value '8'.
- **Output:** A 9x10 grid.
    - The '8' from the input is placed in a specific position within the grid.
    - The remaining cells are filled with '0' in the top portion and a pattern of '2' in the bottom portion.

**Input 2:**
- **Input:** A single cell with value '0'.
- **Output:**  A 11x10 grid.
    - The '0' from the input is placed in a specific position within the grid.
    - The remaining cells are filled with '0' in the top and bottom portions and a pattern of '2' and '8' in the middle portion.

**Overall Pattern:**

- The input digit's position and the surrounding pattern in the output grid vary based on the input value.
- There's a consistent use of '0' as a background filler, particularly in the top portion of the output grids. 
- The '2' and '8' digits are used strategically to create distinct patterns.


## Program Versions & Explanations:

Since the provided programs and their outputs are identical and don't provide insight into the specific pattern generation, the following programs are created based on the observed transformation logic.

**Program Version 1 (using conditional logic):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  val = first(first(I)) if I else 0  # Extract the input digit
  h, w = 14, 9  # Default output grid dimensions
  O = canvas(0, (h, w)) # Create canvas with background '0'

  if val == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(h-2,1),(h-2,2),(h-2,3),(h-1,3)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(h-1,1),(h-1,2),(h-2,4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(h-3,3),(h-3,4),(h-2,7),(h-2,8)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(h-4,3),(h-4,4)})) 
  elif val == 8:
    h, w = 9, 10
    O = canvas(0, (h, w))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(h-3,4),(h-3,5),(h-2,4),(h-2,5),(h-1,3),(h-1,4),(h-1,5)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(h-4,6),(h-4,7),(h-3,8),(h-3,9)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(h-5,6),(h-5,7)})) 
  elif val == 2:
    h, w = 11, 10
    O = canvas(0, (h, w))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(h-6,3),(h-6,4),(h-5,3),(h-5,4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(h-4,3),(h-4,4),(h-4,5),(h-3,3),(h-3,4),(h-3,5),(h-2,3),(h-2,4),(h-2,5),(h-1,2),(h-1,3),(h-1,4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(h-5,5),(h-4,6)})) 

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Input:** Get the digit from the input grid (or use 0 if empty).
2. **Create Canvas:** Generate an empty canvas with background '0' and dimensions based on the input digit.
3. **Conditional Pattern:** Based on the input digit, paint specific patterns of '2' and '8' at predefined locations on the canvas.

**Program Version 2 (using object manipulation):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  val = first(first(I)) if I else 0
  if val == 0:
    obj_2 = normalize({(2, (0, 0)), (2, (0, 1)), (2, (0, 2)), (2, (1, 2)), (2, (1, 0)), (2, (1, 1)), (2, (0, 3))})
    obj_8 = normalize({(8, (0, 0)), (8, (0, 1)), (8, (1, 3)), (8, (1, 4)), (8, (0, 2)), (8, (0, 3))})
    h, w = 14, 9
    O = canvas(0, (h, w))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj_2, (h - 2, 1)))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj_8, (h - 4, 3)))
  elif val == 8:
    obj_2 = normalize({(2, (0, 0)), (2, (0, 1)), (2, (0, 2)), (2, (1, 1)), (2, (1, 2)), (2, (2, 0)), (2, (2, 1)), (2, (2, 2))})
    obj_8 = normalize({(8, (0, 0)), (8, (0, 1)), (8, (1, 2)), (8, (1, 3)), (8, (0, 2)), (8, (0, 3))})
    h, w = 9, 10
    O = canvas(0, (h, w))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj_2, (h - 4, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj_8, (h - 6, 6)))
  else: # val == 2
    obj_8 = normalize({(8, (0, 0)), (8, (0, 1)), (8, (1, 0)), (8, (1, 1))})
    obj_2 = normalize({(2, (0, 0)), (2, (0, 1)), (2, (0, 2)), (2, (1, 0)), (2, (1, 1)), (2, (1, 2)), (2, (2, 0)), (2, (2, 1)), (2, (2, 2)), (2, (3, 0)), (2, (3, 1)), (2, (3, 2)), (2, (2, 3))})
    h, w = 11, 10
    O = canvas(0, (h, w))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj_8, (h - 6, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj_2, (h - 5, 2)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Input:** Get the digit from the input grid.
2. **Define Objects:** Define the base patterns for '2' and '8' as objects using coordinates relative to their upper-left corner.
3. **Conditional Placement:** Based on the input digit:
   - Create a canvas with calculated dimensions. 
   - Shift and paint the predefined objects onto the canvas at specific locations.

**Program Version 3 (using loops and offsets):** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  val = first(first(I)) if I else 0
  h, w = 14, 9  # Default
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))

  if val == 0:
    for i in range(2):
      for j in range(3):
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(h-2+i, 1+j)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(h-2,4), (h-1, 4)}))
    for i in range(2):
      for j in range(2):
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(h-4+i, 3+j)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(h-2, 7), (h-2, 8)}))
  elif val == 8: 
    h, w = 9, 10
    O = canvas(0, (h, w))
    for i in range(2):
      for j in range(3):
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(h-4+i, 4+j)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(h-1, 3), (h-1, 4), (h-1, 5)}))
    for i in range(2):
      for j in range(2):
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(h-6+i, 6+j)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(h-3, 8), (h-3, 9)}))
  elif val == 2:
    h, w = 11, 10
    O = canvas(0, (h, w))
    for i in range(2):
      for j in range(2):
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(h-6+i, 3+j)}))
    for i in range(4):
      for j in range(3):
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(h-5+i, 2+j)})) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(h-4, 6)}))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Input:** Get the digit from the input.
2. **Canvas and Loops:** 
    - Create a canvas with calculated dimensions based on the input.
    - Use nested loops to iterate over rows (i) and columns (j) of the patterns within the grid.
3. **Conditional Painting:** Based on the input digit, paint '2' and '8'  at calculated offsets from the loop indices to form the patterns. 

**Program Version 4 (combining object and loop approaches):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  val = first(first(I)) if I else 0
  h, w = 14, 9  # Default dimensions
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))

  if val == 0:
    obj_2 = normalize({(2, (0, 0)), (2, (0, 1)), (2, (0, 2))})
    obj_8 = normalize({(8, (0, 0)), (8, (0, 1))})
    for i in range(2): 
      O = paint(O, shift(obj_2, (h - 2 + i, 1))) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(h-2,4), (h-1, 4)}))
    for i in range(2):
      O = paint(O, shift(obj_8, (h - 4 + i, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj_8, (h - 2, 7)))
  elif val == 8:
    h, w = 9, 10
    O = canvas(0, (h, w))
    obj_2 = normalize({(2, (0, 0)), (2, (0, 1)), (2, (0, 2))})
    obj_8 = normalize({(8, (0, 0)), (8, (0, 1))})
    for i in range(2):
      O = paint(O, shift(obj_2, (h - 4 + i, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj_2, (h - 1, 3))) 
    for i in range(2):
      O = paint(O, shift(obj_8, (h - 6 + i, 6)))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj_8, (h - 3, 8)))
  else: # val == 2
    h, w = 11, 10
    O = canvas(0, (h, w))
    obj_8 = normalize({(8, (0, 0)), (8, (0, 1))})
    obj_2 = normalize({(2, (0, 0)), (2, (0, 1)), (2, (0, 2))})
    for i in range(2):
      O = paint(O, shift(obj_8, (h - 6 + i, 3)))
    for i in range(4):
      O = paint(O, shift(obj_2, (h - 5 + i, 2))) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(h-4, 6)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **Combined Approach:** This version combines the efficiency of loops with the clarity of object-based pattern definition.
- **Simplified Patterns:** Define smaller base objects for '2' and '8'.
- **Loop and Shift:**  Use loops to repeat and shift these base objects to create the final patterns.

**Program Version 5 (functional approach with higher-order functions):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  val = first(first(I)) if I else 0

  def paint_pattern(O, pattern, start):
    return paint(O, recolor(pattern[0], frozenset((i + start[0], j + start[1]) for i, j in pattern[1])))

  if val == 0:
    h, w = 14, 9
    O = canvas(0, (h, w))
    patterns = [
        (2, ((0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 3))),
        (8, ((0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 2), (0, 3)))
    ]
    start_positions = [(h - 2, 1), (h - 4, 3)]
    O = reduce(lambda O, x: paint_pattern(O, x[0], x[1]), zip(patterns, start_positions), O)
  elif val == 8:
    h, w = 9, 10
    O = canvas(0, (h, w))
    patterns = [
        (2, ((0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2))),
        (8, ((0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (0, 2), (0, 3)))
    ]
    start_positions = [(h - 4, 3), (h - 6, 6)]
    O = reduce(lambda O, x: paint_pattern(O, x[0], x[1]), zip(patterns, start_positions), O)
  else: # val == 2
    h, w = 11, 10
    O = canvas(0, (h, w))
    patterns = [
        (8, ((0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1))),
        (2, ((0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (2, 3)))
    ]
    start_positions = [(h - 6, 3), (h - 5, 2)]
    O = reduce(lambda O, x: paint_pattern(O, x[0], x[1]), zip(patterns, start_positions), O)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Functional Style:**  This version demonstrates a more functional programming style.
2. **Helper Function (paint_pattern):**  Takes the canvas, a pattern (value and relative indices), and a starting position. It paints the pattern at the specified location.
3. **Pattern and Position Lists:** Define patterns as tuples (value, list of indices) and their starting positions in lists.
4. **Reduce Function:** Use the `reduce` function to iteratively apply `paint_pattern` to the canvas, painting each pattern at its corresponding position. 

These programs provide a diverse set of solutions to achieve the desired transformation, each highlighting different aspects of the DSL and programming paradigms.
