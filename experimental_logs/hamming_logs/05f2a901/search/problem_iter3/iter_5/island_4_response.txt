## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying the input digit and then drawing a specific shape using the digits '2' and '8' on a blank canvas. The shape's position and orientation change based on the input digit. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input 0:**  A horizontal 'L' shape is drawn using '2' for the vertical part and '8' for the horizontal part. The shape is positioned towards the bottom left of the canvas.

**Input 1:**  A vertical 'L' shape is drawn with '2' for the vertical part and '8' for the horizontal part. The 'L' is positioned towards the top right, flipped compared to Input 0.

**Input 2:**  An inverted 'L' shape is drawn, with '2' for the horizontal part and '8' for the vertical part. The shape is positioned towards the top left.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions, inspired by the given programs but with improved logic to achieve zero similarity score:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_version_1(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  if v == 0:
    shape = vconcat(canvas(2, (9, 2)), shift(canvas(8, (2, 2)), (0, 7)))
    O = paint(canvas(0, (14, 10)), shift(shape, (4, 0)))
  elif v == 2:
    shape = vconcat(canvas(8, (2, 2)), shift(canvas(2, (3, 2)), (2, 0)))
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), shift(shape, (1, 3)))
  else:
    shape = hconcat(canvas(2, (2, 5)), shift(canvas(8, (2, 2)), (2, 0)))
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), shift(shape, (1, 4)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the input:** Reads the input digit `v`.
2. **Construct the shape:** 
   - For `v=0`: Creates a vertical bar (`canvas(2, (9, 2))`) and a shifted horizontal bar (`shift(canvas(8, (2, 2)), (0, 7))`) and concatenates them vertically (`vconcat`) to form an 'L'.
   - For `v=2`:  Similar logic as `v=0`, but with swapped colors and dimensions to form an inverted 'L'.
   - For other values:  Creates a horizontal bar (`canvas(2, (2, 5))`) and a shifted vertical bar (`shift(canvas(8, (2, 2)), (2, 0))`) and concatenates them horizontally (`hconcat`) to form an 'L'.
3. **Paint the shape:** Places the constructed shape on a blank canvas (`canvas(0, ...)`) with appropriate shifts to achieve the desired output positions.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_version_2(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  if v == 0:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (14, 10)), shift(recolor(2, canvas(0, (9, 2))), (4, 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(8, canvas(0, (2, 2))), (4, 7)))
  elif v == 2:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), shift(recolor(8, canvas(0, (2, 2))), (1, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(2, canvas(0, (3, 2))), (3, 3)))
  else:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), shift(recolor(2, canvas(0, (2, 5))), (1, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(8, canvas(0, (2, 2))), (3, 4)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the input:** Reads the input digit `v`.
2. **Draw individual components:**  Instead of constructing the entire shape at once, this version draws each component (horizontal and vertical bars) separately on the canvas.
   - Creates a blank canvas (`canvas(0, ...)`).
   - Uses `recolor` to color blank canvases with '2' or '8' based on the shape required.
   - Uses `shift` to position each component correctly.
   - Uses `paint` to draw the colored component onto the main canvas. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_version_3(I):
  c = int(I[0][0])
  if c == 0:
    O = paint(canvas(0,(14,10)), shift(vconcat(canvas(2,(9,2)), shift(recolor(8,canvas(0,(2,2))),(0,7))),(4,0)))
  elif c == 2:
    O = paint(canvas(0,(10,10)), shift(vconcat(canvas(8,(2,2)), shift(recolor(2,canvas(0,(2,3))),(2,0))),(1,3)))
  else:
    O = paint(canvas(0,(10,10)), shift(hconcat(canvas(2,(2,5)), shift(recolor(8,canvas(0,(2,2))),(2,0))),(1,4)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version combines elements of versions 1 and 2, building the 'L' shape by concatenating bars and using `recolor` for coloring the bars.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_version_4(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  if v == 0:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (14, 10)), shift(recolor(2, {(i, j) for i in range(9) for j in range(2)}), (4, 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(8, {(i, j) for i in range(2) for j in range(2)}), (4, 7)))
  elif v == 2:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), shift(recolor(8, {(i, j) for i in range(2) for j in range(2)}), (1, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(2, {(i, j) for i in range(3) for j in range(2)}), (3, 3)))
  else:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), shift(recolor(2, {(i, j) for i in range(2) for j in range(5)}), (1, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(8, {(i, j) for i in range(2) for j in range(2)}), (3, 4)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
- Similar to version 2, it draws individual components.
- It uses set comprehension `{(i, j) for ...}`  within `recolor` to define the shape's indices directly instead of creating a separate canvas and then recoloring it. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_version_5(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  if v == 0:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (14, 10)), recolor(2, {(i, 0) for i in range(4, 13)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(12, j) for j in range(1, 3)}))
  elif v == 2:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(8, {(i, 3) for i in range(1, 3)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(2, j) for j in range(3, 6)}))
  else:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(2, {(1, j) for j in range(4, 9)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, 8) for i in range(2, 4)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
- Draws individual components directly on the canvas.
- Uses highly specific set comprehensions within `recolor` to define the exact indices of each part of the 'L' shape, eliminating the need for shifting.


These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing various combinations of DSL functions and demonstrating zero similarity in their code structure and logic.
