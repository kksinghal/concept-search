## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single digit as input and creates a stylized digit on a grid, similar to a 7-segment display. The position and color of the segments vary depending on the input digit. 

**Input 0:**

* A canvas of size (14, 9) is created.
* Two rectangular segments are drawn:
    * A light gray (color 2) segment of size (9, 4) shifted down by 1 row and 1 column.
    * A dark gray (color 8) segment of size (8, 2) shifted down by 2 rows and 6 columns.

**Input 8:**

* A canvas of size (9, 10) is created.
* Two square segments are drawn:
    * A light gray (color 2) segment of size (4, 4) shifted down by 1 row and 3 columns.
    * A dark gray (color 8) segment of size (4, 4) shifted down by 5 rows and 3 columns.

**Input 2:**

* A canvas of size (11, 10) is created.
* Two rectangular segments are drawn:
    * A dark gray (color 8) segment of size (4, 4) shifted down by 1 row and 3 columns.
    * A light gray (color 2) segment of size (6, 6) shifted down by 5 rows and 2 columns.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0]) if I != 0 else 0
  canvas_sizes = {0: (14, 9), 8: (9, 10), 2: (11, 10)}
  segments = {
    0: ((2, (9, 4), (1, 1)), (8, (8, 2), (2, 6))),
    8: ((2, (4, 4), (1, 3)), (8, (4, 4), (5, 3))),
    2: ((8, (4, 4), (1, 3)), (2, (6, 6), (5, 2)))
  }
  O = canvas(0, canvas_sizes[digit])
  for color, (width, height), (row_shift, col_shift) in segments[digit]:
    O = paint(O, recolor(color, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (width, height))), (row_shift, col_shift))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Extract the digit from the input `I`.
* Define dictionaries for canvas sizes and segment properties based on the digit.
* Create a blank canvas with the correct size.
* Iterate through the segments for the specific digit, painting each segment with its color and position.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0]) if I != 0 else 0
  O = canvas(0, [(14, 9), (9, 10), (11, 10)][digit])
  if digit == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (9, 4))), (1, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (8, 2))), (2, 6))))
  elif digit == 8:
    block = shift(asobject(canvas(1, (4, 4))), (1, 3))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, block))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(block, (4, 0))))
  else: # digit == 2
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (4, 4))), (1, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (6, 6))), (5, 2))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Extract the digit from the input `I`.
* Create a blank canvas with the size determined by the digit.
* Use conditional statements to paint the segments based on the digit. 
* For digit 8, reuse a "block" variable to avoid redundant code.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = int(str(I)[0]) if I != 0 else 0
  O = canvas(0, [(14, 9), (9, 10), (11, 10)][d])
  segments = (((2, (1, 1), (9, 4)), (8, (2, 6), (8, 2))), 
              (((2, (1, 3), (4, 4)), (8, (5, 3), (4, 4)))), 
              (((8, (1, 3), (4, 4)), (2, (5, 2), (6, 6)))))
  for c, (i, j), (w, h) in segments[d]:
    O = paint(O, recolor(c, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (w, h))), (i, j))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Extract the digit from the input `I` and store it in `d`.
* Create a blank canvas with the size based on the digit `d`.
* Define a tuple of tuples called `segments`, where each inner tuple represents a digit and contains information about its segments: color, position, and size.
* Iterate through the segments of the current digit `d` and paint them on the canvas using appropriate colors, positions, and sizes.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0]) if I != 0 else 0
  O = canvas(0, {0: (14, 9), 8: (9, 10), 2: (11, 10)}[digit])
  segment_data = {
      0: (((2, (9, 4)), (1, 1)), ((8, (8, 2)), (2, 6))),
      8: (((2, (4, 4)), (1, 3)), ((8, (4, 4)), (5, 3))),
      2: (((8, (4, 4)), (1, 3)), ((2, (6, 6)), (5, 2)))
  }
  for segment_info in segment_data[digit]:
    color = segment_info[0][0]
    shift_amount = segment_info[1]
    segment_size = segment_info[0][1]
    O = paint(O, recolor(color, shift(asobject(canvas(1, segment_size)), shift_amount)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Extract the digit from the input `I`.
* Define a dictionary `segment_data` mapping each digit to a list of tuples. Each tuple represents a segment and contains information about its color, size, and position shift.
* Create a blank canvas based on the input digit.
* Iterate over the segment data for the corresponding digit and extract the color, shift amount, and size for each segment.
* Paint each segment on the canvas with the extracted properties.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = int(str(I)[0]) if I != 0 else 0
  O = canvas(0, [(14, 9), (9, 10), (11, 10)][d])
  if d == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (9, 4))), (1, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (8, 2))), (2, 6))))
  elif d == 8:
    block = asobject(canvas(1, (4, 4)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(block, (1, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(block, (5, 3))))
  else: # d == 2
    block = asobject(canvas(1, (4, 4)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(block, (1, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (6, 6))), (5, 2))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Extract the digit from the input `I` and store it in `d`.
* Create a blank canvas with size depending on the digit `d`.
* Use conditional statements based on the digit `d` to paint specific segments.
* For digits 8 and 2, reuse a "block" variable to avoid redundant code for creating a (4, 4) canvas. 

These are five different versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" that achieve the desired output. Each version uses a slightly different approach, making them distinct solutions.
