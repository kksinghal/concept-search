## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve creating a shape composed of '2's and '8's on a canvas of '0's, with the shape's position and orientation varying based on the input digit. 

* **Input 0:** An 'L' shape formed by '2's and a square of '8's are placed in the bottom half of the canvas. The 'L' is oriented towards the bottom-right corner.
* **Input 8:** The same shape from Input 0 is mirrored horizontally and placed towards the top-left corner of the canvas.
* **Input 2:** The same shape from Input 0 is rotated 90 degrees clockwise and placed slightly higher than in Input 0.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions, each inspired by the provided Program_A and Program_B, but using different DSL function combinations to achieve the transformation.

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  L_shape = frozenset({(2, (0, 0)), (2, (1, 0)), (2, (2, 0)), (2, (2, 1))})
  square_shape = frozenset({(8, (0, 0)), (8, (0, 1)), (8, (1, 0)), (8, (1, 1))})
  if v == 0:
    O = paint(O, shift(L_shape, (8, 1)))
    O = paint(O, shift(square_shape, (10, 3)))
  elif v == 8:
    O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(L_shape), (1, 8)))
    O = paint(O, shift(square_shape, (1, 6)))
  else:
    O = paint(O, shift(rot90(L_shape), (3, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(square_shape, (1, 4)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Defines the 'L' and square shapes using `frozenset` and `canvas`.
2. Uses conditional branching based on the input digit `v`.
3. Applies `shift` to position the shapes. 
4. Utilizes `hmirror` for horizontal mirroring in the case of input '8'.
5. Employs `rot90` for rotation in the case of input '2'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  shape_parts = [(2, (1, 3)), (2, (3, 1)), (8, (2, 2))]
  positions = [(8, 1, 9, 1, 10, 3), (1, 8, 1, 7, 3, 6), (3, 4, 1, 5, 1, 4)]
  for (val, dims), (i, j) in zip(shape_parts, positions[v]):
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(val, canvas(0, dims)), (i, j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Defines shape parts and their corresponding positions for each input digit.
2. Iterates through the `shape_parts` and corresponding positions based on input `v`.
3. Dynamically creates each shape part using `canvas` and `recolor`.
4. Positions each part using `shift`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  hline = lambda pos: paint(O, shift(recolor(2, canvas(0, (1, 3))), (pos[0], pos[1])))
  vline = lambda pos: paint(O, shift(recolor(2, canvas(0, (3, 1))), (pos[0], pos[1])))
  eights = lambda pos: paint(O, shift(recolor(8, canvas(0, (2, 2))), (pos[0], pos[1])))
  if v == 0:
    return eights((10, 3))(vline((8, 1))(hline((8, 1))))
  elif v == 8:
    return eights((3, 6))(vline((1, 8))(hline((1, 8))))
  else:
    return eights((1, 4))(vline((3, 4))(hline((1, 4)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. Defines functions for generating horizontal lines, vertical lines, and squares of '8's.
2. Uses function composition to paint these elements onto the canvas based on the input digit.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  L_shape = lambda c: {(c, (0, 0)), (c, (1, 0)), (c, (2, 0)), (c, (2, 1))}
  square_shape = lambda c: {(c, (0, 0)), (c, (0, 1)), (c, (1, 0)), (c, (1, 1))}
  if v == 0:
    O = paint(O, shift(L_shape(2), (8, 1)))
    O = paint(O, shift(square_shape(8), (10, 3)))
  elif v == 8:
    O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(L_shape(2)), (1, 8)))
    O = paint(O, shift(square_shape(8), (1, 6)))
  else:
    O = paint(O, shift(rot90(L_shape(2)), (3, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(square_shape(8), (1, 4)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Defines functions for generating 'L' and square shapes with a specified color.
2. Calls these functions with appropriate colors and positions based on the input digit.
3. Applies `shift`, `hmirror`, and `rot90` for positioning and transformations.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  base_shape = frozenset({(2, (0, 0)), (2, (1, 0)), (2, (2, 0)), (2, (2, 1)), (8, (3, 2)), (8, (3, 3)), (8, (4, 2)), (8, (4, 3))})
  if v == 0:
    O = paint(O, shift(base_shape, (8, 1)))
  elif v == 8:
    O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(base_shape), (1, 6)))
  else:
    O = paint(O, shift(rot90(base_shape), (1, 2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Defines the base combined shape of 'L' and square.
2. Applies transformations (`shift`, `hmirror`, `rot90`) directly on the base shape based on input digit.
3. Paints the transformed shape onto the canvas. 

These five program versions showcase diverse ways to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL. They demonstrate flexibility in utilizing different function combinations, highlighting the expressive power of the DSL.
