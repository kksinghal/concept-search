## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be encoding the input digit into a specific pattern on the output grid. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input 0:** A single cell with value '0'.

**Output 0:** A pattern resembling the digit '2' formed using '2's and an '8' formed using two '8's are placed on a canvas of '0's.

**Input 1:** A single cell with value '8'.

**Output 1:**  A horizontally flipped pattern resembling the digit '2' formed using '2's and an '8' formed using two '8's are placed on a canvas of '0's.

**Input 2:** A single cell with value '0'.

**Output 2:**  A vertically flipped pattern resembling the digit '2' formed using '2's and an '8' formed using two '8's are placed on a canvas of '0's.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = index(I, ORIGIN)
  grid = canvas(ZERO, (14, 10))
  two_pattern = {(8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (9, 0), (9, 2), (10, 1)}
  eight_pattern = {(10, 4), (11, 4), (10, 5), (11, 5)}
  if v == 0:
    grid = paint(grid, recolor(TWO, two_pattern))
    grid = paint(grid, recolor(EIGHT, eight_pattern))
  elif v == 8:
    grid = paint(grid, recolor(TWO, hmirror(two_pattern)))
    grid = paint(grid, recolor(EIGHT, hmirror(eight_pattern)))
  else:
    grid = paint(grid, recolor(TWO, vmirror(two_pattern)))
    grid = paint(grid, recolor(EIGHT, vmirror(eight_pattern)))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize:** Create a blank canvas of '0's.
2. **Define Patterns:**  Define the '2' and '8' patterns using indices.
3. **Conditional Painting:**
    - If input is '0', paint the patterns directly.
    - If input is '8', horizontally mirror the patterns before painting.
    - Otherwise, vertically mirror the patterns before painting.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = index(I, ORIGIN)
  grid = canvas(ZERO, (14, 10))
  base_two = {(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1)}
  base_eight = {(2, 4), (3, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5)}
  transform = {0: identity, 8: hmirror, 1: vmirror}[v]
  grid = paint(grid, recolor(TWO, transform(base_two)))
  grid = paint(grid, recolor(EIGHT, transform(base_eight)))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize:**  Create a blank canvas.
2. **Define Base Patterns:** Define base patterns for '2' and '8'.
3. **Transformation Mapping:** Use a dictionary to map input values to transformation functions (identity, hmirror, vmirror).
4. **Apply Transformation:** Apply the mapped transformation to the base patterns before painting.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = index(I, ORIGIN)
  grid = canvas(ZERO, (14, 10))
  two_obj = asobject( ((0,2,2,0), (2,0,2,0), (0,2,0,0)) )
  eight_obj = asobject( ((0,8,8,0), (0,8,8,0)) )
  transform = {0: identity, 8: hmirror, 1: vmirror}[v]
  grid = paint(grid, shift(recolor(TWO, transform(toindices(two_obj))), (8,0)))
  grid = paint(grid, shift(recolor(EIGHT, transform(toindices(eight_obj))), (10,3)))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize:**  Create a blank canvas.
2. **Define Objects:**  Define '2' and '8' as objects using nested tuples.
3. **Transformation Mapping:** Same as in Version 2.
4. **Apply Transformation and Shift:** Apply the mapped transformation to object indices, convert them to objects, and shift them to their respective positions on the canvas before painting.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = index(I, ORIGIN)
  grid = canvas(ZERO, (14, 10))
  two_coords = [(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (0,0), (0,2), (-1,1)]
  eight_coords = [(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1)]
  transform = {0: lambda x: x, 8: lambda x: (-x[0],x[1]), 1: lambda x: (x[0],-x[1])}[v]
  transformed_two = [transform(coord) for coord in two_coords]
  transformed_eight = [transform(coord) for coord in eight_coords]
  for i, j in transformed_two:
    grid = fill(grid, TWO, {(i+9, j+1)})
  for i, j in transformed_eight:
    grid = fill(grid, EIGHT, {(i+10, j+4)})
  return grid 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize:**  Create a blank canvas.
2. **Define Coordinates:** Define relative coordinates for '2' and '8' patterns.
3. **Transformation Mapping:**  Map input values to lambda functions performing coordinate transformations.
4. **Apply Transformation and Fill:**  Apply the mapped transformation to each coordinate, then fill the corresponding cell on the canvas with '2' or '8'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = index(I, ORIGIN)
  c = canvas(ZERO, (14, 10))
  if v == 0:
    c = fill(c, TWO, {(8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (9, 0), (9, 2), (10, 1)})
    c = fill(c, EIGHT, {(10, 4), (11, 4), (10, 5), (11, 5)})
  elif v == 8:
    c = fill(c, TWO, {(8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (9, 9), (9, 7), (10, 8)})
    c = fill(c, EIGHT, {(10, 5), (11, 5), (10, 6), (11, 6)})
  else:
    c = fill(c, TWO, {(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 1)})
    c = fill(c, EIGHT, {(3, 4), (4, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)})
  return c
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize:** Create a blank canvas.
2. **Hardcoded Patterns:**  Directly hardcode the transformed patterns for each input value and paint them onto the canvas.

These five program versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and diversity possible within the provided DSL.
