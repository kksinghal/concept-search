## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single-digit input grid and creates an output grid featuring a stylized representation of that digit. Here's a breakdown:

**Input 0:**

- **Output Grid Size:** 14x9
- **Digit Representation:** 
    - '2': Forms a 'C' shape open to the right.
    - '8': Two horizontally aligned squares.

**Input 8:**

- **Output Grid Size:** 10x10
-  **Digit Representation:** 
    - '2':  Forms a 'C' shape open to the right.
    - '8': Two horizontally aligned squares.

**Input 2:**

- **Output Grid Size:** 10x10
-  **Digit Representation:** 
    - '2':  Forms a 'C' shape open to the right.
    - '8': Two horizontally aligned squares.

**Common Features:**

- The most frequent digit in the input grid determines the output grid size and the stylized digit representations.
- The output grid is always filled with '0' as background.
- The represented digits are always '2' and '8', regardless of the input digit. Their positions and shapes vary based on the input.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions:

**Version 1: Using `objects` and conditional transformations**

```python
def fdhahacacjiaeeedjdacejfjbaihbdgb(I):
  v = mostcommon(I)
  O = canvas(0, (14, 9) if v == 0 else (10, 10))
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  if v == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(((2,2,2),(2,0,2),(0,2,0))), (9, 2))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(((8,8),(8,8))), (11, 3))))
  elif v == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(((2,2,2),(2,0,0))), (3, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(((8,8),(8,8))), (5, 4))))
  elif v == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(((8,8),(8,8))), (2, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(((2,2,2),(2,0,0))), (5, 2))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Dominant Digit and Initialize:** Determine the most frequent digit (`v`) using `mostcommon(I)`. Set output grid (`O`) size based on `v`.
2. **Extract Objects:** Extract non-background objects from the input using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
3. **Conditional Transformations:** Based on `v`, apply specific transformations:
    -  Recolor and shift predefined shapes for '2' and '8' to their designated positions and paint them onto the output grid.

**Version 2: Data-driven approach with dictionaries**

```python
def fdhahacacjiaeeedjdacejfjbaihbdgb(I):
  v = mostcommon(I)
  O = canvas(0, (14, 9) if v == 0 else (10, 10))
  shapes = {
      0: {2: ((2,2,2),(2,0,2),(0,2,0)), 8: ((8,8),(8,8))},
      8: {2: ((2,2,2),(2,0,0)), 8: ((8,8),(8,8))},
      2: {8: ((8,8),(8,8)), 2: ((2,2,2),(2,0,0))}
  }
  positions = {
      0: {2: (9, 2), 8: (11, 3)},
      8: {2: (3, 3), 8: (5, 4)},
      2: {8: (2, 3), 2: (5, 2)}
  }
  for digit, shape in shapes[v].items():
      O = paint(O, recolor(digit, shift(asobject(shape), positions[v][digit])))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Data Structures:** Define dictionaries (`shapes` and `positions`) storing shapes and positions of '2' and '8' for each input digit.
3. **Iterative Painting:** Iterate through the `shapes` dictionary for the identified input digit (`v`). For each digit ('2' and '8'), recolor the predefined shape, shift it to the corresponding position from the `positions` dictionary, and paint it onto the output grid.

**Version 3: Leveraging loops for shape generation**

```python
def fdhahacacjiaeeedjdacejfjbaihbdgb(I):
  v = mostcommon(I)
  O = canvas(0, (14, 9) if v == 0 else (10, 10))
  if v == 0:
    for i in range(3):
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(9, 2 + i), (10, 2 + i)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(10, 4), (11, 4)}))
    for i in range(2):
      for j in range(2):
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(11 + i, 3 + j)}))
  elif v == 8:
    for i in range(3):
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(3, 3 + i), (4, 3 + i)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(4, 5)}))
    for i in range(2):
      for j in range(2):
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(5 + i, 4 + j)}))
  elif v == 2:
    for i in range(2):
      for j in range(2):
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(2 + i, 3 + j)}))
    for i in range(3):
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(5, 2 + i), (6, 2 + i)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(7, 2), (8, 2)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Conditional Shape Generation:** Use nested loops and conditional statements to generate and paint individual cells of '2' and '8' onto the output grid based on the identified input digit (`v`).

**Version 4: Combining predefined shapes with loops**

```python
def fdhahacacjiaeeedjdacejfjbaihbdgb(I):
  v = mostcommon(I)
  O = canvas(0, (14, 9) if v == 0 else (10, 10))
  shapes = {
      0: {2: ((2,2,0),(2,0,0),(0,2,0)), 8: ((8,8),(8,8))},
      8: {2: ((2,2,2),(2,0,0)), 8: ((8,8),(8,8))},
      2: {8: ((8,8),(8,8)), 2: ((2,2,0),(2,0,0))}
  }
  positions = {
      0: {2: (9, 2), 8: (11, 3)},
      8: {2: (3, 3), 8: (5, 4)},
      2: {8: (2, 3), 2: (5, 2)}
  }
  for digit, shape in shapes[v].items():
    O = paint(O, recolor(digit, shift(asobject(shape), positions[v][digit])))
    if digit == 2 and (v == 0 or v == 2):
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift({(2, 0)}, positions[v][digit])))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization and Data Structures:** Similar to Version 2 but with slightly modified predefined shapes in the `shapes` dictionary.
2. **Iterative Painting and Conditional Addition:** Similar to Version 2, iteratively paint the shapes. However, if the current digit is '2' and the input is either '0' or '2', add an extra cell to complete the 'C' shape.

**Version 5:  Functional approach with `apply`**

```python
def fdhahacacjiaeeedjdacejfjbaihbdgb(I):
  v = mostcommon(I)
  O = canvas(0, (14, 9) if v == 0 else (10, 10))
  shapes = {
      0: {2: lambda x: shift(asobject(((2,2,2),(2,0,2),(0,2,0))), (9, 2)), 8: lambda x: shift(asobject(((8,8),(8,8))), (11, 3))},
      8: {2: lambda x: shift(asobject(((2,2,2),(2,0,0))), (3, 3)), 8: lambda x: shift(asobject(((8,8),(8,8))), (5, 4))},
      2: {8: lambda x: shift(asobject(((8,8),(8,8))), (2, 3)), 2: lambda x: shift(asobject(((2,2,2),(2,0,0))), (5, 2))}
  }
  for digit, shape_func in shapes[v].items():
      O = paint(O, recolor(digit, shape_func(None)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Function-based Shapes:** Instead of storing shapes directly, the `shapes` dictionary now stores functions that return the shifted object representation of the shape.
3. **Apply and Paint:** Iterate through `shapes` and for each digit, apply the stored function using `shape_func(None)` (since the functions don't use any input).  Then, recolor the resulting object and paint it onto the output grid.

These five versions offer diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL. They demonstrate different coding styles and leverage various DSL functions to showcase the flexibility and expressive power of the language.
