## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to take an input digit and create a specific pattern on the output grid using three colors: 0 (background), the input digit, and a secondary digit (2 or 8 depending on the input). Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input 0 - Output 0:**

* A 2x4 rectangle of '2' is placed at the bottom center.
* A 2x2 square of '8' is placed one row above the '2' rectangle, slightly shifted to the right.
* The rest of the grid is filled with '0'.

**Input 8 - Output 1:**

* A 2x2 square of '2' is placed slightly off-center towards the top right.
* A 2x2 square of '8' is placed below the '2' square, slightly shifted to the right.
* The rest of the grid is filled with '0'.

**Input 2 - Output 2:**

* A 2x2 square of '8' is placed near the top center.
* A 3x4 rectangle of '2' is placed below the '8' square, slightly shifted to the left.
* The rest of the grid is filled with '0'.

It appears there's a predefined pattern associated with each input digit, defining the shape and position of the colored blocks.

## Program Versions & Explanations:

Due to the predefined nature of the transformation, a rule-based approach might be more suitable than directly adapting the provided programs. Below are five distinct program versions utilizing this approach:

### Program Version 1: Data-Driven Approach

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    digit_patterns = {
        0: {
            'size': (14, 10),
            'blocks': [
                (2, (2, 4), (9, 1)),  # color, (height, width), (start_row, start_col)
                (8, (2, 2), (7, 4))
            ]
        },
        8: {
            'size': (10, 10),
            'blocks': [
                (2, (2, 2), (1, 4)),
                (8, (2, 2), (3, 6))
            ]
        },
        2: {
            'size': (15, 10),
            'blocks': [
                (8, (2, 2), (1, 3)),
                (2, (3, 4), (3, 1))
            ]
        }
    }

    input_digit = int(first(str(I))) if I != 0 else 0
    pattern = digit_patterns[input_digit]

    O = canvas(0, pattern['size'])
    for color, (block_height, block_width), (start_row, start_col) in pattern['blocks']:
        O = paint(O, recolor(color, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (block_height, block_width))), (start_row, start_col))))

    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version stores pattern information (block sizes and positions) for each input digit in a dictionary.
* It retrieves the appropriate pattern based on the input digit.
* It creates an empty canvas of the correct size.
* It iterates through the blocks defined in the pattern, creates them with the specified color, and places them on the canvas using `shift` and `paint`.

### Program Version 2: Function Composition

**Code:**

```python
def create_block(color, size, shift):
  return recolor(color, shift(asobject(canvas(1, size)), shift))

def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    digit_patterns = {
        0: lambda O: paint(paint(O, create_block(2, (2, 4), (9, 1))), create_block(8, (2, 2), (7, 4))),
        8: lambda O: paint(paint(O, create_block(2, (2, 2), (1, 4))), create_block(8, (2, 2), (3, 6))),
        2: lambda O: paint(paint(O, create_block(8, (2, 2), (1, 3))), create_block(2, (3, 4), (3, 1)))
    }

    input_digit = int(first(str(I))) if I != 0 else 0
    O = canvas(0, digit_patterns[input_digit].__code__.co_consts[2])
    return digit_patterns[input_digit](O)
```

**Explanation:**

* This version defines a helper function `create_block` to simplify block creation.
* It uses lambda functions within the `digit_patterns` dictionary to represent the block placement logic for each digit.
* It retrieves the appropriate lambda function based on the input digit and applies it to an empty canvas of the correct size.

### Program Version 3: Conditional Logic

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    input_digit = int(first(str(I))) if I != 0 else 0

    if input_digit == 0:
        O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (2, 4))), (9, 1))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (2, 2))), (7, 4))))
    elif input_digit == 8:
        O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (2, 2))), (1, 4))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (2, 2))), (3, 6))))
    else:  # input_digit == 2
        O = canvas(0, (15, 10))
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (2, 2))), (1, 3))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (3, 4))), (3, 1))))

    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version uses conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to apply the specific block placement logic for each input digit.
* It creates an empty canvas of the correct size within each conditional branch.
* It directly uses `recolor`, `shift`, and `paint` to create and place the blocks on the canvas.

### Program Version 4: Pattern Encoding

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(first(str(I))) if I != 0 else 0
  patterns = {
    0: ((14, 10), ((2, (9, 1), (2, 4)), (8, (7, 4), (2, 2)))),
    8: ((10, 10), ((2, (1, 4), (2, 2)), (8, (3, 6), (2, 2)))),
    2: ((15, 10), ((8, (1, 3), (2, 2)), (2, (3, 1), (3, 4))))
  }
  canvas_size, blocks = patterns[digit]
  O = canvas(0, canvas_size)
  for color, (i, j), (h, w) in blocks:
    O = paint(O, recolor(color, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (h, w))), (i, j))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version encodes the entire output pattern, including canvas size and block details, within a dictionary.
* Each key represents the input digit, and the value is a tuple containing canvas size and a tuple of block information (color, position, size).
* It directly unpacks and utilizes the pattern information to construct the output grid using `canvas`, `recolor`, `shift`, and `paint`.

### Program Version 5: Modular Design

**Code:**

```python
def draw_block(O, color, position, size):
  return paint(O, recolor(color, shift(asobject(canvas(1, size)), position)))

def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    input_digit = int(first(str(I))) if I != 0 else 0

    if input_digit == 0:
        O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
        O = draw_block(O, 2, (9, 1), (2, 4))
        O = draw_block(O, 8, (7, 4), (2, 2))
    elif input_digit == 8:
        O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
        O = draw_block(O, 2, (1, 4), (2, 2))
        O = draw_block(O, 8, (3, 6), (2, 2))
    else:  # input_digit == 2
        O = canvas(0, (15, 10))
        O = draw_block(O, 8, (1, 3), (2, 2))
        O = draw_block(O, 2, (3, 1), (3, 4))

    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version emphasizes code reusability by introducing the `draw_block` function, which handles the creation and placement of a single block.
* It uses conditional statements to determine the appropriate block sequence for each input digit.
* It repeatedly calls `draw_block` with the correct parameters to construct the output grid.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation while using a diverse set of DSL functions and logical structures. Each version aims to provide a clear and concise solution with varying levels of code complexity and readability.
