## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single-cell input grid containing either a '0', '2', or '8' and generates a larger output grid with a distinct shape formed by '2's and '8's on a background of '0's. The position and shape of the output depend on the value in the input grid.

**Input 0 (value '0'):**  A "staircase" shape is generated at the bottom center of the grid, consisting of a '2' base with an '8' step on top.

**Input 1 (value '2'):** An "L" shape is generated slightly off-center, with the '2's forming the vertical part and the '8's forming the horizontal part.

**Input 2 (value '8'):** An inverted "L" shape is generated at the top center of the grid, with the '8's forming the vertical part and the '2's forming the horizontal part. 


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  if d == 0:
    base = canvas(2, (9, 2)) 
    step = shift(recolor(8, canvas(2, (2, 2))), (0, 3))
    shape = vconcat(base, step)
    O = paint(canvas(0, (14, 10)), shift(shape, (4, 0)))
  elif d == 2:
    vertical = canvas(2, (5, 2))
    horizontal = shift(recolor(8, canvas(2, (2, 2))), (2, 2)) 
    shape = combine(vertical, horizontal)
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), shift(shape, (1, 3)))
  else: 
    vertical = canvas(8, (4, 2))
    horizontal = shift(recolor(2, canvas(2, (3, 2))), (2, 0))
    shape = combine(vertical, horizontal)
    O = paint(canvas(0, (15, 10)), shift(shape, (1, 2)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

- **Extracts** the input value 'd' from the input grid.
- **Uses conditional statements** to generate different shapes based on 'd'.
- **Constructs** individual components of the shape using `canvas` and `recolor`.
- **Positions** components relative to each other using `shift` and combines them using `vconcat`, `hconcat`, or `combine`.
- **Paints** the final shape onto an empty canvas of the correct size.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  s = shape(I)
  if v == 0:
    O = paint(canvas(0,(14,10)), shift(combine(canvas(2,(9,2)),shift(recolor(8,canvas(0, (2,2))), (0, 3))), (4, 0)))
  elif v == 2:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), shift(combine(canvas(2,(5,2)), shift(recolor(8, canvas(2, (2, 2))), (2, 2))), (1, 3)))
  else:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (15, 10)), shift(combine(canvas(8,(4,2)), shift(recolor(2, canvas(2, (3, 2))), (2, 0))), (1, 2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version focuses on **condensing the code** by nesting functions and reducing intermediate variables.
- It directly embeds the shape construction and positioning within the `paint` function for each case.
- While less readable, this approach showcases the flexibility of the DSL.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  val = int(I[0][0])
  if val == 0:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (14, 10)), shift(combine(recolor(2, canvas(0, (9, 2))), shift(recolor(8, canvas(0, (2, 2))), (0, 3))), (4, 0)))
  elif val == 2:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), shift(combine(recolor(2, canvas(0, (5, 2))), shift(recolor(8, canvas(0, (2, 2))), (2, 2))), (1, 3)))
  else:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (15, 10)), shift(combine(recolor(8, canvas(0, (4, 2))), shift(recolor(2, canvas(0, (3, 2))), (2, 0))), (1, 2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version further **optimizes for conciseness** by reusing the `recolor` function to create both the base shape and the '8' or '2' components within a single line.
- This demonstrates efficient use of the DSL's capabilities.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  if v == 0:
    s = vconcat(canvas(2, (9, 2)), shift(recolor(8, canvas(2, (2, 2))), (0, 3)))
    O = paint(canvas(0, (14, 10)), shift(s, (4, 0)))
  elif v == 2:
    s = combine(canvas(2, (5, 2)), shift(recolor(8, canvas(2, (2, 2))), (2, 2)))
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), shift(s, (1, 3)))
  else:
    s = combine(canvas(8, (4, 2)), shift(recolor(2, canvas(2, (3, 2))), (2, 0)))
    O = paint(canvas(0, (15, 10)), shift(s, (1, 2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version aims for a balance between readability and conciseness. 
- It uses a single variable 's' to store the constructed shape before painting it onto the canvas.
- This improves readability compared to deeply nested functions while maintaining a relatively compact code structure. 

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  val = int(I[0][0])
  if val == 0:
    shape = vconcat(canvas(2, (9,2)), shift(recolor(8, canvas(0, (2,2))), (0, 3)))
    canvas_size = (14, 10)
    offset = (4, 0)
  elif val == 2:
    shape = combine(canvas(2, (5, 2)), shift(recolor(8, canvas(2, (2, 2))), (2, 2)))
    canvas_size = (10, 10)
    offset = (1, 3)
  else:
    shape = combine(canvas(8, (4, 2)), shift(recolor(2, canvas(2, (3, 2))), (2, 0)))
    canvas_size = (15, 10)
    offset = (1, 2)
  O = paint(canvas(0, canvas_size), shift(shape, offset))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version focuses on **improving code structure and readability**. 
- It separates the shape construction and canvas parameters for each case, making the code easier to understand and modify.
- Using descriptive variable names further enhances readability.
