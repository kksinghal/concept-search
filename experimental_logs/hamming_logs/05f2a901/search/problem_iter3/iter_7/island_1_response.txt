## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to identify the input digit and then draws a specific shape related to that digit on the output grid. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Pair 0 (Input: 0):** 
* The output grid has a height of 14.
* A reversed 'L' shape formed by the digit '2' is placed near the bottom.
* A square shape formed by the digit '8' is placed above the 'L' shape, slightly shifted to the right.

**Pair 1 (Input: 8):**
* The output grid has a height of 9.
* A 'T' shape formed by the digit '2' is drawn. The 'T' shape is positioned relative to the input '8' with its top slightly above the '8'.

**Pair 2 (Input: 0):**
* The output grid has a height of 11.
* A square shape formed by the digit '8' is drawn near the top.
* A reversed 'L' shape formed by the digit '2' is placed below the square, slightly shifted to the left. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions that aim to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  val = mostcommon(I)  # Identify the input digit
  h = 14 if val == 0 else (9 if val == 8 else 11)  # Output grid height
  O = canvas(0, (h, 9))  # Create canvas with background '0'

  if val == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(h-3,1),(h-3,2),(h-3,3),(h-2,1)}))  # Reversed 'L'
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(h-4,4),(h-4,5),(h-3,4),(h-3,5)}))  # Square
  elif val == 8:
    input_pos = ulcorner(first(objects(I, True, False, True)))  # '8' position
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(input_pos[0]-4+i, input_pos[1]-1+j) for i, j in [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3)]}))  # 'T' shape
  else:  # val == 2 
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(2,3),(2,4),(3,3),(3,4)}))  # Square
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(4,1),(4,2),(4,3),(5,1),(5,2)}))  # Reversed 'L'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Identifies Input:** Uses `mostcommon(I)` to determine the input digit.
* **Canvas Creation:** Creates a canvas of the appropriate height based on the input digit.
* **Shape Drawing:** Uses hardcoded coordinates for shapes based on the input digit and `paint` and `recolor` functions to draw them.
* **'T' Shape Positioning:**  For input '8', it calculates the 'T' shape position relative to the '8's location.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  val = mostcommon(I)
  h = 14 if val == 0 else (9 if val == 8 else 11)
  O = canvas(0, (h, 9))

  if val == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(((2,2,2),(2,0,0))), (h-5,1)))) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(((8,8),(8,8))), (h-6,4))))
  elif val == 8:
    input_obj = first(objects(I, True, False, True))
    i, j = ulcorner(input_obj)
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(((2,2,2,0,0),(0,2,2,2,2),(0,0,2,2,0))), (i-4,j-2))))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(((8,8),(8,8))), (2,3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(((0,2,2,2),(2,2,0,0),(0,0,0,0))), (3,1)))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Similar to Version 1, but represents shapes using `asobject` for potentially better readability.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  val = mostcommon(I)
  h = 14 if val == 0 else (9 if val == 8 else 11)
  O = canvas(0, (h, 9))

  if val == 0:
    l_shape = frozenset({(h-3,1),(h-3,2),(h-3,3),(h-2,1)})  
    square_shape = frozenset({(h-4,4),(h-4,5),(h-3,4),(h-3,5)}) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, l_shape))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, square_shape))
  elif val == 8:
    input_pos = ulcorner(first(objects(I, True, False, True))) 
    t_shape = {(input_pos[0]-4+i, input_pos[1]-1+j) for i in range(3) for j in range(5) if (i,j) in [(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,2),(2,2),(2,1),(2,3)]}
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, t_shape)) 
  else:
    square_pos = (2, 3) 
    rev_l_shape_pos = (4, 1)
    square_shape = {(square_pos[0] + i, square_pos[1] + j) for i in range(2) for j in range(2)}
    rev_l_shape = {(rev_l_shape_pos[0] + i, rev_l_shape_pos[1] + j) for i in range(2) for j in range(3) if (i,j) != (1,2)}
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, square_shape))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, rev_l_shape))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

*  Uses set comprehensions to define shapes, offering a more compact way to generate shape coordinates.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  val = mostcommon(I)
  O = canvas(0, (14, 9)) if val == 0 else (canvas(0, (9, 9)) if val == 8 else canvas(0, (11, 9)))
  if val == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(11,1),(11,2),(11,3),(12,1)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(10,4),(10,5),(11,4),(11,5)})) 
  elif val == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(4,3),(4,4),(4,5),(5,4),(6,4),(6,3),(6,5)}))
  else: 
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(2,3),(2,4),(3,3),(3,4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(4,1),(4,2),(4,3),(5,1),(5,2)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

*  This version directly embeds shape coordinates within the code, reducing complexity but making it less adaptable.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  v = mostcommon(I)
  h = 14 if v == 0 else (9 if v == 8 else 11)
  O = canvas(0, (h, 9))
  if v == 0:
    O = paint(paint(O, recolor(2, shift(frozenset({(0, j) for j in range(1,4)} | {(1, 1)}), (h-3, 0)))),
              recolor(8, shift(frozenset({(i, j) for i in range(2) for j in range(2)}), (h-5, 4))))
  elif v == 8:
    p = ulcorner(first(objects(I, True, False, True)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(frozenset({(i, j) for i in range(3) for j in range(5) if (i, j) in [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)]}), (p[0]-4, p[1]-2))))
  else:
    O = paint(paint(O, recolor(8, shift(frozenset({(i, j) for i in range(2) for j in range(2)}), (2, 3)))),
              recolor(2, shift(frozenset({(0, j) for j in range(3)} | {(1, 0), (1, 1)}), (4, 0)))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version attempts to define shapes using a combination of set comprehensions and set operations for potentially increased conciseness and flexibility.
