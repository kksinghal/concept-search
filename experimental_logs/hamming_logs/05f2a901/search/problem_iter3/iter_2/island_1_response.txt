## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the input value and then drawing specific patterns based on this value on different sized canvases. The patterns always consist of a '2' shape and an '8' shape, but their positioning, size, and orientation change depending on the input value. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input:

**Input 0:**

* **Canvas Size:** 14 x 9
* **'2' Shape:** Located at the bottom left, forming a backward 'L' shape with a tail.
* **'8' Shape:** Located above the '2' shape, forming an 'L' shape.

**Input 8:**

* **Canvas Size:** 9 x 10
* **'2' Shape:** Located at the bottom right, forming a square shape.
* **'8' Shape:** Located above the '2' shape, forming an 'L' shape.

**Input 2:**

* **Canvas Size:** 11 x 10
* **'2' Shape:** Located at the bottom right, forming a large square shape with an extra cell on the left.
* **'8' Shape:** Located above the '2' shape, forming a square shape.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:** (Using conditional statements and nested loops)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  val = first(first(I)) if I else 0
  h, w = 14, 9 if val == 0 else (9, 10 if val == 8 else (11, 10))
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if val == 0:
        if (i == h - 2 and j in [1, 2, 3]) or (i == h - 1 and j in [1, 3]):
          O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j))})
        if (i == h - 3 and j in [3, 5]) or (i == h - 2 and j in [4, 5]):
          O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j))})
      elif val == 8:
        if (i == h - 3 and j in [3, 5]) or (i == h - 2 and j in [3, 4, 5]):
          O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j))})
        if (i == h - 4 and j in [6, 8]) or (i == h - 3 and j in [6, 7, 8]):
          O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j))})
      else:
        if (i == h - 4 and j in [3, 5]) or (i == h - 3 and j in [3, 4, 5]):
          O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j))})
        if (i in [h - 5, h - 4, h - 3] and j in [2, 3, 4]) or (i == h - 2 and j == 2):
          O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j))})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Input Identification:** This code first determines the input value (`val`) from the input grid `I`. 
2. **Canvas Creation:** Based on `val`, it creates a canvas (`O`) of the appropriate size using `canvas(0, (h, w))`.
3. **Pattern Drawing:** Using nested loops and conditional statements, the code iterates over each cell of the canvas. Based on `val` and the cell's coordinates, it selectively paints the cell with '2' or '8' using `paint(O, {(value, (i, j))})`.

**Program Version 2:** (Using `shift` and pre-defined objects)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  val = first(first(I)) if I else 0
  h, w = 14, 9 if val == 0 else (9, 10 if val == 8 else (11, 10))
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))

  obj_2_0 = normalize({(2, (0, 0)), (2, (0, 1)), (2, (0, 2)), (2, (1, 2)), (2, (1, 0)), (2, (1, 1)), (2, (0, 3))})
  obj_8_0 = normalize({(8, (0, 0)), (8, (0, 1)), (8, (1, 3)), (8, (1, 4)), (8, (0, 2)), (8, (0, 3))})
  obj_2_8 = normalize({(2, (0, 0)), (2, (0, 1)), (2, (0, 2)), (2, (1, 1)), (2, (1, 2)), (2, (2, 0)), (2, (2, 1)), (2, (2, 2))})
  obj_8_8 = normalize({(8, (0, 0)), (8, (0, 1)), (8, (1, 2)), (8, (1, 3)), (8, (0, 2)), (8, (0, 3))})
  obj_8_2 = normalize({(8, (0, 0)), (8, (0, 1)), (8, (1, 0)), (8, (1, 1))})
  obj_2_2 = normalize({(2, (0, 0)), (2, (0, 1)), (2, (0, 2)), (2, (1, 0)), (2, (1, 1)), (2, (1, 2)), (2, (2, 0)), (2, (2, 1)), (2, (2, 2)), (2, (3, 0)), (2, (3, 1)), (2, (3, 2)), (2, (2, 3))})
  
  if val == 0:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj_2_0, (h - 2, 1)))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj_8_0, (h - 3, 3)))
  elif val == 8:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj_2_8, (h - 3, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj_8_8, (h - 4, 6)))
  else: 
    O = paint(O, shift(obj_8_2, (h - 4, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj_2_2, (h - 4, 2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Input & Canvas:** Similar to Version 1, this code identifies the input value and creates the canvas.
2. **Pre-defined Objects:** It defines the '2' and '8' shapes as objects using `normalize` to position them at the origin.
3. **Conditional Painting:**  It uses conditional statements to select the appropriate pre-defined objects based on `val`. It then uses `shift` to position these objects on the canvas and `paint` to draw them.

**Program Version 3:** (Using a helper function and loops)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  val = first(first(I)) if I else 0
  h, w = 14, 9 if val == 0 else (9, 10 if val == 8 else (11, 10))
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  
  def draw_shape(shape, color, start_pos):
    for i, row in enumerate(shape):
      for j, cell in enumerate(row):
        if cell:
          O = paint(O, {(color, (i + start_pos[0], j + start_pos[1]))})
    return O
  
  if val == 0:
    shape_2 = ((1, 1, 1, 0), (1, 1, 0, 1))
    shape_8 = ((1, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1))
    O = draw_shape(shape_2, 2, (h - 2, 1))
    O = draw_shape(shape_8, 8, (h - 3, 3))
  elif val == 8:
    shape_2 = ((1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1))
    shape_8 = ((1, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1))
    O = draw_shape(shape_2, 2, (h - 3, 3))
    O = draw_shape(shape_8, 8, (h - 4, 6))
  else:
    shape_8 = ((1, 1), (1, 1))
    shape_2 = ((1, 1, 1, 0), (1, 1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 0, 1), (1, 1, 1, 1))
    O = draw_shape(shape_8, 8, (h - 4, 3))
    O = draw_shape(shape_2, 2, (h - 5, 2))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Input & Canvas:** Similar to previous versions, this code identifies the input and creates the canvas.
2. **Shape Definition & Drawing:** It defines a helper function `draw_shape` that takes a shape (represented as a 2D list of 1s and 0s), color, and starting position. It then uses nested loops to draw the shape on the canvas.
3. **Conditional Shape Selection:** Based on `val`, it selects the appropriate shapes and calls `draw_shape` to draw them on the canvas.

**Program Version 4:** (Using list comprehensions and conditional expressions)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  val = first(first(I)) if I else 0
  h, w = 14, 9 if val == 0 else (9, 10 if val == 8 else (11, 10))
  
  def get_shape(val, color):
    return (((color if (i in [h - 2, h - 1] and j in [1, 3]) or (i == h - 2 and j in [2]) else 0) for j in range(w)) for i in range(h)) if val == 0 else \
           (((color if (i in [h - 3, h - 2] and j in [3, 5]) or (i == h - 2 and j in [4]) else 0) for j in range(w)) for i in range(h)) if val == 8 else \
           (((color if (i in [h - 5, h - 4, h - 3] and j in [2, 4]) or (i in [h - 5, h - 4, h - 3, h - 2] and j == 3) else 0) for j in range(w)) for i in range(h))
           
  O = tuple(tuple(v2 if v2 else (v8 if v8 else 0) for v2, v8 in zip(row2, row8))
           for row2, row8 in zip(get_shape(val, 2), get_shape(val, 8)))
  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Input & Dimensions:**  Similar to previous versions.
2. **Shape Generation:** The `get_shape` function uses nested list comprehensions and conditional expressions to generate a grid containing the desired '2' or '8' shape based on the input value and color.
3. **Combining Shapes:** It calls `get_shape` twice, once for each color, and uses another list comprehension to combine the resulting grids, prioritizing the '2' shape.

**Program Version 5:** (Using recursion)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  val = first(first(I)) if I else 0
  h, w = 14, 9 if val == 0 else (9, 10 if val == 8 else (11, 10))
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  
  def draw_pixel(i, j, color, shape):
    if i < 0 or j < 0 or i >= h or j >= w or shape[i][j] == 0:
      return
    O = paint(O, {(color, (i, j))})
    shape[i][j] = 0  # Mark pixel as drawn
    draw_pixel(i + 1, j, color, shape)
    draw_pixel(i - 1, j, color, shape)
    draw_pixel(i, j + 1, color, shape)
    draw_pixel(i, j - 1, color, shape)

  if val == 0:
    shape = [[1 if (i == h - 2 and j in [1, 2, 3]) or (i == h - 1 and j in [1, 3]) else 0 for j in range(w)] for i in range(h)]
    draw_pixel(h - 2, 1, 2, shape)
    shape = [[1 if (i == h - 3 and j in [3, 5]) or (i == h - 2 and j in [4, 5]) else 0 for j in range(w)] for i in range(h)]
    draw_pixel(h - 3, 3, 8, shape)
  # Add cases for val == 8 and val == 2 similarly...
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Input & Canvas:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Recursive Drawing:**  The `draw_pixel` function recursively explores and paints connected pixels of the same color, starting from a given point.
3. **Shape Representation:** It defines shapes as 2D lists of 1s (representing the shape) and 0s (background).
4. **Triggering Recursion:** It calls `draw_pixel` for the starting point of each shape, triggering the recursive drawing process.

These are just five examples. You can come up with many other variations by combining these techniques or exploring other functions provided in the DSL. The key is to analyze the transformation logic and find efficient and elegant ways to express it using the available tools.
