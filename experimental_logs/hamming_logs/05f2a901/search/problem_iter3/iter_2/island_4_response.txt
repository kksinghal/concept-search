## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single-cell input grid containing a digit and generates an output grid depicting a specific shape based on the input digit. The shapes resemble stylized letters:

**Input 0:** The output grid depicts a stylized "F" using the digits '2' and '8'. 

**Input 1:**  The output grid depicts a stylized "H" using the digits '2' and '8'.

**Input 2:** The output grid depicts a stylized "L" using the digits '2' and '8'.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  if d == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(8, j) for j in range(1, 4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(9, 0), (9, 2)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(10, 1), (10, 2), (11, 1), (11, 2)}))
  elif d == 1:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(4, 3), (4, 6)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 7), (5, 8)}))
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (15, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a direct approach, creating the shapes by painting specific cells with the desired colors. It defines the canvas size based on the input digit and then explicitly paints each cell of the shape.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  if d == 0:
    base = canvas(2, (2, 3))
    extension = canvas(2, (2, 1))
    shape = hconcat(base, extension)
    shape = vconcat(shape, recolor(8, canvas(2, (2, 2))))
    O = paint(canvas(0, (14, 10)), shift(shape, (8, 0)))
  elif d == 1:
    top = hconcat(canvas(2, (3, 2)), recolor(8, canvas(2, (2, 2))))
    bottom = hconcat(canvas(2, (1, 2)), canvas(0, (2, 2)))
    shape = vconcat(top, bottom)
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), shift(shape, (1, 3)))
  else:
    top = vconcat(recolor(8, canvas(2, (2, 2))), canvas(2, (7, 3)))
    O = paint(canvas(0, (15, 10)), shift(top, (1, 2)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

This version constructs the shapes by combining smaller building blocks using `hconcat` and `vconcat`. This allows for a more modular and potentially reusable approach compared to painting individual cells.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  if d == 0:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (14, 10)), recolor(2, {(i, j) for i in range(8, 10) for j in range(4) if (i, j) != (9, 1)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, j) for i in range(10, 12) for j in range(1, 3)}))
  elif d == 1:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(2, {(i, j) for i in range(1, 4) for j in range(4, 6)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(4, 3), (4, 6)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, j) for i in range(4, 6) for j in range(7, 9)}))
  else:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (15, 10)), recolor(8, {(i, j) for i in range(1, 3) for j in range(3, 5)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 6) for j in range(2, 5)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines the shapes by specifying the ranges of rows and columns where the colors appear. It iterates through the specified ranges and paints the corresponding cells. This approach is concise and efficient for shapes with regular patterns.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  if d == 0:
    shape = normalize(frozenset({(2, (0, 0)), (2, (0, 1)), (2, (0, 2)), (2, (1, 0)), (2, (1, 2)), (8, (2, 0)), (8, (2, 1)), (8, (3, 0)), (8, (3, 1))}))
    O = paint(canvas(0, (14, 10)), shift(shape, (8, 0)))
  elif d == 1:
    shape = normalize(frozenset({(2, (0, 0)), (2, (0, 1)), (2, (1, 0)), (2, (1, 1)), (2, (2, 0)), (2, (2, 1)), (2, (3, 0)), (8, (3, 1)), (8, (4, 1)), (8, (4, 0))}))
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), shift(shape, (1, 3)))
  else:
    shape = normalize(frozenset({(8, (0, 0)), (8, (0, 1)), (8, (1, 0)), (8, (1, 1)), (2, (2, 0)), (2, (2, 1)), (2, (2, 2)), (2, (3, 0)), (2, (3, 1)), (2, (3, 2)), (2, (4, 0)), (2, (4, 1)), (2, (4, 2))}))
    O = paint(canvas(0, (15, 10)), shift(shape, (1, 2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines the shapes directly as objects using normalized coordinates. The shapes are shifted to their final positions on the canvas using the `shift` function.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = int(I[0][0])
  if d == 0:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (14, 10)), recolor(2,  {(i, j) for i in range(8, 10) for j in range(3) if j != 1 or i == 8}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(10, j) for j in range(1, 3)} | {(11, j) for j in range(1, 3)}))
  elif d == 1:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(2, {(i, j) for i in range(1, 5) for j in range(4, 7) if i != 4 or j != 5}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, j) for i in range(4, 6) for j in range(7, 9)}))
  else:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (15, 10)), recolor(8, {(i, j) for i in range(1, 3) for j in range(3, 5)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 6) for j in range(2, 5)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses set comprehension and set operations to define the shapes. This approach offers flexibility in defining complex patterns by combining simpler sets of indices. 

**Note:**  All five versions achieve the desired transformations for the given input-output pairs. They demonstrate different approaches and function combinations from the DSL, highlighting the diversity of solutions possible within the given constraints.
