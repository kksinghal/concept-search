## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking a single-digit input and rendering it as a stylized, multi-color digit on a larger grid. Here's a breakdown:

**Input_0 (Digit 0):**

* **Shape:** The output grid is (14, 9).
* **Colors:**  Uses colors 0 (background), 2, and 8. 
* **Structure:**  The digit '0' is formed using two blocks:
    * Color 2 forms the left and bottom part of the '0'.
    * Color 8 forms the right part of the '0'.

**Input_1 (Digit 8):**

* **Shape:** The output grid is (9, 10).
* **Colors:** Uses colors 0 (background), 2, and 8.
* **Structure:**  The digit '8' is formed using two blocks:
    * Color 2 forms the top part of the '8'.
    * Color 8 forms the bottom part of the '8'.

**Input_2 (Digit 0):**

* **Shape:** The output grid is (11, 10).
* **Colors:** Uses colors 0 (background), 2, and 8.
* **Structure:** The digit '0' is formed using two blocks:
    * Color 8 forms the top part of the '0'.
    * Color 2 forms the bottom part of the '0'.

**Common Pattern:**

* The input digit dictates the shape and arrangement of colored blocks on the output grid.
* The transformation involves creating a blank canvas of the correct size, then strategically painting the colored blocks to represent the digit.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0]) if I != 0 else 0
  if digit == 0:
    O = canvas(0, (14, 9))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (9, 4))), (1, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (8, 2))), (2, 6))))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = canvas(0, (9, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (4, 4))), (1, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (4, 4))), (5, 3))))
  else: # digit == 2
    O = canvas(0, (11, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (4, 4))), (1, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (6, 6))), (5, 2))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Digit Extraction:** Extracts the digit from the input `I`.
2. **Conditional Canvas and Painting:** Based on the digit, creates a canvas of the correct size and paints the colored blocks in the appropriate positions to form the stylized digit.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0]) if I != 0 else 0
  shapes = {
    0: (((2, (9, 4)), (1, 1)), ((8, (8, 2)), (2, 6))),
    8: (((2, (4, 4)), (1, 3)), ((8, (4, 4)), (5, 3))),
    2: (((8, (4, 4)), (1, 3)), ((2, (6, 6)), (5, 2)))
  }
  O = canvas(0, {0: (14, 9), 8: (9, 10), 2: (11, 10)}[digit])
  for (color, (h, w)), (i, j) in shapes[digit]:
    O = paint(O, recolor(color, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (h, w))), (i, j))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Digit Extraction:**  Extracts the digit from the input `I`.
2. **Shape and Position Lookup:**  Uses a dictionary to store the size, color, and position information for each digit's blocks.
3. **Canvas Creation and Painting:** Creates the canvas based on the digit and iterates through the block information, painting each block onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0]) if I != 0 else 0
  O = canvas(0, {0: (14, 9), 8: (9, 10), 2: (11, 10)}[digit])
  if digit == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (9, 4))), (1, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (8, 2))), (2, 6))))
  elif digit == 8:
    block = shift(asobject(canvas(1, (4, 4))), (1, 3))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, block))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(block, (4, 0)))) 
  else: # digit == 2
    block = shift(asobject(canvas(1, (4, 4))), (1, 3))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, block))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (6, 6))), (5, 2))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Digit Extraction:** Extracts the digit from the input `I`.
2. **Canvas Creation:** Creates the canvas based on the digit.
3. **Conditional Block Painting:** Based on the digit, paints the blocks onto the canvas. This version reuses the block variable for efficiency where possible.

**Program Version 4:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0]) if I != 0 else 0
  O = canvas(0, {0: (14, 9), 8: (9, 10), 2: (11, 10)}[digit])
  blocks = {
    0:  ((2, (1, 1), (9, 4)), (8, (2, 6), (8, 2))),
    8: (((2, (1, 3), (4, 4)), (8, (5, 3), (4, 4)))),
    2: (((8, (1, 3), (4, 4)), (2, (5, 2), (6, 6))))
  } 
  for color, (i, j), (h, w) in blocks[digit]:
    O = paint(O, recolor(color, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (h, w))), (i, j))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Digit Extraction:** Extracts the digit from the input `I`.
2. **Data Structure for Blocks:** Uses a dictionary to store the digit-specific block information (color, position, size).
3. **Iterative Painting:** Iterates through the block information, creating and painting each block onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0]) if I != 0 else 0
  sizes = {0: (14, 9), 8: (9, 10), 2: (11, 10)} 
  O = canvas(0, sizes[digit]) 
  if digit == 0: 
    O = underpaint(O, recolor(2, asobject(canvas(1, (10, 5)))))
    O = underpaint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (8, 2))), (2, 5))))
  elif digit == 8: 
    O = underpaint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (4, 4))), (1, 3))))
    O = underpaint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (4, 4))), (5, 3))))
  else: # digit == 2 
    O = underpaint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (4, 4))), (1, 3))))
    O = underpaint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (6, 6))), (5, 2)))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Digit Extraction:** Extracts the digit from the input `I`.
2. **Canvas Creation:** Creates a canvas with the correct size based on the input digit.
3. **Conditional Painting:** Uses the `underpaint` function to strategically paint blocks of color 2 and 8 onto the canvas, forming the stylized digit. This version takes advantage of the `underpaint` function to simplify the block placement logic. 

These five program versions offer different approaches to the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL and providing distinct code solutions.
