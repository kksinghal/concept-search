## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking a single-digit input grid and creating an output grid containing representations of the digits '2' and '8'. The position and size of these representations depend on the input digit.

* **Input 0:** The output grid depicts the digits '2' and '8' positioned at the bottom center. The '2' is larger and above the '8'.
* **Input 8:** The output grid depicts a smaller '2' positioned above the '8'. The '8' is smaller compared to the one in the output of Input 0.
* **Input 2:** The output grid depicts a larger '8' with a smaller '2' positioned below it.  

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  v = first(first(I)) if I else 0
  O = canvas(0, (14, 9))
  if v == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(((2,2,2),(2,0,2),(0,2,0))), (9,2))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(((8,8),(8,8))), (11,3))))
  elif v == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(((2,2,2),(2,0,0))), (3,3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(((8,8),(8,8))), (5,4))))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(((8,8),(8,8))), (2,3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(((2,2,2),(2,0,0))), (5,2))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Initialization:**  The program first initializes a blank canvas `O` of size 14x9 filled with 0s. 
* **Digit Identification:** It extracts the input digit `v`.
* **Conditional Rendering:**  Based on `v`, it paints pre-defined shapes for '2' and '8' using `recolor` and `shift` to achieve the correct positions and sizes on the canvas. 

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  v = mostcommon(I)
  O = canvas(0,  (14, 9) if v == 0 else (10, 10))
  if v == 0:
    two = asobject(((2,2,2),(2,0,2),(0,2,0)))
    eight = asobject(((8,8),(8,8)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(two, (9,2))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(eight, (11,3))))
  elif v == 8:
    two = asobject(((2,2,2),(2,0,0)))
    eight = asobject(((8,8),(8,8)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(two, (3,3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(eight, (5,4))))
  else:
    eight = asobject(((8,8),(8,8)))
    two = asobject(((2,2,2),(2,0,0)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(eight, (2,3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(two, (5,2))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Dynamic Canvas Sizing:**  This version determines canvas size dynamically based on `v`. 
* **Object Templates:** It defines separate object templates for '2' and '8' for better code readability.
* **Conditional Positioning:**  It uses the same `paint`, `recolor`, and `shift` functions but with different offsets based on the input digit for precise positioning.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  v = first(first(I)) if I else 0
  size_dict = {0: (14, 9), 8: (10, 10), 2: (10, 10)}
  O = canvas(0, size_dict[v])
  two_shape = ((2,2,2),(2,0,2),(0,2,0)) if v == 0 else ((2,2,2),(2,0,0))
  eight_shape = ((8,8),(8,8))
  two = asobject(two_shape)
  eight = asobject(eight_shape)
  if v == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(two, (9,2))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(eight, (11,3))))
  elif v == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(two, (3,3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(eight, (5,4))))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(eight, (2,3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(two, (5,2))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Dictionary for Size and Shape:**  This version uses a dictionary to manage canvas sizes and shape variations for '2' based on the input digit.
* **Unified Rendering Logic:**  It reuses the same `paint`, `recolor`, and `shift` calls with consistent logic but with adjusted shapes and positions.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  v = first(first(I)) if I else 0
  O = canvas(0, (14, 9) if v == 0 else (10, 10))
  if v == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(((2,2,2),(2,0,2),(0,2,0))), (9,2))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(((8,8),(8,8))), (11,3))))
  else:
    two_pos = (3, 3) if v == 8 else (5, 2)
    eight_pos = (5, 4) if v == 8 else (2, 3)
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(((2,2,2),(2,0,0))), two_pos)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(((8,8),(8,8))), eight_pos)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Simplified Branching:** This version simplifies the conditional logic by grouping common operations.
* **Position Variables:**  It uses variables to store positions for '2' and '8', improving readability and reducing code duplication. 

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  v = mostcommon(I)
  O = canvas(0, (14, 9) if v == 0 else (10, 10))
  shapes = {
      0: {2: ((2,2,2),(2,0,2),(0,2,0)), 8: ((8,8),(8,8))},
      8: {2: ((2,2,2),(2,0,0)), 8: ((8,8),(8,8))},
      2: {8: ((8,8),(8,8)), 2: ((2,2,2),(2,0,0))}
  }
  positions = {
      0: {2: (9, 2), 8: (11, 3)},
      8: {2: (3, 3), 8: (5, 4)},
      2: {8: (2, 3), 2: (5, 2)}
  }
  for digit, shape in shapes[v].items():
      O = paint(O, recolor(digit, shift(asobject(shape), positions[v][digit])))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Data-Driven Approach:**  This version adopts a data-driven approach by storing shapes and positions in dictionaries.
* **Iterative Rendering:**  It iterates through the dictionaries, dynamically painting digits at their designated positions based on the input. This approach is more flexible and scalable for handling more digits or variations. 

These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating diverse logic and DSL function combinations.
