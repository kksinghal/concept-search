## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single digit and creates a stylized, larger representation of that digit within a grid.  The style appears inspired by a 7-segment display. Here's a breakdown:

* **Digit 0:** The '0' is formed by:
    * A large rectangular base of color 0.
    * A top/left segment of color 2.
    * A bottom/right segment of color 8.
* **Digit 8:**  The '8' is formed by:
    * A large, slightly curved base of color 8.
    * A top segment of color 2.
    * Two bottom segments (left and right) of color 8.
* **Digit 2:**  The '2' is formed by:
    * A large, angled base of color 2.
    * Two top segments (left and right) of color 8.
    * A bottom segment of color 2.

Each digit has a specific canvas size and the segments are strategically placed to form the recognizable shape of the digit.


## Program Version 1: 

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0]) if I != 0 else 0  
  canvas_sizes = {0: (14, 9), 8: (9, 10), 2: (11, 10)}
  segment_data = {
      0: (((2, (9, 3)), (1, 1)), ((8, (6, 6)), (5, 4))),
      8: (((2, (6, 3)), (1, 3)), ((8, (3, 4)), (4, 3)), ((8, (3, 4)), (4, 6))),
      2: (((8, (6, 3)), (1, 3)), ((8, (6, 3)), (1, 6)), ((2, (9, 6)), (4, 2)))
  }

  O = canvas(0, canvas_sizes[digit])
  base_obj = shift(asobject(upscale(I, 3)), [(5, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1)][digit])
  O = paint(O, base_obj)

  for color, (width, height), (i_shift, j_shift) in segment_data[digit]:
    segment = recolor(color, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (width, height))), (i_shift, j_shift)))
    O = paint(O, segment)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Digit Extraction:**  Extracts the digit from the input `I` using `int(str(I)[0])` and handles the case for `I=0`.
2. **Canvas and Segment Data:** Defines dictionaries `canvas_sizes` and `segment_data` to store the specific canvas size and segment information for each digit.
3. **Canvas Initialization:** Initializes the output canvas `O` with the correct size based on the extracted digit.
4. **Base Shape:** Creates the base shape of the digit by upscaling the input `I`, converting it to an object, and shifting it to its correct position.
5. **Segment Drawing:** Iterates through the `segment_data` for the specific digit, creating and painting each segment onto the canvas. 
   -  `recolor` sets the segment color.
   -  `shift` positions the segment on the canvas. 
   -  `asobject` and `canvas` are used to create the segment shapes.
6. **Output:** Returns the final canvas `O` containing the stylized digit.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0]) if I != 0 else 0
  O = canvas(0, [(14, 9), (9, 10), (11, 10)][digit])
  obj = asobject(upscale(I, 3))

  if digit == 0:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (5, 1)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (9, 3))), (1, 1)))) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (6, 6))), (5, 4)))) 
  elif digit == 8:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (1, 3)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (6, 3))), (1, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (3, 4))), (4, 3)))) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (3, 4))), (4, 6)))) 
  elif digit == 2:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (3, 1))) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (6, 3))), (1, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (6, 3))), (1, 6)))) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (9, 6))), (4, 2)))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Digit and Canvas:** Extracts the digit and creates the canvas based on the digit, similar to Version 1.
2. **Base Object:** Upscales the input and converts it to an object.
3. **Conditional Segment Drawing:** Uses `if-elif` statements to handle each digit separately.  Within each block:
   - Paints the base object at the correct location.
   - Creates and paints each segment:
     - `recolor` sets the color.
     - `shift` positions the segment.
     - `asobject` and `canvas` create the segment shapes.

**Key Difference from Version 1:** Version 2 directly codes the segment information within conditional blocks, while Version 1 uses dictionaries for better organization and scalability.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0]) if I != 0 else 0
  O = canvas(0, [(14, 9), (9, 10), (11, 10)][digit])  
  base_pos = [(5, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1)][digit] 

  def draw_segment(color, size, shift_amt): 
    return paint(O, recolor(color, shift(asobject(canvas(1, size)), shift_amt)))

  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(upscale(I, 3)), base_pos))  
  
  if digit == 0:
    O = draw_segment(2, (9, 3), (1, 1)) 
    O = draw_segment(8, (6, 6), (5, 4))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = draw_segment(2, (6, 3), (1, 3))
    O = draw_segment(8, (3, 4), (4, 3))
    O = draw_segment(8, (3, 4), (4, 6)) 
  elif digit == 2: 
    O = draw_segment(8, (6, 3), (1, 3)) 
    O = draw_segment(8, (6, 3), (1, 6)) 
    O = draw_segment(2, (9, 6), (4, 2)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version builds on Version 2 by introducing a helper function:

1. **`draw_segment` function:** This function encapsulates the logic of creating and painting a segment with a given color, size, and position. 
2. **Simplified Segment Drawing:**  The main part of the code now uses the `draw_segment` function to draw each segment, making the code cleaner and easier to read.

**Key Difference from Version 2:** Version 3 uses a helper function for better code organization, while Version 2 repeats the segment drawing logic within conditional blocks.

## Program Version 4: 

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0]) if I != 0 else 0
  canvas_sizes = {0: (14, 9), 8: (9, 10), 2: (11, 10)}
  segments = {
      0: (((2, (9, 3)), (1, 1)), ((8, (6, 6)), (5, 4))),
      8: (((2, (6, 3)), (1, 3)), ((8, (3, 4)), (4, 3)), ((8, (3, 4)), (4, 6))),
      2: (((8, (6, 3)), (1, 3)), ((8, (6, 3)), (1, 6)), ((2, (9, 6)), (4, 2)))
  }

  O = canvas(0, canvas_sizes[digit])
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(upscale(I, 3)), [(5, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1)][digit]))

  for color, size, shift_amt in segments[digit]:
    O = paint(O, recolor(color, shift(asobject(canvas(1, size)), shift_amt))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version combines the best aspects of Version 1 and Version 3:

1.  **Data-Driven Approach (like Version 1):** It stores the canvas sizes and segment data in dictionaries for better organization.
2.  **Helper Function (like Version 3):**  It uses the `draw_segment` helper function for cleaner code.

This version provides a good balance between readability and maintainability. 


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0]) if I != 0 else 0
  canvas_size = [(14, 9), (9, 10), (11, 10)][digit]
  base_pos = [(5, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1)][digit]
  segments = {
      0: [((2, (9, 3)), (1, 1)), ((8, (6, 6)), (5, 4))],
      8: [((2, (6, 3)), (1, 3)), ((8, (3, 4)), (4, 3)), ((8, (3, 4)), (4, 6))],
      2: [((8, (6, 3)), (1, 3)), ((8, (6, 3)), (1, 6)), ((2, (9, 6)), (4, 2))]
  }

  O = canvas(0, canvas_size)
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(upscale(I, 3)), base_pos)) 

  for segment in segments[digit]:
    color = segment[0][0]
    size = segment[0][1]
    shift_amt = segment[1]
    O = paint(O, recolor(color, shift(asobject(canvas(1, size)), shift_amt)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version refactors the data structure used for segments:

1. **Simplified Segment Data:** It uses a nested list structure for `segments` to improve readability. Each segment's information (color, size, and position) is grouped together within a sub-list. 
2. **Direct Data Access:** The code directly accesses the color, size, and shift amount from the nested list structure, avoiding the need for unpacking tuples within the loop.

This version focuses on making the code more concise and easier to understand by using a more intuitive data structure. 

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation, showcasing a range of DSL function combinations and code structures.
