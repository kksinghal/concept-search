## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes an input grid containing a single digit (0, 8, or other) and creates a fixed output grid with specific shapes made of '2's and '8's, positioned based on the input digit.

**Input 0:**

* A horizontal line of three '2's is placed at the bottom left.
* A vertical line of two '2's is placed above the horizontal line, slightly offset to the right.
* A square of '8's (2x2) is placed above and to the right of the '2's.

**Input 8:**

* The same shapes from Input 0 are mirrored along the diagonal axis.

**Input Other:**

* The same shapes from Input 0 are shifted upwards and to the left. 


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  hline = lambda pos: paint(O, shift(recolor(2, canvas(0, (1, 3))), (pos[0], pos[1])))
  vline = lambda pos: paint(O, shift(recolor(2, canvas(0, (2, 1))), (pos[0], pos[1])))
  eights = lambda pos: paint(O, shift(recolor(8, canvas(0, (2, 2))), (pos[0], pos[1])))
  if v == 0:
    return eights((10, 3))(vline((9, 1)) (hline((8, 1))))
  elif v == 8:
    return eights((3, 6))(vline((1, 7))(hline((1, 8))))
  else:
    return eights((1, 4))(vline((1, 5))(hline((3, 4)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

* Defines lambda functions `hline`, `vline`, and `eights` to create the respective shapes at a given position.
* Uses function composition to sequentially paint the shapes onto the canvas.
* Positional arguments for each shape are determined based on the input value.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  shapes = [
      (recolor(2, canvas(0, (1, 3))), (8, 1)),
      (recolor(2, canvas(0, (2, 1))), (9, 1)),
      (recolor(8, canvas(0, (2, 2))), (10, 3))
  ]
  if v == 8:
      shapes = [ (s, (13 - i, 9 - j)) for s, (i, j) in shapes ]
  elif v != 0:
      shapes = [ (s, (i - 7, j - 2)) for s, (i, j) in shapes ]
  for shape, (i, j) in shapes:
    O = paint(O, shift(shape, (i, j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Stores the shapes and their default positions in a list.
* Modifies the positions based on the input value using list comprehension.
* Iterates through the shapes and paints them onto the canvas.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  if v == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, 1) for i in range(8, 11)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(9, j) for j in range(1, 3)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, j) for i in range(10, 12) for j in range(3, 5)}))
  elif v == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, 8) for i in range(1, 4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(1, j) for j in range(7, 9)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(6, 8)}))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, 4) for i in range(3, 6)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(1, j) for j in range(4, 6)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, j) for i in range(1, 3) for j in range(4, 6)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Directly defines the indices of cells to be painted for each shape and input value.
* Utilizes set comprehension to generate the indices efficiently.
* Paints the shapes onto the canvas based on the input value.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  pos = [(8, 1, 9, 1, 10, 3), (1, 8, 1, 7, 3, 6), (3, 4, 1, 5, 1, 4)][v]
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(2, canvas(0, (1, 3))), (pos[0], pos[1])))
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(2, canvas(0, (2, 1))), (pos[2], pos[3])))
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(8, canvas(0, (2, 2))), (pos[4], pos[5])))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Stores the positions of each shape for different input values in a list of tuples.
* Retrieves the appropriate positions from the list based on the input value.
* Uses the retrieved positions to paint the shapes onto the canvas.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (14, 10))
  if v == 0:
    O = underpaint(O, shift(recolor(2, canvas(0, (3, 1))), (8, 1)))
    O = underpaint(O, shift(recolor(2, canvas(0, (1, 2))), (9, 1)))
    O = underpaint(O, shift(recolor(8, canvas(0, (2, 2))), (10, 3)))
  elif v == 8:
    O = underpaint(O, shift(recolor(2, canvas(0, (3, 1))), (1, 8)))
    O = underpaint(O, shift(recolor(2, canvas(0, (1, 2))), (1, 7)))
    O = underpaint(O, shift(recolor(8, canvas(0, (2, 2))), (3, 6)))
  else:
    O = underpaint(O, shift(recolor(2, canvas(0, (3, 1))), (3, 4)))
    O = underpaint(O, shift(recolor(2, canvas(0, (1, 2))), (1, 5)))
    O = underpaint(O, shift(recolor(8, canvas(0, (2, 2))), (1, 4)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Uses `underpaint` function to paint shapes onto the canvas without overwriting existing non-background colors.
* Directly defines the positions and colors for each shape based on the input value.
* Ensures shapes are painted in the correct order to avoid unwanted overwrites.
