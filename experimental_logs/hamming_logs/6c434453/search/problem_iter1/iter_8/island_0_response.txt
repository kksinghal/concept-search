## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves identifying square objects and changing the color of their surrounding cells based on the color of the center cell.

* **If the center cell of a square object is the background color:** The surrounding cells of the square are filled with the color '2'.
* **If the center cell of a square object is not the background color:** The surrounding cells of the square retain their original color.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
           fill(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)),  # Create background canvas
                2,
                mpapply(toindices, sfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: square(obj) and index(I, center(obj)) == mostcommon(I)))),  # Fill around squares with bg center
           0,  # Placeholder, irrelevant
           mpapply(toindices, sfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: square(obj) and index(I, center(obj)) != mostcommon(I))))  # Retain color around other squares
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))`**: Creates a canvas of the background color with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`**: Identifies all square objects in the input grid.
3. **`sfilter(...)`**: Filters the objects based on whether the center cell's color matches the background color or not.
4. **`mpapply(toindices, ...)`**: Extracts the indices of the filtered objects.
5. **`fill(...)`**: Fills the surrounding cells of squares with background centers with color '2' on the canvas.
6. The second `fill(...)` is a placeholder and doesn't affect the output as we are already retaining the original colors.
7. **`paint(...)`**: Combines the filled canvas with the original grid, preserving the colors of non-background-centered squares.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Create background canvas
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):  # Iterate over all objects
    if square(obj):  # Check if square
      if index(I, center(obj)) == mostcommon(I): # If center is background
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, 2, delta(toindices(obj))) # Fill around with '2'
      else:
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, toobject(delta(toindices(obj)), I)) # Retain original colors around
  return new_grid 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))`**: Creates a canvas filled with the background color.
2. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`**: Gets all objects from the input grid.
3. **`for obj in ...`**: Iterates through each object.
4. **`if square(obj)`**: Checks if the object is a square.
5. **`index(I, center(obj)) == mostcommon(I)`**: Checks if the center cell of the square is the background color.
    * **If True:**  `fill(new_grid, 2, delta(toindices(obj)))` fills the surrounding cells with '2'.
    * **If False:** `paint(new_grid, toobject(delta(toindices(obj)), I))` paints the surrounding cells with their original colors from the input grid.
6. **`return new_grid`**: Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I,  # Use original grid as base
                  fill(canvas(0, shape(I)),  # Create an empty canvas
                       2,
                       mpapply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), sfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: square(obj) and index(I, center(obj)) == mostcommon(I)))),  # Mark cells around bg-center squares
                  I)  # Use original color if no mark on the canvas
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(0, shape(I))`**: Creates a canvas of '0's with the same shape as the input. 
2. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`**:  Gets all objects from the input grid.
3. **`sfilter(...)`**: Filters for squares with a background-colored center.
4. **`mpapply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), ...)`**: Gets the surrounding cell indices for the filtered squares.
5. **`fill(...)`**:  Marks these surrounding cells on the canvas with '2'.
6. **`cellwise(I, ..., I)`**: Merges the canvas with the original grid. If a cell is marked with '2' on the canvas, it will take that color; otherwise, it retains its original color.

**Program Version 4:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcommon(I)  # Store background color
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)),  # Create background canvas
               merge(
                 apply(lambda obj: recolor(2 if index(I, center(obj)) == bg else index(I, center(obj)), 
                                          delta(toindices(obj))), 
                       sfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), square))))  # Paint the delta of each square with the determined color
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`bg = mostcommon(I)`**: Stores the background color for efficiency.
2. **`canvas(bg, shape(I))`**: Creates a canvas filled with the background color.
3. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`**: Extracts all objects from the input grid.
4. **`sfilter(..., square)`**: Filters for objects that are squares.
5. **`apply(lambda obj: ..., ...)`**: For each square:
   * **`delta(toindices(obj))`**:  Gets the indices of surrounding cells.
   * **`recolor(2 if index(I, center(obj)) == bg else index(I, center(obj)), ...)`**: Recolors those surrounding cells:
      * If the square's center is the background color, recolor to '2'.
      * Otherwise, retain the original color of the surrounding cells. 
6. **`merge(...)`**: Merges the recolored surrounding cells into a single set.
7. **`paint(...)`**:  Paints the merged set onto the background canvas, resulting in the final output.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  squares = sfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), square)  # Identify all square objects
  bg_color = mostcommon(I)  # Get background color
  def recolor_square(obj):
    new_color = 2 if index(I, center(obj)) == bg_color else index(I, center(obj))  # Determine new color
    return recolor(new_color, delta(toindices(obj)))  # Recolor surrounding cells
  recolored_squares = apply(recolor_square, squares)  # Apply recoloring to all squares
  return paint(canvas(bg_color, shape(I)), merge(recolored_squares))  # Paint on a background canvas
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`squares = ...`**:  Identifies and stores all square objects in the grid.
2. **`bg_color = ...`**: Stores the background color for clarity and potential efficiency.
3. **`def recolor_square(obj): ...`**: Defines a function to recolor the surrounding cells of a single square:
    * **`new_color = ...`**: Determines the new color for the surrounding cells based on the center cell's color.
    * **`return recolor(...)`**: Returns the surrounding cells recolored with the determined `new_color`.
4. **`recolored_squares = ...`**:  Applies the `recolor_square` function to each square object.
5. **`return paint(...)`**:  Paints the `recolored_squares` onto a newly created canvas filled with the background color, generating the final output.
