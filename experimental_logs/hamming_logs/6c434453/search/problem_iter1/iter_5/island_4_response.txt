## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

1. **Shift & Recolor:** Objects with color '1' are shifted rightward by half their height and recolor to '2'. 
2. **Maintain:** All other objects remain unchanged.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

This transformation follows the same logic as above.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, F)
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 1:
      shift_amount = height(obj) // 2
      new_obj = shift(obj, (0, shift_amount))  # Shift rightward
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, recolor(2, new_obj))
    else:
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, obj)
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

- We iterate through each object in the input grid.
- If the object's color is '1', we calculate the shift amount as half its height and shift the object rightward using `shift(obj, (0, shift_amount))`. 
- Then, we recolor this shifted object to '2' and paint it onto the new grid.
- Other objects are directly painted onto the new grid without modification.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
    frozenset(
      recolor(2, shift(obj, (0, height(obj) // 2))) if color(obj) == 1 else obj
      for obj in objects(I, T, T, F)
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses a more compact approach with a generator expression.
- We create a new canvas based on the input grid's background color and shape.
- For each object in the input, we conditionally shift and recolor it if its color is '1', otherwise, keep it unchanged.
- Finally, we paint all transformed objects onto the new canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def transform_obj(obj):
    if color(obj) == 1:
      return recolor(2, shift(obj, (0, width(obj) // 2)))
    return obj
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), apply(transform_obj, objects(I, T, T, F)))
```

**Explanation:**

- We define a helper function `transform_obj` to encapsulate the object transformation logic (conditional shifting and recoloring).
- Then, we apply this function to all objects extracted from the input grid.
- Finally, we paint these transformed objects onto a new canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
    mapply(
      lambda obj: recolor(2, shift(obj, (0, height(obj) // 2))) if color(obj) == 1 else obj,
      objects(I, T, T, F)
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

- This version utilizes the `mapply` function to apply the transformation logic to all objects and merge the results.
- The transformation logic remains the same: conditional shifting and recoloring based on object color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def cond_shift(obj):
    return shift(obj, (0, height(obj) // 2)) if color(obj) == 1 else obj
  def cond_recolor(obj):
    return recolor(2, obj) if color(obj) == 1 else obj
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), apply(cond_recolor, apply(cond_shift, objects(I, T, T, F))))
```

**Explanation:**

- Here, we break down the transformation into two separate functions: `cond_shift` for conditional shifting and `cond_recolor` for conditional recoloring.
- We apply these functions sequentially using nested `apply` calls to achieve the final transformation.

These five program versions demonstrate distinct approaches and DSL function combinations while achieving the same desired transformation on the input grids. Remember that these are just a few examples, and numerous other valid and efficient solutions might exist within the given DSL.
