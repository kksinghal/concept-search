## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation identifies squares within the input grid. If the center of the square contains the most common color in the grid (in this case, '0'), it fills the entire square with the value '2'. If the center is not the most common color, it keeps the square's original color.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** This transformation follows the same logic as the previous one, identifying squares and filling them with '2' if their center contains the most common color ('0').  Again, squares with centers of a different color retain their original coloring.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def bbicffedbbbcedgdacbbafjdeiefihjd_improved(I):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):  
    if square(obj): 
      center_i, center_j = center(obj)
      center_val = index(I, (center_i, center_j))
      fill_val = 2 if center_val == mostcommon(I) else center_val 
      new_grid = fill(new_grid, fill_val, toindices(obj))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a blank canvas:**  `new_grid = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))` creates a new grid of the same size as the input (`I`), filled with the most common color in the input.
2. **Iterate over objects:**  `for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):` loops through each object (connected component) in the input grid.
3. **Identify squares:** `if square(obj):` checks if the current object is a square.
4. **Get center value:** `center_i, center_j = center(obj)`  and `center_val = index(I, (center_i, center_j))`  finds the coordinates of the square's center and its corresponding value in the input grid.
5. **Determine fill value:**  `fill_val = 2 if center_val == mostcommon(I) else center_val` sets the fill value to '2' if the center is the most common color, otherwise, it keeps the original color of the square.
6. **Fill the square:** `new_grid = fill(new_grid, fill_val, toindices(obj))` fills the corresponding square in the `new_grid` with the determined `fill_val`.
7. **Return the transformed grid:** `return new_grid` returns the modified grid.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def afeafcgbcgfiejfcbehacccabiiaigcc_improved(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if any(square(o) and (i,j) == center(o) and index(I, (i,j)) == mostcommon(I) 
             for o in objects(I, T, F, F)) 
      else index(I, (i,j)) 
      for j in range(len(I[0])))
    for i in range(len(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested list comprehensions to achieve the transformation concisely:

1. **Iterate over cells:**  The outer loop `for i in range(len(I))` iterates through rows, and the inner loop `for j in range(len(I[0]))` iterates through columns of the input grid.
2. **Identify square centers:** `any(square(o) and (i,j) == center(o) and index(I, (i,j)) == mostcommon(I) for o in objects(I, T, F, F))` checks if the current cell `(i, j)` is the center of any square and if its value is the most common color.
3. **Conditional filling:**
    - If the condition is true (the cell is a square center with the most common color), the cell value is set to '2'.
    - Otherwise, `index(I, (i,j))` keeps the original cell value.
4. **Construct new grid:** The list comprehensions efficiently build the transformed grid based on these conditions.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def eiecgceffccdejhgaafbjhbadacfeaid_improved(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          2 if any(square(obj) and (i, j) in toindices(obj) and index(I, center(obj)) == mostcommon(I) 
                 for obj in objects(I, T, F, F)) 
          else I[i][j]
          for j in range(len(I[0])))
      for i in range(len(I))) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages the `toindices` function for a more efficient check:

1. **Iterate over cells:** Similar to version 2, it iterates over each cell `(i, j)` in the input grid.
2. **Check for square membership:**  `any(square(obj) and (i, j) in toindices(obj) and index(I, center(obj)) == mostcommon(I) for obj in objects(I, T, F, F))` checks if the current cell belongs to any square and if that square's center has the most common color. 
3. **Conditional filling:** If the cell is part of a square with the most common color at its center, its value is changed to '2'; otherwise, it keeps its original value.
4. **Construct new grid:** The transformed grid is constructed using the nested list comprehensions.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def cfededadafdgefagjbfefdhjbgebdacf_improved(I):
  squares = frozenset(obj for obj in objects(I, T, F, F) if square(obj))
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if any((i, j) in toindices(obj) and index(I, center(obj)) == mostcommon(I) for obj in squares)
      else I[i][j]
      for j in range(len(I[0])))
    for i in range(len(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version precomputes the squares for efficiency:

1. **Find all squares:** `squares = frozenset(obj for obj in objects(I, T, F, F) if square(obj))` first identifies all square objects in the grid and stores them in the `squares` set.
2. **Iterate over cells:**  It then iterates over each cell `(i, j)` of the input grid.
3. **Efficient square membership check:** `any((i, j) in toindices(obj) and index(I, center(obj)) == mostcommon(I) for obj in squares)` efficiently checks if the current cell belongs to any of the precomputed squares and if that square's center has the most common color.
4. **Conditional filling:** Based on the check, the cell value is either changed to '2' or retains its original value.
5. **Construct new grid:**  The final transformed grid is assembled using list comprehensions.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def alternative_solution(I):
    new_grid = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
        if square(obj):
            center_indices = toindices(shift(obj, subtract((0,0), center(obj)))) # bring center to (0, 0)
            if index(I, center(obj)) == mostcommon(I):
                new_grid = fill(new_grid, 2, toindices(shift(obj, subtract((0,0), center(obj)))))
    return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a slightly different approach by shifting the object:

1. **Create a blank canvas:** Similar to other versions, it creates an empty grid `new_grid`.
2. **Iterate over objects:** It iterates over each object `obj` in the grid.
3. **Identify squares:** It checks if the object is a square.
4. **Shift object to center:** `center_indices = toindices(shift(obj, subtract((0,0), center(obj))))` calculates the indices of the object as if its center were at the origin (0, 0).
5. **Check center color:** It verifies if the color at the object's original center is the most common color.
6. **Conditional filling:** If the condition holds, it fills the `new_grid` with '2' at the shifted indices, effectively filling the original square in the grid.
7. **Return transformed grid:** Finally, it returns the `new_grid`.


These five versions offer distinct approaches and logical flows to solve the given transformation problem, demonstrating the flexibility and power of the provided DSL.
