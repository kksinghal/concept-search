## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation revolves around identifying square objects within the grid and then filling them based on the color of their center cell. Let's break down the logic for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

1. **Identify Square Objects:** The program identifies three square objects: 
    * A 3x3 square of '1's in the top-left.
    * A 2x2 square of '1's in the bottom-left.
    * A 3x3 square of '1's in the bottom-right.

2. **Fill Based on Center Color:**
    * The top-left square has a center of '0' (background color). It's filled with '2'.
    * The bottom-left square has a center of '1'. It remains filled with '1'.
    * The bottom-right square has a center of '1'. It remains filled with '1'.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

1.  **Identify Square Objects:** The program identifies three square objects:
    * A 3x3 square of '1's in the top-right.
    * A 3x3 square of '1's in the bottom-right.
    * A 3x3 square of '1's in the middle-left.

2. **Fill Based on Center Color:**
    * The top-right square has a center of '1'. It remains filled with '1'.
    * The bottom-right square has a center of '1'. It remains filled with '1'.
    * The middle-left square has a center of '0' (background color). It's filled with '2'.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated":

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Create a new grid filled with the most common color
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F): # Iterate through all objects
    if square(obj): # If the object is a square
      if index(I, center(obj)) == mostcommon(I): # If the center of the square is the background color
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, 2, toindices(obj)) # Fill the square with '2' on the new grid
      else: # Otherwise
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, index(I, center(obj)), toindices(obj)) # Fill the square with its original color
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates a new grid (`new_grid`) of the same size as the input (`I`), filled with the most common color in the input.

2. **Iterate and Fill:**  Iterates over each object in the input. If the object is a square:
   - If the center cell of the square is the background color, it fills the corresponding area in `new_grid` with '2'.
   - Otherwise, it fills the area with the original color of the square.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), # Start with a canvas of the background color
               merge(
                 apply(lambda obj: recolor(2 if index(I, center(obj)) == mostcommon(I) else index(I, center(obj)), obj),  
                       sfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), square)))) # Recolor square objects based on center
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and Filtering:**  Creates a canvas filled with the background color and filters for square objects.
2. **Recoloring and Merging:** Recolors each square object based on its center color ('2' for background, original color otherwise), then merges these recolored objects onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return  tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if any(
        all(
          (i + di, j + dj) in toindices(obj) and index(I, (i + di, j + dj)) == index(I, center(obj))
          for di in range(-1, 2) 
          for dj in range(-1, 2)
        ) 
        for obj in objects(I, T, F, F) if square(obj) and index(I, center(obj)) == mostcommon(I) 
      ) else v 
      for j, v in enumerate(r)
    ) 
    for i, r in enumerate(I)
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Cells:** Iterates through each cell in the input grid.
2. **Check for Square Containment:** For each cell, it checks if the cell is part of a 3x3 square where:
   - The square is an object in the input.
   - The center of the square is the background color.
3. **Conditional Filling:** If the conditions are met, the cell is filled with '2'; otherwise, it retains its original value.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      next(
        (2 for obj in objs 
         if square(obj) and (i, j) == center(obj) and index(I, (i, j)) == mostcommon(I)),
        next(
          (v for obj in objs 
           for v, (si, sj) in obj 
           if square(obj) and (i, j) in toindices(obj)), 
          I[i][j] # Default to the original cell value
        )
      )
      for j in range(len(I[0]))
    )
    for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:**  Extracts all objects from the input grid.

2. **Nested Iteration and Filling:**  Iterates through each cell of the input grid. For each cell, it uses nested generator expressions to:
   - Prioritize filling with '2' if the cell is the center of a square object and that center has the background color.
   - Otherwise, fill with the color of the object the cell belongs to (if any).
   - Default to the original cell's color if it doesn't belong to a square object.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if any(
        (i+di, j+dj) in toindices(obj) 
        for di in range(-1,2) for dj in range(-1,2) 
        for obj in objects(I, T, F, F) 
        if square(obj) and index(I, center(obj)) == mostcommon(I)
      ) else I[i][j] 
      for j in range(len(I[0]))
    ) 
    for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Cell-Based Approach:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
2. **Square Detection and Filling:** For every cell, it checks if it's part of a 3x3 square where:
   - The square is an object.
   - The square's center color is the background color.
3. **Conditional Assignment:**  If a cell meets the conditions, it's assigned the value '2'; otherwise, it retains its original value.

These five programs use distinct strategies and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing diverse solutions to the problem.
