## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to modify the input grid by changing the color of cells within square objects. Here's a breakdown:

**General Logic:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The program first identifies all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is defined as a group of connected cells with the same color, where connectivity can be either four-directional (up, down, left, right) or eight-directional (including diagonals).
2. **Target Square Objects:** The program specifically targets objects that form a square shape.
3. **Modify Square Objects:**
   - **Internal Fill:**  The cells within the square object are filled with a specific color. 
     - If the center cell of the square object has the background color, the fill color is '2'.
     - If the center cell is not the background color, the fill color is the same as the center cell.
   - **Center Preservation:** The center cell of the square object retains its original color. 
4. **Non-Square Objects:** Objects that are not squares remain unchanged in the output grid.

**Example (Input_0 to Output_0):**

- Several square objects are present in the input (e.g., the 3x3 block of '1's). 
- For the 3x3 square, the center cell is '0' (background color). Therefore, the entire square is filled with '2', except for the center which remains '0'.
- Non-square objects, like the lines of '1's, are unchanged.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Identify objects in the grid
  new_grid = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Create an empty canvas
  for obj in objs:
    if square(obj):  # Check if the object is square
      center_color = index(I, center(obj))
      fill_color = 2 if center_color == mostcommon(I) else center_color 
      filled_obj = toobject(obj, canvas(fill_color, shape(obj)))  # Fill the object with the determined color
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, filled_obj) # Paint the filled object onto the canvas
    else:
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, obj)  # Paint non-square objects as they are
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification and Canvas Creation:**  Similar to Program_B, it identifies objects and creates a blank canvas.
2. **Square Object Handling:** It iterates through each object. If it's a square:
   - Determines the fill color based on the center cell's color.
   - Creates a new object representing the filled square.
   - Paints the filled object onto the canvas.
3. **Non-Square Object Handling:** Non-square objects are directly painted onto the canvas without modification.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)),  # Create an empty canvas
    merge(
      apply(
        lambda obj: toobject(obj, canvas(2 if index(I, center(obj)) == mostcommon(I) else index(I, center(obj)), shape(obj)))
        if square(obj) else obj, # Conditionally fill square objects
        objects(I, T, F, F) # Identify objects in the grid
      )
    ) 
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a more functional approach:

1. **Canvas Creation:**  Starts with creating a blank canvas.
2. **Object Processing:** Applies a lambda function to each identified object. 
   - Inside the lambda function, it conditionally fills the object with the appropriate color if it's a square, otherwise, it keeps the object unchanged.
3. **Painting and Merging:**  The modified objects are then merged and painted onto the canvas.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Create an empty canvas
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if contained((i, j),  toindices(extract(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: contained((i,j), toindices(obj)))) )  and square(extract(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: contained((i,j), toindices(obj)))):
        center_color = index(I, center(extract(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: contained((i,j), toindices(obj)))))
        fill_color = 2 if center_color == mostcommon(I) else center_color
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, fill_color, {(i, j)})
      else:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, value, {(i, j)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version adopts a cell-by-cell approach:

1. **Canvas Creation:** Starts by creating a blank canvas.
2. **Cell Iteration:** Iterates over each cell in the input grid.
3. **Object and Square Check:** For each cell, it checks if it belongs to a square object.
4. **Conditional Filling:** Based on the object type and center color, it fills the current cell on the canvas with the appropriate color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint( 
      canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), # Create an empty canvas
      merge(
          apply(
              lambda obj: recolor(
                2 if index(I, center(obj)) == mostcommon(I) else index(I, center(obj)), obj) if square(obj) else obj,
              objects(I, T, F, F) # Identify objects in the grid
          )
      )
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on directly recoloring objects:

1. **Canvas Creation:** Starts with a blank canvas.
2. **Object Recoloring:** Applies a lambda function to each identified object.
   - If the object is square, it uses `recolor` to change the color of the entire object to the appropriate fill color.
   - Non-square objects are left unchanged.
3. **Painting and Merging:** Recolored objects are merged and painted onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Identify all objects in the grid
    new_grid = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Create an empty canvas
    for obj in objs:
        if square(obj): # Check if the object is square
            for i, j in toindices(obj):
                center_color = index(I, center(obj))
                fill_color = 2 if center_color == mostcommon(I) else center_color
                new_grid = fill(new_grid, fill_color, {(i, j)}) # Fill cell by cell
        else:
            new_grid = paint(new_grid, obj)  # Paint non-square objects as they are
    return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version combines elements from previous versions:

1. **Object Identification and Canvas Creation:** It identifies objects and creates a blank canvas.
2. **Square Object Handling:** If the object is a square, it iterates through each cell within the object and fills it with the determined color.
3. **Non-Square Object Handling:** Non-square objects are directly painted onto the canvas without modification.

These different versions of the program demonstrate diverse ways to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
