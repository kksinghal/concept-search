## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid and replacing them with a different object based on their original shape. 

* **Square Objects:** Replaced with a smaller square of a different color (color '2' in the provided examples). The smaller square is positioned within the original square's boundaries, maintaining the same center.
* **Non-Square Objects:**  Remain unchanged.

**Input 0:**
* The top-left 3x3 square of '1's is replaced by a 3x3 square of '2's with the center '2' replaced by '1'.
* The other '1's and the background '0's remain unchanged.

**Input 1:**
* The 3x3 square of '1's is replaced by a 3x3 square of '2's with the center '2' replaced by '0'. 
* The other '1's and the background '0's remain unchanged.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Identify all objects in the grid
  new_grid = I
  for obj in objs:
    if square(obj): #Check if the object is square
      color_to_fill = 2
      if (index(I,center(obj)) !=  mostcommon(I)):
        color_to_fill = index(I,center(obj))
      new_grid = underfill(new_grid, color_to_fill , toindices(obj))
    
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all connected regions of the same digit.
2. **Iterate and Check:** The code iterates through each object (`obj`). 
3. **Square Check:** `square(obj)` determines if the current object is a square.
4. **Replace with Smaller Square:** If the object is square, `underfill` function is used to replace the original object with '2's while keeping the center digit intact. 
5. **Return Modified Grid:** The modified grid is returned as output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Identify all objects in the grid
  new_grid = canvas(mostcommon(I),shape(I)) #create an empty canvas
  for obj in objs:
    if not square(obj): #Check if the object is not square
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, obj)
    else:
      color_to_fill = 2
      if (index(I,center(obj)) !=  mostcommon(I)):
        color_to_fill = index(I,center(obj))
      temp_grid = canvas(color_to_fill, shape(obj))
      temp_grid = fill(temp_grid, index(I,center(obj)), {(center(obj)[0]-uppermost(obj),center(obj)[1]-leftmost(obj))})
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, toobject(obj,temp_grid))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all connected regions of the same digit.
2. **Create Empty Canvas** `canvas` function initiates an empty grid of background color
3. **Iterate and Check:** The code iterates through each object (`obj`). 
4. **Non-Square Check:** `square(obj)` determines if the current object is not a square.
5. **Paint to the new grid:** If the object is not a square, `paint` function is used to paint the object to new grid. 
6. **Else paint square:** If the object is square, a smaller square is created using `canvas` and `fill` function and then painted to the new grid using `paint` function.
7. **Return Modified Grid:** The modified grid is returned as output.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  new_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    if square(obj):
      color_to_fill = 2
      if (index(I,center(obj)) !=  mostcommon(I)):
        color_to_fill = index(I,center(obj))
      temp_grid = canvas(color_to_fill, shape(obj))
      temp_grid = fill(temp_grid, index(I,center(obj)), {(center(obj)[0]-uppermost(obj),center(obj)[1]-leftmost(obj))})
      new_objs.add(toobject(obj,temp_grid))
    else:
      new_objs.add(obj)
  new_grid = canvas(mostcommon(I),shape(I))
  for obj in new_objs:
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, obj)
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all connected regions of the same digit.
2. **Create a set of new objects:** An empty set is initiated to save modified objects. 
3. **Iterate and Check:** The code iterates through each object (`obj`). 
4. **Square Check:** `square(obj)` determines if the current object is a square.
5. **Modify and add to set:** If the object is square, a temporary grid is created of same size with desired modification and added to new object set. 
6. **Add to set:** if the object is not square, it is added to the new set.
7. **Create Empty Canvas** `canvas` function initiates an empty grid of background color
8. **Paint all the objects from set:** Iterate through the set of new objects and paint it to the new grid.
9. **Return Modified Grid:** The modified grid is returned as output.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  new_grid = I
  for obj in objs:
    if square(obj):
      color_to_fill = 2
      if (index(I,center(obj)) !=  mostcommon(I)):
        color_to_fill = index(I,center(obj))
      new_grid = fill(new_grid, color_to_fill, toindices(obj))
      new_grid = fill(new_grid, index(I,center(obj)), {center(obj)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all connected regions of the same digit.
2. **Iterate and Check:** The code iterates through each object (`obj`). 
3. **Square Check:** `square(obj)` determines if the current object is a square.
4. **Fill the square:** If the object is square, `fill` function is used to first fill the entire square with desired color while keeping the center digit intact.
5. **Fill the center:**  `fill` function is used again to paint the center with its original color. 
6. **Return Modified Grid:** The modified grid is returned as output.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  new_objs = [(obj,square(obj)) for obj in objs]
  new_grid = canvas(mostcommon(I),shape(I))
  for obj in new_objs:
    if obj[1]:
      color_to_fill = 2
      if (index(I,center(obj[0])) !=  mostcommon(I)):
        color_to_fill = index(I,center(obj[0]))
      temp_grid = canvas(color_to_fill, shape(obj[0]))
      temp_grid = fill(temp_grid, index(I,center(obj[0])), {(center(obj[0])[0]-uppermost(obj[0]),center(obj[0])[1]-leftmost(obj[0]))})
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, toobject(obj[0],temp_grid))
    else:
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, obj[0])
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all connected regions of the same digit.
2. **Create a list of objects with its property:** An empty list is initiated to save objects and their property (if it is square or not). 
3. **Create Empty Canvas** `canvas` function initiates an empty grid of background color
4. **Iterate through list:** The code iterates through each item in the list. 
5. **Check the property:** The property is checked, if it was square or not.
6. **Modify and paint:** If the object is square, a temporary grid is created of same size with desired modification and then painted to the new grid using `paint` function.
7. **Paint to the new grid:** If the object is not a square, `paint` function is used to paint the object to new grid. 
8. **Return Modified Grid:** The modified grid is returned as output.


These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation, each with a different combination of DSL functions and logic.
