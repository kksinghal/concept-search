## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying objects within the grid and rotating them by 90 degrees. The axis of rotation appears to be the upper-leftmost cell of the object. The object is then repainted with the value '2' at its new location. Let's break it down for each example:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Objects:** Several objects exist, including single-cell objects. 
2. **Rotation:** Each object is rotated 90 degrees clockwise around its upper-leftmost cell.
3. **Recoloring:** The rotated objects are repainted with the value '2'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. **Objects:** Again, multiple objects exist with varying sizes.
2. **Rotation:**  Each object is rotated 90 degrees clockwise around its upper-leftmost cell.
3. **Recoloring:**  The rotated objects are repainted with the value '2'.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" along with explanations:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  new_objs = frozenset({recolor(2, rot90(normalize(obj))) for obj in objs})
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(new_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies all distinct objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Rotate and Recolor:** For each object, we normalize its position (`normalize(obj)`) to have its upper-left corner at the origin (0,0). Then, we rotate it 90 degrees clockwise (`rot90(...)`) and recolor it with value '2' (`recolor(2, ...)`)
3. **Paint on Canvas:**  A new canvas of the same size as the input grid and filled with the background color is created (`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`). The rotated and recolored objects are painted onto this canvas (`paint(..., merge(new_objs))`).

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(rot90(normalize(obj)), ulcorner(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:**  Start with a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input.
2. **Iterate and Transform:** Loop through each object in the input grid. Normalize, rotate, and recolor each object as in version 1. Then, shift the rotated object back to its original position using `shift(..., ulcorner(obj))` and paint it onto the canvas.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    O = paint(cover(O, obj), recolor(2, shift(rot90(normalize(obj)), ulcorner(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Modification:** Instead of a separate canvas, this version directly modifies the input grid 'I'.
2. **Iterative Overwrite:** For each object, we first 'erase' it from the grid using `cover(O, obj)`. We then calculate the rotated and recolored version of the object and paint it onto the grid at the correct position. 

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  transformed_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(2, shift(rot90(normalize(obj)), ulcorner(obj))), objects(I, True, False, True))
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(transformed_objs))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Functional Approach:** This version utilizes `apply` for a more functional programming style.
2. **Transformation Pipeline:** A lambda function is defined that encompasses the normalization, rotation, recoloring, and shifting operations. This lambda function is then applied to each object extracted from the input grid using `apply`. Finally, the transformed objects are merged and painted onto a blank canvas.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def transform_object(obj):
        return recolor(2, shift(rot90(normalize(obj)), ulcorner(obj)))
    
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
        O = paint(O, transform_object(obj)) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Abstraction with Function:** This version introduces a separate function `transform_object` to encapsulate the object transformation logic, improving code readability.
2. **Step-by-Step Transformation:**  Similar to version 2, it iterates through each object, applies the `transform_object` function to it, and then paints the transformed object onto the canvas. 

These are five distinct solutions for the "Program_to_be_generated", each offering a slightly different approach while utilizing the provided DSL functions to achieve the desired grid transformation.
