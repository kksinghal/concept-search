## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to identify specific objects based on their shape and neighborhood relationships and then recolors those objects while preserving the rest of the grid. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* A vertical line object (3 cells) adjacent to a square object (9 cells) is identified.
* The vertical line object is recolored to '2'.
* The square object is recolored to '2' except for its rightmost column, which remains '1'. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

*  A horizontal line object (3 cells) adjacent to a square object (9 cells) is identified.
* The horizontal line object is recolored to '2'.
* The square object is recolored to '2' except for its topmost row, which remains '1'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions for "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, F)
  x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda o: square(o) and size(o) == 9)
  x3 = extract(x2, lambda o: size(sfilter(x1, rbind(adjacent, o))) > 0)
  x4 = extract(x1, rbind(adjacent, x3))
  x5 = color(x4)
  x6 = recolor(x5, x4)
  x7 = difference(toindices(x3), connect(ulcorner(x3),urcorner(x3)))
  x8 = recolor(x5, toobject(x7, I))
  O = paint(paint(I, x6), x8)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `x1 = objects(I, T, F, F)` extracts all objects from the grid.
2. **Find Square Objects:** `x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda o: square(o) and size(o) == 9)` filters for square objects with 9 cells.
3. **Locate Adjacent Square:** `x3 = extract(x2, lambda o: size(sfilter(x1, rbind(adjacent, o))) > 0)` finds the square object adjacent to another object.
4. **Find Adjacent Object:** `x4 = extract(x1, rbind(adjacent, x3))` extracts the object adjacent to the located square object.
5. **Get Object Color:** `x5 = color(x4)` retrieves the color of the adjacent object.
6. **Recolor Adjacent Object:** `x6 = recolor(x5, x4)` recolors the entire adjacent object with its own color.
7. **Identify Recoloring Area in Square:** `x7 = difference(toindices(x3), connect(ulcorner(x3),urcorner(x3)))` calculates the indices of the square to recolor, excluding the top (or rightmost) line.
8. **Recolor Square:** `x8 = recolor(x5, toobject(x7, I))` creates an object with the desired recoloring.
9. **Combine Recolored Objects:** `O = paint(paint(I, x6), x8)` paints both recolored objects onto the original grid.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, F)
  x2 = argmin(x1, size)
  x3 = extract(x1, rbind(adjacent, x2))
  x4 = color(x3)
  x5 = recolor(x4, x2)
  x6 = position(x2, x3)
  x7 = branch(x6[1] != 0, vconcat(repeat((x4,), height(x3)-1), ((0,),)), hconcat(repeat(((x4,),), width(x3)-1), ((0,),)))
  x8 = shift(asobject(x7), ulcorner(x3))
  x9 = recolor(x4, intersection(toindices(x8), toindices(x3)))
  O = paint(paint(I, x5), x9)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects & Smallest:** Similar to version 1, but finds the smallest object directly (`x2`).
2. **Find Adjacent Object and Color:**  Identifies and retrieves the color of the object adjacent to the smallest (`x3`, `x4`).
3. **Recolor Smallest Object:** Recolors the smallest object with the adjacent object's color (`x5`).
4. **Determine Relative Position and Generate Mask:**  Calculates the relative position (`x6`) and generates a mask (`x7`) for recoloring the larger object, leaving one row/column unchanged.
5. **Position Mask:** Shifts the mask to align with the larger object (`x8`).
6. **Recolor Larger Object:** Recolors the overlapping area between the mask and larger object (`x9`).
7. **Combine Recolored Objects:** Paints both recolored objects onto the original grid.


### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, F)
  x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda o: square(o) and size(o) == 9)
  x3 = extract(x2, lambda o: size(sfilter(x1, rbind(adjacent, o))) > 0)
  x4 = extract(x1, rbind(adjacent, x3))
  x5 = color(x4)
  x6 = recolor(x5, x4)
  x7 = branch(vmatching(x3, x4), hsplit(subgrid(x3, I), width(x3)), vsplit(subgrid(x3, I), height(x3)))
  x8 = branch(vmatching(x3, x4), last(x7), first(x7))
  x9 = recolor(x5, asobject(x8))
  x10 = shift(x9, ulcorner(x3))
  O = paint(paint(I, x6), x10)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects, Square, Adjacent:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Get Adjacent Object Color & Recolor:**  Retrieves the adjacent object's color and recolors it (`x5`, `x6`).
3. **Split Square and Select:** Splits the square object either horizontally or vertically based on adjacency and selects the appropriate part for recoloring (`x7`, `x8`).
4. **Recolor Selection:** Recolors the selected part of the square object (`x9`).
5. **Position and Paint:** Positions the recolored part correctly on the grid and combines it with the recolored smaller object (`x10`, `O`).

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, F)
  x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda o: square(o) and size(o) == 9)
  x3 = extract(x2, lambda o: size(sfilter(x1, rbind(adjacent, o))) > 0)
  x4 = extract(x1, rbind(adjacent, x3))
  x5 = color(x4)
  x6 = recolor(x5, x4)
  x7 = branch(vmatching(x3, x4), hconcat(canvas(x5, (height(x3), width(x3)-1)), canvas(0, (height(x3), 1))), vconcat(canvas(x5, (height(x3)-1, width(x3))), canvas(0, (1, width(x3)))))
  x8 = asobject(x7)
  x9 = shift(x8, ulcorner(x3))
  O = paint(paint(I, x6), x9)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects, Square, Adjacent:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Get Adjacent Object Color & Recolor:** Retrieves the adjacent object's color and recolors it (`x5`, `x6`).
3. **Construct Recolored Part:** Creates a new object representing the recolored part of the square, leaving one row or column blank (`x7`).
4. **Convert to Object & Position:** Converts the newly constructed part to an object and positions it on the grid (`x8`, `x9`).
5. **Combine & Return:** Combines the recolored objects and returns the final grid.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, F)
  x2 = argmin(x1, size)
  x3 = extract(x1, rbind(adjacent, x2))
  x4 = color(x3)
  x5 = recolor(x4, x2)
  x6 = box(x3)
  x7 = difference(toindices(x3), x6)
  x8 = recolor(x4, toobject(x7, I))
  O = paint(paint(I, x5), x8)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects & Smallest:** Similar to version 2.
2. **Find Adjacent Object and Color:**  Identifies and retrieves the color of the object adjacent to the smallest (`x3`, `x4`).
3. **Recolor Smallest Object:** Recolors the smallest object with the adjacent object's color (`x5`).
4. **Create Outline:** Creates the outline (`x6`) of the larger object.
5. **Identify Inside Area:** Calculates the difference between the larger object and its outline, obtaining the area to be recolored (`x7`).
6. **Recolor Inside Area:** Recolors the identified inside area with the color of the smaller object (`x8`).
7. **Combine Recolored Objects:** Paints both recolored objects onto the original grid.


These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches using different combinations and logic within the DSL to achieve the desired transformation. They showcase various ways to identify objects, manipulate their shapes, and recolor specific areas based on adjacency and spatial relationships.
