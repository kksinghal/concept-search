## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation logic for the given input-output pairs is as follows:

**For each connected object:**

1. **Identify squares:** Determine if the object's bounding box forms a square.
2. **Fill based on center:** 
   - If the object is **square** and its center cell value is the **background color**, fill the entire object with the color '2'.
   - If the object is **square** and its center cell value is **not the background color**, fill the entire object with the color of its center cell.
   - If the object is **not square**, leave it unchanged.

**Note:** The background color is the most frequent color in the input grid.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" that achieve the desired transformation:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Identify connected objects
  new_grid = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Create empty canvas
  for obj in objs:
    if square(obj):  # Check if object is a square
      center_val = index(I, center(obj))
      fill_val = 2 if center_val == mostcommon(I) else center_val
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, recolor(fill_val, toindices(obj)))  # Fill with appropriate color
    else:
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, obj) # Keep non-square objects unchanged
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all connected objects in the input grid.
2. **Create canvas:** `canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))` creates an empty grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
3. **Iterate and process:** The code iterates through each object:
   - **Square check:** `square(obj)` determines if the object is a square.
   - **Fill color logic:** `center_val` gets the center cell's value. `fill_val` is set to '2' if the center is background, otherwise it's set to the center cell's value.
   - **Fill and paint:** `recolor(fill_val, toindices(obj))` creates a new object with the determined fill color. This object is then painted onto the canvas using `paint(new_grid, ...)`.
   - **Non-square handling:**  If the object is not a square, it is painted directly onto the canvas without any modification.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), # Create empty canvas
    merge(
      apply(
        lambda obj: recolor(2 if index(I, center(obj)) == mostcommon(I) else index(I, center(obj)), toindices(obj)) 
                    if square(obj) else obj, # Conditional recoloring for squares
        objects(I, T, F, F) # Identify objects
      )
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a more functional approach:

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies connected objects.
2. **Conditional recoloring:** A lambda function is applied to each object using `apply`:
   - **Square check and recolor:** `square(obj)` determines if the object is a square. If so, `recolor(...)` is used to fill it with '2' if the center is background, otherwise with the center cell's color. 
   - **Non-square handling:** If the object is not a square, it's returned unchanged.
3. **Merge and paint:** `merge(...)` combines all the processed objects, and `paint(...)` paints them onto the canvas created with `canvas(...)`.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), # Create empty canvas
    frozenset(
      (2 if index(I, center(obj)) == mostcommon(I) else index(I, center(obj)), idx) if square(obj) 
      else (v, idx) 
      for obj in objects(I, T, F, F) for v, idx in obj
    )
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version further compresses the logic using set comprehension:

1. **Identify objects and iterate:**  The code iterates through each object and its cells using nested loops within the set comprehension.
2. **Conditional cell recoloring:**  For each cell `(v, idx)`:
   - **Square check and recolor:** If the cell belongs to a square object `(square(obj))`, its value `v` is conditionally replaced with '2' (if the center is background) or the center cell's value. 
   - **Non-square handling:**  If the cell belongs to a non-square object, its original value is retained.
3. **Paint:** The resulting set of modified cells is directly painted onto the canvas created with `canvas(...)`.


### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: (i,j) in toindices(obj)) # Find object at location
      if square(obj) and (i, j) in toindices(obj):  # Only process cells within square objects
        center_val = index(I, center(obj))
        fill_val = 2 if center_val == mostcommon(I) else center_val
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, fill_val, {(i, j)})  # Fill individual cell
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates over the grid and utilizes `extract`:

1. **Iterate over grid:** The code uses nested loops to iterate over each cell in the input grid.
2. **Find object at location:**  `extract(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: (i,j) in toindices(obj))` finds the object to which the current cell belongs.
3. **Process square objects:**
   - **Square check:** If the object is square and the current cell is part of it, proceed with filling.
   - **Fill color logic:**  Determine the appropriate fill color based on the center cell.
   - **Fill cell:** `fill(new_grid, fill_val, {(i, j)})` fills the current cell on the canvas with the determined color.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_cell(i, j):
    obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: (i, j) in toindices(obj))
    return (2 if index(I, center(obj)) == mostcommon(I) else index(I, center(obj)), (i, j)) if square(obj) else (I[i][j], (i, j))
  
  return paint(
    canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), 
    frozenset(process_cell(i, j) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0])))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a helper function and set comprehension for a concise representation:

1. **Helper function `process_cell`:**  Takes cell coordinates `(i, j)` as input and returns the modified cell value and coordinates based on the transformation logic.
   - **Find object:** `extract(...)` finds the object for the current cell.
   - **Conditional processing:** Applies the same square checking and fill color logic as before.
2. **Set comprehension and paint:**  The code uses set comprehension to apply `process_cell` to each cell in the grid, generating a set of modified cells. Finally, `paint(...)` paints these cells onto a blank canvas.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformation, offering a range of options for code generation. Each version prioritizes a different aspect: conciseness, readability, functional programming, or a combination of these.
