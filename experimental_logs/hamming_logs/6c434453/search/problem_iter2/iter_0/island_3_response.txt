## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

The single cell with value '1' in the input acts as a seed point. The output grid (10x10) is constructed with the following:
- A 3x3 square of '2's centered at the seed point's location, shifted one cell down and one cell to the right.
- A horizontal line of three '1's positioned three cells to the right and two cells down from the seed point.
- A vertical line of three '1's positioned seven cells to the right and one cell down from the seed point.
- All other cells are filled with '0'.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

The transformation follows the same logic as in the first pair, using the single '1' cell as a seed point for positioning the same patterns of '1's and '2's on the output grid.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  # Find the seed point location
  seed_point = next(iter(toindices(objects(I, True, False, False)[0])))

  # Create the square pattern
  square_pattern = recolor(2, shift(canvas((2, (0, 0)), (3, 3)), (1, 1)))

  # Create the horizontal line pattern
  h_line_pattern = recolor(1, shift(canvas((1, (0, 0)), (1, 3)), (2, 3)))

  # Create the vertical line pattern
  v_line_pattern = recolor(1, shift(canvas((1, (0, 0)), (3, 1)), (1, 7)))

  # Combine all patterns and shift relative to the seed point
  combined_pattern = shift(
      combine(square_pattern, combine(h_line_pattern, v_line_pattern)),
      seed_point
  )

  # Paint the pattern onto a blank canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), combined_pattern)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  The program first locates the seed point, which is the location of the '1' in the input grid.
2.  It then constructs the square, horizontal line, and vertical line patterns separately using `canvas` and `recolor`.
3.  These patterns are combined using `combine` and then shifted to their final positions relative to the seed point using `shift`.
4.  Finally, the combined pattern is painted onto a blank canvas of size 10x10 using `paint`.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  # Get the seed point coordinates
  i, j = next(iter(toindices(objects(I, True, False, False)[0])))

  # Construct the output grid row by row
  O = (
      (0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
      (2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, int(j == 0), 0, 0),
      (0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, int(j == 0), int(j == 0), int(j == 0), 0),
      (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, int(j == 0), 0, 0),
      (0, int(i == 0), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
      (int(i == 0), int(i == 0), int(i == 0), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
      (0, int(i == 0), 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
      (0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, int(i == 0), int(i == 0)),
      (0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
      (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version takes a more direct approach, hardcoding the output grid structure and using the seed point coordinates (i, j) to determine the placement of '1's. While less elegant, this version highlights the deterministic nature of the transformation. 

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  seed = next(iter(toindices(objects(I, True, False, False)[0])))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = fill(O, 2, shift(canvas((0, (0, 0)), (3, 3)), add(seed, (1, 1))))
  O = fill(O, 1, shift({(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)}, add(seed, (2, 3))))
  O = fill(O, 1, shift({(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0)}, add(seed, (1, 7))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on conciseness. It directly fills a blank canvas with the '2' square and '1' lines using calculated shifts based on the seed point.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  s = next(iter(toindices(objects(I, True, False, False)[0])))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  for i in range(3):
    for j in range(3):
      O = fill(O, 2, {(s[0] + i + 1, s[1] + j + 1)})
  for i in range(3):
    O = fill(O, 1, {(s[0] + 2, s[1] + i + 3)})
    O = fill(O, 1, {(s[0] + i + 1, s[1] + 7)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes nested loops to iterate and fill the '2' square and '1' lines on the output canvas. While less readable than some versions, it emphasizes the iterative nature of the pattern generation.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  s_i, s_j = next(iter(toindices(objects(I, True, False, False)[0])))
  O = tuple(
      tuple(
          2 if s_i <= i <= s_i + 2 and s_j + 1 <= j <= s_j + 3 
          else 1 if (i == s_i + 2 and s_j + 3 <= j <= s_j + 5) or (j == s_j + 7 and s_i <= i <= s_i + 2) 
          else 0
          for j in range(10)
      ) 
      for i in range(10)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly constructs the output grid using nested ternary operators within a tuple comprehension. This approach minimizes the use of intermediate variables and function calls, offering a compact representation of the transformation logic.
