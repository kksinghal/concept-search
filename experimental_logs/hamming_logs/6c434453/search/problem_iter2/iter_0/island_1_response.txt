## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

The single cell at the top left corner of the input grid acts as an "instruction" cell, dictating the placement of a specific pattern on the output grid.  The output features two diagonal lines of '2's, one starting one cell down and one cell right from the top left corner and extending downwards, and another starting three cells down and seven cells right from the top left corner and extending downwards. The rest of the grid is filled with '0's, and there is a small horizontal line of '1's extending to the right from seven cells down and seven cells right from the top left corner.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

Similar to the previous transformation, the single cell in the input acts as an instruction. This time, the output features two diagonal lines of '2's, one starting four cells down and five cells right from the top left corner and extending downwards, and another starting one cell down and five cells right from the top left corner and extending downwards. A small horizontal line of '1's extends to the right from three cells down and eight cells right from the top left corner, and another horizontal line of '1's extends to the right from eight cells down and six cells right from the top left corner. The rest of the grid is filled with '0's.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) # Initialize a blank canvas
  if index(I, (0, 0)) == 1:
    O = fill(O, 2, connect((1, 1), (10, 10))) # Draw the first diagonal line
    O = fill(O, 2, connect((3, 7), (10, 14))) # Draw the second diagonal line
    O = fill(O, 1, connect((7, 7), (7, 9))) # Draw the horizontal line
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Initializes a blank canvas `O` of size 10x10 filled with '0's.
- Checks if the input grid `I` has a '1' at position (0, 0).
- If true, it fills the canvas with '2's along two diagonal lines using `connect` and `fill`.
- Then, it draws a horizontal line of '1's using `connect` and `fill`.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))  # Create a canvas with the same shape as the input
  if size(objects(I, T, F, F)) > 0: # Check if there are any objects in the input
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, connect((1, 1), (9, 9)))) # Draw the first diagonal
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, connect((3, 7), (7, 11)))) # Draw the second diagonal
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, connect((7, 7), (7, 9)))) # Draw the horizontal line
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Creates a canvas `O` of the same shape as the input `I`, filled with '0's.
- Checks if there are any objects in the input grid.
- If true, it paints '2's along two diagonal lines on the canvas using `connect`, `recolor`, and `paint`.
- Finally, it paints a horizontal line of '1's using `connect`, `recolor`, and `paint`.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) # Initialize a blank canvas
  obj = asobject(I) # Convert the input grid to an object
  if size(obj) > 0: # Check if the object is not empty
    O = fill(O, 2, shift(connect((0, 0), (9, 9)), (1, 1))) # Draw the first diagonal line
    O = fill(O, 2, shift(connect((0, 0), (3, 7)), (3, 7))) # Draw the second diagonal line
    O = fill(O, 1, connect((7, 7), (7, 9))) # Draw the horizontal line
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Initializes a blank canvas `O` of size 10x10 filled with '0's.
- Converts the input grid `I` into an object `obj`.
- If `obj` is not empty, it draws two diagonal lines of '2's by shifting and filling pre-defined lines created with `connect`.
- Then, it draws a horizontal line of '1's using `connect` and `fill`.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) # Initialize a blank canvas
  if colorcount(I, 1) > 0: # Check if the input grid has any '1's
    line1 = connect((1, 1), (10, 10)) # Define the first diagonal line
    line2 = connect((3, 7), (10, 14)) # Define the second diagonal line
    hline = connect((7, 7), (7, 9)) # Define the horizontal line
    O = fill(O, 2, line1) # Draw the first diagonal line
    O = fill(O, 2, line2) # Draw the second diagonal line
    O = fill(O, 1, hline) # Draw the horizontal line
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Initializes a blank canvas `O` of size 10x10 filled with '0's.
- Checks if the input grid `I` has any cells with the value '1'.
- If true, it defines the coordinates for two diagonal lines and a horizontal line.
- Finally, it fills the canvas with the defined lines, using '2' for the diagonals and '1' for the horizontal line.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  height, width = shape(I)  # Get the height and width of the input grid
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))  # Create a blank canvas of size 10x10
  if height > 0 and width > 0:  # Check if the input grid is not empty
    O = fill(O, 2, shoot((1, 1), (1, 1)))  # Draw the first diagonal
    O = fill(O, 2, shoot((3, 7), (1, 1)))  # Draw the second diagonal
    O = fill(O, 1, connect((7, 7), (7, 9)))  # Draw the horizontal line
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Calculates the `height` and `width` of the input grid `I`.
- Creates a blank canvas `O` of size 10x10 filled with '0's.
- Checks if the input grid is not empty (has both height and width greater than 0).
- If true, it draws two diagonal lines of '2's using `shoot` and `fill` functions.
- Finally, it draws a horizontal line of '1's using `connect` and `fill`.
