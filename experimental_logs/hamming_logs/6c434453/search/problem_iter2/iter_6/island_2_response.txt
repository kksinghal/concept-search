## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

The transformation involves identifying the location of the digit '1' in the input grid and then generating a specific 'C' shaped pattern of '2's around it. The 'C' shape opens towards the bottom-right, with its top left corner one cell diagonally down and right from the '1'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

This transformation mirrors the logic of the first one. The code identifies the '1' in the input and generates the same 'C' shaped pattern of '2's around it. The position and orientation of the 'C' remain consistent with the first transformation. 

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the object containing '1'
  one_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 1))
  # Calculate offset for the 'C' shape
  offset = (uppermost(one_obj) + 1, leftmost(one_obj) + 1)
  # Define the 'C' shape
  c_shape = {(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), 
             (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 8), 
             (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 1)}
  # Shift the 'C' shape to the calculated offset
  shifted_c = shift(c_shape, offset)
  # Create a blank canvas
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  # Fill the 'C' shape with '2's
  O = fill(O, 2, shifted_c)
  # Paint the original '1' back onto the canvas
  O = paint(O, one_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1':**  The code identifies the object containing the digit '1' in the input grid.
2. **Calculate Offset:** It determines the position of the 'C' shape by calculating an offset from the '1's location. 
3. **Define 'C' Shape:**  A set of coordinates representing the desired 'C' shape is defined.
4. **Shift and Fill:** The 'C' shape is shifted to the calculated offset and filled with '2's on a blank canvas.
5. **Paint Original:** The '1' from the input grid is painted back onto the canvas at its original position. 

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the indices of '1' in the input grid
  one_indices = toindices(first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 1)))
  # Calculate the center of the '1'
  center_i, center_j = center(one_indices)
  # Define a function to check if an index is part of the 'C' shape
  def is_c_shape(i, j):
    return (i == center_i + 1 and 1 <= j - center_j <= 8) or \
           (j == center_j + 1 and 0 <= i - center_i <= 6) or \
           (i == center_i + 2 and 1 <= j - center_j <= 2) or \
           (i == center_i + 3 and j == center_j + 8) 
  # Create a blank canvas
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  # Iterate through each cell of the canvas
  for i in range(len(O)):
    for j in range(len(O[0])):
      # Fill the cell with '2' if it belongs to the 'C' shape
      if is_c_shape(i, j):
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})
      # Otherwise, if the cell corresponds to the original '1', keep it as '1'
      elif (i, j) in one_indices:
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1':**  Finds the indices of the '1' in the input grid.
2. **Calculate Center:**  Calculates the center coordinates of the '1'.
3. **Define `is_c_shape` Function:**  Defines a function to determine if a given coordinate (i, j) falls within the boundaries of the 'C' shape relative to the calculated center.
4. **Iterate and Fill:** Iterates through every cell of a blank canvas. If the cell's coordinates satisfy the `is_c_shape` condition, it's filled with '2'; if the cell's coordinates match the original '1' indices, it's filled with '1'. Otherwise, the cell remains empty (filled with '0').

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the '1' object
  one_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 1))
  # Define the base 'C' shape
  c_shape = {(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)}
  # Extend the 'C' shape horizontally
  c_shape |= {(2, j) for j in range(3, 9)}
  # Extend the 'C' shape vertically
  c_shape |= {(i, 1) for i in range(3, 6)}
  # Add the final point of the 'C'
  c_shape |= {(3, 8)}
  # Calculate offset based on '1' location
  offset = (uppermost(one_obj) + 1, leftmost(one_obj) + 1)
  # Shift the 'C' shape
  shifted_c = shift(c_shape, offset)
  # Create a blank canvas
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  # Fill the 'C' shape with '2'
  O = fill(O, 2, shifted_c)
  # Paint the original '1' back
  O = paint(O, one_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1':** Finds the object containing '1'.
2. **Build 'C' Shape:** Constructs the 'C' shape incrementally by defining its base and then extending it horizontally and vertically. 
3. **Calculate Offset and Shift:** Determines the correct position for the 'C' based on the '1's location and shifts the shape.
4. **Fill and Paint:** Fills the shifted 'C' shape with '2's on a blank canvas and paints the original '1' back.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the '1' object
  one_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 1))
  # Get the upper-left corner of the '1' object
  corner_i, corner_j = ulcorner(one_obj)
  # Create a blank canvas
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  # Define a lambda function to check if a cell is part of the 'C'
  is_c = lambda i, j: (i == corner_i+1 and corner_j+1 <= j <= corner_j+8) or \
                       (j == corner_j+1 and corner_i <= i <= corner_i+6) or \
                       (i == corner_i+2 and corner_j+1 <= j <= corner_j+2) or \
                       (i == corner_i+3 and j == corner_j+8)
  # Fill the canvas
  O = tuple(tuple(2 if is_c(i, j) else (1 if (i, j) == (corner_i, corner_j) else 0) 
                 for j in range(len(O[0])))
            for i in range(len(O)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1' and Get Corner:**  Finds the '1' object and gets the coordinates of its upper-left corner.
2. **Create Canvas:**  Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input.
3. **Lambda Function `is_c`:** Defines a lambda function to determine if a cell at coordinates (i, j) is part of the 'C' shape, relative to the '1's upper-left corner.
4. **Fill Canvas:** Uses nested list comprehensions to iterate through the canvas cells. For each cell, it checks:
   - If `is_c(i, j)` is True: Fill with '2'.
   - If the cell is the '1's upper-left corner: Fill with '1'.
   - Otherwise: Fill with '0'. 

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the '1' object
  one_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 1))
  # Get the center of the '1' object
  ci, cj = center(one_obj)
  # Define horizontal and vertical lines of the 'C'
  hlines = {((ci + 1, cj + j), (ci + 1, cj + j)) for j in range(1, 9)}
  vlines = {((ci + i, cj + 1), (ci + i, cj + 1)) for i in range(7)}
  # Additional points for the 'C'
  extra = {((ci + 2, cj + 1), (ci + 2, cj + 1)), 
           ((ci + 2, cj + 2), (ci + 2, cj + 2)),
           ((ci + 3, cj + 8), (ci + 3, cj + 8))}
  # Combine all parts of the 'C'
  c_shape =  hlines | vlines | extra
  # Create a blank canvas
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  # Paint the 'C' shape onto the canvas
  for (i1, j1), (i2, j2) in c_shape:
    O = fill(O, 2, {(i1, j1)})
  # Paint the original '1' back onto the canvas
  O = paint(O, one_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1' and Get Center:** Finds the '1' object and its center coordinates.
2. **Construct 'C' Shape:**  Defines the 'C' shape by creating sets for its horizontal and vertical lines and adding additional points.
3. **Combine 'C' Parts:** Combines all parts of the 'C' into a single set.
4. **Paint on Canvas:** Creates a blank canvas and iterates through the 'C' shape set, filling each point with '2'. Then, it paints the original '1' back onto the canvas.
