## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

The transformation places a "C" shape open to the right, made of the digit '2', around the input '1'. The 'C' has a height of 3 units and a width of 9 units. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

This transformation also places a right-facing "C" shape made of '2' around the input '1'. However, this 'C' is positioned differently: its top-left corner is two cells to the right and one cell above the input '1'. The dimensions of the 'C' remain the same as in the previous transformation.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the described transformations:

**Program Version 1:** (Using direct index manipulation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Find the location of '1'
    loc = toindices(objects(I, True, False, False)).pop()
    # Define the 'C' shape indices relative to '1'
    c_shape = {(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 1)}
    # Shift the 'C' shape indices to the '1' location
    shifted_shape = shift(c_shape, loc)
    # Create a blank canvas
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    # Fill the canvas with '2' at the shifted shape indices
    O = fill(O, 2, shifted_shape)
    # Place the original '1' back on the canvas
    O = fill(O, 1, {loc})
    return O
```

**Explanation:** 

1.  **Locate '1':** The code first identifies the location of the digit '1' in the input grid.
2.  **Define 'C' Shape:** It then defines the indices of the 'C' shape relative to the '1' location.
3.  **Shift and Fill:** The 'C' shape indices are shifted to the actual '1' location, and a blank canvas is filled with '2' at these shifted indices.
4.  **Replace '1':** Finally, the original '1' is placed back at its initial location on the canvas.

**Program Version 2:** (Using horizontal and vertical line construction)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Find the location of '1'
    loc = toindices(objects(I, True, False, False)).pop()
    # Define start and end points for lines of the 'C'
    top_left = add(loc, (0, 1))
    bottom_left = add(loc, (2, 1))
    top_right = add(loc, (0, 8))
    bottom_right = add(loc, (2, 8))
    # Create the 'C' shape using lines
    c_shape = connect(top_left, top_right) | connect(top_left, bottom_left) | connect(bottom_left, bottom_right)
    # Create a blank canvas
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    # Fill the canvas with '2' at the 'C' shape indices
    O = fill(O, 2, c_shape)
    # Place the original '1' back on the canvas
    O = fill(O, 1, {loc})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Locate '1':** Similar to Version 1, the code locates the '1' digit.
2.  **Define Line Endpoints:** It determines the start and end points for the horizontal and vertical lines that constitute the 'C' shape.
3.  **Construct 'C' with Lines:** Using the `connect` function, it creates the lines and combines them to form the complete 'C' shape.
4.  **Fill and Replace:** The process of filling the canvas and replacing the '1' remains the same as in Version 1.

**Program Version 3:** (Utilizing shape mirroring and combination)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Find the location of '1'
    loc = toindices(objects(I, True, False, False)).pop()
    # Define half of the 'C' shape 
    half_c = {(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)}
    # Mirror the half shape horizontally
    mirrored_half = hmirror(half_c)
    # Combine both halves to create the full 'C' shape
    full_c = half_c | mirrored_half
    # Shift the full shape to the '1' location
    shifted_c = shift(full_c, loc)
    # Create a blank canvas
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    # Fill the canvas with '2' at the shifted shape indices
    O = fill(O, 2, shifted_c)
    # Place the original '1' back on the canvas
    O = fill(O, 1, {loc})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Locate '1':**  The code starts by finding the position of '1'.
2.  **Define and Mirror:**  It defines one half of the 'C' and then mirrors it horizontally to obtain the other half.
3.  **Combine and Shift:** Both halves are combined to form the full 'C', which is then shifted to the '1' location.
4.  **Fill and Replace:** The remaining steps involve filling the canvas and replacing the '1' as in previous versions.

**Program Version 4:** (Employing a drawing sequence)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Find the location of '1'
    loc = toindices(objects(I, True, False, False)).pop()
    # Define a sequence of movements to draw the 'C'
    movements = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, -1), (0, -1), (0, -1), (0, -1), (0, -1), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)]
    # Start drawing from the right of '1'
    current_loc = add(loc, (0, 1))
    # Create a blank canvas
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    # Iterate through the movements to draw the 'C'
    for move in movements:
        current_loc = add(current_loc, move)
        O = fill(O, 2, {current_loc})
    # Place the original '1' back on the canvas
    O = fill(O, 1, {loc})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Locate '1':** The initial step is to locate the '1' digit.
2.  **Define Movement Sequence:** A sequence of movements (up, down, left, right) is defined to trace the outline of the 'C' shape.
3.  **Iterate and Draw:** Starting from a position adjacent to the '1', the code iterates through the movement sequence, updating the current location and filling the canvas at each step to draw the 'C'.
4.  **Replace '1':** Finally, the '1' is placed back in its original position.

**Program Version 5:** (Using object manipulation and painting)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Find the '1' object
    obj = objects(I, True, False, False).pop()
    # Define a small horizontal line as the base for the 'C'
    base_line = {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8)}
    # Create the top and bottom lines of the 'C'
    top_line = shift(base_line, add(ulcorner(obj), (0, 1)))
    bottom_line = shift(base_line, add(ulcorner(obj), (2, 1)))
    # Create the left side of the 'C'
    left_side = {(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0)}
    left_side = shift(left_side, add(ulcorner(obj), (0, 1)))
    # Combine all parts to form the complete 'C'
    c_shape = top_line | bottom_line | left_side
    # Create a blank canvas
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    # Paint the 'C' shape onto the canvas
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, c_shape))
    # Paint the original '1' back onto the canvas
    O = paint(O, obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Locate '1' Object:** Instead of finding the index, this version identifies the '1' as an object.
2.  **Construct 'C' from Parts:** It creates the 'C' shape by defining a base horizontal line and then shifting and combining it to form the top, bottom, and left side of the 'C'.
3.  **Paint on Canvas:** The constructed 'C' shape is then painted onto a blank canvas using the `paint` function.
4.  **Paint Original '1':**  Finally, the original '1' object is painted back onto the canvas.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and diverse capabilities of the provided DSL.
