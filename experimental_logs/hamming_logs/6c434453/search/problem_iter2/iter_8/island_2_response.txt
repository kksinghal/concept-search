## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* Identify the location of the digit '1' in the input grid.
* Construct a 'C' shaped object composed of the digit '2' with its top-left corner at the location of the '1' in the input grid.
* The 'C' shape follows a specific pattern: 
    * A vertical line of length 6 units starting from the top-left corner.
    * A horizontal line of length 3 units extending to the right from the bottom of the vertical line.
    * A short vertical line of length 2 units extending upwards from the right end of the horizontal line. 
* The output grid is a 10x10 grid where the 'C' shape is filled with '2' and the rest of the cells are filled with '0'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* This transformation follows the same logic as the previous one, but the 'C' shape is mirrored horizontally. 


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code using the DSL provided:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_loc = ulcorner(objects(I, True, False, False))  # Find location of '1'
  c_shape = {(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), 
             (5, 1), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2)}  # Base 'C' shape
  c_shape = shift(c_shape, one_loc)  # Shift 'C' to '1' location
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))  # Create 10x10 canvas
  O = fill(O, 2, c_shape)  # Fill 'C' with '2'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' location:**  `one_loc = ulcorner(objects(I, True, False, False))` identifies all objects ('1' in this case) and finds the upper-left corner of the first object.
2. **Define 'C' shape:**  A base 'C' shape is defined using a set of relative indices.
3. **Shift 'C':**  `c_shape = shift(c_shape, one_loc)` moves the 'C' shape to the location of '1'.
4. **Create canvas and fill:**  A 10x10 canvas is created and the shifted 'C' shape is filled with '2'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))  # Create 10x10 canvas
  one_loc = ulcorner(objects(I, True, False, False))  # Find location of '1'
  for i in range(6):  # Vertical line
    O = fill(O, 2, {(one_loc[0] + i, one_loc[1])}) 
  for j in range(1, 4):  # Horizontal line
    O = fill(O, 2, {(one_loc[0] + 5, one_loc[1] + j)})
  for k in range(1, 3):  # Short vertical line
    O = fill(O, 2, {(one_loc[0] + 5 - k, one_loc[1] + 3)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create canvas:** A 10x10 canvas is created.
2. **Find '1' location:** Similar to Version 1.
3. **Iterative drawing:** This version draws the 'C' shape iteratively:
    * A loop draws the vertical line.
    * Another loop draws the horizontal line.
    * The final loop draws the short vertical line.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_loc = ulcorner(objects(I, True, False, False))  # Find location of '1'
  v_line = frozenset({(one_loc[0] + i, one_loc[1]) for i in range(6)})
  h_line = frozenset({(one_loc[0] + 5, one_loc[1] + j) for j in range(1, 4)})
  short_v = frozenset({(one_loc[0] + 5 - k, one_loc[1] + 3) for k in range(1, 3)})
  c_shape = v_line | h_line | short_v  # Combine the lines
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))  # Create 10x10 canvas
  O = fill(O, 2, c_shape)  # Fill 'C' with '2'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' location:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Construct lines:** This version constructs each line segment of the 'C' separately using set comprehension.
3. **Combine lines:**  The line segments are combined using the union operator (`|`) to form the complete 'C' shape. 
4. **Create canvas and fill:** Similar to previous versions.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_loc = ulcorner(objects(I, True, False, False))  # Find location of '1'
  c_shape = connect(one_loc, (one_loc[0] + 5, one_loc[1]))  # Vertical line
  c_shape = c_shape | connect((one_loc[0] + 5, one_loc[1] + 1), (one_loc[0] + 5, one_loc[1] + 3))  # Horizontal
  c_shape = c_shape | connect((one_loc[0] + 4, one_loc[1] + 3), (one_loc[0] + 3, one_loc[1] + 3))  # Short vertical
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))  # Create 10x10 canvas
  O = fill(O, 2, c_shape)  # Fill 'C' with '2'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' location:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Construct lines with `connect`:** This version leverages the `connect` function to draw each line segment of the 'C'.
3. **Combine lines:** Similar to Version 3.
4. **Create canvas and fill:** Similar to previous versions. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_loc = ulcorner(objects(I, True, False, False))  # Find location of '1'
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))  # Create 10x10 canvas
  O = paint(O, {(2, (one_loc[0] + i, one_loc[1])) for i in range(6)})  # Vertical line
  O = paint(O, {(2, (one_loc[0] + 5, one_loc[1] + j)) for j in range(1, 4)})  # Horizontal line
  O = paint(O, {(2, (one_loc[0] + 5 - k, one_loc[1] + 3)) for k in range(1, 3)})  # Short vertical
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' location:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Create canvas:** A 10x10 canvas is created.
3. **Direct painting:** This version directly paints each line segment onto the canvas using set comprehension and the `paint` function.
