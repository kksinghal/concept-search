## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying the location of the input object (represented by the digit '1') and then drawing a specific pattern on the output grid based on that location. The pattern consists of:

- A 3x3 square of '2's centered one cell diagonally down and right from the input object.
- A horizontal line of three '1's extending right from a point two cells down and three cells right from the input object.
- A vertical line of three '1's extending down from a point one cell down and seven cells right from the input object.

**Let's break it down for each input-output pair:**

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

1. The input object ('1') is at location (0, 0).
2. A 3x3 square of '2's is drawn centered at (2, 2).
3. A horizontal line of '1's starts at (2, 5).
4. A vertical line of '1's starts at (3, 7).

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

1. The input object ('1') is at location (0, 0).
2. A 3x3 square of '2's is drawn centered at (3, 3).
3. A horizontal line of '1's starts at (3, 6).
4. A vertical line of '1's starts at (4, 8).

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def chcdfjejbfffeaeeacdhcfieafdedfge(I):
  # Find the input object's location
  obj_loc = ulcorner(objects(I, True, False, False)[0]) 

  # Calculate the shift amount
  shift_amount = add(obj_loc, (2, 2))  

  # Define the patterns
  square_pattern = recolor(2, shift(canvas((2, (0, 0)), (3, 3)), (1, 1)))
  h_line_pattern = recolor(1, shift(canvas((1, (0, 0)), (1, 3)), (0, 3)))
  v_line_pattern = recolor(1, shift(canvas((1, (0, 0)), (3, 1)), (0, 6)))

  # Combine and shift the patterns
  combined_pattern = shift(combine(square_pattern, combine(h_line_pattern, v_line_pattern)), shift_amount)

  # Paint the pattern onto a blank canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), combined_pattern)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Object Location:** Uses `objects` to find the object and `ulcorner` to get its top-left corner.
2. **Calculate Shift:** Adds (2, 2) to the object's location for the square's center.
3. **Define Patterns:** Creates individual patterns for the square, horizontal line, and vertical line.
4. **Combine & Shift:** Merges the patterns and shifts them based on the calculated shift amount.
5. **Paint & Return:** Paints the combined pattern onto a blank canvas and returns the result.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def dcigbafbacaeeecijbcdigfadicdfcih(I):
  # Get the input object's location
  i, j = ulcorner(objects(I, True, False, False)[0])

  # Create the output grid
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Draw the square
  for di in range(3):
      for dj in range(3):
          O = fill(O, 2, {(i + di + 2, j + dj + 2)}) 

  # Draw the horizontal line
  for dj in range(3):
      O = fill(O, 1, {(i + 2, j + dj + 5)})

  # Draw the vertical line
  for di in range(3):
      O = fill(O, 1, {(i + di + 3, j + 7)})

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Object Location:** Gets the top-left corner of the input object.
2. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates a blank 10x10 canvas.
3. **Draw Square:** Uses nested loops and `fill` to draw the 3x3 square of '2's.
4. **Draw Horizontal Line:** Uses a loop and `fill` to draw the horizontal line of '1's.
5. **Draw Vertical Line:** Uses a loop and `fill` to draw the vertical line of '1's.
6. **Return Grid:** Returns the final output grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def acibeajejgacehbbijdadgdcaidbfcgd(I):
  # Get the input object's location
  obj_i, obj_j = ulcorner(objects(I, True, False, False)[0])

  # Construct the output grid using nested comprehensions
  O = tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if obj_i + 1 <= i <= obj_i + 3 and obj_j + 1 <= j <= obj_j + 3  # Square condition
      else 1 if (i == obj_i + 2 and obj_j + 3 <= j <= obj_j + 5) or (j == obj_j + 7 and obj_i + 1 <= i <= obj_i + 3)  # Line conditions
      else 0
      for j in range(10)
    )
    for i in range(10)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Object Location:** Extracts the coordinates of the input object.
2. **Construct Grid:** Builds the output grid directly using nested comprehensions:
   - **Square Condition:**  Fills '2's within the square's boundaries.
   - **Line Conditions:**  Fills '1's for the horizontal and vertical lines based on their positions relative to the object.
3. **Return Grid:** Returns the constructed grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def fcfeaiffgbejedaaiadcfgfacefddhcc(I):
  # Find the input object and its location
  obj = objects(I, True, False, False)[0]
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)

  # Create the output grid
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Paint the shifted square
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas((2, (0, 0)), (3, 3)), (i + 1, j + 1)))) 

  # Draw the horizontal line
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i + 2, j + 3), (i + 2, j + 4), (i + 2, j + 5)}))

  # Draw the vertical line
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i + 1, j + 7), (i + 2, j + 7), (i + 3, j + 7)}))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Object and Location:** Identifies the input object and its top-left corner.
2. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0's.
3. **Paint Square:** Creates a 3x3 square, shifts it to the correct position, and paints it onto the canvas with the color '2'.
4. **Paint Horizontal Line:** Directly paints the horizontal line using its coordinates.
5. **Paint Vertical Line:** Directly paints the vertical line using its coordinates.
6. **Return Grid:** Returns the modified canvas as the output.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def egefgdbacbiheeedaeajaaajieaehicb(I):
  # Get the input object's location
  i, j = ulcorner(objects(I, True, False, False)[0])

  # Define the patterns as grids
  square = canvas(2, (3, 3))
  h_line = canvas(1, (1, 3))
  v_line = canvas(1, (3, 1))

  # Construct the output grid using concatenation 
  O = hconcat(
      vconcat(
          hconcat(canvas(0, (i + 1, j + 1)), square), 
          h_line,
          v_line,
          canvas(0, (10 - i - 4, 1))
      ),
      canvas(0, (10, 9 - j - 3))  
  )

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Object Location:** Determines the input object's top-left corner.
2. **Define Pattern Grids:** Creates separate grids representing the square, horizontal line, and vertical line.
3. **Concatenate Grids:** Assembles the final output grid by strategically concatenating the pattern grids with blank canvases:
   - Uses `hconcat` to join grids horizontally.
   - Uses `vconcat` to join grids vertically.
   - Adjusts the sizes of blank canvases based on the object's location to position the patterns correctly.
4. **Return Grid:** Returns the concatenated grid as the output.
