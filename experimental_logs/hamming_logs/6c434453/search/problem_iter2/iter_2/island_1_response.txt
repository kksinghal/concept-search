## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single-cell object on a 1x1 grid and creates a new object on a 10x10 grid. The new object has the following properties:

* **Two diagonal lines:** Composed of the digit '2'. These lines are mirrored across the main diagonal of the grid.
* **A horizontal and vertical line:** Composed of the digit '1'. These lines intersect at the mirrored position of the original object relative to the main diagonal.

**Example:**

If the input object is at position (0, 0), the output will have:

* Diagonal lines starting from (1, 1) and (9, 9) towards the center.
* Horizontal line from (7, 7) to (7, 9).
* Vertical line from (0, 0) to (2, 0).

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))  # Initialize a 10x10 canvas with '0'
    i, j = ulcorner(objects(I, T, F, F))  # Get the location of the input object
    ri, rj = 9 - i, 9 - j  # Calculate the mirrored position
    O = fill(O, 2, connect((1, 1), (9, 9)))  # Draw the first diagonal line
    O = fill(O, 2, connect((0, 9), (9, 0)))  # Draw the second diagonal line
    O = fill(O, 1, connect((ri, rj), (ri, rj + 2)))  # Draw the horizontal line
    O = fill(O, 1, connect((ri, rj), (ri - 2, rj)))  # Draw the vertical line
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  A 10x10 canvas filled with '0' is created.
2.  The location of the input object is determined.
3.  The mirrored position relative to the main diagonal is calculated.
4.  The two diagonal lines with '2' are drawn using `connect` and `fill`.
5.  The horizontal and vertical lines with '1' are drawn using `connect` and `fill`, centered at the mirrored position.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(0,(10,10)) # Initialize a 10x10 canvas with '0'
  for obj in objects(I,T,F,F):
    i, j = ulcorner(obj) # Get the location of the input object
    O = fill(O, 2, connect((i + 1, j + 1), (9 - j, 9 - i)))  # Draw the first diagonal line
    O = fill(O, 2, connect((j, 9 - i), (9 - j, i)))  # Draw the second diagonal line
    O = fill(O, 1, hline(shift(obj, (9 - 2 * j, 9 - 2 * i))))  # Draw the horizontal line
    O = fill(O, 1, vline(shift(obj, (9 - 2 * j, 9 - 2 * i))))  # Draw the vertical line
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Initializes a 10x10 canvas filled with '0'.
2.  Finds connected objects in the input.
3.  Calculates the starting and ending points of the diagonal lines based on the object's position, drawing them with the value '2'.
4.  Shifts the original object to its mirrored position and draws horizontal and vertical lines with '1' using `hline` and `vline`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))  # Initialize a blank canvas
    obj = objects(I, T, F, F).pop()  # Get the object from the input
    center_i, center_j = 9 - centerofmass(obj)[0], 9 - centerofmass(obj)[1]  # Calculate the mirrored center
    O = fill(O, 2, connect((1, 1), (9, 9)))  # Draw the first diagonal line
    O = fill(O, 2, connect((0, 9), (9, 0)))  # Draw the second diagonal line
    for i in range(3):
        O = fill(O, 1, {(center_i, center_j + i)})  # Draw part of the horizontal line
        O = fill(O, 1, {(center_i - i, center_j)})  # Draw part of the vertical line
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a 10x10 canvas with '0'.
2. Extracts the object from the input.
3. Calculates the mirrored center of the object.
4. Draws the two diagonal lines with '2' using 'connect' and 'fill'.
5. Iterates three times, drawing individual cells with '1' to form the horizontal and vertical lines centered at the mirrored center.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10,10)) # Initialize a blank canvas
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    i, j = ulcorner(obj) # Get the upper-left corner of the object
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, connect((1,1),(9,9)))) # Draw the first diagonal line
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, connect((0,9),(9,0)))) # Draw the second diagonal line
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(obj, (9 - 2 * i, 9 - 2 * j)))) # Draw the horizontal line
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(hmirror(obj), (9 - 2 * i, 9 - 2 * j)))) # Draw the vertical line
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Initializes a 10x10 canvas with '0'.
2.  Iterates through objects in the input.
3.  Gets the object's upper-left corner coordinates.
4.  Draws the two diagonal lines with '2' using 'connect', 'recolor', and 'paint'.
5.  Shifts the object to its mirrored position and draws it with '1' using 'shift', 'recolor', and 'paint' for the horizontal line.
6.  Mirrors the object horizontally, shifts it to the mirrored position, and draws it with '1' for the vertical line.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) # Initialize a blank canvas
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
        i, j = ulcorner(obj) # Get the upper-left corner of the object
        for n in range(10):
            O = fill(O, 2, {(n, n)})  # Draw first diagonal
            O = fill(O, 2, {(n, 9 - n)})  # Draw second diagonal
        for n in range(3):
            O = fill(O, 1, {(9 - i - n, 9 - j)})  # Draw part of the vertical line
            O = fill(O, 1, {(9 - i, 9 - j - n)})  # Draw part of the horizontal line
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a 10x10 canvas with '0'.
2. Iterates through objects in the input (although there's only one).
3. Gets the object's upper-left corner coordinates.
4. Draws the two diagonal lines by iterating through each cell on the diagonals and filling them with '2'.
5. Iterates three times, drawing individual cells with '1' to form the horizontal and vertical lines centered at the mirrored position of the object.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation, utilizing different functions and logic within the DSL. Each version is significantly different, showcasing diverse problem-solving strategies.
