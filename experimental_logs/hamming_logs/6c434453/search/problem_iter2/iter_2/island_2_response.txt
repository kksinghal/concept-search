## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the location of the digit '1' in the input grid and then drawing a 'C' shape around it using the digit '2'. The 'C' shape always has the same orientation and size, regardless of the location of '1'.

**Input 0 & Output 0:**

* The '1' is located at the top-left corner.
* A 'C' is drawn around it, with the top-left corner of the 'C' one cell to the right of the '1'.

**Input 1 & Output 1:**

* The '1' is located at the top-left corner.
* A 'C' is drawn around it, with the top-left corner of the 'C' one cell to the right of the '1'.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions for "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:** (Inspired by shape-based drawing)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the location of '1'
  one_loc = toindices(objects(I, True, False, False)).pop()
  # Define the 'C' shape relative to the '1' location
  c_shape = {(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), 
             (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 8), 
             (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 1)}
  # Shift the 'C' shape to the '1' location
  shifted_c = shift(c_shape, one_loc)
  # Create a blank canvas
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  # Fill the canvas with '2' at the 'C' shape indices
  O = fill(O, 2, shifted_c)
  # Place the original '1' back on the canvas
  O = fill(O, 1, {one_loc})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' Location:** Identify the location of '1' using `objects` and `toindices`.
2. **Define 'C' Shape:** Define the 'C' shape as a set of relative indices.
3. **Shift 'C' Shape:** Shift the 'C' shape to the '1' location using `shift`.
4. **Create Canvas:** Create a blank canvas of the same size as the input using `canvas`.
5. **Draw 'C' Shape:** Fill the canvas with '2' at the indices defined by the shifted 'C' shape using `fill`.
6. **Place Original '1':**  Fill the canvas with '1' at the original '1' location using `fill`.

**Program Version 2:** (Inspired by line-based drawing)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the location of '1'
  one_loc = toindices(objects(I, True, False, False)).pop()
  # Define the start and end points of the 'C' lines
  start_top = add(one_loc, (0, 1))
  end_top = add(one_loc, (0, 8))
  start_bottom = add(one_loc, (2, 1))
  end_bottom = add(one_loc, (2, 8))
  corner = add(one_loc, (1, 1))
  # Draw the 'C' shape using lines
  c_shape = connect(start_top, end_top) | connect(start_bottom, end_bottom) | connect(start_top, corner)
  # Create a blank canvas
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  # Fill the canvas with '2' at the 'C' shape indices
  O = fill(O, 2, c_shape)
  # Place the original '1' back on the canvas
  O = fill(O, 1, {one_loc})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' Location:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Define Line Endpoints:** Calculate the start and end points of the lines forming the 'C' relative to the '1' location.
3. **Draw Lines:** Draw the lines using the `connect` function and combine them using the union operator (`|`).
4. **Create Canvas & Draw:** Same as steps 4-6 in version 1.

**Program Version 3:** (Inspired by mirroring and combining)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the location of '1'
  one_loc = toindices(objects(I, True, False, False)).pop()
  # Define half of the 'C' shape
  half_c = {(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)}
  # Mirror the half 'C' horizontally
  mirrored_half = hmirror(half_c)
  # Combine both halves to form the full 'C'
  full_c = half_c | mirrored_half
  # Shift the full 'C' to the '1' location
  shifted_c = shift(full_c, add(one_loc, (0, 1)))
  # Create a blank canvas
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  # Fill the canvas with '2' at the 'C' shape indices
  O = fill(O, 2, shifted_c)
  # Place the original '1' back on the canvas
  O = fill(O, 1, {one_loc})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' Location:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Define Half 'C':** Define half of the 'C' shape as a set of relative indices.
3. **Mirror Half 'C':** Mirror the half 'C' shape horizontally using `hmirror`.
4. **Combine Halves:** Combine the original half and mirrored half using the union operator to form the full 'C'.
5. **Shift & Draw:** Similar to steps 3-6 in version 1.

**Program Version 4:** (Inspired by iterative drawing with movements)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the location of '1'
  one_loc = toindices(objects(I, True, False, False)).pop()
  # Define a sequence of movements to draw the 'C'
  movements = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 1),
               (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, -1),
               (0, -1), (0, -1), (0, -1), (0, -1), (0, -1), 
               (-1, 0), (0, -1)]
  # Start drawing from the right of '1'
  current_loc = add(one_loc, (0, 1))
  # Create a blank canvas
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  # Iterate through the movements to draw the 'C'
  for move in movements:
    current_loc = add(current_loc, move)
    O = fill(O, 2, {current_loc})
  # Place the original '1' back on the canvas
  O = fill(O, 1, {one_loc})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' Location:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Define Movements:** Define a sequence of movements (up, down, left, right) required to draw the 'C' shape.
3. **Iterative Drawing:**  Start from the right of the '1' and iteratively update the current location based on the movement sequence, filling the canvas with '2' at each step.
4. **Place Original '1':** Same as step 6 in version 1.

**Program Version 5:** (Inspired by object manipulation and painting)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the '1' object
  one_obj = objects(I, True, False, False).pop()
  # Define a small horizontal line as the base for the 'C'
  base_line = {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8)}
  # Create the top, bottom, and left lines of the 'C'
  top_line = shift(base_line, add(ulcorner(one_obj), (0, 1)))
  bottom_line = shift(base_line, add(ulcorner(one_obj), (2, 1)))
  left_side = {(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0)}
  left_side = shift(left_side, add(ulcorner(one_obj), (0, 1)))
  # Combine all parts to form the complete 'C'
  c_shape = top_line | bottom_line | left_side
  # Create a blank canvas
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  # Paint the 'C' shape onto the canvas with color 2
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, c_shape))
  # Paint the original '1' back onto the canvas
  O = paint(O, one_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' Object:**  Identify the '1' object using `objects`.
2. **Define 'C' Components:** Define the horizontal and vertical lines that make up the 'C' shape.
3. **Position Components:** Shift and combine the lines relative to the '1' object's location to form the complete 'C'.
4. **Create Canvas:** Same as step 4 in version 1.
5. **Paint 'C' Shape:**  Paint the 'C' shape onto the canvas using `paint` and `recolor` with color '2'.
6. **Paint Original '1':** Paint the original '1' object back onto the canvas using `paint`. 

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating diverse DSL function combinations and logic.
