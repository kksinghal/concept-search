## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single-cell object ('1') and generates a square (3x3) and a horizontal line extending from the right edge of the square to the right edge of the grid.  The color of the objects is '2', except for the rightmost cell of the line which is '1'.

**Specific Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:**  The single '1' cell acts as an anchor point. A 3x3 square is generated with its upper-left corner one cell above and to the left of the '1'.  A horizontal line is drawn from the right edge of this square to the edge of the grid.
* **Input_1:** The transformation follows the same logic as Input_0, with the object positions determined relative to the location of the single '1' cell.

## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct DSL program versions to achieve the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  # Find the seed point
  seed = first(toindices(objects(I, T, F, T)))
  
  # Create the square object 
  square_obj = recolor(2, backdrop(shift({seed}, (1,1))))
  
  # Create the horizontal line object
  line_indices = frozenset((seed[0], j) for j in range(seed[1] + 3, width(I)))
  line_obj = recolor(2, line_indices) | {(1, (seed[0], width(I) - 1))}
  
  # Combine the objects and paint onto a blank canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), square_obj | line_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Seed:**  `first(toindices(objects(I, T, F, T)))` finds the location (i, j) of the single '1' cell. 
2. **Square Object:** A 3x3 square is created using `backdrop` and `shift`, then recolored to '2'.
3. **Line Object:** Indices for the horizontal line are generated based on the seed position and grid width. The line is recolored to '2' and the rightmost cell is set to '1'.
4. **Combine and Paint:** The square and line objects are combined and painted onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
    seed = first(toindices(objects(I, T, F, T)))
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    for i in range(seed[0] - 1, seed[0] + 2):
        for j in range(seed[1] + 1, width(I)):
            if i in range(seed[0], seed[0] + 2) and j in range(seed[1] + 1, seed[1] + 3):
                O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})
            elif i == seed[0]:
                O = fill(O, 2 if j < width(I) - 1 else 1, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Seed:** Same as Program Version 1.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** The program iterates through potential square and line indices. 
   - It fills cells within the square boundaries with '2'.
   - For the line, it fills with '2' except for the last cell, which is filled with '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
    seed = first(toindices(objects(I, T, F, T)))
    h, w = shape(I)
    O = paint(canvas(0, (h, w)), recolor(2, backdrop(shift({seed}, (1, 1)))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(seed[0], j) for j in range(seed[1] + 3, w - 1)}))
    return paint(O, {(1, (seed[0], w - 1))}) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Seed:**  Same as Program Version 1.
2. **Paint Square:** Paints the square directly onto the canvas using `recolor`, `backdrop`, and `shift`.
3. **Paint Line (Except Last Cell):** Paints the line segment with color '2', excluding the last cell.
4. **Paint Last Cell:** Paints the last cell of the line with color '1'. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  seed = first(toindices(objects(I, T, F, T)))
  h, w = shape(I)
  square = recolor(2, backdrop({(0, 0)}))
  line = recolor(2, {(0, j) for j in range(3, w - 1)}) | {(1, (0, w - 1))}
  O = paint(canvas(0, (h, w)), shift(square, (seed[0] - 1, seed[1] + 1)))
  return paint(O, shift(line, (seed[0], 0)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Seed:** Same as Program Version 1.
2. **Create Templates:**  Creates separate templates for the square and line, assuming the seed is at (0, 0).
3. **Shift and Paint:** Shifts the templates based on the actual seed location and paints them onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
    seed = first(toindices(objects(I, T, F, T)))
    O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(2, {(seed[0] + i - 1, seed[1] + j + 1) 
                                            for i in range(3) 
                                            for j in range(3) 
                                            if 0 <= seed[0] + i - 1 < len(I) 
                                            and 0 <= seed[1] + j + 1 < len(I[0])}))
    O = paint(O, {(2, (seed[0], j)) for j in range(seed[1] + 3, len(I[0]) - 1)})
    return paint(O, {(1, (seed[0], len(I[0]) - 1))})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Seed:** Same as Program Version 1.
2. **Paint Square with Bounds Check:** Paints the square directly using nested loops and includes boundary checks to avoid errors.
3. **Paint Line and Last Cell:** Similar to Program Version 3, it paints the line (excluding the last cell) and then paints the last cell separately.
