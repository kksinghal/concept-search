## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the location of the digit '1' in the input grid and then drawing a specific shape (let's call it 'Shape X') using the digit '2' relative to that location. Shape X is characterized by its resemblance to a distorted 'C' with an extended arm. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Locate '1':** The digit '1' is at the top-left corner of the input grid.
2. **Draw Shape X:** Shape X is drawn with its opening facing towards the right and its extended arm pointing downwards. The '1' from the input grid is preserved in its original location within Shape X.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. **Locate '1':** The digit '1' is now located within a horizontal line of '1's in the input grid.
2. **Draw Shape X:** Shape X is drawn with its opening facing towards the left and its extended arm pointing upwards.  Again, the original '1' from the input grid is maintained within Shape X.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" in the provided DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

### Program Version 1: Direct Construction with Offsets

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_loc = toindices(first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 1))).pop()
  x_shape = {(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (0, 8), (-1, 7), (-2, 7), (-2, 6), (-2, 5), (-2, 4), (-2, 3), (-2, 2), (-2, 1), (-2, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 0)}
  shifted_x = shift(x_shape, subtract(one_loc, (2, 8)))
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  O = fill(O, 2, shifted_x)
  O = fill(O, 1, {one_loc})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1':**  Finds the coordinates (`one_loc`) of '1' in the input grid.
2. **Define Shape X:**  Explicitly defines Shape X's cell coordinates relative to the '1' location. 
3. **Shift and Fill:**  Shifts Shape X to align with the located '1' and fills the canvas with '2' at those positions.
4. **Restore '1':**  Places the original '1' back onto the canvas at `one_loc`.

### Program Version 2:  Mirroring and Union

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_loc = toindices(first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 1))).pop()
  half_x = {(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (-1, 7), (-1, 6)} 
  mirrored_half = hmirror(half_x)
  full_x = half_x | mirrored_half
  shifted_x = shift(full_x, subtract(one_loc, (1, 7)))
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  O = fill(O, 2, shifted_x)
  O = fill(O, 1, {one_loc})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1':** Same as Version 1.
2. **Define Half Shape:** Defines only half of Shape X.
3. **Mirror and Combine:** Mirrors the half shape horizontally and combines it with the original to create the complete Shape X.
4. **Shift and Fill:** Same as Version 1.
5. **Restore '1':** Same as Version 1.

### Program Version 3: Iterative Drawing

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_loc = toindices(first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 1))).pop()
  movements = [(0,1),(1,0),(1,0),(0,1),(0,1),(1,-1),(0,1),(0,1),(0,1),(0,1),(0,1),(-1,0),(-1,0),(0,-1),(0,-1),(-1,1),(0,-1),(0,-1),(0,-1),(0,-1),(0,-1),(1,0),(1,0),(0,-1)]
  current_loc = subtract(one_loc, (1, 8))
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for move in movements:
    current_loc = add(current_loc, move)
    O = fill(O, 2, {current_loc})
  O = fill(O, 1, {one_loc})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1':** Same as Version 1.
2. **Define Movements:** Defines a sequence of movements (up, down, left, right) that, when followed, draw Shape X.
3. **Iterate and Draw:** Starts from a position relative to '1' and iterates through the movements, filling the canvas with '2' at each step.
4. **Restore '1':** Same as Version 1.

### Program Version 4:  Upscaling and Downscaling

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_loc = toindices(first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 1))).pop()
  small_x = {(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 4), (-1, 3), (-2, 3), (-2, 2), (-2, 1), (-2, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 0)}
  upscaled_x = upscale(small_x, 2)
  shifted_x = shift(upscaled_x, subtract(one_loc, (3, 9)))
  O = canvas(0, multiply(shape(I), 2))
  O = fill(O, 2, shifted_x)
  O = fill(O, 1, {multiply(one_loc, 2)}) 
  O = downscale(O, 2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1':** Same as Version 1.
2. **Define Small Shape:** Defines a smaller version of Shape X.
3. **Upscale:**  Upscales the small shape to the desired size.
4. **Shift and Fill:**  Shifts the upscaled shape and fills the canvas.
5. **Restore '1':**  Places the original '1' back, considering the upscaling.
6. **Downscale:** Downscales the output grid to the original size. 

### Program Version 5:  Combining Basic Shapes

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_loc = toindices(first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 1))).pop()
  vert_line = connect((0, 0), (6, 0))
  horiz_line = connect((0, 0), (0, 8))
  corner = {(1, 1)}
  shifted_v = shift(vert_line, subtract(one_loc, (2, 8)))
  shifted_h = shift(horiz_line, subtract(one_loc, (1, 7)))
  shifted_c = shift(corner, one_loc)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  O = fill(O, 2, shifted_v | shifted_h | shifted_c)
  O = fill(O, 1, {one_loc})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1':** Same as Version 1.
2. **Define Basic Shapes:** Defines a vertical line, a horizontal line, and a corner piece.
3. **Shift and Combine:**  Shifts each basic shape to the correct position relative to '1' and combines them using the union operation (`|`).
4. **Fill and Restore:** Fills the canvas with '2' at the combined shape's indices and restores the original '1'. 


These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation in the provided DSL. Each version utilizes different functions and logic, offering a diverse set of solutions to the problem.
