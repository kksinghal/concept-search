## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single-cell object on a 10x10 grid and generates a specific pattern based on the object's location. The pattern consists of:

* **Two diagonal lines:** These lines form an 'X' across the grid, intersecting at the center.
* **Two lines extending from the object's mirrored position:** A vertical line extends upwards and a horizontal line extends rightwards from the point mirrored across the center of the grid relative to the object's position. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input 0:** The object is located at (0,0). 

* The mirrored position is (9,9). 
* The vertical line starts at (9,9) and goes up.
* The horizontal line starts at (9,9) and goes right (truncated at the grid boundary).

**Input 1:** The object is located at (1,5). 

* The mirrored position is (8,4).
* The vertical line starts at (8,4) and goes up.
* The horizontal line starts at (8,4) and goes right.


## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(0,(10,10)) # Initialize a blank canvas
  obj = objects(I, T, F, F).pop() # Get the object
  i, j = ulcorner(obj) # Get the upper-left corner of the object
  mirrored_center = (9 - i, 9 - j)
  O = fill(O, 2, connect((0, 0), (9, 9))) # Draw first diagonal
  O = fill(O, 2, connect((0, 9), (9, 0))) # Draw second diagonal
  O = fill(O, 1, shoot(mirrored_center, (-1, 0))) # Vertical line upwards
  O = fill(O, 1, shoot(mirrored_center, (0, 1))) # Horizontal line rightwards
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and Object Extraction:** Initializes a blank canvas `O` and extracts the single object `obj` from the input grid `I`.
2. **Mirrored Position:** Calculates the `mirrored_center`  of the object across the grid's center.
3. **Diagonal Lines:** Draws two diagonal lines across the canvas using `connect` and `fill` with value `2`.
4. **Mirrored Lines:** Draws the vertical line upwards and horizontal line rightwards from the `mirrored_center` using `shoot` and `fill` with value `1`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(0,(10,10))
  obj = objects(I, T, F, F).pop()
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)
  mirrored_i, mirrored_j = 9 - i, 9 - j
  for n in range(10):
    O = fill(O, 2, {(n, n), (n, 9 - n)}) # Draw both diagonals in one loop
  for n in range(mirrored_i + 1): # Vertical line
    O = fill(O, 1, {(mirrored_i - n, mirrored_j)}) 
  for n in range(mirrored_j, 10): # Horizontal line
    O = fill(O, 1, {(mirrored_i, n)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization and Mirroring:** Similar to Version 1, but directly calculates `mirrored_i` and `mirrored_j`.
2. **Combined Diagonals:** Draws both diagonals within a single loop for efficiency.
3. **Iterative Lines:** Draws the vertical and horizontal lines iteratively, cell by cell, using the calculated mirrored coordinates.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = canvas(0,(10,10))
  obj = asobject(I)  
  i, j = ulcorner(obj) 
  O = fill(O, 2, connect((0, 0), (9, 9)) | connect((0, 9), (9, 0))) # Combine diagonals
  O = fill(O, 1, shoot((9-i, 9-j), (-1, 0)) | shoot((9-i, 9-j), (0, 1))) # Combine lines
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Simplified Object Extraction:** Uses `asobject` for a more direct extraction, treating the whole input grid as a single object.
2. **Set Union for Drawing:** Utilizes the `|` operator to combine the indices generated by `connect` and `shoot`, drawing both diagonals and lines with fewer `fill` calls.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = canvas(2, (10, 10))  # Initialize with diagonals
  obj = objects(I, T, F, F).pop()
  i, j = 9 - ulcorner(obj)[0], 9 - ulcorner(obj)[1] # Directly calculate mirrored coordinates
  O = fill(O, 0, difference(asindices(O), connect((0, 0), (9, 9)) | connect((0, 9), (9, 0)))) # Erase non-diagonal cells
  O = fill(O, 1, shoot((i, j), (-1, 0))) # Vertical line
  O = fill(O, 1, shoot((i, j), (0, 1))) # Horizontal line
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Pre-filled Diagonals:** Initializes the canvas `O` with the diagonal lines already present (value `2`).
2. **Direct Mirroring:** Directly calculates the mirrored coordinates during extraction.
3. **Erasing for Clarity:** Uses `difference` to erase cells that are not part of the diagonal lines, making the subsequent drawing steps clearer.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  obj = next(iter(objects(I, T, F, F)))  # Extract the object
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  for r in range(10):
      for c in range(10):
          if (r == c or r + c == 9):  # Check for diagonal
              O = fill(O, 2, {(r, c)})
          if (c == 9 - j and r <= 9 - i) or (r == 9 - i and c >= 9 - j): # Check for lines from mirrored point
              O = fill(O, 1, {(r, c)}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Iteration:** This version iterates through every cell of the canvas.
2. **Conditional Drawing:** For each cell, it checks if it belongs to the diagonals or the lines extending from the mirrored point using conditional statements.
3. **Explicit Filling:** If a cell meets the criteria, it's filled with the corresponding value (2 for diagonals, 1 for lines).



Each of these versions utilizes different logic and DSL function combinations, demonstrating diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation.
