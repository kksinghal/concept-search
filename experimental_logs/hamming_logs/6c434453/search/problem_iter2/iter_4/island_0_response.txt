## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the single-celled object with value '1' in the input grid and drawing two specific shapes around it on a blank canvas:

* **Shape 1:** An 'L' shape formed with value '2', positioned to the upper left of the '1' object.
* **Shape 2:** Two horizontal lines of '1's, one to the right and one below the 'L' shape. 

The exact positioning and orientation of these shapes depend on the location of the '1' object. 

**Example:**

Let's analyze Input_0 and Output_0:

**Input_0:**

```
1
```

**Output_0:**

```
0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
0 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

1. **Identify '1' object:**  The '1' object is at location (0, 0).
2. **Draw 'L' shape:** An 'L' shape of '2's is drawn with its corner at (1, 1).
3. **Draw Horizontal Lines:** 
   * The first line of '1's starts at (3, 8) and extends two cells to the right. 
   * The second line of '1's starts at (1, 7) and extends three cells to the right.

This pattern of identifying the '1' and drawing the shapes around it repeats for all input-output pairs, with the shapes' positions adjusted relative to the '1' object's location.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the `Program_to_be_generated` using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if size(obj) == 1 and color(obj) == 1:
      i, j = first(toindices(obj))
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, frozenset({(i + 1, j + 1), (i + 2, j + 1), (i, j + 2), (i + 1, j + 2), (i + 2, j + 2)}))) 
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, frozenset({(i + 3, j + 1), (i + 4, j + 1), (i, j + 8), (i + 1, j + 8), (i + 2, j + 8)})))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0's.
2. **Locate '1' object:** Iterates through connected objects and finds the object with size 1 and color 1.
3. **Draw 'L' shape:**  Directly paints an 'L' shape of '2's using a frozenset of its cell coordinates, offset from the '1' object's location.
4. **Draw Horizontal Lines:**  Similarly, paints two horizontal lines of '1's using frozensets for their coordinates.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if size(obj) == 1 and color(obj) == 1:
      i, j = first(toindices(obj))
      L_shape =  frozenset({(0, 0), (1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, 1), (1, 1)})
      line1 = frozenset({(2, -1), (3, -1)})
      line2 = frozenset({(-1, 7), (0, 7), (1, 7)})
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(L_shape, (i + 2, j + 2))))
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(line1, (i + 2, j + 2))))
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(line2, (i + 1, j + 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and '1' object:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Define Shape Templates:** Defines the 'L' shape, and the two horizontal lines as frozensets relative to (0, 0).
3. **Shift and Paint:**  Uses the `shift` function to move the templates to the correct positions relative to the '1' object before painting.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) 
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if size(obj) == 1 and color(obj) == 1:
      i, j = first(toindices(obj))
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, frozenset((i + a, j + b) for a in range(1, 3) for b in range(1, 3))))
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, j + 2)}))
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, frozenset({(i + a, j + 1) for a in range(3, 5)}))) 
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, frozenset({(i + a, j + 8) for a in range(0, 3)})))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and '1' object:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Generate 'L' Shape Dynamically:**  Uses nested loops within a frozenset comprehension to dynamically generate the coordinates for the 'L' shape.
3. **Direct Coordinate Calculation:**  Calculates the coordinates for the horizontal lines directly during the `paint` function calls.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if size(obj) == 1 and color(obj) == 1:
      i, j = first(toindices(obj))
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(frozenset({(a, b) for a in range(2) for b in range(3)}), (i, j + 1))))
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(frozenset({(a, 0) for a in range(2, 4)}), (i + 3, j + 1))))
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(frozenset({(a, 0) for a in range(3)}), (i, j + 8))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and '1' object:**  Same as previous versions.
2. **Simplified Shape Definitions:** Defines shapes more concisely using range and frozenset comprehension.
3. **Consistent Shifting:** Uses `shift` consistently for all shapes to reposition them based on the '1' object. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if size(obj) == 1 and color(obj) == 1:
      i, j = first(toindices(obj))
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, frozenset(((i + 1, j + 1), (i + 2, j + 1), (i, j + 2)))))
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(frozenset(((0, 0), (1, 0))), (i + 1, j + 2))))
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(frozenset(((0, 0), (1, 0))), (i + 3, j + 1))))
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(frozenset(((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0))), (i, j + 8)))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and '1' object:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Combined Direct and Shifted Painting:** Combines directly specifying coordinates with using `shift` for repositioning.
3. **Reused Shape Template:** Reuses a simple two-cell horizontal line template and shifts it multiple times for the lines. 

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the same transformation using different combinations of DSL functions, ensuring zero similarity in their code and logic.
