## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:**

1. **Identify the input object:** A single cell with value '1'.
2. **Generate three patterns:** 
    * A 3x3 square of '2's.
    * A horizontal line of three '1's.
    * A vertical line of three '1's. 
3. **Position the patterns:**
    * The square's upper-left corner is shifted two cells down and two cells right from the input object. 
    * The horizontal line's leftmost cell is shifted two cells down and five cells right from the input object.
    * The vertical line's topmost cell is shifted three cells down and seven cells right from the input object.
4. **Combine the patterns:** All patterns are painted onto a blank 10x10 canvas.

**Input 1 -> Output 1:**

This transformation follows the same logic as Input 0 -> Output 0, with the same patterns generated and positioned relative to the single-cell input object. 


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL to achieve the desired transformations:

**Program Version 1:** (Inspired by pattern generation in Program A and relative positioning in Program B)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find input object location
  obj_loc = ulcorner(objects(I, True, False, False)[0])

  # Define pattern offsets relative to object location
  square_offset = (2, 2)
  h_line_offset = (2, 5)
  v_line_offset = (3, 7)

  # Create patterns on a 10x10 canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(2, shift(asindices(canvas(0, (3, 3))), add(obj_loc, square_offset))))  # Square
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(asindices(canvas(0, (1, 3))), add(obj_loc, h_line_offset))))  # Horizontal line
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(asindices(canvas(0, (3, 1))), add(obj_loc, v_line_offset))))  # Vertical line

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version first finds the input object's location using `objects` and `ulcorner`.
* It defines offsets for each pattern relative to the object location.
* It then generates each pattern using `canvas`, `asindices`, `recolor`, and shifts them to their final positions using `shift` and `add`. 
* Finally, it combines them on a blank canvas using `paint`. 

**Program Version 2:** (Focuses on directly constructing the output grid based on relative cell positions)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find object location
  obj_i, obj_j = ulcorner(objects(I, True, False, False)[0])

  # Construct output grid using nested comprehensions
  O = tuple(
      tuple(
          2 if (obj_i + 2) <= i <= (obj_i + 4) and (obj_j + 2) <= j <= (obj_j + 4) else  # Square
          1 if ((i == obj_i + 2) and (obj_j + 5) <= j <= (obj_j + 7)) or  # Horizontal line
             ((j == obj_j + 7) and (obj_i + 3) <= i <= (obj_i + 5)) else  # Vertical line
          0
          for j in range(10)
      )
      for i in range(10)
  )

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version determines the input object's location and then uses nested comprehensions to construct the output grid directly.
* It iterates through each cell of the 10x10 output grid.
* For each cell, it checks if it falls within the defined boundaries of the square, horizontal line, or vertical line relative to the input object's position.
* Based on these checks, it assigns the appropriate color (2, 1, or 0) to the cell.

**Program Version 3:** (Employs a loop to handle pattern generation and positioning)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find object location
  obj_loc = ulcorner(objects(I, True, False, False)[0])

  # Define patterns and their offsets
  patterns = [
      ((3, 3), 2, (2, 2)), # Square: (size, color, offset)
      ((1, 3), 1, (2, 5)), # Horizontal line
      ((3, 1), 1, (3, 7))  # Vertical line
  ]

  # Create a blank canvas
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Paint each pattern
  for size, color, offset in patterns:
    O = paint(O, recolor(color, shift(asindices(canvas(0, size)), add(obj_loc, offset))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version defines a list of patterns, each with its size, color, and offset relative to the input object. 
* It then iterates through this list, generating and positioning each pattern on the canvas using a loop.
* This approach promotes code reusability and makes it easier to add or modify patterns.

**Program Version 4:** (Combines pre-built patterns with canvas manipulation for more efficient grid construction)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find object location
  i, j = ulcorner(objects(I, True, False, False)[0])

  # Pre-build patterns
  square = canvas(2, (3, 3))
  h_line = paint(canvas(0, (1, 3)), recolor(1, asindices(canvas(0, (1, 3)))))
  v_line = paint(canvas(0, (3, 1)), recolor(1, asindices(canvas(0, (3, 1)))))

  # Construct the output grid in parts using canvas and offsets
  top_left = canvas(0, (i + 2, j + 2))
  top_right = canvas(0, (i + 2, 8 - j))
  bottom_left = canvas(0, (8 - i, j + 7))
  bottom_right = canvas(0, (8 - i, 3 - j))

  # Concatenate the parts to form the final grid
  O = hconcat(vconcat(hconcat(top_left, square, top_right), h_line, v_line, bottom_left), bottom_right)
  return O

```

**Explanation:**

* This version pre-builds the square, horizontal line, and vertical line patterns. 
* It then constructs the output grid by creating smaller canvases representing the regions around the patterns and concatenating them together with the patterns in their correct positions. 
* This method can be more efficient for larger grids or more complex patterns.

**Program Version 5:** (Leverages symmetry to reduce redundant code)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find object location
  obj_loc = ulcorner(objects(I, True, False, False)[0])
  i, j = obj_loc

  # Create the top half of the output grid
  top_half = tuple(
      tuple(
          2 if (i + 2) <= row <= (i + 4) and (j + 2) <= col <= (j + 4) else
          1 if (row == i + 2 and (j + 5) <= col <= (j + 7)) else
          0
          for col in range(10)
      )
      for row in range(5)
  )

  # Mirror the top half to create the bottom half
  bottom_half = vmirror(top_half)

  # Concatenate the halves to form the final grid
  O = vconcat(top_half, bottom_half)

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version exploits the vertical symmetry present in the output. It first generates only the top half of the output grid using nested comprehensions. 
* Then, it mirrors the top half vertically to create the complete output grid, reducing the code complexity and potential for errors.


Each of these program versions presents a distinct approach to solving the given transformation task, demonstrating a range of possible solutions within the provided DSL.
