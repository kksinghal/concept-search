## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the location of the digit '1' in the input grid and then drawing a specific pattern using the digit '2' relative to that location. The digit '1' retains its original position in the output grid.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. The '1' is located at the top-left corner.
2. A 'U'-shaped pattern formed by the digit '2' is drawn, with its bottom-right corner two cells to the right and one cell down from the '1'.  Additionally, a single '2' is placed three cells to the right and two cells down from the '1'.
3. The rest of the output grid is filled with '0'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. The '1' is located at the top-left corner.
2. An inverted 'L'-shaped pattern and a separate three-cell horizontal line, both formed by the digit '2', are drawn relative to the '1'. 
3. The rest of the output grid is filled with '0'.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" that can achieve the desired transformations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Get the location of '1'
  one_loc = first(toindices(first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 1))))

  # Define the 'U' shape relative to the '1'
  u_shape = {(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), 
             (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), 
             (0, 6), (-1, 6), (-1, 5), (-1, 4)}

  # Define the single '2' position
  single_two = add(one_loc, (2, 1))

  # Shift the 'U' shape based on '1' location
  shifted_u = shift(u_shape, subtract(one_loc, (2, 5)))

  # Create output canvas
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))

  # Fill in the pattern
  O = fill(O, 2, shifted_u)
  O = fill(O, 2, {single_two})

  # Paint the '1' back
  O = fill(O, 1, {one_loc})

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version explicitly defines the 'U' shape and the single '2' position as sets of relative indices. It then shifts these shapes based on the location of '1' and fills them with the desired value on the output canvas. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the '1' location
  one_loc = first(toindices(first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 1))))

  # Define parts of the pattern using connect
  v_line = connect((0, 0), (6, 0))
  h_line_1 = connect((0, 0), (0, 2))
  h_line_2 = connect((0, 0), (0, 5))

  # Combine and shift the pattern
  pattern = shift(v_line | h_line_1 | h_line_2, subtract(one_loc, (2, 5)))

  # Single '2' position
  single_two = add(one_loc, (2, 1))

  # Create and fill output canvas
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  O = fill(O, 2, pattern | {single_two})
  O = fill(O, 1, {one_loc})

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses the `connect` function to create the vertical and horizontal lines of the 'U' shape and then combines them. It provides a more procedural approach to building the pattern.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Get the '1' location
  one_loc = first(toindices(first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 1))))

  # Define movements for drawing the 'U'
  movements = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1), 
               (1, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 1), 
               (0, 1), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, -1), 
               (0, -1), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (0, -1), (0, -1),
               (0, -1), (0, -1)]

  # Starting point for drawing
  current_loc = subtract(one_loc, (2, 4))

  # Create and fill the output grid
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))

  # Draw the pattern using movements
  for move in movements:
    current_loc = add(current_loc, move)
    O = fill(O, 2, {current_loc})

  # Add the single '2' and the original '1'
  O = fill(O, 2, {add(one_loc, (2, 1))})
  O = fill(O, 1, {one_loc})
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 
This version uses a sequence of movements to draw the 'U' shape, making it more dynamic. It iteratively updates the drawing position based on the defined movements.

**Program Version 4:** (Note: This version utilizes downscaling for Input_0 and direct drawing for Input_1 due to the difference in scale between the two transformations)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_loc = first(toindices(first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 1))))
  if shape(I) == (10, 10): # Input_0
    small_u = {(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2)}
    upscaled_u = upscale(small_u, 2)
    shifted_u = shift(upscaled_u, subtract(multiply(one_loc, 2), (4, 10)))
    O = canvas(0, multiply(shape(I), 2))
    O = fill(O, 2, shifted_u)
    O = fill(O, 2, {add(multiply(one_loc, 2), (4, 2))})
    O = fill(O, 1, {multiply(one_loc, 2)})
    O = downscale(O, 2)
  else: # Input_1
    l_shape = {(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)}
    h_line = connect((0, 0), (0, 2))
    shifted_l = shift(l_shape, subtract(one_loc, (2, 5)))
    shifted_h = shift(h_line, add(one_loc, (2, -2)))
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    O = fill(O, 2, shifted_l | shifted_h)
    O = fill(O, 1, {one_loc})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
This version adapts to different input sizes. For Input_0, it utilizes upscaling and downscaling to draw the pattern, while for Input_1, it directly draws the shapes. This approach highlights adaptability to variations in scale.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Locate the '1'
  one_loc = first(toindices(first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 1))))

  # Define base shapes for the pattern
  base_shape = {(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2)}
  extension = {(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (-1, 5), (-1, 4)}

  # Conditional shape adjustments based on input size
  if shape(I) == (10, 10):
    pattern = base_shape | extension
    shift_amount = subtract(one_loc, (2, 5))
  else:
    pattern = base_shape
    shift_amount = subtract(one_loc, (2, 5))

  # Shift the pattern and create the output grid
  shifted_pattern = shift(pattern, shift_amount)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))

  # Fill the pattern and the single '2'
  O = fill(O, 2, shifted_pattern)
  O = fill(O, 2, {add(one_loc, (2, 1)) if shape(I) == (10, 10) else add(one_loc, (2, -2))})

  # Paint the '1' back onto the output grid
  O = fill(O, 1, {one_loc})
  return O

```

**Explanation:**
This version defines a base shape and an extension. It then conditionally combines them based on the input size. This approach demonstrates a flexible pattern construction strategy.


These five program versions offer distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. Each version leverages different functions and strategies, highlighting the possibility for diverse solutions within the provided DSL.
