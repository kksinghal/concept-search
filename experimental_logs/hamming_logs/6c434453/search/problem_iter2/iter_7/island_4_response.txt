## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the single-celled object representing the input ('1') and constructing two new objects in the output:

**Object 1: A 3x3 square:**
* The top-left corner of this square is positioned one cell down and two cells to the right of the input '1'.
* The square is filled with the digit '2'.

**Object 2: A horizontal line:**
* The line starts three cells to the right of the input '1'.
* It extends horizontally to the right edge of the grid.
* The line is filled with the digit '2', except for the last cell, which is '1'.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The single '1' results in a 3x3 square at the top left and a horizontal line extending from (0,3) to (0,9). 
* **Input_1:** The transformation is identical, but the position of the input '1' changes the placement of the generated objects. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct programs achieving the described transformation:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def djgfgiebffhceefdbbcfcbedcdebgcaf(I):
  # Find seed point ('1')
  seed = ulcorner(objects(I, T, F, T))

  # Construct square indices relative to seed
  square_indices = frozenset({(seed[0] + i, seed[1] + j) for i in range(1, 4) for j in range(2, 5)})
  
  # Construct line indices relative to seed
  line_indices = frozenset({(seed[0], j) for j in range(seed[1] + 3, width(I))})

  # Combine square and line, recolor to '2'
  shape_obj = recolor(2, square_indices | line_indices)
  
  # Paint on canvas, replace last cell of line with '1'
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shape_obj)
  O = paint(O, {(1, (seed[0], width(I) - 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find seed:** Locate the input '1' using `objects` and `ulcorner`.
2. **Construct Square:** Generate indices for the 3x3 square relative to the seed.
3. **Construct Line:** Generate indices for the horizontal line.
4. **Combine and Recolor:** Merge the square and line indices, recolor them to '2'.
5. **Paint and Adjust:** Paint the combined object on a blank canvas. Replace the last cell of the line with '1'.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def afjaaefbejhaeeeibbdgadfaegbfdjba(I):
  # Seed point
  seed = ulcorner(objects(I, T, F, T))

  # Create a base square object
  base_square = frozenset({(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)})
  
  # Shift and recolor the base square
  square_obj = recolor(2, shift(base_square, (seed[0] + 1, seed[1] + 2)))
  
  # Generate horizontal line using interval
  line_obj = recolor(2, {(seed[0], j) for j in interval(seed[1] + 3, width(I) - 1, 1)})

  # Combine, paint, and replace last cell
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), square_obj | line_obj)
  O = paint(O, {(1, (seed[0], width(I) - 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Seed:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Base Square:** Define a base 3x3 square object at the origin.
3. **Shift and Recolor:** Shift the base square to the desired location relative to the seed and recolor it to '2'.
4. **Generate Line:** Create the horizontal line using `interval` and recolor to '2'.
5. **Combine and Adjust:** Same as Version 1.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def fcdfagfebgaaecdcjiiahfcfieejjjdc(I):
  # Find the seed point
  seed_i, seed_j = ulcorner(objects(I, T, F, T))
  
  # Create the square object using nested loops and conditionals
  square_obj = frozenset({(2, (i, j)) for i in range(seed_i + 1, seed_i + 4) for j in range(seed_j + 2, seed_j + 5)})

  # Create the line object using connect function
  line_obj = recolor(2, connect((seed_i, seed_j + 3), (seed_i, width(I) - 2)))

  # Combine and paint the objects
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), square_obj | line_obj | {(1, (seed_i, width(I) - 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Seed:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Construct Square:** Directly generate square indices using nested loops and recolor to '2'.
3. **Construct Line:** Use the `connect` function to create the horizontal line and recolor to '2'.
4. **Combine and Paint:** Paint all objects, including the final '1' at the end of the line, onto the canvas in a single step.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def ejhcacfeedadedhjbbfcbjchdfbejdjf(I):
  # Seed point
  seed = ulcorner(objects(I, T, F, T))
  
  # Define square corners
  top_left = (seed[0] + 1, seed[1] + 2)
  bottom_right = (top_left[0] + 2, top_left[1] + 2)

  # Construct square using 'box' function
  square_obj = recolor(2, backdrop(frozenset({top_left, bottom_right})))
  
  # Generate line using 'shoot' function
  line_obj = recolor(2, shoot((seed[0], seed[1] + 3), (0, 1)))
  
  # Combine, paint and replace last cell
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), square_obj | line_obj)
  O = paint(O, {(1, (seed[0], width(I) - 1))})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Seed:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Square Corners:** Calculate the top-left and bottom-right corners of the square based on the seed.
3. **Construct Square:** Use `backdrop` with the calculated corners to generate the square indices and recolor to '2'.
4. **Generate Line:** Utilize the `shoot` function with the starting point and direction to create the line indices and recolor to '2'.
5. **Combine and Adjust:** Same as Version 1.


### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def jedabhbfegfceccgaaiejhiddbcababc(I):
  # Seed point
  seed = ulcorner(objects(I, T, F, T))

  # Create base 3x3 grid and shift
  base_grid = ((2, 2, 2), (2, 2, 2), (2, 2, 2))
  shifted_grid = shift(asobject(base_grid), (seed[0] + 1, seed[1] + 2))
  
  # Generate horizontal line with '1' at the end
  line_obj = recolor(2, {(seed[0], j) for j in range(seed[1] + 3, width(I))}) | {(1, (seed[0], width(I) - 1))}

  # Paint both elements onto the canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shifted_grid | line_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Seed:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Base Grid:** Define a pre-colored 3x3 grid representing the square.
3. **Shift Grid:** Convert the grid to an object and shift it to the correct position based on the seed.
4. **Generate Line:** Generate line indices and include the final '1' during its creation.
5. **Paint:** Paint both the shifted square and the generated line onto the canvas directly. 

These five program versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation. They showcase the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL by leveraging different functions and strategies.
