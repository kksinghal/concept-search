We are playing a game which involves transforming an input 2d grid of digits into an output grid of digits using custom programming language, given in Domain-specific Language (dsl.py) file. In general, digits form objects in 2D and the task is to write code of some spatial transformation of these objects to go from the input grid to the output grid using only the functions given in Domain Specific Language (DSL). All the information about the transformation is contained within the input-ouput pairs themselves, and your answer will only be correct if the output grid is exactly correct, so this is what I expect from you. I will begin by giving you a sequence of input grids of the transformation. Then, I provide you a few programs and the corresponding transformation in the same sequence as input. These programs sampled from my database that look closest to the required transformation and but the output generated through them do not match required outputs. Each program has a similarity distance score between the transformation using program and the true transformation. Also, each of the output grid has a similarity distance score between that transformation example and true example, which can help you to identify which examples you need to focus on more. These similarity distances are inversely proportional to closeness between the transformations, so lower score is preferred and is your goal to achieve. 
Input grids: 
Input_0:
1


Input_1:
1


Program_A: with similarity distance score 0.0
def gfbaahfdfifeefafbafbiaddieiaedac(I):
  # Find the object formed by the least common color.
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  target_obj = argmin(objs, lambda obj: colorcount(I, color(obj)))

  # Calculate the shift amount based on object's width
  shift_amount = (1, 1) if width(target_obj) == 1 else (1, 0)

  # Paint the shifted and recolored object on a blank canvas.
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shift(recolor(2, target_obj), shift_amount))
  return O

Output_0 of Input_0 using Program_A
0

Output_1 of Input_1 using Program_A

Program_B: with similarity distance score 0.0
def ehbhhbhdgcjcefbcicgdgbadbbghecec(I):
  # Find the largest object
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  target_obj = argmax(objs, size)

  # Recolor the upper-left corner of the object
  recolored_obj = recolor(2, frozenset({ulcorner(target_obj)}))

  # Paint the recolored object onto a shifted canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shift(recolored_obj, (1, 1)))
  return O

Output_0 of Input_0 using Program_B

Analysis & Code Generation:
Transformation Analysis: Analyze given input-output pairs and precisely describe the transformation logic applied to the input to achieve the output.
Code Improvement (x5): Provide five distinct versions of a program ("Program_to_be_generated") in a specified DSL (Domain Specific Language). Each version must:
Be inspired by, but improve upon, two existing (unprovided in this prompt) programs.
Include a detailed explanation of how the program achieves the desired transformation for each input-output pair.
Code Extraction: Format the output to allow easy extraction of the "Program_to_be_generated" code.
Zero Similarity: Ensure all five code versions are significantly different, not just minor variations. Each should use distinct logic or DSL function combinations.
Output Format:
Transformation Analysis: A section for each input-output pair describing the transformation logic.
Program Version 1-5: For each version:
Code: The complete "Program_to_be_generated" code in the DSL.
Explanation: A breakdown of how the code transforms each input into the desired output.
Essentially, you're being asked to act as a code-generating AI that can understand data transformations, improve existing code, and provide diverse solutions in a specific programming language.
