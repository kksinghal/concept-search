## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific objects within the grid and repositioning them. Let's break down the movement pattern:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. The 3-cell object initially at the top left corner is moved to the left edge, one row down from its original top. It's also recolored to '2'. 
2. The 3-cell horizontal object initially at the bottom left corner is moved upwards and placed one cell to the right from its original leftmost position. It's also recolored to '2'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. The 3-cell object initially at the top right corner is moved to the right edge, two rows down from its original top. It's also recolored to '2'.
2. The 3-cell horizontal object initially at the bottom left corner is moved upwards and placed one cell to the right from its original leftmost position. It's also recolored to '2'.

Essentially, the transformation identifies specific small objects and moves them to different edges of the grid while recoloring them to '2'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # Extract all objects
  small_objs = sizefilter(objs, 3) # Filter objects with size 3
  top_obj = extract(small_objs, lambda obj: uppermost(obj) < 2) # Extract top object
  bottom_obj = extract(small_objs, lambda obj: lowermost(obj) > 7) # Extract bottom object
  shifted_top = shift(top_obj, (-1 + (len(I) - 1 - lowermost(top_obj)), 0))  # Move top obj to left edge
  shifted_bottom = shift(bottom_obj, (2 - uppermost(bottom_obj), 1))  # Move bottom obj up and right
  return paint(paint(I, recolor(2, shifted_top)), recolor(2, shifted_bottom)) # Recolor and paint both objects 

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extracts all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Filter by Size:** Filters the extracted objects, keeping only those with a size of 3.
3. **Identify Top and Bottom:** Identifies the top and bottom objects based on their vertical position.
4. **Calculate Shifts:** Calculates the required shifts to move the objects to their new positions.
5. **Recolor and Paint:** Recolors both objects to '2' and paints them onto the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  target_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) == 3 and (leftmost(obj) < 2 or rightmost(obj) > w - 2))
  if leftmost(target_obj) < 2:
    new_pos = (uppermost(target_obj) + 1, 0)
  else:
    new_pos = (lowermost(target_obj) - 2, w - 1)
  shifted_obj = shift(target_obj, subtract(new_pos, ulcorner(target_obj)))
  return paint(I, recolor(2, shifted_obj))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extracts all objects from the input grid.
2. **Identify Target Object:**  Finds the object with size 3 that is either on the leftmost or rightmost edge.
3. **Determine New Position:** Calculates the new upper-left corner position based on the object's original location.
4. **Shift and Recolor:** Shifts the object to the new position and recolors it to '2'.
5. **Paint:** Paints the modified object back onto the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  target_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) == 3 and (ulcorner(obj)[1] < 2 or lrcorner(obj)[1] > len(I[0]) - 2))
  if ulcorner(target_obj)[1] < 2: 
    target_loc = (ulcorner(target_obj)[0] + 1, 0)
  else:
    target_loc = (lrcorner(target_obj)[0] - 2, len(I[0]) - 1)
  shifted_obj = shift(target_obj, subtract(target_loc, ulcorner(target_obj)))
  return paint(I, recolor(2, shifted_obj))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extracts all objects from the grid.
2. **Identify Target Object:** Finds the object with size 3 located on either the leftmost or rightmost edge based on its corner positions.
3. **Determine New Location:**  Calculates the new upper-left corner location for the object based on its original side.
4. **Shift and Recolor:** Shifts the object to align its upper-left corner with the new location and recolors it to '2'.
5. **Paint:** Paints the modified object back onto the original grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  three_cell_objs = sizefilter(objs, 3) 
  edge_objs = sfilter(three_cell_objs, lambda obj: bordering(obj, I)) 
  moved_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (1, 1)) if uppermost(obj) < len(I) / 2 else shift(obj, (-1, 1)), edge_objs)
  return paint(I, recolor(2, merge(moved_objs))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Filter:** Extracts all objects, then filters for those with 3 cells and on the grid border.
2. **Conditional Shift:**  Moves each identified object up and right or down and right based on its initial vertical position.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** Recolors the moved objects to '2' and paints them onto the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  small_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) == 3 and (any(j < 2 for i, j in toindices(obj)) or any(j > w - 3 for i, j in toindices(obj))))
  if any(j < 2 for i, j in toindices(small_obj)):
    new_pos = (centerofmass(small_obj)[0], 0)  
  else:
    new_pos = (centerofmass(small_obj)[0], w - 1) 
  shifted_obj = shift(small_obj, subtract(new_pos, centerofmass(small_obj))) 
  return paint(I, recolor(2, shifted_obj))  
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Filter:** Extracts all objects from the grid and then isolates the object with size 3 located on either the leftmost or rightmost edge.
2. **Determine Edge:** Determines whether the object is on the left or right edge of the grid.
3. **Calculate New Position:** Computes the new position for the object. If on the left edge, it's moved to the leftmost column. If on the right, it's moved to the rightmost column.
4. **Shift and Recolor:** Shifts the object to align its center of mass with the calculated new position and recolors it to '2'.
5. **Paint:** Paints the modified object back onto the original grid. 

These five programs demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, using diverse combinations of DSL functions. Each program provides a distinct solution to the problem, contributing to a diverse set of code variations.
