## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific objects in the input grid and mirroring them to new locations, recoloring them with the value '2'. 

**Input 0:**

* The smallest object (a single '1' cell) is identified and recolored to '2'.
* The bottom-left object (a group of connected '1' cells) is mirrored horizontally and upwards relative to a line passing just below its bottom edge. The mirrored object is also recolored to '2'.

**Input 1:**

* The same logic from Input 0 applies to Input 1. The smallest object (again, a single '1' cell) and the bottom-left object are mirrored and recolored. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # Find all objects in the grid
  smallobj = argmin(objs, size) # Find the smallest object 
  O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, smallobj)) # Paint the smallest object with '2' on the canvas

  # Find the bottom-left object
  bl_obj = argmin(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: llcorner(o)[0]) 
  
  # Mirror and paint the bottom-left object
  mirrored_obj = hmirror(bl_obj)  # Mirror horizontally
  corner_i = lowermost(bl_obj) # Find the y-coordinate of the bottom row of the object 
  mirrored_obj = shift(mirrored_obj, (corner_i * 2 - height(mirrored_obj) + 1, 0)) # Shift the object to its mirrored position
  O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, mirrored_obj))  # Paint the mirrored object with '2' on the canvas

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and Objects:** A blank canvas 'O' is created, and all objects in the input 'I' are identified. 
2. **Smallest Object:** The smallest object is found and painted onto the canvas with the color '2'.
3. **Bottom-Left Object:** The bottom-left object is identified.
4. **Mirroring and Shifting:** This object is mirrored horizontally.  The mirrored object is then shifted vertically so that its top edge aligns with the bottom edge of the original object. 
5. **Painting:** The mirrored object is then painted onto the canvas with the color '2'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), recolor(TWO, argmin(objects(I, T, F, F), size))) # Paint the smallest object
  bl_obj = argmin(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: llcorner(o)[0]) # Find the bottom-left object
  corner = llcorner(bl_obj) # Find the coordinates of the bottom-left corner of the object
  for i, j in toindices(bl_obj):
    O = paint(O, {(TWO, (2 * corner[0] - i, j))}) # Mirror and paint each cell of the object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Smallest Object:** Similar to Version 1, the smallest object is found and directly painted onto a blank canvas with color '2'.
2. **Bottom-Left Object and Corner:** The bottom-left object is identified, and its bottom-left corner's coordinates are determined.
3. **Iterative Mirroring:** The program iterates through each cell of the bottom-left object. For each cell, it calculates the mirrored cell's position relative to the bottom-left corner and paints it on the canvas with color '2'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
    smallest = argmin(objs, size)
    bottom_left = argmin(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: llcorner(o)[0])
    output_grid = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    for i in range(len(I)):
      for j in range(len(I[0])):
        if (I[i][j] != ZERO and {(I[i][j], (i,j))} in objs) and ({(I[i][j], (i,j))} in smallest or {(I[i][j], (i,j))} in bottom_left):
          output_grid = paint(output_grid, recolor(TWO, {(TWO, (i, j))}))
        if {(I[i][j], (i,j))} in bottom_left:
          corner_i = lowermost(bottom_left)
          output_grid = paint(output_grid, recolor(TWO, {(TWO, (2 * corner_i - i, j))})) 
    return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:** The code identifies all objects, the smallest object, and the bottom-left object in the input grid.
2. **Canvas Creation:** A blank canvas is created with the same dimensions as the input.
3. **Iterative Painting:** The program iterates through each cell of the input grid. 
   - If a cell is part of either the smallest or the bottom-left object, it is directly painted onto the canvas with the color '2'.
   - If a cell belongs to the bottom-left object, its mirrored position is calculated, and that mirrored cell is also painted onto the canvas with the color '2'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    smallobj = argmin(objects(I, T, F, F), size)
    O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, smallobj))
    bl_obj = argmin(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: llcorner(o)[0])
    
    bl_corner = llcorner(bl_obj)
    top_row = uppermost(bl_obj)
    for i in range(height(bl_obj)):
        row = crop(I, (top_row + i, 0), (1, width(bl_obj)))
        mirrored_row = hmirror(row)
        O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, asobject(mirrored_row)))
        O = move(O, asobject(mirrored_row), (2*(bl_corner[0] - top_row) - i, 0)) 

    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** The program initializes a blank canvas and identifies the smallest and bottom-left objects. The smallest object is painted onto the canvas.
2. **Row-wise Mirroring:**  It then focuses on the bottom-left object. It iterates through each row of this object. For each row:
    -  The row is extracted from the input.
    -  The row is mirrored horizontally.
    -  The mirrored row is painted onto the canvas with color '2'.
    -  The painted row on the canvas is then moved to its final mirrored position based on the bottom-left corner of the original object.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
        if size(obj) == size(argmin(objects(I, T, F, F), size)):
            O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, obj))
        if obj == argmin(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: llcorner(o)[0]):
            corner = llcorner(obj)
            for i, j in toindices(obj):
                O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, {(TWO, (2 * corner[0] - i, j))}))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** It starts with a blank canvas.
2. **Object Iteration and Processing:** It iterates through every object in the input. For each object, it checks:
    -  **Smallest Object:** If the object is the smallest one, it's painted onto the canvas with color '2'.
    -  **Bottom-Left Object:** If the object is the bottom-left one, it iterates through each cell of this object. For every cell, it calculates the mirrored cell's position using the bottom-left corner of the object and paints this mirrored cell onto the canvas with color '2'.
