## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 
The transformation takes the top and bottom non-background objects and moves them to the left and right edges of the grid respectively. The objects are then recolored to '2'. The top object is shifted one row down while the bottom object is positioned at the bottom edge.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** 
Similar to the previous transformation, the top and bottom non-background objects are moved to the left and right edges. However, in this case, the top object is shifted two rows down while the bottom object remains in its original row. Both objects are recolored to '2'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  top_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: uppermost(obj) < h // 2 and color(obj) != bg)
  bottom_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: lowermost(obj) >= h // 2 and color(obj) != bg)
  shifted_top = shift(top_obj, (1, -leftmost(top_obj) + 1))
  shifted_bottom = shift(bottom_obj, (h - lowermost(bottom_obj) - height(bottom_obj), w - rightmost(bottom_obj)))
  return paint(paint(fill(I, bg, shifted_top), recolor(2, shifted_top)), recolor(2, shifted_bottom))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** We find all objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Select top and bottom objects:**  We extract the top and bottom non-background objects.
3. **Shift objects:** The top object is shifted one row down and one column right. The bottom object is moved to the right edge in its original row.
4. **Recolor and paint:** Both objects are recolored to '2'. The original locations of the objects are filled with the background color before painting the shifted and recolored objects.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  top_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: ulcorner(obj)[0] < h // 2)
  bottom_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: ulcorner(obj)[0] >= h // 2)
  shifted_top = shift(top_obj, (1, -leftmost(top_obj) + 1))
  shifted_bottom = shift(bottom_obj, (0, w - width(bottom_obj)))
  return paint(paint(I, recolor(2, shifted_top)), recolor(2, shifted_bottom))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition into objects:** We partition the grid into objects based on color, excluding the background.
2. **Extract top and bottom objects:** We select the top and bottom objects based on the row index of their upper left corner.
3. **Shift objects:** We shift the top object one row down and one column right. The bottom object is moved to the right edge in its original row.
4. **Recolor and paint:** Both objects are recolored to '2' and painted onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  top = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: uppermost(o) < h//2)
  bottom = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: uppermost(o) >= h//2)
  return paint(paint(fill(I, bg, (1,-leftmost(top)+1)), recolor(2, shift(top, (1,-leftmost(top)+1)))), recolor(2, shift(bottom, (0, w-width(bottom)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get grid dimensions:**  We get the height and width of the grid.
2. **Identify objects (without background):** We extract all objects from the grid, excluding the background.
3. **Select top and bottom objects:** We select the top and bottom objects.
4. **Shift and recolor:** We shift the top object one row down and one column right, and the bottom object to the right edge of the grid. Both objects are recolored to '2'.
5. **Paint objects:** We paint the shifted and recolored objects onto the original grid after filling the original object locations with the background color.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  top_obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: centerofmass(obj)[0] < h // 2 and color(obj) != bg)
  bottom_obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: centerofmass(obj)[0] >= h // 2 and color(obj) != bg)
  I = paint(I, recolor(bg, top_obj))
  I = paint(I, recolor(bg, bottom_obj))
  top_obj = shift(top_obj, (1, -leftmost(top_obj) + 1))
  bottom_obj = shift(bottom_obj, (0, w - width(bottom_obj)))
  I = paint(I, recolor(2, top_obj))
  I = paint(I, recolor(2, bottom_obj))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** We locate all objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Select top and bottom objects:**  We choose the top and bottom objects based on the vertical position of their center of mass.
3. **Clear original positions:** We erase the original locations of the chosen objects by recoloring them with the background color.
4. **Shift objects:** The top object is shifted down by one row and right by one column. The bottom object is moved to the rightmost column without changing its row. 
5. **Recolor and paint:** We recolor both objects to '2' and paint them onto the grid at their new locations.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  top = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: center(o)[0] < h // 2)
  bottom = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: center(o)[0] >= h // 2)
  return paint(paint(fill(I, bg, shift(top, (1,-leftmost(top)+1))), recolor(2, shift(top, (1,-leftmost(top)+1)))), recolor(2, shift(bottom, (0, w - rightmost(bottom)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get grid dimensions:** We obtain the height and width of the grid.
2. **Identify objects (without background):** We extract all objects from the grid, excluding the background.
3. **Select top and bottom objects:**  We select the top and bottom objects based on the vertical position of their center.
4. **Shift and recolor:** We shift the top object one row down and one column right, and the bottom object to the right edge of the grid. Both objects are recolored to '2'.
5. **Paint objects:** We paint the shifted and recolored objects onto the original grid after filling the original object locations with the background color.


Each version uses a slightly different approach to object selection, shifting, and painting, resulting in distinct logic and DSL function combinations.
