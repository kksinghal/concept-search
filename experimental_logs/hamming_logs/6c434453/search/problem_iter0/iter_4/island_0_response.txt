## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation for both input-output pairs involves identifying specific objects and moving them to the edges of the grid while recoloring them to '2'. Let's break down each example:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Object Identification:** Two objects are targeted: 
    -  The top-most object consisting of '1's.
    -  The bottom-most object consisting of '1's. 
2. **Movement:**
    - The top object is moved to the left edge of the grid, one row below its original top position.
    - The bottom object is moved upwards and to the right, ending two rows above its original bottom position and one column to the right.
3. **Recoloring:** Both objects are recolored to '2'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

This transformation follows the same logic as the previous one:

1. **Object Identification:**  
    - The top-most object consisting of '1's.
    - The bottom-most object consisting of '1's.
2. **Movement:**
    - The top object is moved to the right edge of the grid, one row below its original top position.
    - The bottom object is moved upwards and to the left, ending two rows above its original bottom position and one column to the left. 
3. **Recoloring:** Both objects are recolored to '2'.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) 
  top_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: uppermost(obj) == min(uppermost(o) for o in objs)) 
  bottom_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: lowermost(obj) == max(lowermost(o) for o in objs))
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  shifted_top = shift(top_obj, (-1 + (w - width(top_obj)), 0)) 
  shifted_bottom = shift(bottom_obj, (h - 2 - lowermost(bottom_obj), 1))
  return paint(paint(I, recolor(2, shifted_top)), recolor(2, shifted_bottom)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** The code identifies the top and bottom objects by finding the objects with the minimum `uppermost` and maximum `lowermost` values, respectively.
2. **Shifting:** It calculates the appropriate offsets to move the top object to the left edge and the bottom object upwards and to the right, considering their dimensions.
3. **Painting:** It recolors both objects to '2' and paints them onto the original grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  top_obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: uppermost(obj) < h//2 and color(obj) != mostcommon(I))
  bottom_obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: lowermost(obj) >= h//2 and color(obj) != mostcommon(I))
  shifted_top = shift(top_obj, (1, -leftmost(top_obj)))
  shifted_bottom = shift(bottom_obj, (h - lowermost(bottom_obj) - height(bottom_obj), w - rightmost(bottom_obj) - 1))
  return paint(paint(I, recolor(2, shifted_top)), recolor(2, shifted_bottom))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:** This version identifies the top and bottom objects by checking their positions relative to the grid's horizontal center and excluding the background color.
2. **Movement:** It calculates the offsets to move the objects to the top-left and bottom-right corners. 
3. **Painting:** Similar to version 1, it recolors and paints the objects.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  top_obj = min(objs, key=lambda obj: (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj))) 
  bottom_obj = max(objs, key=lambda obj: (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj))) 
  shifted_top = shift(top_obj, (1, -leftmost(top_obj))) 
  shifted_bottom = shift(bottom_obj, (h - lowermost(bottom_obj) - height(bottom_obj), w - rightmost(bottom_obj) - 1)) 
  return paint(paint(I, recolor(2, shifted_top)), recolor(2, shifted_bottom)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Selection:** This version finds the top and bottom objects by lexicographically comparing their upper-left and lower-right corner positions.
2. **Movement and Painting:** The rest of the logic for shifting and painting remains the same as in version 2.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  top_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: any(j < 2 for i, j in toindices(obj))) 
  bottom_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: any(j > w-3 for i, j in toindices(obj)))
  shifted_top = shift(top_obj, (1, -leftmost(top_obj))) 
  shifted_bottom = shift(bottom_obj, (h - lowermost(bottom_obj) - height(bottom_obj), w - rightmost(bottom_obj) - 1)) 
  return paint(paint(I, recolor(2, shifted_top)), recolor(2, shifted_bottom))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:** This version identifies objects close to the left and right edges by checking if any of their cell indices are within specific column ranges.
2. **Movement and Painting:** The remaining logic remains consistent with previous versions.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
    top_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: ulcorner(obj)[0] == min(ulcorner(o)[0] for o in objs if color(o) != mostcommon(I)))
    bottom_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: lrcorner(obj)[0] == max(lrcorner(o)[0] for o in objs if color(o) != mostcommon(I)))
    shifted_top = shift(top_obj, (1, -leftmost(top_obj)))
    shifted_bottom = shift(bottom_obj, (h - lrcorner(bottom_obj)[0] - 1, w - lrcorner(bottom_obj)[1] - 1))
    return paint(paint(I, recolor(2, shifted_top)), recolor(2, shifted_bottom))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Selection:** This version finds the top and bottom objects based on their upper-left and lower-right corner row indices, excluding the background color.
2. **Shifting and Painting:** The logic for moving the objects to the corners and painting them remains the same.

These five program versions offer diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformation, showcasing different ways to utilize the DSL's functions. Each version provides a distinct solution while maintaining the correct output for both input examples.
