## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in both examples seems to involve identifying specific objects and shifting them one position to the left. Additionally, a single vertical line of a fixed color (2 in this case) is drawn on the grid. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

1. **Object Identification and Shift:**  Two objects are identified:
    * The top-left connected '1's forming an L-shape. This object is shifted one position to the left.
    * The bottom-middle '2' connected diagonally. This object is also shifted one position to the left.
2. **Vertical Line:** A vertical line of '2's is drawn on the 6th column (index 5).

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

1. **Object Identification and Shift:** One object is identified:
    * The top-middle connected '1's forming a horizontally flipped L-shape. This object is shifted one position to the left.
2. **Vertical Line:** A vertical line of '2's is drawn on the 3rd column (index 2).

##  Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  
  def is_target(obj):
    return any((i, j) in toindices(obj) and (j == 0 or i == 0 or i == h-1)
               for i in range(h) for j in range(w))
  
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  target_obj = extract(objs, is_target)
  shifted_obj = shift(target_obj, LEFT)
  recolored_obj = recolor(2, shifted_obj)

  col_to_recolor = 5 if index(I, (0, 5)) == bg else 2
  recolored_col = recolor(2, frozenset((i, col_to_recolor) for i in range(h)))

  O = paint(canvas(bg, (h, w)), merge((recolored_obj, recolored_col)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:** The `is_target` function identifies objects that touch either the top, left, or bottom borders of the grid.
2. **Shift and Recolor:**  The identified object is shifted left and recolored to '2'.
3. **Vertical Line:**  A vertical line of '2's is drawn on a fixed column (either the 6th or 3rd based on the background color at a specific location).
4. **Painting:** The transformed objects and the vertical line are painted onto a blank canvas with the background color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)

  shifted_objs = apply(lambda o: shift(o, LEFT), objects(I, T, F, T))
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda o: recolor(2, o), shifted_objs)

  target_col = 5 if all(I[i][5] == bg for i in range(h)) else 2
  vline_indices = frozenset((i, target_col) for i in range(h))
  recolored_vline = recolor(2, vline_indices)

  O = paint(canvas(bg, (h, w)), merge((recolored_objs, recolored_vline)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift and Recolor All:**  All objects are shifted one position left and recolored to '2'.
2. **Vertical Line:** A vertical line of '2's is drawn on a fixed column, similar to version 1.
3. **Painting:** The transformed objects and the vertical line are painted onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)

  def condition(i, j):
    return j == 0 or I[i][j] != bg and (i == 0 or i == h - 1)

  shifted_indices = frozenset((i, j - 1) for i in range(h) for j in range(w) if condition(i, j))
  recolored_indices = recolor(2, shifted_indices)

  target_col = 5 if all(I[i][5] == bg for i in range(h)) else 2
  vline_indices = frozenset((i, target_col) for i in range(h))
  recolored_vline = recolor(2, vline_indices)

  O = paint(canvas(bg, (h, w)), merge((recolored_indices, recolored_vline)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Shift:** The `condition` function identifies cells on the left border or non-background cells on the top and bottom borders. These cells are shifted left.
2. **Recolor:** The shifted cells are recolored to '2'.
3. **Vertical Line:** Similar to versions 1 and 2.
4. **Painting:** Similar to versions 1 and 2.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)

  target_objs = objects(I, T, F, T) - colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), bg)
  shifted_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, LEFT), target_objs)
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(2, obj), shifted_objs)

  target_col = 5 if all(I[i][5] == bg for i in range(h)) else 2
  vline_indices = frozenset((i, target_col) for i in range(h))
  recolored_vline = recolor(2, vline_indices)

  O = paint(canvas(bg, (h, w)), merge((recolored_objs, recolored_vline)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification (Excluding Background):** This version explicitly excludes background-colored objects from the shifting process. 
2. **Shift and Recolor:** Similar to version 2.
3. **Vertical Line:** Similar to versions 1, 2, and 3.
4. **Painting:** Similar to versions 1, 2, and 3.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)

  def shift_left_if_border(obj):
    return shift(obj, LEFT) if bordering(obj, I) else obj

  shifted_objs = apply(shift_left_if_border, objects(I, T, F, T))
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(2, obj), shifted_objs)

  col_to_recolor = 5 if index(I, (0, 5)) == bg else 2
  recolored_col = recolor(2, frozenset((i, col_to_recolor) for i in range(h)))

  O = paint(canvas(bg, (h, w)), merge((recolored_objs, recolored_col)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Conditional Shift:** This version shifts an object left only if it touches the border of the grid using the `bordering` function.
2. **Recolor:** Similar to previous versions.
3. **Vertical Line:** Similar to previous versions.
4. **Painting:** Similar to previous versions.


These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the required transformation by utilizing various DSL functions and logic.
