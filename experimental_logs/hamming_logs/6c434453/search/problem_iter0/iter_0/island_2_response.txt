## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify specific objects within the input grid and repaint them with a designated color (in this case, '2'). The selection of objects seems to be based on their shape and relative position within the grid. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Object Identification:** Two distinct objects from Input_0 are selected for repainting in Output_0. Both objects initially consist of the digit '1'.
    - Object 1: A horizontal line of three '1's located in the top left corner.
    - Object 2: An L-shaped object formed by three connected '1's in the bottom left corner and two '1's extending to the right.
2. **Repainting:** The identified objects are repainted with the digit '2' in the output grid, while maintaining their original shape and position.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. **Object Identification:** Similar to the previous example, two objects are selected from Input_1:
    - Object 1: A horizontal line of three '1's, this time positioned in the top right corner.
    - Object 2: An L-shaped object, mirrored compared to the previous example, formed by three connected '1's in the bottom right corner and two '1's extending to the left.
2. **Repainting:**  The selected objects are repainted with the digit '2' in Output_1, preserving their original structure and location. 

**Overall Transformation Logic:**

The transformation consistently identifies and repaints objects consisting of the digit '1' that exhibit either a horizontal line shape or a specific L-shaped structure. The position and orientation of these objects within the grid seem to be flexible.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the code that achieve the desired transformation, along with explanations:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    # Identify all objects composed of '1's
    x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
    # Filter for objects with a width of 3
    x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda o: width(o) == 3)
    # Repaint the selected objects with color '2'
    x3 = apply(lambda o: recolor(2, o), x2)
    # Merge the repainted objects
    x4 = merge(x3)
    # Paint the merged objects onto a blank canvas
    O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), x4)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- `objects(I, T, F, T)`: Extracts all connected objects formed by the digit '1', ignoring the background.
- `sfilter(x1, lambda o: width(o) == 3)`: Selects objects with a width of 3, capturing both the horizontal line and the L-shape (as one arm of the L has a width of 3).
- `apply(lambda o: recolor(2, o), x2)`: Recolors the chosen objects with the digit '2'.
- `merge(x3)`:  Combines the repainted objects into a single object.
- `paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), x4)`: Places the merged object onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    # Create a mask by replacing all '1's with '2'
    x1 = replace(I, 1, 2)
    # Extract all objects
    x2 = objects(x1, F, T, F)
    # Filter for objects containing the color '2'
    x3 = sfilter(x2, lambda o: 2 in palette(o))
    # Paint the selected objects onto a blank canvas
    O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(x3))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- `replace(I, 1, 2)`: Creates a new grid where every '1' is replaced by '2', essentially pre-painting the target objects.
- `objects(x1, F, T, F)`:  Finds all connected objects in the modified grid, regardless of their color.
- `sfilter(x2, lambda o: 2 in palette(o))`: Isolates objects containing the digit '2', which were originally the target objects.
- `paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(x3))`: Merges the selected objects and paints them onto a blank canvas.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Extract all objects composed of '1's
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  # Define a function to check for horizontal lines or L-shapes
  def is_target(obj):
    return hline(obj) or (width(obj) == 3 and height(obj) in [2, 3])
  # Filter for the target objects
  x2 = sfilter(x1, is_target)
  # Repaint the selected objects with '2'
  x3 = apply(lambda o: recolor(2, o), x2)
  # Paint the merged objects onto a blank canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(x3))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

- `objects(I, T, F, T)`:  Extracts connected objects made of '1's.
- `is_target(obj)`:  Defines a helper function to explicitly check if an object is a horizontal line (`hline(obj)`) or an L-shape (width of 3 and height of 2 or 3).
- `sfilter(x1, is_target)`: Filters for the objects matching the desired criteria.
- `apply(lambda o: recolor(2, o), x2)`: Recolors the selected objects.
- `paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(x3))`:  Combines and paints the objects onto a blank canvas.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find indices of all '1's in the grid
  x1 = ofcolor(I, 1)
  # Group the indices into objects
  x2 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  # Filter for objects that fully contain any 3 horizontally adjacent '1's
  x3 = sfilter(x2, lambda o: any(all(((i, j), (i, j+1), (i, j+2)) in toindices(o) for j in range(width(I)-2)) for i in range(height(I))))
  # Recolor the selected objects
  x4 = apply(lambda o: recolor(2, o), x3)
  # Paint onto a blank canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(x4)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

- `ofcolor(I, 1)`: Gets the indices of all cells containing '1'.
- `objects(I, T, F, T)`:  Extracts connected objects of '1's.
-  The `sfilter` with the nested lambda expression identifies objects containing three consecutive horizontal '1's.
-  The remaining steps recolor and paint the objects as before.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    # Extract objects of '1's 
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    # Filter: keep objects that are either hline or have exactly 5 cells 
    target_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: hline(obj) or size(obj) == 5)
    # Recolor the target objects with '2'
    recolored_objs = apply(lambda o: recolor(2, o), target_objs)
    # Create a blank canvas of the same size as the input
    canvas_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))
    # Paint the recolored objects onto the canvas
    O = paint(canvas_grid, merge(recolored_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

-  This version directly identifies target objects by checking if they are either horizontal lines (`hline(obj)`) or have exactly 5 cells (`size(obj) == 5`), which corresponds to our L-shapes.
- The rest of the logic remains consistent with previous versions.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the desired object identification and transformation, leveraging different functions and logic within the provided DSL. Each version offers a unique solution while adhering to the constraints of the programming language.
