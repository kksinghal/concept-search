## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific objects within the grid and recoloring them based on their spatial orientation.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Object Identification:** The program identifies all connected regions of the digit '1', treating each region as a distinct object.
2. **Orientation Check:** It then checks if these objects are oriented vertically (taller than they are wide).
3. **Recoloring:**  
    * Vertically oriented objects are recolored to the digit '2'.
    * The remaining objects retain their original color ('1').

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

This transformation follows the same logic as above, identifying objects formed by the digit '1' and recoloring only the vertically oriented ones to '2'.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions for "Program_to_be_generated":

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)  # Extract connected objects of same color
  recolored = set()
  for obj in objs:
    if portrait(obj):  # Check if the object is taller than wide
      recolored.add(recolor(2, obj))  # Recolor to '2' if vertical
    else:
      recolored.add(obj)  # Keep original color if not vertical
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(recolored))  # Paint on an empty canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:**  `objects(I, True, False, False)` extracts connected components of the same color from the input grid `I`.
2. **Orientation and Recoloring:**  The code iterates through each object `obj`:
   - `portrait(obj)` checks if the object is taller than it is wide (vertically oriented).
   - If vertical, `recolor(2, obj)` recolors the object to '2'.
   - Otherwise, the object retains its original color.
3. **Painting on Canvas:**  
   - `canvas(0, shape(I))` creates an empty grid of the same size as the input, filled with '0'.
   - `merge(recolored)` combines all the recolored (and unchanged) objects.
   - `paint` overlays the combined objects onto the empty canvas to generate the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  vertical_objs = sfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), portrait)  # Filter for vertical objects
  O = paint(I, merge(apply(rbind(recolor, 2), vertical_objs)))  # Recolor and paint directly on input
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Vertical Object Filtering:** 
   - `objects(I, True, False, False)` extracts connected components.
   - `sfilter(objects(...), portrait)` keeps only the objects that satisfy the `portrait` condition (taller than wide).
2. **Recoloring and Painting:**
   - `rbind(recolor, 2)` creates a partial function that recolors an object to '2'.
   - `apply(rbind(...), vertical_objs)` applies the recoloring to all vertical objects.
   - `merge(...)` combines the recolored objects.
   - `paint(I, ...)` directly paints these recolored objects onto the original input grid `I` to produce the output `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I  # Start with the input grid
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != 0 and portrait(toobject({(i, j)}, I)):  # Check object at each cell
        O = fill(O, 2, toobject({(i, j)}, I))  # Recolor if vertical
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterative Recoloring:**  This version iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`.
2. **Object Check:**
   - `toobject({(i, j)}, I)` constructs the object containing the current cell (i, j).
   - `portrait(toobject(...))` checks if this object is vertically oriented.
3. **Conditional Recoloring:**  If the cell belongs to a vertical object (`val != 0 and portrait(...)`),  `fill(O, 2, toobject(...))` recolors the entire object to '2' in the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  v_objs = mfilter(objs, portrait)  # Extract and merge vertical objects
  not_v_objs = difference(objs, v_objs)  # Objects that are not vertical
  O = paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), v_objs), not_v_objs)  # Paint in two steps
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Categorization:**
   -  Extracts connected objects and then separates them into two sets: `v_objs` (vertical objects) and `not_v_objs` (non-vertical objects).
2. **Two-Step Painting:**
   - `canvas(0, shape(I))` creates an empty canvas.
   - First, `paint(canvas(...), v_objs)` paints the vertical objects (recolored to '2' implicitly) onto the canvas.
   - Then, `paint(..., not_v_objs)` paints the non-vertical objects (retaining their original color) onto the same canvas, resulting in the final output `O`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    verticals = set()
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val != 0:
                obj = toobject({(i, j)}, I)
                if portrait(obj):
                    verticals.add(obj)
    O = I
    for obj in verticals:
        O = fill(O, 2, obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Vertical Object Collection:** This version first iterates through the grid to identify and store vertical objects in the `verticals` set. 
2. **Recoloring:** It then iterates through the collected vertical objects and uses `fill` to recolor them to '2' in the output grid `O`.


## Note: 

These programs are designed based on the provided input-output examples and the assumption that the background color is '0'. You might need to adjust the `without_bg` parameter in the `objects` function or add additional logic if the background color changes in other examples.
