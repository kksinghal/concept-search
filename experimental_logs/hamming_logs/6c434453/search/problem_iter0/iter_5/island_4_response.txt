## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on identifying specific object formations and recoloring them while preserving the rest of the grid. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation targets vertical lines of the digit '1', recoloring them to '2'. Other occurrences of '1' and the background (digit '0') remain unchanged.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the previous transformation, vertical lines of the digit '1' are identified and recolored to '2'. Again, other occurrences of '1' and the background (digit '0') are preserved.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False) # Extract connected objects of same color
  v_lines = mfilter(objs, vline) #Filter objects that are vertical lines
  recolored_objs = recolor(2, v_lines)  # Recolor vertical lines to '2'
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolored_objs) # Paint on an empty canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `objects(I, True, False, False)`: Extracts connected components (objects) from the input grid `I`, considering only objects with the same color (`True`), not connecting diagonally (`False`), and including the background (`False`).
2.  `mfilter(objs, vline)`: Filters the extracted objects (`objs`), keeping only those that form a vertical line (`vline`).
3.  `recolor(2, v_lines)`: Recolors the filtered vertical line objects to the digit '2'.
4.  `paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolored_objs)`: Creates a new canvas of the same size as the input grid (`shape(I)`) filled with '0' and paints the recolored objects onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(2, mfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda o: vline(o) and color(o) == 1)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, True, False, False)`:  Same as in Version 1.
2. `lambda o: vline(o) and color(o) == 1`: Defines an anonymous function that checks if an object is a vertical line (`vline`) and its color is '1'.
3. `mfilter(..., lambda o: ...)`: Filters the objects based on the anonymous function, keeping only vertical lines of color '1'.
4. `recolor(2, ...)`: Recolors the filtered objects to '2'.
5. `paint(I, ...)`: Paints the recolored objects directly onto the original input grid `I`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda ij: index(I, ij) == 1 and index(I, add(ij, DOWN)) == 1 and index(I, add(ij, UP)) == 1)
  return paint(I, recolor(2, toobject(indices, I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `asindices(I)`:  Gets all indices of the input grid `I`.
2. `lambda ij: index(I, ij) == 1 and index(I, add(ij, DOWN)) == 1 and index(I, add(ij, UP)) == 1`:  Defines an anonymous function to check if an index and its vertical neighbors (above and below) all have the value '1'.
3. `mfilter(..., lambda ij: ...)`: Filters the grid indices, keeping only those that are part of a vertical line of '1's.
4. `toobject(indices, I)`: Converts the filtered indices back into an object representation using the values from the input grid `I`.
5. `recolor(2, ...)` and `paint(I, ...)`:  Recolors the object to '2' and paints it onto the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  return tuple(tuple(2 if all(I[k][j] == 1 for k in range(max(0, i-1), min(h, i+2))) and I[i][j] == 1 else I[i][j] for j in range(w)) for i in range(h))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested list comprehensions to achieve the transformation without relying heavily on DSL functions. It iterates through each cell and checks if it's part of a vertical line of '1's by examining its immediate vertical neighbors. If it is, the cell is recolored to '2'; otherwise, it retains its original value.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  lines = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: width(obj) == 1 and color(obj) == 1)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(2, lines))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, True, False, False)`:  Extracts connected objects from the input grid.
2. `lambda obj: width(obj) == 1 and color(obj) == 1`: Defines a function to check if an object is a vertical line (width of 1) and has the color '1'.
3. `mfilter(objs, lambda obj: ...)`: Filters the objects, keeping only vertical lines of color '1'.
4. `recolor(2, lines)`: Recolors the filtered lines to '2'.
5. `paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), ...)`: Creates a new canvas and paints the recolored lines onto it.


These five program versions showcase different approaches to solving the given transformation problem, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
