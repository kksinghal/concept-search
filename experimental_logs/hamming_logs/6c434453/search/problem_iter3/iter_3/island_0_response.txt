## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves creating two specific shapes on a 10x10 canvas based on the input value:

**Input 0:**

- A "horizontal S" shape formed by the digit '1' is drawn on the right half of the canvas.
- A "staircase" shape formed by the digits '2' is drawn on the left half of the canvas.

**Input 1:**

- A "vertical S" shape formed by the digit '1' is drawn on the bottom half of the canvas.
- A "staircase" shape formed by the digit '2' is drawn on the top half of the canvas. 

The shapes maintain their basic form but are rotated and mirrored between the two inputs. The exact positioning and orientation of these shapes need to be captured in the code. 

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (8, 7)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7)}))
  elif I == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version directly hardcodes the coordinates of each cell for both shapes in both orientations. 
- It first creates a blank canvas and then paints the shapes based on the input value.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  s_shape = {(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0)}
  staircase_shape = {(0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6)}
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(s_shape, (3, 7))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, staircase_shape))
  elif I == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(rot90(s_shape), (7, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(rot90(staircase_shape), (5, 0))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version defines the shapes as sets of relative indices.
- It uses `shift` and `rot90` functions to position and orient the shapes correctly.
- This approach is more concise and easier to understand than hardcoding all coordinates.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  s_shape = hconcat(canvas(1, (1, 6)), hconcat(rot180(canvas(1, (2, 3))), canvas(1, (1, 3))))
  staircase_shape = hconcat(canvas(2, (3, 2)), hconcat(rot180(canvas(2, (1, 2))), canvas(2, (1, 2))))
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, asobject(shift(s_shape, (3, 7))))
    O = paint(O, asobject(staircase_shape))
  elif I == 2:
    O = paint(O, asobject(shift(rot90(s_shape), (7, 3))))
    O = paint(O, asobject(shift(rot90(staircase_shape), (5, 0))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version constructs the shapes using `canvas`, `hconcat`, and `rot180` functions. 
- It then uses `asobject` to convert the grids into objects for painting.
- This approach demonstrates building complex shapes from simpler elements.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def make_s_shape(color):
  return hconcat(canvas(color, (1, 6)), hconcat(rot180(canvas(color, (2, 3))), canvas(color, (1, 3))))

def make_staircase(color):
  return hconcat(canvas(color, (3, 2)), hconcat(rot180(canvas(color, (1, 2))), canvas(color, (1, 2))))

def program(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, asobject(shift(make_s_shape(1), (3, 7))))
    O = paint(O, asobject(make_staircase(2)))
  elif I == 2:
    O = paint(O, asobject(shift(rot90(make_s_shape(1)), (7, 3))))
    O = paint(O, asobject(shift(rot90(make_staircase(2)), (5, 0))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version introduces helper functions `make_s_shape` and `make_staircase` to improve code readability and organization.
- It uses these functions to generate the shapes with the desired color and then positions them on the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    for i, j in {(3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (8, 7)}:
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, j)}))
    for i, j in {(0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7)}:
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, j)}))
  elif I == 2:
    for i, j in {(7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8)}:
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, j)}))
    for i, j in {(5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3)}:
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, j)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates over the coordinates of each shape and paints individual cells.
- While less elegant than other versions, it demonstrates a different approach using loops.
