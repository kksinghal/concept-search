## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the location of the digit '1' in the input grid and then constructing specific shapes with the digit '2' and '1' in the output grid. The position of these constructed shapes is relative to the location of the '1' in the input.

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

1. **'2' Shape:** A '2' shape is constructed with its top-left corner two cells to the right and one cell down from the '1' in the input.
2. **'1' Shape:** A diagonal line of three '1's is placed with its top-left '1' seven cells to the right and seven cells down from the origin. 

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

1. **'2' Shape:** The '2' shape is placed one cell to the right and five cells down from the '1' in the input.
2. **'1' Shape:** The diagonal line of '1's remains at the same position as in the transformation from Input 0 to Output 0.


## Code Generation:

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 1):**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  # Find the '1' location
  one_i, one_j = first(toindices(ofcolor(I, 1)))

  # Construct the '2' shape indices
  two_shape = frozenset({(one_i + 1, one_j + 2), (one_i + 2, one_j + 1), 
                          (one_i + 2, one_j + 2), (one_i + 2, one_j + 3), 
                          (one_i + 3, one_j + 1), (one_i + 4, one_j + 1), 
                          (one_i + 5, one_j + 1), (one_i + 6, one_j + 2),
                          (one_i + 7, one_j + 2), (one_i + 7, one_j + 3),
                          (one_i + 7, one_j + 4), (one_i + 8, one_j + 4)}) 
  
  # Fill the canvas
  O = fill(canvas(0, (10, 10)), 2, two_shape)
  
  # Add diagonal '1's
  one_shape = frozenset({(one_i + 4, one_j - 3), (one_i + 5, one_j - 2),
                         (one_i + 6, one_j - 1)})
  O = fill(O, 1, one_shape)

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version directly calculates the indices for the '2' and '1' shapes based on the '1' location in the input.
- The `frozenset` is used to define the shape indices.
- The `fill` function places the '2's and '1's onto the canvas.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 2):**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  # Find the '1' location
  one_loc = first(toindices(ofcolor(I, 1)))

  # Construct the '2' shape using relative movements
  two_shape = shift(
                  frozenset({(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (3, 0), 
                            (4, 0), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (7, 3)}), 
                  add(one_loc, (1, 1)))
  
  # Construct the '1' shape using relative movements
  one_shape = shift(frozenset({(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)}), add(one_loc, (4, -3)))
  
  # Fill the canvas
  O = fill(canvas(0, (10, 10)), 2, two_shape)
  O = fill(O, 1, one_shape)

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses relative movements with the `shift` function to position the '2' and '1' shapes.
-  A base shape is defined and then shifted based on the '1' location.
-  The `add` function calculates the final offset for the shape placement.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 3):**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  # Find the '1' location
  one_i, one_j = first(toindices(ofcolor(I, 1)))

  # Define base shapes for '2' and '1'
  base_two_shape = ((0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), 
                    (2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), 
                    (0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
                    (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
                    (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0),
                    (0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0),
                    (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0),
                    (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0))

  base_one_shape = ((1, 1, 1), 
                    (0, 1, 0), 
                    (0, 0, 1))

  # Convert base shapes to object format
  two_obj = asobject(base_two_shape)
  one_obj = asobject(base_one_shape)

  # Shift the objects to their final positions
  final_two_shape = shift(two_obj, (one_i, one_j))
  final_one_shape = shift(one_obj, (one_i + 4, one_j - 3))

  # Paint the objects on the canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), final_two_shape)
  O = paint(O, final_one_shape)

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version defines the '2' and '1' shapes directly as grids and then converts them to objects.
- It uses the `asobject` function for the conversion and the `shift` function for positioning.
- The `paint` function draws the objects onto the canvas.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 4):**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  # Find the '1' location
  one_i, one_j = first(toindices(ofcolor(I, 1)))

  # Define functions to create lines of '2's
  def create_vline(start, length):
    return frozenset({(start[0] + i, start[1]) for i in range(length)})

  def create_hline(start, length):
    return frozenset({(start[0], start[1] + j) for j in range(length)})

  # Construct the '2' shape using line functions
  two_shape = combine(
    create_vline((one_i + 1, one_j + 2), 3),
    combine(
        create_hline((one_i + 2, one_j + 1), 3),
        combine(
            create_vline((one_i + 7, one_j + 2), 2),
            create_hline((one_i + 7, one_j + 3), 2)
        )
    )
  )

  # Construct the '1' shape using a loop
  one_shape = frozenset()
  for i in range(3):
    one_shape = one_shape | {(one_i + 4 + i, one_j - 3 + i)}

  # Fill the canvas
  O = fill(canvas(0, (10, 10)), 2, two_shape)
  O = fill(O, 1, one_shape)

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses separate functions to create vertical and horizontal lines of '2's.
-  It then combines these lines to construct the final '2' shape.
-  The '1' shape is constructed using a loop to add indices iteratively.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 5):**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  # Find the '1' location
  one_loc = first(toindices(ofcolor(I, 1)))

  # Define the '2' shape as a list of relative movements
  two_movements = [(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), 
                  (6, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 4)]

  # Calculate '2' shape indices based on relative movements
  two_shape = frozenset({add(one_loc, move) for move in two_movements})

  # Construct the '1' shape using connect function
  one_shape = connect((one_i + 4, one_j - 3), (one_i + 6, one_j - 1))

  # Fill the canvas
  O = fill(canvas(0, (10, 10)), 2, two_shape)
  O = fill(O, 1, one_shape)

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version defines the '2' shape as a list of relative movements from the '1' location.
- It then iterates through the movements and calculates the final shape indices.
- The `connect` function is used to efficiently generate the diagonal line of '1's.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to code generation, each leveraging different DSL functions and logic to achieve the same desired transformation.
