## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single-cell object as input and generates two distinct shapes, 'C' and 'c', on a 10x10 canvas. The 'C' shape is larger and positioned to the lower-right of the 'c' shape. The positions of both shapes are relative to the input object's location.

**Specifics:**

* **Input_0 & Output_0:** The single cell acts as an anchor point. The 'C' shape is drawn with its top-left corner two cells to the right and two cells down from the input cell. The 'c' shape is drawn with its top-left corner one cell to the right and one cell down from the input cell.  'C' is filled with color '1', 'c' with color '2'.
* **Input_1 & Output_1:**  The transformation follows the same logic as in the previous example, maintaining the relative positioning of 'C' and 'c' shapes to the input cell.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct programs implementing the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:** (Inspired by shape construction in Program A)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Get input object location
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, False))
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)

  # Construct 'C' shape
  C = (
    {(i + 2, j + 2), (i + 3, j + 2), (i + 2, j + 3)} | 
    {(i + r, j + 3) for r in range(4, 9)} |
    {(i + 6, j + 2), (i + 7, j + 2), (i + 7, j + 1), (i + 8, j + 1)} |
    {(i + 8, j + c) for c in range(3, 9)} |
    {(i + 7, j + 8)}
  )

  # Construct 'c' shape
  c = (
    {(i + 2, j + 1), (i + 2, j + 2), (i + 3, j + 2), (i + 3, j + 1)} |
    {(i + r, j + 1) for r in range(4, 8)} |
    {(i + r, j + 2) for r in range(5, 7)} |
    {(i + 6, j + 1)}
  )

  # Paint shapes on canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(1, C) | recolor(2, c))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate Input:**  Finds the input object and its upper-left corner coordinates.
2. **Construct Shapes:**  Defines the 'C' and 'c' shapes using set notation and coordinate offsets relative to the input cell.
3. **Paint Canvas:**  Creates a blank 10x10 canvas and paints the shapes with their respective colors.

**Program Version 2:** (Inspired by shape shifting in Program B)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Get input object location
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, False))
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)

  # Define base 'C' shape
  base_C = frozenset({(1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), 
                       (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), 
                       (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (6, 7)})

  # Define base 'c' shape
  base_c = frozenset({(1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), 
                       (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0)})

  # Shift and recolor shapes
  C = shift(recolor(1, base_C), (i + 1, j + 1))
  c = shift(recolor(2, base_c), (i + 1, j))

  # Paint shapes on canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), C | c)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate Input:**  Finds the input object and its upper-left corner coordinates.
2. **Define Base Shapes:**  Defines the base shapes of 'C' and 'c' at the origin.
3. **Shift and Recolor:** Shifts the base shapes to their correct positions relative to the input and recolors them.
4. **Paint Canvas:**  Creates a blank 10x10 canvas and paints the shifted and recolored shapes.

**Program Version 3:** (Using loops for shape generation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Get input object location
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, False))
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)

  # Initialize canvas
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Paint 'C' shape
  for r in range(i + 2, i + 9):
    O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({(r, j + 3)}))
  for c in range(j + 2, j + 8):
    O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({(i + 8, c)}))
  O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({(i + 2, j + 2), (i + 3, j + 2), (i + 7, j + 2), (i + 7, j + 1), (i + 8, j + 1)}))

  # Paint 'c' shape
  for r in range(i + 2, i + 7):
    O = fill(O, 2, frozenset({(r, j + 1)}))
  for c in range(j + 1, j + 3):
    O = fill(O, 2, frozenset({(i + 3, c), (i + 6, c)}))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate Input:**  Finds the input object and its upper-left corner coordinates.
2. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates a blank 10x10 canvas.
3. **Paint 'C' & 'c' Shapes:** Uses nested loops to iterate over the rows and columns of the shapes and paints them cell by cell on the canvas.

**Program Version 4:** (Using 'connect' function for lines)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Get input object location
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, False))
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)

  # Define corner points for 'C'
  C_ul = (i + 2, j + 2) 
  C_ur = (i + 8, j + 2)
  C_ll = (i + 8, j + 8)

  # Define corner points for 'c'
  c_ul = (i + 2, j + 1)
  c_lr = (i + 6, j + 2)

  # Construct shapes using 'connect'
  C = connect(C_ul, (C_ul[0], C_ur[1])) | connect(C_ur, C_ll) | {(C_ll[0] - 1, C_ll[1])}
  c = connect(c_ul, (c_lr[0], c_ul[1])) | connect((c_lr[0], c_ul[1]), c_lr) | {(c_ul[0], c_lr[1])}

  # Paint on canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(1, C) | recolor(2, c))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate Input:**  Finds the input object and its upper-left corner coordinates.
2. **Define Corner Points:**  Calculates the corner points of both 'C' and 'c' shapes relative to the input.
3. **Construct Shapes:**  Uses the `connect` function to create the lines forming the shapes based on the calculated corner points.
4. **Paint Canvas:**  Creates a blank 10x10 canvas and paints the constructed shapes with their respective colors.

**Program Version 5:** (Combining shapes from smaller parts)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Get input object location
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, False))
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)

  # Define base horizontal and vertical lines
  h_line = frozenset({(0, c) for c in range(6)})
  v_line = frozenset({(r, 0) for r in range(7)})

  # Construct 'C' shape
  C = shift(v_line, (i + 2, j + 2)) | shift(hmirror(h_line), (i + 2, j + 3)) | {(i + 8, j + 1)}

  # Construct 'c' shape
  c = shift(h_line, (i + 2, j + 1)) | shift(v_line, (i + 3, j + 2)) | {(i + 7, j + 1)}

  # Paint shapes on canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(1, C) | recolor(2, c))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate Input:**  Finds the input object and its upper-left corner coordinates.
2. **Define Base Lines:** Defines base horizontal and vertical lines.
3. **Construct Shapes:**  Constructs both 'C' and 'c' shapes by shifting, mirroring, and combining these base lines. 
4. **Paint Canvas:**  Creates a blank 10x10 canvas and paints the constructed shapes with their respective colors.


Each version utilizes a different approach, demonstrating distinct logic and DSL function combinations to achieve the same transformation.
