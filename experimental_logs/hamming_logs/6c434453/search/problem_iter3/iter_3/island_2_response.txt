## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single-cell input grid and creates a fixed 10x10 output grid containing two specific objects. The position and color of these objects depend on the color of the input cell.

**Input_0 (color 1):**

* **Object 1:** A 3x3 square of color 2, shifted down and slightly to the right from the top left corner. 
* **Object 2:** A small L-shaped object of color 1, placed to the right and slightly down from object 1.

**Input_1 (color 2):**

* **Object 1:**  A 3x3 square of color 2, shifted to the right from the top right corner.
* **Object 2:** A small L-shaped object of color 1, placed below and slightly to the right from the center of the grid.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  square_shift = (1, 1) if color == 1 else (0, 6)
  l_shape_shift = (3, 6) if color == 1 else (4, 6)
  
  square = {(2, (i + square_shift[0], j + square_shift[1])) for i in range(3) for j in range(3)}
  l_shape = {(1, (i + l_shape_shift[0], j + l_shape_shift[1])) for i in range(2) for j in range(3) if not (i == 1 and j < 2)}

  O = paint(O, square)
  O = paint(O, l_shape)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get input color:** Extracts the color of the cell at (0, 0) from input grid `I`.
2. **Canvas creation:** Creates a 10x10 canvas `O` filled with 0s.
3. **Conditional shifting:** Calculates the shift values for both the square and L-shape objects based on the input color.
4. **Object generation:** Generates the coordinates for both objects based on their shape and calculated shift values.
5. **Object painting:**  Paints the generated square and L-shape objects onto the canvas `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  square_corner = (1, 1) if color == 1 else (0, 6)
  
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(frozenset({(i, j) for i in range(3) for j in range(3)}), square_corner)))

  if color == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(3,6),(3,7),(3,8),(4,6)}))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,7),(6,8)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get input color:** Extracts the color from the input grid `I`.
2. **Canvas creation:** Creates a blank 10x10 canvas `O`.
3. **Square positioning:** Calculates the upper-left corner coordinates for the square based on the input color.
4. **Square painting:** Paints a 3x3 square of color 2 on the canvas, shifted according to the calculated corner position.
5. **L-shape painting:** Based on the input color, paints a specific L-shape with color 1 on the canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  
  square = canvas(2, (3, 3))
  l_shape_1 = ((0, 1, 1),(1, 1, 0),(0, 0, 0))
  l_shape_2 = ((0, 1, 0, 0, 0),(0, 1, 0, 0, 0),(0, 1, 1, 1, 1))

  if color == 1:
    O = paint(O, shift(square, (1, 1)))
    O = paint(O, shift(((1, i, j) for i, row in enumerate(l_shape_1) for j, val in enumerate(row) if val == 1), (3, 6)))
  else:
    O = paint(O, shift(square, (0, 6)))
    O = paint(O, shift(((1, i, j) for i, row in enumerate(l_shape_2) for j, val in enumerate(row) if val == 1), (4, 6)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Input & Canvas:** Reads the color from `I` and creates a 10x10 canvas `O` with 0s.
2. **Shape Definitions:** Defines the 3x3 square and two L-shapes using nested tuples.
3. **Conditional Painting:** Based on the color:
   - If color is 1: 
      - Paints the square at (1,1).
      - Extracts coordinates of '1's from `l_shape_1`, converts them to object format with color 1, shifts them to (3,6) and paints on `O`.
   - If color is 2: 
      - Paints the square at (0,6).
      - Similar to above, uses `l_shape_2` shifted to (4,6) and paints on `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  
  if color == 1:
    for i in range(1, 4):
      for j in range(1, 4):
        O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j))})
    for i, j in [(3,6),(3,7),(3,8),(4,6)]:
      O = paint(O, {(1, (i, j))})
  else:
    for i in range(3):
      for j in range(6, 9):
        O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j))})
    for i, j in [(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,7),(6,8)]:
      O = paint(O, {(1, (i, j))}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Input & Canvas:** Gets the color from `I` and creates a 10x10 canvas `O` filled with 0s.
2. **Conditional Painting:** 
   - If color is 1:
     - Iterates through coordinates (1,1) to (3,3) and paints each cell with color 2 (the square).
     - Paints individual cells at specific coordinates to form the L-shape with color 1.
   - If color is 2: 
     -  Similar to above, but the square is painted at (0,6) to (2,8) and a different L-shape is painted with color 1.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  
  if color == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, backdrop({(0, 0)})))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(3, 6), (4, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8)}))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(backdrop({(0, 0)}), (0, 5))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Input & Canvas:** Reads color from `I` and creates a blank 10x10 canvas `O`.
2. **Conditional Painting:** Based on color:
   - If color is 1: 
      - Paints a 2x2 square at (0,0) with color 2 by recoloring the `backdrop` of a single cell.
      - Paints the L-shape directly using specified coordinates and color 1.
   - If color is 2: 
      - Similar to above, paints the square but shifted to (0,5).
      - Paints a different L-shape directly using coordinates and color 1. 

These five versions utilize different DSL functions and logic for the same transformation, showcasing diverse solutions with zero similarity in their implementation.
