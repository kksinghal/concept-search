## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to be based on the input color and involves placing a 3x3 square and an L-shaped object on a 10x10 canvas.

**Input_0 (color 1):**

* A 3x3 square of color 2 is placed with its upper left corner at (1, 1).
* An L-shaped object of color 1 (4 cells) is placed with its upper left corner at (4, 6). The L-shape is oriented horizontally.

**Input_1 (color 1):**

* A 3x3 square of color 2 is placed with its upper left corner at (5, 1).
* An L-shaped object of color 1 (4 cells) is placed with its upper left corner at (6, 6). The L-shape is oriented vertically.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Square Placement
  square_start = (1, 1) if color == 1 else (5, 1)
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(1, (3, 3)), square_start)))

  # L-Shape Placement
  L_shape = frozenset({(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)}) if color == 1 else frozenset({(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)})
  L_shape_start = (4, 6)
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(L_shape, L_shape_start)))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with zeros.
2. **Color Detection:** Determines the input color at position (0, 0).
3. **Square Placement:** Calculates the starting position of the 3x3 square based on the input color. It creates a 3x3 square filled with 1s, recolors it to 2, shifts it to the calculated position, and paints it on the canvas.
4. **L-Shape Placement:** Defines the L-shape using two different `frozenset` representations based on the input color (horizontal or vertical). It shifts the chosen L-shape to position (4, 6), recolors it to 1, and paints it on the canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Square Placement
  square_start = add((1, 1), multiply((4, 0), (color != 1)))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asindices(canvas(1, (3, 3))), square_start)))

  # L-Shape Placement
  L_shape = frozenset({(i, 0) for i in range(3)}) | {(2, 1)}
  L_shape = L_shape if color == 1 else rot90(L_shape)
  L_shape_start = (4, 6)
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(L_shape, L_shape_start)))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Color Detection:** Similar to Version 1.
3. **Square Placement:** Uses arithmetic operations to calculate the square's starting position. If the color is not 1, it adds (4, 0) to the base position (1, 1); otherwise, it keeps the base position.
4. **L-Shape Placement:** Defines a basic L-shape and rotates it 90 degrees if the color is not 1. This version uses `rot90` for rotation and set union (`|`) for constructing the L-shape.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Square Placement
  square_offset = (4, 0) if color != 1 else (0, 0)
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(1, (3, 3)), add((1, 1), square_offset))))

  # L-Shape Placement
  L_shape = {(i, j) for i in range(3) for j in range(2)}
  L_shape.update({(2, j) for j in range(2, 4 if color == 1 else 3)})
  L_shape_start = (4, 6)
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(frozenset(L_shape), L_shape_start)))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Color Detection:** Similar to Version 1.
3. **Square Placement:** Calculates the offset for the square based on color and adds it to the base position (1, 1).
4. **L-Shape Placement:** Builds the L-shape incrementally using a set comprehension and `update`. The horizontal L-shape has one extra column compared to the vertical one.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Square Placement
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(1, (3, 3)), (1, 1) if color == 1 else (5, 1))))

  # L-Shape Placement
  L_shape = frozenset({(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)}) if color == 1 else frozenset({(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)})
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(L_shape, (4, 6))))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Color Detection:** Similar to Version 1.
3. **Square Placement:** Directly embeds the conditional logic for the square's starting position within the `shift` function call.
4. **L-Shape Placement:** Similar to Version 1 but directly embeds the L-shape's starting position.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Square Placement
  square_start = (color == 1) * (1, 1) + (color != 1) * (5, 1) 
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(1, (3, 3)), square_start)))

  # L-Shape Placement
  L_shape = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(4) for j in range(3) if (i, j) in [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)]) if color == 1 else frozenset((i, j) for i in range(3) for j in range(4) if (i, j) in [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)])
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(L_shape, (4, 6))))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Color Detection:** Similar to Version 1.
3. **Square Placement:** Calculates the square's starting position using boolean multiplication and addition.
4. **L-Shape Placement:** Uses a more compact representation of the L-shape, directly embedding the shape definition within a conditional statement based on the input color.

These five program versions showcase distinct logic and function combinations to achieve the same transformation.  Remember to test each version thoroughly to ensure it produces the correct output for both inputs.
