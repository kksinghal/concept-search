## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves placing two specific shapes, 'T' and 'L', on a 10x10 canvas. The shapes and their positions are determined by the input 'I'.

**Input 0:**

- A 'T' shape formed by the digit '2' is placed at the top left corner of the canvas.
- An 'L' shape formed by the digit '1' is placed towards the bottom right of the canvas.

**Input 1:**

- The 'T' shape from Input 0 is horizontally mirrored and placed towards the top right of the canvas.
- The 'L' shape from Input 0 is rotated 90 degrees clockwise and placed slightly to the left of its position in Input 0.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) # Create canvas

  T = ((2,2,2), (0,2,0), (0,2,0)) # Define T shape
  L = ((1, 1), (1, 0), (1, 0)) # Define L shape

  if I != 1:
    T = hmirror(T) # Mirror T shape if I is not 1
    L = rot90(L) # Rotate L shape if I is not 1

  T_pos = (0, 1) if I == 1 else (0, 5) # Determine T position based on I
  L_pos = (4, 6) if I == 1 else (3, 6) # Determine L position based on I

  O = paint(O, asobject(shift(T, T_pos))) # Paint T shape
  O = paint(O, asobject(shift(L, L_pos))) # Paint L shape
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This program directly addresses the transformation logic:

1. **Shape Definition:** Defines the 'T' and 'L' shapes as tuples.
2. **Conditional Transformation:** Mirrors the 'T' shape and rotates the 'L' shape if 'I' is not 1.
3. **Position Determination:** Sets the positions of 'T' and 'L' based on the value of 'I'.
4. **Shape Placement:** Paints the shapes onto the canvas at their respective positions.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  def shape_placer(shape, pos, mirror_shape=False, rotate_shape=False):
    """Places a shape on the canvas with optional mirroring and rotation."""
    if mirror_shape:
      shape = hmirror(shape)
    if rotate_shape:
      shape = rot90(shape)
    return paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), asobject(shift(shape, pos)))
  
  T = ((2,2,2), (0,2,0), (0,2,0))
  L = ((1, 1), (1, 0), (1, 0))
  
  return shape_placer(T, (0, 1) if I==1 else (0, 5), mirror_shape= I!=1) if I==1 else shape_placer(L, (4, 6) if I==1 else (3, 6), rotate_shape= I!=1) 
```

**Explanation:**

This program uses a functional approach:

1. **`shape_placer` Function:** Defines a function to handle shape placement, mirroring, and rotation.
2. **Shape Definition:** Defines the 'T' and 'L' shapes.
3. **Conditional Placement:** Calls `shape_placer` with the appropriate arguments based on the value of 'I'.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  """Places 'T' and 'L' shapes on a canvas based on input I."""
  def apply_transformations(shape, transformations):
    """Applies a sequence of transformations to a shape."""
    for transform in transformations:
      shape = transform(shape)
    return shape

  T_transformations = [] if I == 1 else [hmirror]
  L_transformations = [] if I == 1 else [rot90]

  T = apply_transformations(((2,2,2), (0,2,0), (0,2,0)), T_transformations)
  L = apply_transformations(((1, 1), (1, 0), (1, 0)), L_transformations)

  T_pos = (0, 1) if I == 1 else (0, 5) 
  L_pos = (4, 6) if I == 1 else (3, 6) 

  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, asobject(shift(T, T_pos)))  
  O = paint(O, asobject(shift(L, L_pos)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This program focuses on code reusability and separation of concerns:

1. **`apply_transformations` Function:** Creates a reusable function to apply a series of transformations to a shape.
2. **Transformation Definition:** Defines lists of transformations for each shape based on 'I'.
3. **Shape Transformation:** Applies the defined transformations to the base shapes.
4. **Shape Placement:** Places the transformed shapes on the canvas.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  shapes = {
      1: {"T": (((2,2,2),(0,2,0),(0,2,0)), (0,1)), "L": (((1,1),(1,0),(1,0)), (4,6))},
      0: {"T": (hmirror(((2,2,2),(0,2,0),(0,2,0))), (0,5)), "L": (rot90(((1,1),(1,0),(1,0))), (3,6))}
  }
  for shape_name in ["T", "L"]:
    shape, pos = shapes[I][shape_name]
    O = paint(O, asobject(shift(shape, pos)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This program uses a data-driven approach:

1. **Shape Data:** Stores shape definitions and positions in a dictionary, keyed by the input 'I'.
2. **Shape Placement:** Iterates through the shapes and their corresponding data, painting them onto the canvas.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  """ Generates the output grid based on the input I. """
  def place_shape(O, shape, pos):
    """ Places a given shape at the specified position on the canvas. """
    return paint(O, asobject(shift(shape, pos)))

  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) # Create a 10x10 canvas filled with 0s

  # Define the T and L shapes
  T = ((2, 2, 2), (0, 2, 0), (0, 2, 0))
  L = ((1, 1), (1, 0), (1, 0))

  # Conditionally transform and place the shapes
  if I == 1:
    O = place_shape(O, T, (0, 1))
    O = place_shape(O, L, (4, 6))
  else:
    O = place_shape(O, hmirror(T), (0, 5))
    O = place_shape(O, rot90(L), (3, 6))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This program emphasizes code readability and modularity:

1. **`place_shape` Function:** Defines a function for placing shapes at given positions.
2. **Shape Definition:** Defines the 'T' and 'L' shapes.
3. **Conditional Placement:** Conditionally transforms and places the shapes based on the input 'I' using the `place_shape` function.

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and programming paradigms. Each version offers unique advantages in terms of readability, reusability, and scalability, catering to different programming styles and preferences.
