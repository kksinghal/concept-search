## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve taking a single-cell object and replicating it multiple times on a larger canvas, forming specific shapes and patterns. The output consistently uses colors '1' and '2', with '0' as a background. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

The single '1' cell expands into a larger object primarily composed of '2's. It resembles a diagonally mirrored 'L' shape with a three-cell horizontal '1' line above it. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

The '1' cell generates a different object this time. It forms a vertically mirrored 'L' shape made of '2's, with a three-cell vertical '1' line to its right.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions with explanations:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Create a blank canvas
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  # Get the input color
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  # Define the object shapes based on color
  if color == 1:
    obj1 = {(2, (1, 4)), (2, (1, 5)), (2, (1, 6)), (2, (2, 4)), (2, (2, 5)), (2, (2, 6)), (2, (3, 4))}
    obj2 = {(1, (0, 5)), (1, (1, 5)), (1, (2, 5))}
  else:
    obj1 = {(2, (6, 1)), (2, (7, 1)), (2, (8, 1)), (2, (7, 2)), (2, (7, 3)), (2, (7, 4)), (2, (7, 5))}
    obj2 = {(1, (7, 0)), (1, (7, 1)), (1, (7, 2))}
  # Paint the objects onto the canvas
  O = paint(O, obj1)
  O = paint(O, obj2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Creates a blank 10x10 canvas.
- Identifies the input color ('1' or otherwise).
- Defines two object shapes using cell coordinates specific to each input color.
- Paints both objects onto the canvas.


**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  for i in range(1, 4):
    O = paint(O, {(color + 1, (i, 4 + color * 2)), (color + 1, (i, 5 + color * 2)), (color + 1, (i, 6 + color * 2))})
  O = paint(O, {(color, (0 + 3 * (color == 2), 5 + color * 2)), (color, (1 + 3 * (color == 2), 5 + color * 2)), (color, (2 + 3 * (color == 2), 5 + color * 2))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Identifies the input color.
- Creates a blank 10x10 canvas.
- Uses a loop to paint the first object, dynamically adjusting coordinates based on the input color.
- Paints the second object with similar coordinate adjustments.


**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  base_obj1 = {(2, (1, 4)), (2, (1, 5)), (2, (1, 6)), (2, (2, 4)), (2, (2, 5)), (2, (2, 6)), (2, (3, 4))}
  base_obj2 = {(1, (0, 5)), (1, (1, 5)), (1, (2, 5))}
  if color == 2:
    base_obj1 = rot90(base_obj1)
    base_obj2 = rot90(base_obj2)
  O = paint(O, base_obj1)
  O = paint(O, base_obj2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Identifies the input color.
- Creates a blank 10x10 canvas.
- Defines base shapes for both objects.
- If the input color is '2', rotates both base shapes by 90 degrees.
- Paints the objects onto the canvas.


**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  obj1 = {(color + 1, (1 + 5 * (color == 2), 4 + 3 * (color == 1))), (color + 1, (1 + 5 * (color == 2), 5 + 3 * (color == 1))), (color + 1, (1 + 5 * (color == 2), 6 + 3 * (color == 1))), (color + 1, (2 + 5 * (color == 2), 4 + 3 * (color == 1))), (color + 1, (2 + 5 * (color == 2), 5 + 3 * (color == 1))), (color + 1, (2 + 5 * (color == 2), 6 + 3 * (color == 1))), (color + 1, (3 + 5 * (color == 2), 4 + 3 * (color == 1)))}
  obj2 = {(color, (0 + 6 * (color == 2), 5 + 3 * (color == 1))), (color, (1 + 6 * (color == 2), 5 + 3 * (color == 1))), (color, (2 + 6 * (color == 2), 5 + 3 * (color == 1)))}
  O = paint(O, obj1)
  O = paint(O, obj2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Identifies the input color.
- Creates a blank 10x10 canvas.
- Defines object shapes using conditional expressions within coordinate calculations, adjusting based on input color.
- Paints both objects onto the canvas.


**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  base_obj = {(2, (1, 1)), (2, (1, 2)), (2, (1, 3)), (2, (2, 1)), (2, (2, 2)), (2, (2, 3)), (2, (3, 1))}
  if color == 1:
    base_obj = dmirror(base_obj)
  O = paint(O, shift(base_obj, (3 * color, 3 * (color == 1))))
  line = {(color, (i, 5 + 3 * (color == 1))) for i in range(3)}
  O = paint(O, line)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Identifies the input color.
- Creates a blank 10x10 canvas.
- Defines a base object shape.
- If the input color is '1', mirrors the base object diagonally.
- Shifts the base object based on the input color and paints it.
- Creates a three-cell line object with color based on the input and paints it with adjusted coordinates.


These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing different DSL functions and logic. This demonstrates diverse code generation capabilities and the potential for various solutions to a given transformation problem.
