## Transformation Analysis:

This transformation seems to involve creating two distinct shapes on a larger canvas based on the input value.  Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

* The output grid is a 10x10 canvas.
* A 'T' shaped object formed with the digit '1' is placed in the bottom left corner.
* Another 'L' shaped object formed with the digit '2' is placed in the top right corner.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

* The output grid is a 10x10 canvas.
* A mirrored 'T' shaped object formed with the digit '1' is placed in the top left corner.
* A mirrored 'L' shaped object formed with the digit '2' is placed in the bottom right corner.


## Program Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    T_shape = asobject(((1, 1, 1), (0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 0)))
    L_shape = asobject(((2, 0, 0), (2, 2, 2)))
    O = paint(O, T_shape, (4, 1))
    O = paint(O, L_shape, (0, 6))
  elif I == 2:
    T_shape = asobject(((0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 0), (1, 1, 1)))
    L_shape = asobject(((2, 2, 2), (0, 0, 2)))
    O = paint(O, T_shape, (0, 1))
    O = paint(O, L_shape, (5, 6))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version predefines the 'T' and 'L' shapes as objects.
* Depending on the input value, it selects either the original or the mirrored version of each shape.
* It then paints these shapes onto the canvas at specific locations to match the desired output.


## Program Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)}),)
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8)}),)
  elif I == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2), (1, 0)}),)
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8)}),)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version directly paints the required cells with the specific colors at the correct coordinates.
* It uses the `recolor` function to efficiently paint multiple cells with the same color.
* This approach avoids defining separate objects and simplifies the code.


## Program Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(1, {(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (1, -1), (1, -2)}), (4, 3)),)
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(2, {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (-1, 1), (-2, 1)}), (2, 6)),)
  elif I == 2:
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(1, {(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)}), (0, 1)),)
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(2, {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1)}), (5, 6)),)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version defines the base shapes of 'T' and 'L' at the origin (0, 0).
* It uses `recolor` to assign the desired colors.
* Then, it utilizes `shift` to move the shapes to their final positions on the canvas.
* This approach allows for easier modification of shape positions if needed.


## Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  if I == 1:
    T_shape = ((0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 0), (1, 1, 1))
    L_shape = ((2, 2, 2), (0, 0, 2))
    return paint(paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), asobject(T_shape), (0, 1)), asobject(L_shape), (5, 6))
  elif I == 2:
    T_shape = ((1, 1, 1), (0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 0))
    L_shape = ((2, 0, 0), (2, 2, 2))
    return paint(paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), asobject(T_shape), (4, 1)), asobject(L_shape), (0, 6))
```

**Explanation:**

* This version directly constructs and paints the shapes within the return statement. 
* It avoids intermediate variables and uses nested `paint` calls for a more concise code structure.
* The logic for selecting the shape orientation based on input remains the same.

## Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    O = fill(O, 1, connect((4, 1), (6, 1)) | connect((5, 1), (5, 3)))
    O = fill(O, 2, connect((0, 6), (2, 6)) | connect((1, 6), (1, 8)))
  elif I == 2:
    O = fill(O, 1, connect((0, 1), (2, 1)) | connect((1, 0), (1, 2)))
    O = fill(O, 2, connect((5, 6), (7, 6)) | connect((6, 6), (6, 8)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version uses the `connect` function to define lines that form the 'T' and 'L' shapes.
* It then uses `fill` to paint these lines with the appropriate colors on the canvas.
* This approach provides a more geometric way of defining the shapes.

These five program versions demonstrate diverse ways to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL. Each version utilizes different functions and logic, highlighting the flexibility of the DSL and offering multiple solutions to the problem.
