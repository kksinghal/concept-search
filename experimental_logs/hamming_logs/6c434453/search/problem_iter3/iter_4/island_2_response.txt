## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in both input-output pairs involves creating specific shapes on a canvas based on the color of the input cell. 

**Input 0:**

* **Shape 1:**  A 3x3 square of value '2' is placed with its upper-left corner at (1,1).
* **Shape 2:** An 'L' shape of value '1' is placed with its corner at (4,6). 

**Input 1:**

* **Shape 1:**  A 3x3 square of value '2' is placed with its upper-left corner at (5,1).
* **Shape 2:** A different 'L' shape of value '1' is placed with its corner at (6,6).


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:** (Using conditional branching and direct cell manipulation)

```python
def program_version_1(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  
  if color == 1:
    # Shape 1
    for i in range(1, 4):
      for j in range(1, 4):
        O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j))})
    # Shape 2
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(6,7),(6,8)}))
  else:
    # Shape 1
    for i in range(1, 4):
      for j in range(6, 9):
        O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j))})
    # Shape 2
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(7,6),(8,6),(8,7),(8,8)}))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** Creates a 10x10 canvas `O` filled with '0'.
2. **Color Check:** Reads the color of the input cell (0,0).
3. **Conditional Shape Generation:**
   - If color is 1:
      - Creates a 3x3 square of '2's by iterating and painting cells (1,1) to (3,3).
      - Creates the first 'L' shape using `recolor` and `paint` at (4,6).
   - Else:
      - Creates a 3x3 square of '2's by iterating and painting cells (1,6) to (3,8).
      - Creates the second 'L' shape using `recolor` and `paint` at (4,6). 

**Program Version 2:** (Using shifted pre-defined shapes)

```python
def program_version_2(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  square = canvas(2, (3, 3))
  L_shape_1 = frozenset({(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)})
  L_shape_2 = frozenset({(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)})

  if color == 1:
    O = paint(O, shift(square, (1, 1)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(L_shape_1, (4, 6))))
  else:
    O = paint(O, shift(square, (5, 1)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(L_shape_2, (6, 6))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shape Definitions:** Pre-defines the square and two 'L' shapes as `frozenset` of indices.
2. **Canvas and Color:** Initializes the canvas and reads the input color.
3. **Conditional Painting:**
   - Based on color, shifts and paints the pre-defined shapes to the correct locations.

**Program Version 3:** (Using nested functions for shape creation)

```python
def program_version_3(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  def create_square(start):
    return frozenset({(i, j) for i in range(start[0], start[0] + 3) for j in range(start[1], start[1] + 3)})

  def create_L1(start):
    return frozenset({(start[0], start[1]), (start[0] + 1, start[1]), (start[0] + 2, start[1]), (start[0] + 2, start[1] + 1), (start[0] + 2, start[1] + 2)})

  def create_L2(start):
    return frozenset({(start[0], start[1]), (start[0] + 1, start[1]), (start[0] + 2, start[1]), (start[0] + 3, start[1]), (start[0] + 3, start[1] + 1), (start[0] + 3, start[1] + 2), (start[0] + 3, start[1] + 3)})

  if color == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, create_square((1, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, create_L1((4, 6))))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, create_square((5, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, create_L2((6, 6))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Nested Functions:** Defines nested functions `create_square`, `create_L1`, and `create_L2` for generating the shapes dynamically.
2. **Dynamic Shape Generation:** Calls the appropriate shape creation functions with starting coordinates and paints them onto the canvas. 

**Program Version 4:** (Using `crop` and pre-defined grids)

```python
def program_version_4(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  pre_square = ((2, 2, 2), (2, 2, 2), (2, 2, 2))
  pre_L1 = ((0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1))
  pre_L2 = ((0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1))

  if color == 1:
    O = paint(O, asobject(crop(hconcat(canvas(0, (10, 1)), pre_square), (0, 1), (3, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, asobject(crop(hconcat(canvas(0, (10, 6)), pre_L1), (0, 6), (3, 6)))))
  else:
    O = paint(O, asobject(crop(hconcat(canvas(0, (10, 5)), pre_square), (0, 1), (3, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, asobject(crop(hconcat(canvas(0, (10, 6)), pre_L2), (0, 6), (4, 6)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Pre-defined Grids:** Defines pre-built grids for the square and 'L' shapes.
2. **Cropping and Concatenation:** 
   - Uses `hconcat` to combine a blank canvas with the pre-defined shapes.
   - Uses `crop` to extract the desired shape from the concatenated grid. 
3. **Painting:** Converts the extracted grids to objects using `asobject` and paints them onto the canvas.


**Program Version 5:** (Using `hsplit` and `vsplit` for shape positioning)

```python
def program_version_5(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  square = canvas(2, (3, 3))
  L_part1 = ((1,), (1,), (1,))
  L_part2 = ((1, 1, 1),)

  if color == 1:
    O = paint(O, asobject(hsplit(vsplit(O, 4)[1], 4)[1]))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, asobject(hconcat(hconcat(canvas(0, (7, 6)), L_part1), L_part2))))
  else:
    O = paint(O, asobject(hsplit(vsplit(O, 2)[1], 2)[1]))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, asobject(hconcat(hconcat(canvas(0, (6, 6)), L_part1), hconcat(L_part2, ((1,),)))))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shape Components:** Defines smaller components (`square`, `L_part1`, `L_part2`) for the final shapes.
2. **Splitting and Concatenation:** 
   - Uses `vsplit` and `hsplit` to divide the canvas into sections.
   - Uses `hconcat` to combine the shape components in the correct order. 
3. **Positioning and Painting:** Positions the combined shapes using the split sections and paints them onto the canvas. 

These five versions provide diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformations, showcasing different combinations of DSL functions and logic. Each version highlights a different aspect of the DSL's capabilities and demonstrates the flexibility in achieving the same output through various means.
