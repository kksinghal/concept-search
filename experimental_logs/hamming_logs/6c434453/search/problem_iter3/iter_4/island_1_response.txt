## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 

1. **'1' Shape:** A horizontal line of three '1's is drawn, anchored to the input '1' location but shifted down and to the right.
2. **'2' Shape:**  A shape resembling a '7' is drawn using '2's. This shape is anchored to the input '1' location but shifted to the left and down. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. **'1' Shape:** Two vertical lines of two '1's are drawn, with the input '1' located at their top-left corner. An additional diagonal line of three '1's extends from the bottom-right corner of the right vertical line.
2. **'2' Shape:** A shape similar to Output_0's '7' is drawn, but mirrored horizontally. This shape is anchored to the input '1' location and shifted upwards.


## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated":

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the '1' location
  one_i, one_j = first(toindices(ofcolor(I, 1)))
  
  # Construct the '1' shape
  one_shape = connect((one_i + 4, one_j - 3), (one_i + 6, one_j - 1))
  if one_i == 0:
    one_shape = combine(one_shape, connect((one_i, one_j), (one_i + 1, one_j)))
    one_shape = combine(one_shape, connect((one_i, one_j + 1), (one_i + 1, one_j + 1)))
    one_shape = combine(one_shape, connect((one_i + 7, one_j + 6), (one_i + 8, one_j + 7)))
    one_shape = combine(one_shape, connect((one_i + 8, one_j + 8), (one_i + 9, one_j + 9)))
  
  # Construct the '2' shape
  two_shape = frozenset({(one_i - 1, one_j + 1), (one_i, one_j), 
                          (one_i, one_j + 1), (one_i, one_j + 2),
                          (one_i + 1, one_j + 1)})
  if one_i == 0:
    two_shape = frozenset({(one_i + 5, one_j + 1), (one_i + 6, one_j), 
                          (one_i + 6, one_j + 1), (one_i + 6, one_j + 2),
                          (one_i + 7, one_j + 1), (one_i + 7, one_j + 2),
                          (one_i + 7, one_j + 3), (one_i + 8, one_j + 3)})
  
  # Fill the canvas
  O = fill(canvas(0, (10, 10)), 2, two_shape)
  O = fill(O, 1, one_shape)
  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version directly constructs the shapes using `connect` and `combine` functions based on the input '1' location. 
- It uses conditional statements (`if one_i == 0`) to differentiate the shapes for Input_0 and Input_1.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the '1' location
  one_loc = first(toindices(ofcolor(I, 1)))

  # Define relative movements for shapes
  one_movements = [(4, -3), (5, -2), (6, -1)]
  two_movements = [(-1, 1), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1)]
  if one_loc == (0, 0):
    one_movements = [(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (7, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 9)]
    two_movements = [(5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (8, 3)]

  # Calculate shape indices based on relative movements
  one_shape = frozenset({add(one_loc, move) for move in one_movements})
  two_shape = frozenset({add(one_loc, move) for move in two_movements})

  # Fill the canvas
  O = fill(canvas(0, (10, 10)), 2, two_shape)
  O = fill(O, 1, one_shape)

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version defines relative movements for each shape's cells from the input '1' location. 
- It uses a conditional statement (`if one_loc == (0, 0)`) to switch between movement sets for the two inputs.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the '1' location
  one_i, one_j = first(toindices(ofcolor(I, 1)))

  # Base shapes
  one_shape = frozenset({(4, -3), (5, -2), (6, -1)})
  two_shape = frozenset({(-1, 1), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1)})

  # Transformations based on input
  if one_i == 0:
    one_shape = frozenset({(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (7, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 9)})
    two_shape = hmirror(shift(two_shape, (6, 6)))

  # Shift shapes based on '1' location
  one_shape = shift(one_shape, (one_i, one_j))
  two_shape = shift(two_shape, (one_i, one_j))

  # Fill the canvas
  O = fill(canvas(0, (10, 10)), 2, two_shape)
  O = fill(O, 1, one_shape)

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version defines base shapes and applies transformations like `hmirror` and `shift` conditionally based on the input. 
- It separates the shape definition from the positioning logic.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the '1' location
  one_loc = first(toindices(ofcolor(I, 1)))

  # Define functions for shapes
  def create_one_shape(loc):
    return connect((loc[0] + 4, loc[1] - 3), (loc[0] + 6, loc[1] - 1))

  def create_two_shape(loc):
    return frozenset({(loc[0] - 1, loc[1] + 1), (loc[0], loc[1]),
                       (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), (loc[0], loc[1] + 2),
                       (loc[0] + 1, loc[1] + 1)})

  # Conditional shape adjustments
  if one_loc == (0, 0):
    one_shape = frozenset({(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (7, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 9)})
  else:
    one_shape = create_one_shape(one_loc)

  two_shape = create_two_shape(one_loc)
  if one_loc == (0, 0):
    two_shape = hmirror(shift(two_shape, (6, 6)))

  # Fill the canvas
  O = fill(canvas(0, (10, 10)), 2, two_shape)
  O = fill(O, 1, one_shape)

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version defines separate functions for creating each shape (`create_one_shape`, `create_two_shape`).
- It uses conditional statements to adjust the shapes based on the input.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the '1' location
  one_i, one_j = first(toindices(ofcolor(I, 1)))

  # Define base shapes
  one_base = frozenset({(4, -3), (5, -2), (6, -1)})
  two_base = frozenset({(-1, 1), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1)})

  # Apply transformations based on input
  if one_i == 0:
    one_shape = frozenset({(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (7, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 9)})
    two_shape = hmirror(shift(two_base, (6, 6)))
  else:
    one_shape = shift(one_base, (one_i, one_j))
    two_shape = shift(two_base, (one_i, one_j))

  # Create a canvas with '1's
  O = fill(canvas(0, (10, 10)), 1, one_shape)

  # Underfill '2's on the canvas
  O = underfill(O, 2, two_shape)

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses `underfill` to draw '2's only on empty cells. 
- It first creates a canvas with '1's and then underfills '2's to prevent accidental overwriting.

These five versions represent distinct approaches to achieve the target transformation while using a variety of DSL functions and logic. Each version attempts to optimize code readability and clarity while showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL.
