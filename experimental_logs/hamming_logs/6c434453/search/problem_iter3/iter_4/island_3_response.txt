## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to involve taking the single-cell object from the input grid and strategically replicating and placing it in the output grid to form two distinct shapes:

* **Shape 1:**  A "C" shape formed by the input color (digit '1').
* **Shape 2:** A "c" shape formed by a new color (digit '2').

The positions and orientations of these shapes vary between the examples, implying a relationship between the input object's location and the output shapes' configuration.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, False))
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)

  C = shift(recolor(1, frozenset({(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2)})), (i + 1, j + 2))
  c = shift(recolor(2, frozenset({(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)})), (j, i + 4))

  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), C | c)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:**  Similar to Program A and B, extract the object's location from the input grid.
2. **Shape Definition:** Instead of connecting lines like in Program A, define the 'C' and 'c' shapes directly as frozen sets. 
3. **Shift and Recolor:** Shift the shapes based on the input object's location and recolor them to '1' and '2' respectively.
4. **Paint:** Paint the shapes onto a blank canvas to generate the output grid.

This version aims for simplicity and directness in shape definition and manipulation.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, False))
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)

  C = {(i + a, j + b) for a in range(1, 4) for b in range(2, 5)} - {(i + 2, j + 3)}
  c = {(i + 4 + a, j - i + b) for a in range(2) for b in range(2)}

  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(1, C) | recolor(2, c))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** Extract the input object's location.
2. **Shape Generation:** Generate the shapes 'C' and 'c' using set comprehension and relative indexing from the object's location. 
3. **Recolor and Paint:** Similar to Version 1, recolor and paint the shapes onto a blank canvas.

Version 2 focuses on using set operations and comprehensions for concise shape generation.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, False))
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)

  C = shift(hmirror(crop(canvas(1, (3, 3)), (0, 0), (3, 2))), (i + 1, j + 2))
  c = shift(crop(canvas(2, (2, 2)), (0, 0), (2, 2)), (j, i + 4))

  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), C | c)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** Get the location of the input object.
2. **Shape Manipulation:** Create the shapes 'C' and 'c' by cropping from filled canvases, using `hmirror` to flip 'C' horizontally.
3. **Shift and Paint:**  Shift the shapes based on the object's location and paint them onto a blank canvas. 

This version emphasizes using shape transformations like mirroring and cropping for generating the desired output.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, False))
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)

  C = frozenset(
      {(i + 1, j + 2), (i + 2, j + 2), (i + 3, j + 2), (i + 1, j + 3), (i + 1, j + 4), (i + 2, j + 4), (i + 3, j + 4)}
  )
  c = frozenset({(j, i + 4), (j + 1, i + 4), (j, i + 5), (j + 1, i + 5)})
  
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(1, C) | recolor(2, c))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** Find the input object's location.
2. **Direct Coordinate Calculation:** Directly calculate and define the coordinates of shapes 'C' and 'c' using the object's location (i, j) and offsets.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** Recolor the calculated shapes and paint them onto a blank canvas.

Version 4 prioritizes a straightforward approach by calculating the final coordinates of 'C' and 'c' directly.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, False))
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)

  C_base = ((1, 1, 1), (1, 0, 1), (1, 1, 1))
  c_base = ((2, 2), (2, 2))

  C = frozenset(
      {(1, (i + a, j + b)) for a, row in enumerate(C_base) for b, v in enumerate(row) if v == 1}
  )
  c = frozenset(
      {(2, (j + a, i + 4 + b)) for a, row in enumerate(c_base) for b, v in enumerate(row) if v == 2}
  )

  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), C | c)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:**  Get the location of the input object.
2. **Base Shape Definition:** Define base shapes 'C' and 'c' as nested tuples representing their structures.
3. **Coordinate Mapping:** Use nested loops and conditions to map the base shapes onto the output grid based on the input object's location.
4. **Paint:** Paint the resulting shapes onto a blank canvas.

Version 5 focuses on defining the shapes in a more visual, nested tuple format and then mapping them to the output grid.

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and strategies, showcasing significantly different code structures and logic.
