## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve taking the single-cell object from the input grid and creating two new objects on a 10x10 canvas:

* **Object 1:** An 'L' shape formed by a 3x2 rectangle with its top-right corner removed. This shape is always composed of '1's.
* **Object 2:** A 3x3 square composed of '2's.

The position of these shapes on the canvas is dependent on the location of the original object in the input. 

**Specific observations:**

* **Input 0:** The object is in the top-left corner. The 'L' shape is positioned one cell down and one cell right from the original object. The square is positioned four cells down and one cell right from the original object.
* **Input 1:** The logic appears consistent, with the shapes shifting their position based on the input object's location. 


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions designed to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, False))
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)

  # Construct the 'L' shape
  L_rect = crop(canvas(1, (3, 3)), (0, 0), (3, 2)) 
  L = shift(difference(L_rect, {(2, 1)}), (i + 1, j - 1))  

  # Construct the square
  square = shift(crop(canvas(2, (3, 3)), (0, 0), (3, 3)), (i + 4, j + 1))

  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), L | square)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Find the object:** `obj = first(objects(I, True, False, False))` identifies the single-cell object in the input grid `I`. `i, j = ulcorner(obj)` gets its coordinates.
2.  **Construct the 'L' shape:** 
    *   `L_rect = crop(canvas(1, (3, 3)), (0, 0), (3, 3))` creates a 3x3 grid filled with '1's.
    *   `L = shift(difference(L_rect, {(2, 1)}), (i + 1, j - 1))` removes the top-right corner from the rectangle and shifts it to the correct position relative to the input object.
3.  **Construct the square:** 
    *   `square = shift(crop(canvas(2, (3, 3)), (0, 0), (3, 3)), (i + 4, j + 1))` creates a 3x3 grid filled with '2's and shifts it to the correct position.
4.  **Combine and paint:**
    *   `O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), L | square)` creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0's and paints the 'L' and square shapes onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, False))
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)

  # Construct the 'L' shape using line segments
  L_vert = shift(frozenset((a, 0) for a in range(3)), (i + 1, j))
  L_horz = shift(frozenset((0, b) for b in range(2)), (i + 1, j - 1))
  L = L_vert | L_horz

  # Construct the square using nested loops
  square = frozenset((i + a + 4, j + b + 1) for a in range(3) for b in range(3)) 

  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(1, L) | recolor(2, square))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

*   This version constructs the 'L' shape using two line segments and the square using nested loops for index generation, offering a different approach from the previous version.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, False))
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)

  # Define the 'L' shape explicitly
  L = shift(frozenset({(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (0, -1), (1, -1)}), (i + 1, j))

  # Construct the square using a single loop and offsets
  square = frozenset((i + 4 + a // 3, j + 1 + a % 3) for a in range(9)) 

  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(1, L) | recolor(2, square))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

*   This version defines the 'L' shape directly as a set of coordinates and uses a single loop with modulo operation for compact square index generation.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, False))
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)

  # Construct 'L' using combinations of lines and differences
  L_base = shift(frozenset((a, 0) for a in range(3)) | frozenset((0, b) for b in range(3)), (i + 1, j - 1))
  L = difference(L_base, {(i + 1, j + 1)})

  # Construct the square using a combination of crop and shift
  square = shift(crop(canvas(2, (5, 5)), (1, 1), (3, 3)), (i + 3, j))

  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(1, L) | recolor(2, square))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

*   This version builds the 'L' shape by first creating a larger shape and then removing unnecessary cells. The square is generated by cropping a larger pre-filled square.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, False))
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)

  # Construct the 'L' shape by mirroring a smaller shape
  L_half = shift(frozenset({(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1)}), (i + 1, j))
  L = L_half | hmirror(L_half)

  # Construct the square using two rectangles
  square_top = shift(crop(canvas(2, (1, 3)), (0, 0), (1, 3)), (i + 4, j + 1))
  square_bottom = shift(crop(canvas(2, (2, 3)), (0, 0), (2, 3)), (i + 5, j + 1))
  square = square_top | square_bottom

  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(1, L) | recolor(2, square))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

*   This version constructs the 'L' by mirroring a smaller L-shaped half. The square is built by combining two rectangles.

These five versions utilize diverse combinations of DSL functions and offer different logical approaches to achieve the same transformation, ensuring zero similarity in their implementation.
