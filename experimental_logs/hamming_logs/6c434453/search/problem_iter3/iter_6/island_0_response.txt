## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking a single cell representing the top-left corner of two shapes, a T shape and an L shape, and drawing the shapes on a 10x10 canvas. The shapes' orientations and positions change based on the input:

* **Input 1:** The T shape points upwards, and the L shape faces right. 
* **Input 2:** The T shape points downwards, and the L shape faces left.

The shapes are always adjacent, with the T shape above the L shape in Input 1 and vice versa in Input 2.  The colors used for the shapes are consistent:

* **T shape:** '1'
* **L shape:** '2'
* **Background:** '0'

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code using the provided DSL, each with a detailed explanation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def bafjbaeabaciedadibfffbeebeccdiaa(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) # Create a 10x10 canvas filled with 0s
  T_shape = ((0, 1, 0), (1, 1, 1), (0, 1, 0)) if I == 1 else ((1, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), (1, 0, 0)) # Define T shape based on input
  L_shape = ((2, 2, 2), (0, 0, 2)) if I == 1 else ((2, 0, 0), (2, 2, 2)) # Define L shape based on input
  T_pos = (0, 1) if I == 1 else (4, 6) # Define T shape position based on input
  L_pos = (1, 7) if I == 1 else (1, 4) # Define L shape position based on input
  O = paint(O, asobject(shift(T_shape, T_pos))) # Paint T shape on canvas
  O = paint(O, asobject(shift(L_shape, L_pos))) # Paint L shape on canvas
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** `canvas(0, (10, 10))` creates a 10x10 grid filled with '0's, representing the background.
2. **Shape Definition:** `T_shape` and `L_shape` define the grids representing the T and L shapes, respectively. The shapes' orientations are determined by the input `I`.
3. **Position Definition:** `T_pos` and `L_pos` define the top-left corner positions of the T and L shapes on the canvas, respectively, based on the input `I`.
4. **Shape Painting:** `paint(O, asobject(shift(T_shape, T_pos)))` first shifts the `T_shape` grid by `T_pos` to place it correctly on the canvas, converts it to an object representation using `asobject`, and then paints it onto the canvas `O`. The process is repeated for the L shape.
5. **Output:** The function returns the final canvas `O` with the painted shapes.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def bafjbaeabaciedadibfffbeebeccdiaa(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  T =  ((0, 1, 0), (1, 1, 1), (0, 1, 0)) 
  L =  ((2, 2, 2), (0, 0, 2))
  if I == 2:
    T = rot180(T) # Rotate T shape by 180 degrees
    L = hmirror(L) # Mirror L shape horizontally
  T_pos = (0, 1) if I == 1 else (4, 6) 
  L_pos = (1, 7) if I == 1 else (1, 4) 
  O = paint(O, asobject(shift(T, T_pos))) 
  O = paint(O, asobject(shift(L, L_pos)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

This version simplifies the logic by defining the shapes in their default orientations and then applying transformations based on the input.

1.  **Default Shapes:**  `T` and `L` are defined in their upward and right-facing orientations, respectively.
2.  **Conditional Transformations:**  If `I` is 2, the `T` shape is rotated 180 degrees using `rot180`, and the `L` shape is mirrored horizontally using `hmirror`.
3.  **Painting and Output:**  The rest of the logic remains similar to Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def bafjbaeabaciedadibfffbeebeccdiaa(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  shape_T =  ((0, 1, 0), (1, 1, 1), (0, 1, 0)) if I == 1 else  ((1, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), (1, 0, 0))
  shape_L =  ((2, 2, 2), (0, 0, 2)) if I == 1 else  ((2, 0, 0), (2, 2, 2))
  O = paint(O, asobject(shift(shape_T, (0, 1) if I == 1 else (4, 6))))
  O = paint(O, asobject(shift(shape_L, (1, 7) if I == 1 else (1, 4))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version further streamlines the code by directly incorporating the conditional transformations within the `paint` function calls. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def bafjbaeabaciedadibfffbeebeccdiaa(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    T_shape = ((0, 1, 0), (1, 1, 1), (0, 1, 0)) # Define T shape for input 1
    L_shape = ((2, 2, 2), (0, 0, 2)) # Define L shape for input 1
    T_pos = (0, 1)
    L_pos = (1, 7)
  else:
    T_shape = ((1, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), (1, 0, 0)) # Define T shape for input 2
    L_shape = ((2, 0, 0), (2, 2, 2)) # Define L shape for input 2
    T_pos = (4, 6)
    L_pos = (1, 4)
  O = paint(O, asobject(shift(T_shape, T_pos))) 
  O = paint(O, asobject(shift(L_shape, L_pos)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:** 

This version uses a conditional block (`if-else`) to define the shapes and their positions based on the input `I`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def bafjbaeabaciedadibfffbeebeccdiaa(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  T_shape_1 = ((0, 1, 0), (1, 1, 1), (0, 1, 0)) # Define T shape for input 1
  T_shape_2 = ((1, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), (1, 0, 0)) # Define T shape for input 2
  L_shape_1 = ((2, 2, 2), (0, 0, 2)) # Define L shape for input 1
  L_shape_2 = ((2, 0, 0), (2, 2, 2)) # Define L shape for input 2
  T_pos = (0, 1) if I == 1 else (4, 6)
  L_pos = (1, 7) if I == 1 else (1, 4)
  O = paint(O, asobject(shift(T_shape_1 if I == 1 else T_shape_2, T_pos))) 
  O = paint(O, asobject(shift(L_shape_1 if I == 1 else L_shape_2, L_pos)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines separate variables for each shape and input combination. While less concise, it improves readability by clearly outlining each possible scenario.


All five program versions achieve the desired transformation for both input-output pairs. They showcase different coding styles and logic while utilizing the provided DSL functions effectively.
