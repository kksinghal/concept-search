## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking a single-cell object from the input grid and generating two distinct objects on a 10x10 canvas:

**Object 1: 'L' Shape**

* The 'L' shape's corner is positioned a fixed offset from the input cell. 
* The 'L' maintains its orientation across different input cell locations.

**Object 2: Square**

*  The square is always a 3x3 shape.
*  The square's position changes relative to the input cell. The top-left corner of the square is always 4 rows below and 1 column to the right of the input cell. 

### Program Version 1: Using `shift` and set operations

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Locate the input cell
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, False))
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)

  # Construct 'L' shape using relative shifts
  L_shape = {(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)}
  L = shift(recolor(1, L_shape), (i + 1, j - 1))  

  # Construct square shape using relative shifts
  square_shape = {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)}
  square = shift(recolor(2, square_shape), (i + 4, j + 1))

  # Combine shapes on canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), L | square) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Locate Input:**  The code first identifies the single-cell object in the input and gets its row (i) and column (j) coordinates.
2.  **Construct 'L':**  A set `L_shape` defines the 'L' relative to (0,0).  `recolor` assigns color '1', and `shift` positions it correctly on the canvas.
3. **Construct Square:** Similar to the 'L', a `square_shape` is defined, recolored, and shifted to its final position.
4. **Combine and Output:** The 'L' and square are combined (`|`) and painted onto a blank 10x10 canvas.

### Program Version 2:  Using `crop` and `canvas` for shapes

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, False))
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)

  # Construct 'L' using crop and canvas
  L = shift(
      crop(canvas(1, (3, 3)), (0, 0), (3, 2)), 
      (i + 1, j - 1)
  )  

  # Construct square using crop and canvas
  square = shift(
      crop(canvas(2, (3, 3)), (0, 0), (3, 3)), 
      (i + 4, j + 1)
  )

  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), L | square)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate Input:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Construct 'L':** An oversized canvas filled with '1' is created. `crop` extracts the 'L' shape, and `shift` positions it.
3. **Construct Square:** Similar to the 'L', but a 3x3 square is cropped directly.
4. **Combine and Output:**  Same as Version 1.

### Program Version 3: Leveraging `hmirror` for 'L' shape

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, False))
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)

  # Construct mirrored 'L' shape
  L_mirrored = {(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)} 
  L = shift(hmirror(recolor(1, L_mirrored)), (i + 1, j + 1)) 

  # Square construction (same as Version 1)
  square_shape = {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)}
  square = shift(recolor(2, square_shape), (i + 4, j + 1))

  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), L | square)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate Input:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Construct 'L':**  Defines a mirrored version of the 'L' (`L_mirrored`), recolors, then uses `hmirror` to get the correct orientation before shifting.
3. **Construct Square:** Same as Version 1. 
4. **Combine and Output:** Same as previous versions. 

### Program Version 4:  Using loops for shape construction

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, False))
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)

  # Construct 'L' using loops
  L = set()
  for k in range(3):
    L.add((i + 1 + k, j))  
  for k in range(2):
    L.add((i + 1 + 2, j + 1 + k))
  L = recolor(1, L)

  # Square construction (same as Version 1)
  square_shape = {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)}
  square = shift(recolor(2, square_shape), (i + 4, j + 1)) 

  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), L | square)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate Input:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Construct 'L':**  Uses loops to iteratively add cells to the `L` set, making it more explicit how the shape is formed.
3. **Construct Square:** Same as Version 1.
4. **Combine and Output:** Same as previous versions.

### Program Version 5:  Combining `connect` and direct cell definition

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, False))
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)

  # Construct 'L' using connect and individual cells
  L = connect((i + 1, j), (i + 3, j)) | {(i + 3, j + 1), (i + 3, j + 2)} 
  L = recolor(1, L)

  # Square construction (same as Version 1)
  square_shape = {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)}
  square = shift(recolor(2, square_shape), (i + 4, j + 1)) 

  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), L | square)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate Input:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Construct 'L':** Uses `connect` for the vertical part of the 'L' and directly adds the remaining two cells as a set.
3. **Construct Square:** Same as Version 1.
4. **Combine and Output:** Same as previous versions.
