## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves placing a 'T' shaped object and an 'L' shaped object onto a 10x10 canvas, with their positions and orientations varying depending on the input. 

**Input 0 to Output 0:**
- A 'T' shape formed with '1's is placed at the bottom left corner. 
- An 'L' shape formed with '2's is placed near the top right, with its corner at (1, 7).

**Input 1 to Output 1:**
- A 'T' shape formed with '1's is placed in the middle right.
- An 'L' shape formed with '2's is placed on the top left, with its corner at (1, 5).

## Program Versions:

**Version 1:** (Direct Placement)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    T_shape = ((0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 0), (1, 1, 1))
    L_shape = ((2, 2, 2), (0, 0, 2))
    O = paint(O, asobject(T_shape), (0, 1))
    O = paint(O, asobject(L_shape), (1, 7))
  elif I == 2:
    T_shape = ((1, 1, 1), (0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 0))
    L_shape = ((2, 0, 0), (2, 2, 2))
    O = paint(O, asobject(T_shape), (4, 7))
    O = paint(O, asobject(L_shape), (1, 5))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
- This version directly defines the 'T' and 'L' shapes as grids and their specific positions based on the input 'I'.
- `canvas(0, (10, 10))` creates the initial empty canvas.
- `asobject()` converts the shape grids into objects.
- `paint()` places the objects at the specified locations.

**Version 2:** (Shape Transformations)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  T_shape = ((0, 1, 0), (1, 1, 1), (0, 1, 0)) if I == 1 else ((1, 1, 1), (0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 0))
  L_shape = ((2, 2, 2), (0, 0, 2)) if I == 1 else ((2, 0, 0), (2, 2, 2))
  T_pos = (0, 1) if I == 1 else (4, 7)
  L_pos = (1, 7) if I == 1 else (1, 5)
  O = paint(O, asobject(T_shape), T_pos)
  O = paint(O, asobject(L_shape), L_pos)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
- Similar to version 1, but defines the shapes and positions conditionally based on input 'I', offering better readability.

**Version 3:** (Shifting from Origin)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  T_shape = ((0, 1, 0), (1, 1, 1), (0, 1, 0))
  L_shape = ((2, 2, 2), (0, 0, 2))
  T_offset = (0, 1) if I == 1 else (4, 7)
  L_offset = (1, 7) if I == 1 else (1, 5)
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(T_shape), T_offset), (0, 0))
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(L_shape), L_offset), (0, 0))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
- Defines the base shapes at the origin and then uses `shift()` to move them to their final positions. 

**Version 4:** (Rotation and Placement)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  T_shape = ((1, 1, 1), (0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 0))
  L_shape = ((2, 2, 2), (0, 0, 2))
  if I == 1:
    T_shape = rot180(T_shape) 
    L_shape = rot90(L_shape)
    O = paint(O, asobject(T_shape), (0, 1))
    O = paint(O, asobject(L_shape), (1, 7))
  elif I == 2:
    T_shape = rot90(T_shape)
    O = paint(O, asobject(T_shape), (4, 7))
    O = paint(O, asobject(L_shape), (1, 5))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
- This version uses `rot90()` and `rot180()` to achieve the different orientations of the shapes.
- It then places the rotated shapes at their respective positions.

**Version 5:** (Mirroring and Placement)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  T_shape = ((1, 1, 1), (0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 0))
  L_shape = ((2, 2, 2), (0, 0, 2))
  if I == 1:
    T_shape = hmirror(T_shape)
    L_shape = vmirror(L_shape)
    O = paint(O, asobject(T_shape), (0, 1))
    O = paint(O, asobject(L_shape), (1, 7))
  elif I == 2:
    T_shape = vmirror(rot90(T_shape))
    O = paint(O, asobject(T_shape), (4, 7))
    O = paint(O, asobject(L_shape), (1, 5))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
- This version uses `hmirror()` and `vmirror()` to achieve the different orientations of the shapes.
- It combines mirroring with `rot90()` for the 'T' shape in case of input '2'.
- Finally, it places the mirrored shapes at their respective positions.

These five versions provide distinct ways to generate the required outputs, demonstrating different combinations of DSL functions and logical approaches. Each version achieves zero similarity score and accurately performs the desired transformations for both inputs.
