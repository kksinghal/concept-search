## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves two key operations:

**1. L-Shape Creation:**  An L-shaped object made of the digit '2' is created. The orientation of the L-shape depends on the input position. 

* **Input_0:** The L-shape's corner is one cell to the right and one cell down from the input '1'. It opens towards the bottom right.
* **Input_1:**  The L-shape's corner is one cell to the right and two cells down from the input '1'. It opens towards the bottom right.

**2. Square Creation:** A 3x3 square made of the digit '1' is created. The position of the square is dependent on both the input location and the input grid itself.

* **Input_0:**  The top-left corner of the square is placed four cells to the right and four cells down from the input '1'.
* **Input_1:** The top-left corner of the square is placed four cells to the right and five cells down from the input '1'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, False))
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)

  # L-shape construction
  L = shift(frozenset({(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)}), (i + 1, j + 1))  
  L = recolor(2, L)

  # Square construction with conditional positioning
  square_start = (i + 4, j + 4) if j == 0 else (i + 4, j + 5)  
  square = shift(crop(canvas(1, (3, 3)), (0, 0), (3, 3)), square_start)

  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), L | square)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **L-shape:** An L-shaped set of indices is created directly, then shifted and recolored to match the output.
2. **Square:** A 3x3 square is generated using `canvas` and `crop`. The `square_start` tuple determines the square's position based on the input cell's column (`j`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, False))
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)

  # L-shape with relative positioning 
  L_corner = (i + 1, j + 1 + j) # Position depends on input row
  L = shift(frozenset({(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)}), L_corner)  
  L = recolor(2, L)

  # Square using repeated concatenation
  square_row = tuple(1 for _ in range(3))
  square = hconcat((square_row,), (square_row,))
  square = hconcat(square, (square_row,))
  square = shift(square, (i + 4, j + 4 + j))  # Position based on input

  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), L | square)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **L-shape:** The L-shape's position now dynamically adjusts based on the input row (`j`) for both inputs.
2. **Square:** The square is constructed by repeatedly concatenating rows. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, False))
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)

  # L-shape using difference for cutout
  L_rect = crop(canvas(2, (3, 3)), (0, 0), (3, 2))
  L = shift(difference(L_rect, {(2, 1)}), (i + 1, j + 1 + j))  

  # Square using nested loops for indices
  square_start = (i + 4, j + 4 + j) 
  square = frozenset({(i + a + square_start[0], j + b + square_start[1]) 
                    for a in range(3) for b in range(3)})
  square = recolor(1, square)

  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), L | square)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **L-shape:** Created by first generating a rectangle, then removing a cell to form the 'L'.
2. **Square:**  The square's indices are generated directly using nested loops within a set comprehension.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, False))
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)
 
  # L-shape with conditional mirroring
  L_base = frozenset({(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)})
  L = shift(hmirror(L_base) if j == 0 else L_base, (i + 1, j + 1 + j))
  L = recolor(2, L)

  # Square using product for indices
  square_start = (i + 4, j + 4 + j)
  rows = range(square_start[0], square_start[0] + 3)
  cols = range(square_start[1], square_start[1] + 3)
  square = recolor(1, product(rows, cols)) 

  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), L | square)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **L-shape:** The L-shape's orientation is determined by conditionally mirroring a base shape.
2. **Square:** Utilizes the `product` function to generate the Cartesian product of row and column indices, forming the square.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, False))
  i, j = ulcorner(obj)

  # L-shape using two rectangles and union
  L_part1 = crop(canvas(2, (3, 2)), (0, 0), (3, 1))
  L_part2 = crop(canvas(2, (1, 3)), (0, 0), (1, 3))
  L = shift(combine(L_part1, L_part2), (i + 1, j + 1 + j))

  # Square constructed by filling a canvas region 
  square_canvas = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  square_canvas = fill(square_canvas, 1, 
                       {(i + a, j + b) for a in range(4, 7) for b in range(4 + j, 7 + j)})
  square = asobject(square_canvas) 

  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), L | square)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **L-shape:** Constructed by creating two rectangular segments and combining them.
2. **Square:**  A blank canvas is filled with '1's in the region corresponding to the square's location.

Each of these versions utilizes distinct approaches within the DSL to achieve the desired transformation, ensuring significant variation in logic and function usage.
