## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking a single-cell input grid and generating a 10x10 output grid containing specific shapes and their placement based on the input color.

**Input_0 (color 1):**
- A 3x3 square of color 2 is placed with its upper-left corner at (1,1).
- An L-shape of color 1, oriented horizontally, is placed with its corner at (4,6).

**Input_1 (color other than 1):**
- A 3x3 square of color 2 is placed with its upper-left corner at (7,1).
- An L-shape of color 1, oriented vertically, is placed with its corner at (6,6).


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Square Placement
  square_start = (1, 1) if color == 1 else (7, 1) 
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(1, (3, 3)), square_start)))

  # L-Shape Placement
  L_shape = frozenset({(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)}) if color == 1 else frozenset({(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)})
  L_shape_start = (4, 6) if color == 1 else (6, 6)
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(L_shape, L_shape_start)))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**
- This version directly encodes the L-shape in its two orientations.
- The `square_start` is adjusted for Input_1 to (7,1).
- It uses conditional statements to select the correct L-shape orientation and placement based on the input `color`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Square Placement
  square_start = add((1, 1), multiply((6, 0), (color != 1))) 
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(1, (3, 3)), square_start)))

  # L-Shape Placement
  L_shape = frozenset({(i, j) for i in range(3) for j in range(2)})
  L_shape |= frozenset({(2, j) for j in range(2, 4 if color == 1 else 3)})
  L_shape_start = (4, 6) if color == 1 else (6, 6)
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(L_shape, L_shape_start)))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**
- This version calculates the `square_start` dynamically using `add` and `multiply` based on the `color`.
- It builds the L-shape dynamically, adding the extra cell based on the `color`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Square Placement
  square_start = (1, 1) if color == 1 else (7, 1)
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(1, (3, 3)), square_start)))

  # L-Shape Placement
  L_shape = frozenset({(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0)}) | {(2, 1)}
  L_shape = L_shape if color == 1 else rot90(L_shape)
  L_shape_start = (4, 6) if color == 1 else (6, 6)
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(L_shape, L_shape_start)))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**
- This version defines a base L-shape and rotates it using `rot90` for Input_1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Square Placement
  square_offset = (6, 0) if color != 1 else (0, 0)
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(1, (3, 3)), add((1, 1), square_offset))))

  # L-Shape Placement
  L_shape = {(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)} if color == 1 else {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)}
  L_shape_start = (4, 6) if color == 1 else (6, 6)
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(frozenset(L_shape), L_shape_start)))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**
- This version calculates a `square_offset` and uses `add` to determine the final `square_start`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Square Placement
  square_start = (1, 1) if color == 1 else (7, 1)
  square = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(square_start[0], square_start[0] + 3) for j in range(square_start[1], square_start[1] + 3))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, square))

  # L-Shape Placement
  L_shape_dims = (3, 2) if color == 1 else (2, 3)
  L_shape = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(L_shape_dims[0]) for j in range(L_shape_dims[1]))
  L_shape |= {(L_shape_dims[0] - 1, L_shape_dims[1])} if color == 1 else {(L_shape_dims[0], L_shape_dims[1] - 1)}
  L_shape_start = (4, 6) if color == 1 else (6, 6)
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(L_shape, L_shape_start)))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**
- This version dynamically generates the square based on the calculated `square_start`.
- It dynamically builds the L-shape by adding the extra cell based on `L_shape_dims`.

These five program versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating a good understanding of the DSL and the ability to generate diverse solutions.
