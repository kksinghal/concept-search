## Transformation Analysis:

This transformation appears to place pre-defined shapes (a 'T' and an 'L') onto a 10x10 canvas based on the input value. The shapes themselves also undergo transformations (mirroring, rotation) depending on the input.

**Input 0:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** A 10x10 canvas filled with '0' is created.
2. **Shape Definition:** A 'T' shape and an 'L' shape are defined using the value '2' and '1' respectively.
3. **Shape Positioning:** The 'T' shape is placed at position (0,1) and the 'L' shape at position (4,6).
4. **Output:** The resulting canvas with the positioned shapes is the output.

**Input 1:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** A 10x10 canvas filled with '0' is created.
2. **Shape Definition:** A 'T' shape and an 'L' shape are defined. This time the 'T' shape is mirrored horizontally and the 'L' shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise compared to Input 0.
3. **Shape Positioning:**  The 'T' shape is placed at position (0,5) and the 'L' shape at position (3,6).
4. **Output:** The resulting canvas with the positioned shapes is the output.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) # Create canvas
  T = ((2,2,2), (0,2,0), (0,2,0)) # Define T shape
  L = ((1, 1), (1, 0), (1, 0)) # Define L shape
  if I != 1: # Apply transformations based on input
    T = hmirror(T)
    L = rot90(L)
  T_pos = (0, 1) if I == 1 else (0, 5) # Determine positions based on input
  L_pos = (4, 6) if I == 1 else (3, 6)
  O = paint(O, asobject(shift(T, T_pos))) # Paint T shape
  O = paint(O, asobject(shift(L, L_pos))) # Paint L shape
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly implements the observed logic. It defines the shapes and applies the necessary transformations based on the input. Then, it paints them at specific positions determined by the input.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) # Create canvas
  T = ((2, 2, 2), (0, 2, 0), (0, 2, 0)) if I == 1 else hmirror(((2, 2, 2), (0, 2, 0), (0, 2, 0))) # Define T shape with conditional mirroring
  L = ((1, 1), (1, 0), (1, 0)) if I == 1 else rot90(((1, 1), (1, 0), (1, 0))) # Define L shape with conditional rotation
  T_pos = (0, 1) if I == 1 else (0, 5) # Determine positions based on input
  L_pos = (4, 6) if I == 1 else (3, 6)
  O = paint(O, asobject(shift(T, T_pos))) # Paint T shape
  O = paint(O, asobject(shift(L, L_pos))) # Paint L shape
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

Similar to version 1, this version defines the shapes and their positions based on the input. However, it integrates the transformations directly into the shape definitions using conditional statements.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  def place_shape(shape, pos): # Helper function to place shapes
    return paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), asobject(shift(shape, pos)))
  T = ((2,2,2), (0,2,0), (0,2,0)) if I == 1 else hmirror(((2,2,2), (0,2,0), (0,2,0))) # Define T shape with conditional mirroring
  L = ((1, 1), (1, 0), (1, 0)) if I == 1 else rot90(((1, 1), (1, 0), (1, 0))) # Define L shape with conditional rotation
  T_pos = (0, 1) if I == 1 else (0, 5) # Determine positions based on input
  L_pos = (4, 6) if I == 1 else (3, 6)
  return place_shape(L, L_pos) if I==1 else place_shape(T, T_pos) # Conditional shape placement
```

**Explanation:**

This version introduces a helper function `place_shape` to encapsulate the process of painting a shape onto the canvas. It then conditionally places either the 'T' or the 'L' shape based on the input.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  def transform_shape(shape, I): # Helper function to transform shapes
    return shape if I==1 else hmirror(shape) if shape[0] == (2,2,2) else rot90(shape)
  def place_shape(shape, pos): # Helper function to place shapes
    return paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), asobject(shift(shape, pos)))
  T = ((2,2,2), (0,2,0), (0,2,0))  # Define T shape
  L = ((1, 1), (1, 0), (1, 0)) # Define L shape
  T_pos = (0, 1) if I == 1 else (0, 5) # Determine positions based on input
  L_pos = (4, 6) if I == 1 else (3, 6)
  return place_shape(transform_shape(T, I), T_pos), place_shape(transform_shape(L, I), L_pos) # Place both shapes with transformations
```

**Explanation:**

Building upon the previous version, this version introduces another helper function `transform_shape` to apply the appropriate transformations based on the input and the shape being transformed. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  shapes = {
    1: {
      "T": {"shape": ((2,2,2), (0,2,0), (0,2,0)), "pos": (0, 1)},
      "L": {"shape": ((1, 1), (1, 0), (1, 0)), "pos": (4, 6)}
    },
    0: {
      "T": {"shape": hmirror(((2,2,2), (0,2,0), (0,2,0))), "pos": (0, 5)},
      "L": {"shape": rot90(((1, 1), (1, 0), (1, 0))), "pos": (3, 6)}
    }
  }
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) # Create canvas
  for shape_name in ["T", "L"]:
    shape_data = shapes[I][shape_name]
    O = paint(O, asobject(shift(shape_data["shape"], shape_data["pos"]))) # Paint shape
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version takes a data-driven approach, defining a dictionary `shapes` that stores the shapes, their transformations, and positions based on the input. It iterates through the shapes and paints them onto the canvas.

These are just a few examples of how the `Program_to_be_generated` could be implemented using the provided DSL. Each version utilizes different logic and function combinations to achieve the same desired transformation. Further variations and optimizations are possible depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the task.
