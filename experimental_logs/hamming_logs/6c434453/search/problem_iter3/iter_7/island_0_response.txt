## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently places two shapes, a "T" and an "L", onto a 10x10 canvas. The shapes and their positions change based on the input.

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

- A "T" shape formed by the digit '2' is placed with its top at position (0,1). 
- An "L" shape formed by the digit '1' is placed with its corner at position (4, 6).

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

- A mirrored "T" shape formed by the digit '2' is placed with its top at (0,5).
- A rotated "L" shape formed by the digit '1' is placed with its corner at (3, 6).


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the required transformation:

**Program Version 1 (Shape Construction and Placement):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))  # Create a 10x10 canvas filled with 0s
    if I == 1:
        T = ((2,2,2), (0,2,0), (0,2,0))
        L = ((1, 1), (1, 0), (1, 0))
        T_pos = (0, 1)
        L_pos = (4, 6)
    else:
        T = ((0,2,0), (2,2,2), (0,2,0))
        L = ((1, 1, 1), (0, 0, 1))
        T_pos = (0, 5)
        L_pos = (3, 6)
    O = paint(O, asobject(shift(T, T_pos))) # Paint the T
    O = paint(O, asobject(shift(L, L_pos))) # Paint the L
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Defines the "T" and "L" shapes directly as grids within the conditional branches based on the input 'I'.
- Uses `shift` to move the shapes to their correct positions.
- Employs `asobject` to convert the grid representation to objects suitable for `paint`.

**Program Version 2 (Mirroring and Rotation):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    T = ((2,2,2), (0,2,0), (0,2,0))
    L = ((1, 1), (1, 0), (1, 0))
    if I != 1:
        T = hmirror(T)
        L = rot90(L) 
    T_pos = (0, 1) if I == 1 else (0, 5)
    L_pos = (4, 6) if I == 1 else (3, 6) 
    O = paint(O, asobject(shift(T, T_pos)))
    O = paint(O, asobject(shift(L, L_pos)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Defines base shapes for "T" and "L".
- Uses `hmirror` to mirror the "T" and `rot90` to rotate the "L" conditionally based on the input.
- Positions are determined within the conditional branches.

**Program Version 3 (Object Manipulation):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    T = frozenset({(2,(0,0)), (2,(0,1)), (2,(0,2)), (2,(1,1)), (2,(2,1))})
    L = frozenset({(1,(0,0)), (1,(0,1)), (1,(1,0))})
    if I != 1:
        T = hmirror(T)
        L = rot90(L)
    T_pos = (0, 1) if I == 1 else (0, 5)
    L_pos = (4, 6) if I == 1 else (3, 6)
    O = paint(O, shift(T, T_pos))
    O = paint(O, shift(L, L_pos))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Directly defines "T" and "L" shapes as objects (sets of (value, (i, j)) tuples).
- Employs `hmirror` and `rot90` as in Version 2.
- Directly uses `shift` for positioning without needing `asobject`.

**Program Version 4 (Conditional Painting):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    if I == 1:
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (0, 0), (0, 2)}))  # Paint the 'T' shape 
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 6)}))  # Paint the 'L' shape
    else:
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(0, 5), (1, 5), (2, 5), (0, 4), (0, 6)}))  # Paint the mirrored 'T' shape
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(3, 6), (4, 6), (3, 7)}))  # Paint the rotated 'L' shape
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Directly paints the shapes onto the canvas using `recolor` and explicitly defined sets of indices for each shape and input case.
- Eliminates the need for separate shape definitions and transformations.

**Program Version 5 (Functional Approach):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    transform = lambda shape, pos: asobject(shift(shape, pos))
    T_shape = lambda I: ((2,2,2), (0,2,0), (0,2,0)) if I == 1 else hmirror(((2,2,2), (0,2,0), (0,2,0)))
    L_shape = lambda I: ((1, 1), (1, 0), (1, 0)) if I == 1 else rot90(((1, 1), (1, 0), (1, 0)))
    T_pos = (0, 1) if I == 1 else (0, 5)
    L_pos = (4, 6) if I == 1 else (3, 6)
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, transform(T_shape(I), T_pos))
    O = paint(O, transform(L_shape(I), L_pos))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Uses lambda functions to define the shape generation and transformation logic more concisely.
- `T_shape` and `L_shape` functions return the appropriate shape based on input 'I'.
- `transform` function encapsulates the shifting and object conversion logic.
