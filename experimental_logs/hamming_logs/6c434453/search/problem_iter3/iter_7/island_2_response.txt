## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves placing two shapes on a 10x10 canvas based on the color of the top-left pixel in the input:

**Input_0 (Top-left pixel: 1)**

* **Square:** A 3x3 square of color '2' is placed with its top-left corner at (1,1).
* **L-Shape:** An L-shape of color '1' is placed with its top-left corner at (4,6). This L-shape extends 3 units horizontally and 2 units vertically.

**Input_1 (Top-left pixel: Not 1)**

* **Square:** A 3x3 square of color '2' is placed with its top-left corner at (5,1).
* **L-Shape:** An L-shape of color '1' is placed with its top-left corner at (6,6). This L-shape extends 2 units horizontally and 4 units vertically.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" utilizing different DSL functions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Square Placement
  square_start = (1, 1) if color == 1 else (5, 1)
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(1, (3, 3)), square_start)))

  # L-Shape Placement
  L_shape_dims = (3, 2) if color == 1 else (2, 4)
  L_shape = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(L_shape_dims[0]) for j in range(L_shape_dims[1]))
  L_shape |= frozenset(((L_shape_dims[0] - 1, j) for j in range(L_shape_dims[1], max(L_shape_dims))))
  L_shape_start = (4, 6) if color == 1 else (6, 6)
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(L_shape, L_shape_start)))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0'.
2. **Square Placement:** 
    * Determines square starting position based on input color.
    * Creates a 3x3 canvas, recolors it to '2', shifts it to the calculated position, and paints it on the main canvas.
3. **L-Shape Placement:**
    * Determines L-shape dimensions and starting position based on input color.
    * Generates the L-shape by combining two ranges of indices, recolors it to '1', shifts it, and paints it on the main canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Square Placement
  square_offset = (4 * (color != 1), 0)
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(1, (3, 3)), add((1, 1), square_offset))))

  # L-Shape Placement
  L_shape_horizontal = frozenset({(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)})
  L_shape_vertical = frozenset({(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)})
  L_shape = L_shape_horizontal if color == 1 else L_shape_vertical
  L_shape_offset = (4, 6) if color == 1 else (6, 6)
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(L_shape, L_shape_offset)))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0'.
2. **Square Placement:**
    * Calculates the offset for the square based on input color.
    * Creates a 3x3 canvas, recolors it to '2', shifts it by (1,1) + offset, and paints it.
3. **L-Shape Placement:**
    * Defines horizontal and vertical L-shape templates.
    * Selects the appropriate L-shape based on input color.
    * Shifts the selected L-shape, recolors it to '1', and paints it.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Square Placement
  square_location = (1 + 4 * (color != 1), 1)
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asindices(canvas(1, (3, 3))), square_location)))

  # L-Shape Placement
  L_shape_points = [(4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8)] if color == 1 else [(6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9)]
  L_shape = frozenset(L_shape_points)
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, L_shape))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0'.
2. **Square Placement:**
    * Calculates the top-left corner of the square based on input color.
    * Creates a 3x3 canvas, converts it to indices, shifts it, recolors it to '2', and paints it.
3. **L-Shape Placement:**
    * Defines lists of points forming the L-shape based on input color.
    * Converts the selected list to a frozenset, recolors it to '1', and paints it.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Square Placement
  square_offset = (0, 0) if color == 1 else (4, 0)
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(asindices(canvas(1, (3, 3))), add((1, 1), square_offset))))

  # L-Shape Placement
  L_shape_start = (4, 6) if color == 1 else (6, 6)
  L_shape_end = add(L_shape_start, (2, 2) if color == 1 else (3, 3))
  L_shape = connect(L_shape_start, (L_shape_end[0], L_shape_start[1])) | connect((L_shape_end[0], L_shape_start[1]), L_shape_end)
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, L_shape))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0'.
2. **Square Placement:**
    * Calculates the offset for the square based on input color.
    * Creates a 3x3 canvas, converts it to indices, shifts it by (1,1) + offset, recolors it to '2', and paints it.
3. **L-Shape Placement:**
    * Determines the starting and ending points of the L-shape's two segments based on input color.
    * Uses the `connect` function to create the two segments and combines them.
    * Recolors the resulting L-shape to '1' and paints it.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Square Placement
  square_start = (1, 1) if color == 1 else (5, 1)
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(2, asindices(canvas(1, (3, 3)))), square_start))

  # L-Shape Placement
  L_shape_horizontal = frozenset({(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)})
  L_shape_vertical = frozenset({(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)})
  L_shape = shift(L_shape_horizontal if color == 1 else L_shape_vertical, (4, 6) if color == 1 else (6, 6))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, L_shape))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0'.
2. **Square Placement:**
    * Determines the square starting position based on input color.
    * Creates a 3x3 canvas, converts it to indices, recolors it to '2', shifts it to the calculated position, and paints it.
3. **L-Shape Placement:**
    * Defines horizontal and vertical L-shape templates.
    * Selects and shifts the appropriate L-shape based on input color in a single step.
    * Recolors the shifted L-shape to '1' and paints it.
