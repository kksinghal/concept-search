## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation involves shifting the leftmost column of the grid one position down.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  The transformation involves replacing the second and third elements of each row with the value '0'.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The transformation involves swapping the first and second rows of the grid.

**Input_3 to Output_3:** The transformation involves swapping the second and third elements of the third row of the grid.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = (I[0], tuple(I[1][(j-1)%len(I[1])] if i == 0 else v for i, v in enumerate(I[1])), tuple(I[2][(j+1)%len(I[2])] if i == 0 else v for i, v in enumerate(I[2])))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Tuple Construction:** This version directly constructs the output tuple `O` by manipulating the rows of the input grid `I`.
2. **Row Shifting:**  The second and third rows (`I[1]` and `I[2]`) are shifted left and right, respectively, but only for the first element (`i == 0`). 
3. **Modulo Operator:** The `%` (modulo) operator ensures elements wrap around when shifted, achieving the cyclic shift in the first element of the second and third rows.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    O = (tuple(I[1][j] if i == 0 else v for j, v in enumerate(O[0])),) + O[1:]
    O = (tuple(I[0][j] if i == 1 else v for j, v in enumerate(O[1])),) + (O[0],) + O[2:]
    O = tuple(tuple(v if j != 1 and j != 2 else 0 for j, v in enumerate(row)) for row in O)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization and Row Swapping:**  The code initializes `O` with `I` and then swaps the first two rows using tuple slicing and concatenation.
2. **Conditional Replacement:** It iterates through each row and uses conditional replacement (`if j != 1 and j != 2`) to set the second and third elements to '0'.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = rot90(I)
    repl = O[0][0] if O[0][0] != 0 else 0
    O = (tuple(repl if j == 0 else v for j, v in enumerate(O[0])),) + O[1:]
    O = rot270(O)
    O = tuple(tuple(v if i != 1 or j != 1 else 0 for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(O))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Rotation:**  This version utilizes `rot90` to rotate the grid clockwise by 90 degrees.
2. **Column Manipulation:** It then focuses on the first column (which was originally the first row) to apply the transformation - replacing the first element with itself or '0' if it was initially '0'. 
3. **Reverse Rotation and Replacement:** The grid is rotated back to its original orientation using `rot270`, and finally, the element at (1,1) is set to '0'.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = tuple(tuple(row[(j-1)%len(row)] if i == 1 else row[j] for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(I))
    O = tuple(tuple(O[1][j] if i == 0 else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(O))
    O = tuple(tuple(0 if i == 1 and j != 0 else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(O))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Conditional Shifting:**  This version conditionally shifts the second row (`i == 1`) of the grid left by one position using the modulo operator (`%`) for wrap-around. 
2. **Row Swapping:**  It then swaps the first and second rows.
3. **Selective Replacement:** Finally, it sets all elements in the second row except the first one to '0'.


**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = hmirror(I)
  O = tuple(tuple(O[i][(j+1)%len(row)] if i == 2 else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(O))
  O = hmirror(O)
  O = (O[1], O[0], O[2])
  O = tuple(tuple(0 if (i == 1 and j > 0) or (i == 2 and j > 0) else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(O))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Mirroring and Shifting:** This version first mirrors the grid horizontally using `hmirror`. 
2. **Conditional Shifting:** It then shifts the third row right by one position, again using the modulo operator for wrap-around.
3. **Mirroring Back and Row Swapping:** The grid is mirrored back horizontally, and the first and second rows are swapped.
4. **Selective Replacement:** Finally, elements in the second and third rows, except the first element in each, are set to '0'.

These five versions demonstrate diverse ways to achieve the desired transformations by combining DSL functions in different ways. Each version utilizes conditional logic, tuple manipulation, and DSL functions like `rot90`, `hmirror`, and modulo operator to achieve the specific element replacements and row operations.
