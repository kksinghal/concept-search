## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected areas of the same digit) and modifying specific cells within these objects based on their position relative to the object's boundaries. 

* **Input 0:** The top row of the leftmost object (digit 0) is changed to 0s.
* **Input 1:** The middle column of the object (digit 6) is changed to 0s.
* **Input 2:**  The transformation is the same as for Input_0. 
* **Input 3:** The top and bottom rows of the rightmost object (digit 2) are changed to 2s, and the middle column is changed to 0s.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each with a detailed explanation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    top = uppermost(obj)
    left = leftmost(obj)
    bottom = lowermost(obj)
    right = rightmost(obj)
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if i == top or j == left or i == bottom or j == right:
        O = fill(O, 0, (i, j))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The code first identifies all objects in the grid using `objects()` function.
2. **Iterate and Modify:** It then iterates through each object, finds its boundaries (top, left, bottom, right), and iterates through the object's cells.
3. **Boundary Modification:** If a cell lies on the boundary of the object, its value is changed to 0 using the `fill()` function.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    c = color(obj)
    for i in range(height(obj)):
      for j in range(width(obj)):
        if (i == 0 or i == height(obj) - 1 or j == 0 or j == width(obj) - 1) and (i + uppermost(obj), j + leftmost(obj)) in toindices(obj):
          O = fill(O, 0, (i + uppermost(obj), j + leftmost(obj)))
        else:
          O = fill(O, c, (i + uppermost(obj), j + leftmost(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition Grid:** The code partitions the input grid into objects based on color using `fgpartition()`, excluding the background.
2. **Create Canvas:** It creates an empty canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
3. **Iterate and Paint:** It iterates through each object, identifies its color, and paints the object onto the canvas cell by cell. If a cell is on the object's boundary, it is painted with 0; otherwise, it's painted with the object's color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if any((i == 0 or i == len(I) - 1 or j == 0 or j == len(I[0]) - 1) and I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0]))):
        O = fill(O, 0, (i, j))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** This version directly iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Boundary Check:**  For each cell, it checks if it's on the grid boundary and if its color is different from the background color.
3. **Fill Boundary:** If both conditions are true, the cell is filled with 0.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        if i == 0 or i == len(I) - 1 or j == 0 or j == len(I[0]) - 1:
          O = fill(O, 0, (i, j))
        else:
          O = fill(O, I[i][j], (i, j))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** Similar to Version 2, it starts with a canvas filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate and Compare:**  It iterates through each cell and checks if it's different from the background color.
3. **Boundary vs. Interior:** If different, it checks if the cell is on the boundary. Boundary cells are filled with 0, and interior cells retain their original color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = underfill(O, 0, box(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The code identifies objects in the grid using `objects()`.
2. **Iterate and Underfill:** It iterates through each object, finds the bounding box using `box()`, and uses `underfill()` to change the values within the bounding box to 0 only if they are currently the background color.

These are just five examples, and many other possible solutions might exist within the given DSL. Each version utilizes different functions and logic, offering diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformation.
