## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve moving objects within the grid based on their color. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:** The object formed by the digit '9' is shifted one cell to the right, wrapping around the grid's edge.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**  The '6' object is shifted one cell downwards, with the bottom row wrapping around to the top.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**  The '9' object is shifted one cell upwards, with the top row wrapping around to the bottom.

**Input_3 - Output_3:** The '2' object is shifted one cell to the left, with the leftmost column wrapping around to the right.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Based on the analysis, the transformation involves identifying objects based on color and then shifting them by one unit in a specific direction with wrapping. The direction of the shift seems to depend on the object's color. 

Since the exact relationship between color and direction is not explicitly provided, I will assume a simple mapping for demonstration purposes:

* **Color 9:** Shift Right
* **Color 6:** Shift Down
* **Color 2:** Shift Left
* **Other colors:** Remain unchanged

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL:


### Program Version 1: (Using nested loops and conditional shifting)

```python
def solve(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  output_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      value = grid[i][j]
      if value == 9:
        new_j = (j + 1) % w
        output_grid = paint(output_grid, {(value, (i, new_j))})
      elif value == 6:
        new_i = (i + 1) % h
        output_grid = paint(output_grid, {(value, (new_i, j))})
      elif value == 2:
        new_j = (j - 1) % w
        output_grid = paint(output_grid, {(value, (i, new_j))})
      else:
        output_grid = paint(output_grid, {(value, (i, j))})
  return output_grid 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an output grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Iteration:** Iterates over each cell of the input grid.
3. **Color-Based Shifting:** 
    - If the cell value is 9, it shifts one cell to the right.
    - If the cell value is 6, it shifts one cell downwards.
    - If the cell value is 2, it shifts one cell to the left.
    - Other colors remain in their original position.
4. **Wrapping:** Uses the modulo operator (%) to handle wrapping around the grid's edges.
5. **Painting:**  Paints the shifted cell onto the output grid.


### Program Version 2: (Using `objects` and `move` functions)

```python
def solve(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  output_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  for obj in objs:
    value = color(obj)
    if value == 9:
      new_obj = shift(obj, (0, 1))
      output_grid = paint(output_grid, {(grid[i][(j + 1) % len(grid[0])], (i, (j + 1) % len(grid[0]))) for v, (i, j) in new_obj})
    elif value == 6:
      new_obj = shift(obj, (1, 0))
      output_grid = paint(output_grid, {(grid[(i + 1) % len(grid)][j], ((i + 1) % len(grid), j)) for v, (i, j) in new_obj})
    elif value == 2:
      new_obj = shift(obj, (0, -1))
      output_grid = paint(output_grid, {(grid[i][(j - 1) % len(grid[0])], (i, (j - 1) % len(grid[0]))) for v, (i, j) in new_obj})
    else:
      output_grid = paint(output_grid, obj)
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:** Identifies all distinct objects in the grid using `objects` function.
2. **Initialization:** Creates an empty output grid.
3. **Object-Based Shifting:** 
    - For each object, determines its color using `color` function.
    - Shifts the object using `shift` function based on its color.
    - Applies wrapping to handle edge cases.
4. **Painting:** Paints the shifted object onto the output grid using `paint` function.


### Program Version 3: (Functional approach with `apply`)

```python
def shift_color(value, loc, grid):
    h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    i, j = loc
    if value == 9:
        return (value, (i, (j + 1) % w))
    elif value == 6:
        return (value, ((i + 1) % h, j))
    elif value == 2:
        return (value, (i, (j - 1) % w))
    else:
        return (value, (i, j))

def solve(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  shifted_objs = apply(lambda obj: frozenset(shift_color(color(obj), loc, grid) for v, loc in obj), objs)
  output_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  for obj in shifted_objs:
    output_grid = paint(output_grid, obj)
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shift_color` Function:** Defines a helper function that takes a color, location, and the grid as input and returns the shifted location based on the color.
2. **Object Identification:** Identifies objects using `objects` function.
3. **Applying Shift:** Uses `apply` function to apply the `shift_color` function to each object in the grid, resulting in shifted objects.
4. **Painting:**  Paints the shifted objects onto the output grid.

### Program Version 4: (Using `replace` for color-based shifting)

```python
def solve(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  shifted_grid_9 = replace(grid, 9, -1)  
  shifted_grid_9 = hconcat((shifted_grid_9[:,-1],), shifted_grid_9[:,:-1])
  shifted_grid_9 = replace(shifted_grid_9, -1, 9)

  shifted_grid_6 = replace(grid, 6, -1)
  shifted_grid_6 = vconcat((shifted_grid_6[-1:,:],), shifted_grid_6[:-1,:])
  shifted_grid_6 = replace(shifted_grid_6, -1, 6)
  
  shifted_grid_2 = replace(grid, 2, -1)
  shifted_grid_2 = hconcat((shifted_grid_2[:,1:],), shifted_grid_2[:,:1])
  shifted_grid_2 = replace(shifted_grid_2, -1, 2)

  return cellwise(cellwise(shifted_grid_9, shifted_grid_6, shifted_grid_9[0][0]), shifted_grid_2, shifted_grid_9[0][0])
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Color-Specific Shifting:** 
    - For each color (9, 6, 2), creates a copy of the grid and temporarily replaces the target color with a unique placeholder (-1). 
    - Shifts the entire grid (or relevant parts) in the desired direction using `hconcat` or `vconcat`.
    - Replaces the placeholder with the original color.
2. **Merging Shifted Grids:** Uses `cellwise` function to combine the three shifted grids, prioritizing changes made for each color.


### Program Version 5: (Compact version using lambda functions and `apply`)

```python
def solve(grid):
    h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    return apply(
        lambda row: tuple(
            apply(
                lambda cell: {
                    9: grid[i][(j + 1) % w], 
                    6: grid[(i + 1) % h][j], 
                    2: grid[i][(j - 1) % w]
                }.get(cell, cell),
                row
            )
        ),
        grid
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Lambda Function for Shifting:** Defines a lambda function that takes a cell value as input and returns the shifted value based on the color mapping.
2. **Nested `apply` Functions:** 
    - The outer `apply` iterates over each row of the grid.
    - The inner `apply` iterates over each cell in a row and applies the shifting lambda function.
3. **Dictionary Lookup:**  Uses a dictionary to map colors to their shifting behavior, making the code more compact.


## Code Extraction:

The code for each program version is provided within the backticks (```). You can easily copy and paste it directly. 

Remember that the color-direction mapping used in these programs is just an assumption.  You might need to modify the mapping based on the actual relationship between colors and shifting directions in your complete dataset.
