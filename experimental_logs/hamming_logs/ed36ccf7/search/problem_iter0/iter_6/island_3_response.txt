## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation shifts objects within the grid based on their position and the grid's dimensions. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The object (group of 9s) is shifted one cell to the left.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** The object (group of 6s) is shifted one cell to the right.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The object (group of 9s) is shifted one cell upwards.

**Input_3 to Output_3:** The object (group of 2s) is shifted one cell diagonally upwards and to the right.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  shifted_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    h, w = shape(I)
    shift_amount = (
      -1 if uppermost(obj) != 0 else 0,  # Shift up if not in top row
      1 if leftmost(obj) == w - 1 else -1 # Shift right if in rightmost column, else left
    )
    shifted_objs = shifted_objs.union(frozenset({shift(obj, shift_amount)}))
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(shifted_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `fgpartition(I)` identifies distinct objects in the input grid `I` excluding the background.
2. **Iterate and Shift:** The code iterates through each object `obj` and determines the shift direction:
    - If the object is not in the top row, it's shifted up by one cell.
    - If the object is in the rightmost column, it's shifted right; otherwise, it's shifted left.
3. **Apply Shift:**  `shift(obj, shift_amount)` shifts the object based on the calculated direction.
4. **Reconstruct Grid:** A new canvas is created with the background color, and the shifted objects are painted onto it.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  h, w = shape(I)
  shifted_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (-1 if uppermost(obj) != 0 else 0, 1 if leftmost(obj) == w - 1 else -1)), objs)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w)), merge(shifted_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a more functional approach with `apply` to shift the objects. It combines the shift logic into a single lambda function for conciseness.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        new_i = i - 1 if i != 0 else i
        new_j = j + 1 if j == w - 1 else j - 1
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (new_i, new_j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates over each cell in the grid, and if it's not a background color, it calculates the new position and paints the cell at that location on the output grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    i, j = ulcorner(obj)
    new_i = i - 1 if i != 0 else i
    new_j = j + 1 if j == w - 1 else j - 1
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (new_i - i, new_j - j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 3 but iterates over objects instead of individual cells. It calculates the shift for the object's upper-left corner and applies that shift to the entire object.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w)),
      merge(
          apply(
              lambda obj: shift(
                  obj,
                  (-1 if uppermost(obj) != 0 else 0, 1 if leftmost(obj) == w - 1 else -1)
              ),
              fgpartition(I)
          )
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version compresses the logic of previous versions into a single line of code using nested functions. It first partitions the grid into objects, then applies a lambda function to shift each object based on its position, and finally paints the shifted objects onto a new canvas.

These five programs demonstrate different approaches and coding styles to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility of the provided DSL.
