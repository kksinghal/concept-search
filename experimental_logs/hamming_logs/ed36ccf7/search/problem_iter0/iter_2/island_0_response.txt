## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place appears to be mirroring objects in the input grid based on their position relative to the vertical midline.  Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0  -> Output_0:**
* Objects on the left side of the vertical midline are mirrored horizontally.
* Objects on the right side remain unchanged.

**Input_1  -> Output_1:**
* Objects on the left side of the vertical midline are mirrored horizontally.
* Objects on the right side remain unchanged.

**Input_2  -> Output_2:**
* Objects on the left side of the vertical midline are mirrored horizontally.
* Objects on the right side remain unchanged.

**Input_3  -> Output_3:**
* Objects on the left side of the vertical midline are mirrored horizontally.
* Objects on the right side remain unchanged.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions, leveraging the DSL functions, to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  transformed_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    if centerofmass(obj)[1] < len(I[0]) // 2:
      transformed_objs = transformed_objs | {hmirror(toobject(obj, I))}
    else:
      transformed_objs = transformed_objs | {obj}
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(transformed_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects` function identifies individual objects within the grid.
2. **Iterate and Transform:** The code iterates through each object. If the object's center of mass lies on the left half of the grid (`centerofmass(obj)[1] < len(I[0]) // 2`), it is mirrored horizontally using `hmirror`. 
3. **Paint to Canvas:** Mirrored objects and unchanged objects are painted onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input, using the most common color from the input grid as the background.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w // 2):
      O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, w - j - 1))})
    for j in range(w // 2, w):
      O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:**  Creates an empty canvas of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the most common color from the input.
2. **Iterative Mirroring:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid. If the cell is on the left half, its value is painted at the mirrored position on the canvas. Cells on the right half are painted directly onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  left = hmirror(lefthalf(I))
  right = righthalf(I)
  return hconcat(left, right)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Split and Mirror:** Splits the input grid into left and right halves.  The left half is mirrored horizontally.
2. **Concatenate:** The mirrored left half and the original right half are concatenated horizontally to form the output.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return hconcat(hmirror(lefthalf(I)), righthalf(I))
```

**Explanation:**

This version is a more concise version of Program Version 3, directly using `hconcat`, `hmirror`, `lefthalf` and `righthalf` to achieve the transformation in a single line.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  w = len(I[0])
  return tuple(tuple(I[i][j] if j >= w // 2 else I[i][w - j - 1] for j in range(w)) for i in range(len(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates over the input grid using nested loops. For each cell, it checks if the column index is greater than or equal to the middle column. If it is, the cell value remains unchanged. Otherwise, the cell value is taken from the mirrored position in the same row. This effectively mirrors the left half of the grid while keeping the right half intact.
