## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve rotating specific objects within the grid based on their color. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The object formed by the digit '9' is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The object formed by the digit '6' is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- The object formed by the digit '9' is rotated 180 degrees. 

**Input_3 to Output_3:**
- The object formed by the digit '2' is rotated 180 degrees.

**General Pattern:**
The transformation involves identifying objects based on their color and then applying a specific rotation to each object. The type of rotation (90 degrees clockwise, 90 degrees counterclockwise, or 180 degrees) seems to depend on the object's color and its initial position.


## Program Versions:

Since the exact logic for determining the rotation type is unclear, the following program versions offer diverse approaches to handle potential scenarios.

**Program Version 1: Color-Specific Rotations**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  transformed_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    c = color(obj)
    if c == 9:
      transformed_objs = transformed_objs | {rot270(obj)}
    elif c == 6:
      transformed_objs = transformed_objs | {rot90(obj)}
    elif c == 2:
      transformed_objs = transformed_objs | {rot180(obj)}
    else:
      transformed_objs = transformed_objs | {obj}
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(transformed_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:**  We identify all objects in the input grid (I) using the `objects` function. 
2. **Color-Specific Rotation:** For each object, we determine its color (c).
    - If c is 9: Rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise (`rot270`).
    - If c is 6: Rotate 90 degrees clockwise (`rot90`).
    - If c is 2: Rotate 180 degrees (`rot180`).
    - Otherwise: Leave the object unchanged.
3. **Reconstruct Grid:**  We paint the transformed objects onto a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input grid.

**Program Version 2: Position-Based Rotations**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
    transformed_objs = frozenset()
    for obj in objs:
        center_i, center_j = centerofmass(obj)
        if center_i < len(I) // 2:
            transformed_objs = transformed_objs | {rot90(obj)}
        elif center_i > len(I) // 2:
            transformed_objs = transformed_objs | {rot270(obj)}
        else:
            transformed_objs = transformed_objs | {rot180(obj)}
    O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(transformed_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Same as in Version 1.
2. **Position-Based Rotation:** For each object, calculate its center of mass.
    - If the center is in the top half of the grid: Rotate 90 degrees clockwise (`rot90`).
    - If the center is in the bottom half: Rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise (`rot270`).
    - If the center is exactly in the middle row: Rotate 180 degrees (`rot180`).
3. **Reconstruct Grid:** Same as in Version 1.

**Program Version 3: Alternating Rotations**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
    transformed_objs = frozenset()
    for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            transformed_objs = transformed_objs | {rot90(obj)}
        elif i % 3 == 1:
            transformed_objs = transformed_objs | {rot270(obj)}
        else:
            transformed_objs = transformed_objs | {rot180(obj)}
    O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(transformed_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Same as in Version 1.
2. **Alternating Rotation:**  Rotate each object based on its position in the `objs` set.
    - Every third object (index 0, 3, 6...): Rotate 90 degrees clockwise (`rot90`).
    - Every third object starting from the second (index 1, 4, 7...): Rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise (`rot270`).
    - Remaining objects: Rotate 180 degrees (`rot180`).
3. **Reconstruct Grid:** Same as in Version 1.

**Program Version 4: Object Size Based Rotation:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
    transformed_objs = frozenset()
    for obj in objs:
        if len(obj) < 5:
            transformed_objs = transformed_objs | {rot90(obj)}
        elif len(obj) >= 5:
            transformed_objs = transformed_objs | {rot180(obj)}
        else: 
            transformed_objs = transformed_objs | {obj}
    O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(transformed_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Same as in Version 1.
2. **Size-Based Rotation:** Rotate each object based on the number of cells it occupies.
    - Objects with less than 5 cells: Rotate 90 degrees clockwise (`rot90`).
    - Objects with 5 or more cells: Rotate 180 degrees (`rot180`).
3. **Reconstruct Grid:** Same as in Version 1.

**Program Version 5: Combination of Color and Size:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
    transformed_objs = frozenset()
    for obj in objs:
        c = color(obj)
        if c == 9:
            transformed_objs = transformed_objs | {rot270(obj)}
        else:
            if len(obj) < 5:
                transformed_objs = transformed_objs | {rot90(obj)}
            elif len(obj) >= 5:
                transformed_objs = transformed_objs | {rot180(obj)}
            else:
                transformed_objs = transformed_objs | {obj}
    O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(transformed_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Same as in Version 1.
2. **Combined Logic:** Applies different rotations based on both color and size.
   - If the object's color is 9: Rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise (`rot270`).
   - For other colors:
      - Objects with less than 5 cells: Rotate 90 degrees clockwise (`rot90`).
      - Objects with 5 or more cells: Rotate 180 degrees (`rot180`).
3. **Reconstruct Grid:** Same as in Version 1. 

These program versions demonstrate various approaches to object manipulation and rotation within a grid using the provided DSL. Each version tackles the transformation task based on a different set of assumptions about the underlying logic.
