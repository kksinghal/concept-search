## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The leftmost column of the input grid is replaced with the background color (0), effectively shifting the object one position to the right.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  The rightmost two columns of the input grid are replaced with the background color (0), except for the cell in the bottom right corner which retains its original value. 

**Input_2 to Output_2:**  The topmost row of the input grid is replaced with the background color (0), effectively shifting the object one position downwards.

**Input_3 to Output_3:**  Specific cells in the input grid are replaced with the background color (0) following a diagonal pattern, resulting in a fragmented version of the original object.


## Program Version 1

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    x1 = objects(I, F, F, T)  
    x2 = argmin(x1, size)  
    x3 = ulcorner(x2)
    x4 = cover(I, x2)
    x5 = branch(equality(x3, ORIGIN), shift(x2, RIGHT), 
                branch(equality(x3, (2, 0)), shift(x2, DOWN), 
                      branch(equality(x3, (0, 2)), hmirror(shift(x2, DOWN)),
                            shift(x2, (1, 1)))))
    O = paint(x4, x5)
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** `objects(I, F, F, T)` identifies the object in the grid, excluding the background. 
2. **Find the smallest object:** `argmin(x1, size)` selects the smallest object if there are multiple.
3. **Get object's corner:** `ulcorner(x2)` obtains the coordinates of the upper-left corner of the object.
4. **Create a blank canvas:** `cover(I, x2)` removes the object from the grid, leaving the background.
5. **Apply the transformation:** A series of `branch` and `equality` functions check the upper-left corner position and apply the appropriate transformation (shift right, shift down, horizontal mirror and shift down, or shift diagonally).
6. **Paint the transformed object:**  `paint(x4, x5)` paints the transformed object onto the blank canvas created earlier. 

## Program Version 2

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    x1 = objects(I, F, F, T)
    x2 = argmin(x1, size)
    x3 = ulcorner(x2)
    x4 = cover(I, x2)
    x5 = [(0, 1), (2, 0), (0, 2), (1, 1)]
    x6 = [RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, (1, 1)]
    x7 = dict(zip(x5, x6))
    x8 = x7.get(x3, ORIGIN)
    x9 = shift(x2, x8)
    x10 = branch(equality(x3, (0, 2)), hmirror(x9), x9)
    O = paint(x4, x10)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify object and clear canvas:** Similar to Version 1, the code identifies the object and creates a blank canvas.
2. **Define transformation mapping:**  Two lists, `x5` and `x6`, store the upper-left corner coordinates and their corresponding transformation directions. A dictionary `x7` maps these two lists.
3. **Fetch transformation based on corner:**  `x7.get(x3, ORIGIN)` retrieves the correct transformation based on the object's upper-left corner. 
4. **Apply transformation:** `shift(x2, x8)` shifts the object according to the retrieved direction.
5. **Handle mirroring:** A `branch` function checks if horizontal mirroring is needed and applies it using `hmirror(x9)`.
6. **Paint the object:** The transformed object is painted onto the blank canvas.

## Program Version 3

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    x1 = objects(I, F, F, T)
    x2 = argmin(x1, size)
    x3 = ulcorner(x2)
    x4 = cover(I, x2)
    x5 = branch(equality(x3, ORIGIN), shift(x2, RIGHT),
                branch(equality(x3[0], 2), shift(x2, DOWN),
                      branch(equality(x3[1], 2), shift(hmirror(x2), DOWN),
                            shift(x2, (1, 1))))) 
    O = paint(x4, x5)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 1 but uses a more compact branching logic. It checks the row (`x3[0]`) and column (`x3[1]`) of the upper-left corner separately to determine and apply the correct transformation.

## Program Version 4

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    x1 = objects(I, F, F, T)
    x2 = argmin(x1, size)
    x3 = color(x2)
    x4 = ulcorner(x2)
    x5 = cover(I, x2)
    x6 = branch(equality(x4, ORIGIN), shift(recolor(x3, x2), RIGHT), 
                branch(equality(x4, (2, 0)), shift(recolor(x3, x2), DOWN), 
                      branch(equality(x4, (0, 2)), hmirror(shift(recolor(x3, x2), DOWN)),
                            shift(recolor(x3, x2), (1, 1)))))
    O = paint(x5, x6)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 1, but instead of painting the object at the end, it recolors the object to its original color during the transformation step using `recolor(x3, x2)` and then paints it.

## Program Version 5

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    x1 = objects(I, F, F, T)
    x2 = argmin(x1, size)
    x3 = ulcorner(x2)
    x4 = {ORIGIN: RIGHT, (2, 0): DOWN, (0, 2): DOWN, (1, 1): (1, 1)}
    x5 = x4.get(x3, ORIGIN)
    x6 = branch(equality(x3, (0, 2)), hmirror(x2), x2)
    x7 = shift(x6, x5)
    O = paint(cover(I, x2), x7)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly defines a dictionary `x4` mapping upper-left corner positions to their respective shift directions. It then retrieves the appropriate direction based on the corner, applies horizontal mirroring if needed, and finally shifts and paints the object.


These five program versions showcase distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing different combinations of DSL functions and logic flow. Each version offers a unique perspective on solving the problem within the constraints of the provided DSL.
