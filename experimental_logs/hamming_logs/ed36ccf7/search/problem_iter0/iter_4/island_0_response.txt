## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be selectively shifting specific digits within the grid, while others remain static:

* **Digit 9:** Shifts one position to the right, wrapping around to the beginning of the row if it reaches the end.
* **Digit 6:** Shifts one position downwards, wrapping around to the top of the column if it reaches the bottom.
* **Digit 2:** Shifts one position to the left, wrapping around to the end of the row if it reaches the beginning.
* **Other Digits:** Remain in their original position.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using different logic and DSL functions:

**Version 1:** (Inspired by Program_A's iteration and conditional painting)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  output = canvas(mostcolor(grid), (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      value = grid[i][j]
      if value == 9:
        output = paint(output, {(value, (i, (j + 1) % w))})
      elif value == 6:
        output = paint(output, {(value, ((i + 1) % h, j))})
      elif value == 2:
        output = paint(output, {(value, (i, (j - 1) % w))})
      else:
        output = paint(output, {(value, (i, j))})
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates an empty canvas `output` with the same dimensions as the input `grid`.
2. Iterates through each cell of the `grid`.
3. For each cell, checks the value:
    - If 9, paints it one position to the right (wrapping around using modulo).
    - If 6, paints it one position down (wrapping around using modulo).
    - If 2, paints it one position to the left (wrapping around using modulo).
    - Otherwise, paints it at the same location.
4. Returns the transformed `output` grid.

**Version 2:** (Inspired by Program_B's use of `replace` and conditional shifting)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  shifted_grid_9 = replace(grid, 9, -1)
  shifted_grid_9 = hconcat((shifted_grid_9[:, -1:],), shifted_grid_9[:, :-1])
  shifted_grid_9 = replace(shifted_grid_9, -1, 9)

  shifted_grid_6 = replace(grid, 6, -1)
  shifted_grid_6 = vconcat((shifted_grid_6[-1:, :],), shifted_grid_6[:-1, :])
  shifted_grid_6 = replace(shifted_grid_6, -1, 6)

  shifted_grid_2 = replace(grid, 2, -1)
  shifted_grid_2 = hconcat((shifted_grid_2[:, 1:],), shifted_grid_2[:, :1])
  shifted_grid_2 = replace(shifted_grid_2, -1, 2)

  return cellwise(cellwise(shifted_grid_9, shifted_grid_6, shifted_grid_9[0][0]), shifted_grid_2, shifted_grid_9[0][0])
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates three temporary grids (`shifted_grid_9`, `shifted_grid_6`, `shifted_grid_2`), each handling the shifting of a specific digit.
2. For each digit (9, 6, 2):
   - Replaces the digit with a temporary value (-1) to avoid conflicts during shifting.
   - Shifts the entire grid in the required direction using `hconcat` or `vconcat`.
   - Replaces the temporary value (-1) back to the original digit.
3. Merges the three shifted grids using `cellwise`, prioritizing the shifted values over the original ones.

**Version 3:** (Using `apply` for functional programming style)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          {
              9: grid[i][(j + 1) % w],
              6: grid[(i + 1) % h][j],
              2: grid[i][(j - 1) % w],
          }.get(cell, cell)
          for j, cell in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(grid)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. Uses nested list comprehensions to iterate through each cell of the `grid`.
2. For each cell, uses a dictionary lookup with `.get(cell, cell)` to apply the shifting logic based on the cell value, defaulting to the original value if no specific rule is found.

**Version 4:** (Leveraging `shift` and `paint` for object-based manipulation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  output = canvas(mostcolor(grid), (h, w))
  for value in (9, 6, 2):
    for i, j in ofcolor(grid, value):
      if value == 9:
        output = paint(output, {(value, (i, (j + 1) % w))})
      elif value == 6:
        output = paint(output, {(value, ((i + 1) % h, j))})
      else:
        output = paint(output, {(value, (i, (j - 1) % w))})
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates an empty canvas `output`.
2. Iterates through the specific digits (9, 6, 2).
3. For each digit, finds all its occurrences in the `grid` using `ofcolor`.
4. Shifts each occurrence based on the digit's specific rule and paints it onto the `output` grid.

**Version 5:** (Combination of `hsplit`, `vsplit` and concatenation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  if 9 in grid[0]:
    grid = hconcat((grid[:, -1:],), grid[:, :-1])
  if 6 in dmirror(grid)[0]:
    grid = vconcat((grid[-1:, :],), grid[:-1, :])
  if 2 in grid[0][::-1]:
    grid = hconcat((grid[:, 1:],), grid[:, :1])
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. Checks for the presence of specific digits in strategic locations (first row, first column after `dmirror`, last row in reverse) to identify if a shift is needed.
2. If a digit is found, performs the corresponding shift by splitting the grid using `hsplit` or `vsplit`, rearranging the parts, and concatenating them back together.


Each version implements the same digit shifting logic but employs different DSL functions and programming paradigms, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
