## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The leftmost column of the input grid is shifted one column to the right. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  The top row of the input grid is shifted one row down.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**  The bottom row of the input grid is shifted one row up.

**Input_3 to Output_3:** The bottom row of the input grid is shifted one row up, and the leftmost and rightmost columns are switched. 

## Code Generation:

The provided transformation analysis suggests a focus on shifting rows or columns. Let's leverage DSL functions like `hsplit`, `vsplit`, `hconcat`, `vconcat`, and potentially others to achieve this.

Since I don't have access to the two unprovided programs you mentioned, the following code examples are inspired by the provided programs and the DSL, focusing on achieving the desired transformations.

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Split the grid into rows
  rows = vsplit(I, height(I))
  # Shift the appropriate row based on input
  if leftmost(objects(I, False, False, False)[0]) == 0:
    rows = (rows[1], rows[0], rows[2]) if len(rows) > 2 else (rows[1], rows[0])
  elif uppermost(objects(I, False, False, False)[0]) == 0:
    rows = (rows[1:], rows[0:1])  if len(rows) > 2 else (rows[1], rows[0])
  else:
    rows = (rows[-1:], rows[:-1])
  # Concatenate rows back into a grid
  O = vconcat(*rows)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Split into Rows:** The input grid is divided into individual rows.
2. **Conditional Shifting:** Based on the position of the first object in the input:
   - If the object touches the left edge, shift the top row down (or swap the top two rows if only two exist).
   - If the object touches the top edge, shift the top row down.
   - Otherwise, shift the bottom row up.
3. **Concatenate:** The shifted rows are combined back into a grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Transpose the grid for column-wise operations
  T = dmirror(I)
  # Split the transposed grid into rows (representing columns of original)
  cols = vsplit(T, height(T))
  # Apply similar conditional shifting as Version 1, but for columns
  if leftmost(objects(T, False, False, False)[0]) == 0:
    cols = (cols[1], cols[0], cols[2]) if len(cols) > 2 else (cols[1], cols[0])
  elif uppermost(objects(T, False, False, False)[0]) == 0:
    cols = (cols[1:], cols[0:1]) if len(cols) > 2 else (cols[1], cols[0])
  else:
    cols = (cols[-1:], cols[:-1])
  # Concatenate columns and transpose back
  O = dmirror(vconcat(*cols))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version mirrors the logic of Version 1 but operates on columns instead of rows using transposition (`dmirror`) before and after the shifting.

**Program Version 3:** (This version might not be the most efficient but demonstrates using different DSL functions)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = objects(I, False, False, False)[0]
  # Determine shift direction based on object position
  if leftmost(obj) == 0:
    direction = DOWN
  elif uppermost(obj) == 0:
    direction = DOWN 
  else:
    direction = UP
  # Find the object to be shifted (assuming single object)
  obj_to_move = obj
  # Shift the object
  shifted_obj = shift(obj_to_move, direction)
  # Paint the shifted object back onto a blank canvas
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_to_move), shifted_obj) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Object and Direction:**  Determines the shift direction based on the object's position.
2. **Shift and Paint:** Shifts the object in the identified direction and paints it onto a cleared version of the input grid. 

**Program Versions 4 & 5:**

Due to the limitations of not having access to the unprovided programs, creating two more distinct versions with significantly different logic becomes challenging. However, I can suggest potential directions:

- **Version 4:**  Explore using `crop` and `combine` to cut and paste rows/columns directly.
- **Version 5:** Investigate using `hperiod` and `vperiod`  to potentially identify patterns and shift elements accordingly.

Remember to test these programs thoroughly with the provided input grids to ensure they produce the expected outputs.
