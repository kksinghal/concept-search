## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects based on connected pixels of the same color (excluding the background color) and then reflecting these objects along the vertical axis, but only if the object touches the left or right border of the grid. The original and reflected objects are then merged to create the final output.

### Input_0 to Output_0:
* The object '9' touches the left border.
* Reflect the '9' object along the vertical axis.
* Merge the original and reflected objects.

### Input_1 to Output_1:
* The object '6' touches both the left and right borders.
* Reflect the '6' object along the vertical axis.
* Merge the original and reflected objects (in this case, they overlap completely).

### Input_2 to Output_2:
* The object '9' touches the right border.
* Reflect the '9' object along the vertical axis.
* Merge the original and reflected objects.

### Input_3 to Output_3:
* The object '2' touches both the left and right borders.
* Reflect the '2' object along the vertical axis.
* Merge the original and reflected objects (resulting in some overlap).


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_9d9215db(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = paint(canvas(bg, (h, w)), merge(
      {shift(obj, (0, w - 1 - 2 * leftmost(obj))) for obj in objs if bordering(obj, I)}
  ))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, False, False, True)` identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Get Background Color:** `bg = mostcolor(I)` gets the most frequent color, representing the background.
3. **Get Grid Dimensions:** `h, w = shape(I)` gets the height and width of the input grid.
4. **Create Blank Canvas:** `canvas(bg, (h, w))` creates a grid filled with the background color.
5. **Filter Bordering Objects:** `bordering(obj, I)` checks if the object touches the border.
6. **Calculate Reflection Shift:** `(0, w - 1 - 2 * leftmost(obj))` calculates the shift required to reflect the object horizontally based on its leftmost position.
7. **Reflect and Shift Objects:** `shift(obj, ...)` reflects and shifts bordering objects.
8. **Merge and Paint:**  `merge(...)` combines the reflected objects and `paint(...)` paints them onto the blank canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_9d9215db(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  h, w = shape(I)
  reflected_objs = {branch(bordering(obj, I), hmirror(obj), obj) for obj in objs}
  shifted_objs = {shift(obj, (0, w - 1 - 2 * leftmost(obj))) for obj in reflected_objs}
  O = paint(canvas(bg, (h, w)), merge(shifted_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects & Background:** Same as version 1.
2. **Conditional Reflection:** `branch(bordering(obj, I), hmirror(obj), obj)` reflects an object horizontally only if it touches the border.
3. **Shift Reflected Objects:** Same logic as version 1, but applied to all potentially reflected objects.
4. **Merge and Paint:** Similar to version 1, but using the conditionally reflected and shifted objects.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_9d9215db(I):
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    h, w = shape(I)
    reflected_objs = set()
    for obj in objs:
        if leftmost(obj) == 0 or rightmost(obj) == w - 1:
            reflected_objs.add(hmirror(obj))
        else:
            reflected_objs.add(obj)
    shifted_objs = {shift(obj, (0, w - 1 - 2 * leftmost(obj))) for obj in reflected_objs}
    O = paint(canvas(bg, (h, w)), merge(shifted_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects & Background:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Iterative Reflection:** This version uses a loop and conditional statements to reflect objects touching the left or right borders.
3. **Shift and Paint:**  Similar to previous versions for shifting and painting the final objects.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_9d9215db(I):
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    h, w = shape(I)
    O = canvas(bg, (h, w))
    for obj in objs:
        if leftmost(obj) == 0 or rightmost(obj) == w - 1:
            O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj), (0, w - 1 - 2 * leftmost(obj))))
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, w - 1 - 2 * leftmost(obj))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects & Background:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Direct Painting:** This version directly paints both the original and reflected objects (if applicable) onto the canvas within the loop, simplifying the final steps.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_9d9215db(I):
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    h, w = shape(I)
    reflected_objs = mapply(lambda obj: branch(bordering(obj, I), hmirror(obj), obj), objs)
    shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, w - 1 - 2 * leftmost(obj))), reflected_objs)
    O = paint(canvas(bg, (h, w)), shifted_objs)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects & Background:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Lambda Functions & Map:** This version utilizes lambda functions and `mapply` to achieve a more functional programming style for reflection and shifting. 
3. **Paint Final Objects:**  The final merged and shifted objects are painted onto the canvas.
