## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to shift the non-background digits in each row one position to the left, wrapping the leftmost digit to the rightmost position if it's not the background color.

**Input 0:**
- The '9's are shifted left, with the leading '9' wrapping to the end. 

**Input 1:**
- The '6's are shifted left, with the leading '6' wrapping to the end. 

**Input 2:**
- The '9's are shifted left. Since the leftmost column is the background color, there is no wrapping. 

**Input 3:**
- The '2's are shifted left, with the leading '2' wrapping to the end. 


## Code Generation:

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 1):** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(tuple(v for v in (r[-1:] + r[:-1])) if any(c != mostcommon(grid) for c in r) else r for r in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** `for r in grid` iterates through each row of the grid.
2. **Identify non-background rows:** `if any(c != mostcommon(grid) for c in r)` checks if any element in the row is not the background color (most common color).
3. **Shift digits:** `(r[-1:] + r[:-1])` shifts the last digit to the beginning for non-background rows.
4. **Keep background rows unchanged:** If the row is a background row, it remains unchanged.
5. **Combine rows:** The shifted rows are combined using `tuple()` to form the final output grid.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 2):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(tuple(row[(i-1)%len(row)] if any(c != mostcommon(grid) for c in row) else row[i] for i in range(len(row))) for row in grid) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows and columns:** This version iterates through each element of the grid.
2. **Shift for non-background rows:** For each non-background row, the digit at index `i` is moved to `(i-1)%len(row)`, effectively shifting it left with wrapping.
3. **Maintain background rows:** Background rows remain unchanged.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 3):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(hconcat(r[-1:], r[:-1]) if any(c != mostcommon(grid) for c in r) else r for r in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** `for r in grid` iterates through each row of the grid.
2. **Identify non-background rows:** `if any(c != mostcommon(grid) for c in r)` checks if any element in the row is not the background color (most common color).
3. **Shift digits:** `hconcat(r[-1:], r[:-1])` concatenates the last element of the row with all elements except the last, effectively performing a left shift with wrapping.
4. **Keep background rows unchanged:** If the row is a background row, it remains unchanged.
5. **Combine rows:**  The modified rows are combined using `tuple()` to form the output grid.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 4):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(tuple(v for i, v in enumerate(r) if i != 0) + (r[0],) if any(c != mostcommon(grid) for c in r) else r for r in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** `for r in grid` iterates through each row of the grid.
2. **Identify non-background rows:** `if any(c != mostcommon(grid) for c in r)` checks if any element in the row is not the background color (most common color).
3. **Shift digits:** For non-background rows, it constructs a new row by taking all elements except the first (`(v for i, v in enumerate(r) if i != 0)`) and appending the first element to the end (`+ (r[0],)`).
4. **Keep background rows unchanged:** If the row is a background row, it remains unchanged.
5. **Combine rows:**  The modified rows are combined using `tuple()` to form the output grid.


**Program_to_be_generated (Version 5):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  transformed = []
  for row in grid:
    new_row = [row[-1]] if any(c != mostcommon(grid) for c in row) else []
    new_row.extend(row[:-1])
    transformed.append(tuple(new_row))
  return tuple(transformed)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** `for row in grid` iterates through each row of the grid.
2. **Identify non-background rows:** `if any(c != mostcommon(grid) for c in row)` checks if any element in the row is not the background color (most common color).
3. **Shift digits:** For non-background rows, it initializes `new_row` with the last element of the row and then extends it with all elements except the last, effectively shifting left with wrapping.
4. **Handle background rows:** For background rows, `new_row` is initialized as an empty list and remains empty after the extension, resulting in no change for these rows.
5. **Combine rows:** The modified rows are combined using `tuple()` to form the output grid.
