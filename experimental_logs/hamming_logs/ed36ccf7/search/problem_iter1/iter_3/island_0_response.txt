## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:** The transformation involves taking the rightmost vertical line of the input grid and moving it to the leftmost position. The original leftmost vertical line is then replaced with the background color (0).

**Input 1 to Output 1:** The transformation involves taking the topmost horizontal line of the input grid and moving it to the bottommost position. The original bottommost horizontal line is then replaced with the background color (0).

**Input 2 to Output 2:** This transformation is the inverse of the transformation applied to Input 0. The leftmost vertical line is moved to the rightmost position, and the original rightmost vertical line is replaced with the background color (0).

**Input 3 to Output 3:**  This transformation is more complex. It involves swapping the two leftmost columns, then swapping the top and bottom cells in the new rightmost column.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to perform the desired transformations:

**Version 1 (using slicing and concatenation):**

```python
def transform_grid(grid):
  h = height(grid)
  w = width(grid)
  if h > w:
    return vconcat(grid[:,w-1:w], grid[:,0:w-1])
  else:
    return hconcat(grid[h-1:h,:], grid[0:h-1,:])
```

**Explanation:**

- Calculates the height and width of the grid.
- If the grid is taller than it is wide (portrait), it performs a vertical transformation:
    - Extracts the rightmost column using slicing (`grid[:,w-1:w]`).
    - Extracts the remaining columns (`grid[:,0:w-1]`).
    - Concatenates the rightmost column to the left of the remaining columns using `vconcat`.
- If the grid is wider than it is tall (landscape) or square, it performs a horizontal transformation:
    - Extracts the bottom row using slicing (`grid[h-1:h,:]`).
    - Extracts the remaining rows (`grid[0:h-1,:]`).
    - Concatenates the bottom row above the remaining rows using `hconcat`.


**Version 2 (using shift and paint):**

```python
def transform_grid(grid):
  h = height(grid)
  w = width(grid)
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  if h > w:
    line = toobject(vfrontier((w-1,0)), grid)
    return paint(paint(grid, recolor(bg, vfrontier((0,0)))), shift(line, (-w+1,0)))
  else:
    line = toobject(hfrontier((0,w-1)), grid)
    return paint(paint(grid, recolor(bg, hfrontier((h-1,0)))), shift(line, (0,-w+1)))
```

**Explanation:**

- Identifies background color and grid dimensions.
- If portrait, extracts and moves the rightmost vertical line:
    - `line`: Extracts the rightmost vertical line as an object.
    - `paint(grid, recolor(bg, vfrontier((0,0))))`: Paints the leftmost vertical line with the background color.
    - `shift(line, (-w+1,0))`: Shifts the extracted line to the leftmost position.
    - Finally, paints the shifted line onto the modified grid.
- If landscape or square, performs analogous operations for the bottom horizontal line.


**Version 3 (using loops and conditional replacement):**

```python
def transform_grid(grid):
  h = height(grid)
  w = width(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), (h,w))
  if h > w:
    for i in range(h):
      new_grid[i][0] = grid[i][w-1]
  else:
    for j in range(w):
      new_grid[h-1][j] = grid[0][j]
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

- Creates a new canvas filled with the background color and the same dimensions as the input.
- Iterates through either rows (if portrait) or columns (if landscape or square).
- For each row/column, copies the value from the last column/row of the input grid to the first column/row of the output grid.


**Version 4 (using transpose and slicing):**

```python
def transform_grid(grid):
  if portrait(grid):
    return hconcat(grid[:,-1:], grid[:,:-1]) 
  else:
    return vconcat(grid[-1:,:], grid[:-1,:])
```

**Explanation:**

- Determines if the grid is portrait.
- If portrait:
    - `grid[:,-1:]`: Extracts the last column.
    - `grid[:,:-1]`: Extracts all columns except the last.
    - `hconcat`: Concatenates the extracted column to the left of the remaining columns.
- If landscape or square:
    - Performs analogous operations for rows using `vconcat`.


**Version 5 (recursive approach for square grids):**

```python
def transform_grid(grid):
  h = height(grid)
  w = width(grid)
  if h > w:
    return vconcat(grid[:,w-1:w], grid[:,0:w-1])
  elif w > h:
    return hconcat(grid[h-1:h,:], grid[0:h-1,:])
  else:
    inner = transform_grid(trim(grid))
    return hconcat(vconcat(grid[0:1,:], inner), grid[h-1:h,:])
```

**Explanation:**

- Handles portrait and landscape cases as in previous versions.
- If the grid is square:
    - Recursively calls the `transform_grid` function on a smaller grid obtained by trimming the outer layer (`trim(grid)`).
    - Reconstructs the final grid by concatenating the top row, the transformed inner grid, and the bottom row.


These versions provide diverse solutions using different DSL functions and logic, illustrating the flexibility of the provided DSL for spatial transformations.
