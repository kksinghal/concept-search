## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation for both input-output pairs involves identifying connected objects (considering diagonal connections) in the input grid and placing a '1' at the cell immediately below the leftmost cell of each object.

**Example:**

Input:

```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```

Output:

```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 1 8 0
0 0 8 1 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```

Here, two distinct objects are formed by the digit '8'. For each object, a '1' is placed below its leftmost cell.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    O = fill(O, 1, {(uppermost(obj) + 1, leftmost(obj))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))`**: Creates a blank canvas (`O`) of the same size as the input (`I`), filled with the most common color in the input.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, T, T)`**: Iterates over each connected object in the input grid, considering diagonal connections and excluding the background.
3. **`O = paint(O, obj)`**: Paints the current object onto the canvas.
4. **`O = fill(O, 1, {(uppermost(obj) + 1, leftmost(obj))})`**: Fills a '1' at the cell below the leftmost cell of the current object.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    O = fill(O, 1, {(uppermost(obj) + 1, leftmost(obj))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`**: Initializes the output (`O`) as a copy of the input (`I`).
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, T, T)`**: Iterates over each connected object in the input grid, considering diagonal connections and excluding the background.
3. **`O = fill(O, 1, {(uppermost(obj) + 1, leftmost(obj))})`**: Fills a '1' at the cell below the leftmost cell of the current object. This directly modifies the output grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  return paint(O,
               mapply(lambda obj: recolor(1, {(uppermost(obj) + 1, leftmost(obj))}),
                      objects(I, T, T, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(...)`**: Creates a blank canvas as in version 1.
2. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`**:  Identifies all connected objects in the input grid.
3. **`lambda obj: recolor(1, {(uppermost(obj) + 1, leftmost(obj))})`**: Defines a lambda function that takes an object and creates a new object with a single cell ('1') below the leftmost cell of the input object.
4. **`mapply(...)`**: Applies the lambda function to each object and merges the results into a single set of cells.
5. **`paint(O, ...)`**:  Paints the merged set of cells (containing the '1's) onto the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               mapply(lambda obj: recolor(1, {(uppermost(obj) + 1, leftmost(obj))}),
                      objects(I, T, T, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 3 but directly uses the input grid as the canvas instead of creating a blank one. It identifies the locations for '1's and directly paints them onto the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value != mostcommon(I) and (i == 0 or I[i-1][j] == mostcommon(I)):
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i+1, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each cell in the input grid. If a cell is not the background color and its above cell is the background color (or it's in the first row), it places a '1' below that cell. This approach directly identifies the leftmost cells of objects without explicitly using the `objects` function.
