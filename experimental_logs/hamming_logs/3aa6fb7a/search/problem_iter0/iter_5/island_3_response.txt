## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects (connected regions) of non-background digits. For each object, it highlights the cell immediately to the right of the rightmost cell of that object. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- Two objects exist: One '8' object with 3 cells and another '8' object with 2 cells.
- For the first object, the rightmost '8' is in column 2, so a '1' is placed in column 3 of the same row.
- For the second object, the rightmost '8' is in column 6, so a '1' is placed in column 7 of the same row.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- Four '8' objects exist, each with 2 cells.
- For each object, a '1' is placed to the right of the rightmost '8', mirroring the logic from Input_0.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL, each with an explanation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  right_edges = mapply(lambda obj: {(i, j + 1) for (v, (i, j)) in obj if j == rightmost(obj)}, objs)
  return fill(I, 1, merge(right_edges))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`:** Identifies all objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid `I`, excluding the background.
2. **`right_edges = mapply(lambda obj: {(i, j + 1) for (v, (i, j)) in obj if j == rightmost(obj)}, objs)`:** For each object, it finds the rightmost cell `(i, j)` and creates a set containing the index to its right `(i, j + 1)`. 
3. **`return fill(I, 1, merge(right_edges))`:** Merges the sets of right edge indices and fills them with '1' on the original input grid `I`. 


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  return fill(I, 1, merge({shift(obj, (0, 1)) - obj for obj in objs}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`:** Identifies objects, same as in Version 1.
2. **`return fill(I, 1, merge({shift(obj, (0, 1)) - obj for obj in objs}))`:** Shifts each object one position to the right. The difference between the shifted object and the original object will be the rightmost edge. These edges are then merged and filled with '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_right = shift(asobject(I), (0, 1))
  return fill(I, 1, toindices(intersection(shifted_right, asobject(replace(I, 0, 1)))) - toindices(asobject(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_right = shift(asobject(I), (0, 1))`:**  Shifts the entire input grid one position to the right.
2. **`replace(I, 0, 1)`:**  Replaces all background digits ('0' in this case) with '1's to ensure correct intersection in the next step.
3. **`intersection(shifted_right, asobject(replace(I, 0, 1)))`:** Finds the intersection between the shifted grid and the modified input grid. This intersection will include the right edges of objects.
4. **`toindices(...) - toindices(asobject(I))`:** Extracts indices from the intersection and removes the indices of the original objects, leaving only the right edge indices. 
5. **`fill(I, 1, ...)`:** Fills the identified right edge indices with '1's.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, mapply(lambda obj: recolor(1, {(i, j + 1) for (v, (i, j)) in obj if j == rightmost(obj)}), objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`:**  Identifies objects, as in previous versions.
2. **`mapply(lambda obj: recolor(1, {(i, j + 1) for (v, (i, j)) in obj if j == rightmost(obj)}), ...)`:**  For each object, it finds the rightmost cells, creates a new object with color '1' at the indices to the right of these cells.
3. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the newly created '1'-colored objects onto the original input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, shift(replace(I, 0, mostcommon(I)), (0, 1)), 1) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`replace(I, 0, mostcommon(I))`:**  Replaces background digits with the most common digit in the grid (assumes most common digit is the background) to handle potential edge cases.
2. **`shift(..., (0, 1))`:**  Shifts the modified grid one position to the right.
3. **`cellwise(I, ..., 1)`:**  Compares the original grid with the shifted grid. If the values in the corresponding cells are different (indicating a right edge), it fills the cell in the output grid with '1'. Otherwise, it keeps the original cell value.


These are five distinct ways to achieve the desired transformation. Each version utilizes a different combination of DSL functions and approaches the problem from a different angle.
