## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify the immediate, non-diagonal neighbors of the object represented by the digit '8'.  These neighbors are then marked with the digit '1' while the original grid remains otherwise unchanged. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The '8' objects in the input have neighbors at specific locations.
* The output fills these neighboring cells with '1'. 
* For example, the '8' at (1,1) gets a '1' at (1,2).

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* Similar to the previous example, the transformation identifies and marks the non-diagonal neighbors of the '8' objects.
* Notice how the transformation correctly handles different configurations and locations of the '8' objects. 


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8) # Extract '8' object
  neighbor_indices = mfilter(
      prapply(lambda cell, d: add(cell, d), toindices(obj8), [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]), # Generate potential neighbors
      lambda cell: 0 <= cell[0] < len(I) and 0 <= cell[1] < len(I[0]) and cell not in toindices(obj8) # Filter valid & non-'8' neighbors
  )
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbor_indices) # Fill valid neighbor cells with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '8' Object:**  The code first identifies and extracts the object composed of '8' digits using `objects` and `extract`.
2. **Generate Potential Neighbors:**  It then uses `prapply` to generate a set of potential neighbor indices by shifting the object's indices (obtained via `toindices`) in each of the four cardinal directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).
3. **Filter Valid Neighbors:** The `mfilter` function is used with a lambda function to keep only valid neighbors. A valid neighbor is within the grid bounds and doesn't belong to the original '8' object.
4. **Fill with '1':** Finally, the `fill` function places the digit '1' at the valid neighbor indices on a copy of the input grid, producing the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  eights = toindices(extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8))
  shifted_neighbors = frozenset({cell for direction in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT] for cell in shift(eights, direction)})
  valid_neighbors = intersection(shifted_neighbors, asindices(I))  
  neighbor_indices = difference(valid_neighbors, eights)
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbor_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '8' Indices:** Extract the indices of all '8' cells.
2. **Calculate Shifted Neighbors:**  Calculate the indices of potential neighbors by shifting the '8' indices in all four cardinal directions.
3. **Intersect with Grid Indices:**  Find the valid neighbor indices by intersecting the shifted neighbor indices with the indices of the input grid. This ensures we only consider cells within the grid's boundaries.
4. **Remove Original '8' Indices:** Exclude the original '8' indices from the valid neighbor indices.
5. **Fill Valid Neighbors:** Fill the cells at the remaining valid neighbor indices with '1'.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8)
  neighbor_cells = frozenset({add(cell, d) for cell in toindices(obj8) for d in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT] 
                          if 0 <= add(cell, d)[0] < len(I) and 0 <= add(cell, d)[1] < len(I[0]) and add(cell, d) not in toindices(obj8)})
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbor_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract the '8' object:** Identify and extract the connected component of cells containing '8'.
2. **Find valid neighbor cells:** Iterate through each cell of the '8' object and its four cardinal neighbors. Check if each neighbor is within the grid boundaries and doesn't belong to the original '8' object.
3. **Fill neighbors with '1':** Fill the valid neighbor cells with '1' in the output grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8)
  neighbor_indices = mfilter(rapply(lambda d: shift(toindices(obj8), d), [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]), 
                            lambda indices: intersection(indices, toindices(obj8)) == frozenset() and len(intersection(indices, asindices(I))) > 0)
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbor_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **Extract '8' object:** Similar to previous versions, this identifies the connected '8' cells.
2. **Generate potential neighbor indices:** It calculates the shifted indices for each direction using `rapply` and `shift`.
3. **Filter for valid neighbors:** The `mfilter` function, combined with a lambda function, checks if the shifted indices satisfy two conditions:
    - They don't overlap with the original '8' object.
    - They fall within the grid's boundaries.
4. **Fill valid neighbors:** The final step involves filling the valid neighbors with '1' in the output grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8)
    neighbors_cells = difference(frozenset({cell for direction in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT] for cell in shift(toindices(obj8), direction)}), toindices(obj8)) 
    valid_neighbors = intersection(neighbors_cells, asindices(I))
    O = fill(I, 1, valid_neighbors)  
    return O
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **Identify '8' Indices:** Extract the indices of all cells containing '8'.
2. **Calculate All Shifted Neighbors:**  Calculate the indices of potential neighbors by shifting the '8' indices in all four cardinal directions. 
3. **Remove Original '8' Indices:**  Subtract the original '8' indices from the set of all shifted neighbors.
4. **Intersect with Grid:** Intersect the remaining indices with the indices of the input grid to ensure we only work with valid grid cells.
5. **Fill Valid Neighbors:** Fill the cells at the valid neighbor indices with '1' on the output grid.
