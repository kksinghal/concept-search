## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific cells within the input grid based on their relationship to the digit '8' and changing their values to '1'. 

* **Target Cells:** Cells located diagonally adjacent to a cell containing '8' are targeted for transformation.
* **Transformation:** The targeted cells have their values changed to '1'.

This applies consistently to both input-output pairs.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  target_indices = mapply(lambda obj: mapply(ineighbors, toindices(obj)), objs)
  O = paint(I, recolor(1, target_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '8' Objects:**  `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` finds all connected regions of '8's.
2. **Find Target Cells:** `mapply(lambda obj: mapply(ineighbors, toindices(obj)), objs)` finds the diagonally adjacent indices for each '8' object and merges them.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** `recolor(1, target_indices)` creates an object with the target indices colored '1'. `paint(I, ...)` applies this object to the input grid.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 8:
        for di, dj in [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]:
          if 0 <= i + di < len(I) and 0 <= j + dj < len(I[0]):
            O = fill(O, 1, {(i + di, j + dj)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** Iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Diagonal Check:** If a cell contains '8', it checks all four diagonal neighbors.
3. **Fill:** If a diagonal neighbor is within the grid bounds, it's filled with '1'.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  indices_8 = ofcolor(I, 8)
  target_indices = mfilter(lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]), 
                           mapply(ineighbors, indices_8))
  O = paint(I, recolor(1, target_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '8' Indices:**  `ofcolor(I, 8)` finds all indices of cells containing '8'.
2. **Get Diagonal Neighbors:** `mapply(ineighbors, indices_8)` gets the diagonally adjacent indices for each '8' index.
3. **Filter Valid Indices:** `mfilter(...)` filters out indices that fall outside the grid boundaries.
4. **Recolor and Paint:**  Similar to Version 1, it recolors the target indices to '1' and paints them onto the input grid.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(1, len(I) - 1):
        for j in range(1, len(I[0]) - 1):
            if I[i][j] == 8:
                O = fill(O, 1, {(i - 1, j - 1), (i - 1, j + 1), (i + 1, j - 1), (i + 1, j + 1)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate with Boundary Check:** Iterates through the grid, excluding the outer edges.
2. **Direct Diagonal Fill:** If a cell contains '8', it directly fills all four diagonal neighbors with '1', assuming they are within the grid bounds due to the loop conditions.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  shifted_grids = [shift(asobject(I), d) for d in [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]]
  overlay = cellwise(I, shifted_grids[0], 0)
  for g in shifted_grids[1:]:
    overlay = cellwise(overlay, g, 0)
  target_indices = ofcolor(overlay, 8)
  O = paint(I, recolor(1, target_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Shifted Grids:** Creates four copies of the input grid, each shifted diagonally.
2. **Find Overlaps:** `cellwise(...)` iteratively finds cells that align with '8' in all shifted grids, resulting in an overlay grid marking potential target cells.
3. **Extract Target Indices:**  `ofcolor(overlay, 8)` finds the indices of the marked cells in the overlay.
4. **Recolor and Paint:** Similar to previous versions, it recolors the target indices to '1' and paints them onto the input grid.
