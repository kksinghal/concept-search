## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying specific cells within the input grid and changing their values to '1'.  Let's break down the pattern:

* **Target Cells:** The cells targeted for change are always directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to an '8' cell.
* **Color Unchanged:** The '8' cells themselves remain unchanged. 
* **Background Unchanged:** The '0' cells that are not adjacent to an '8' also remain unchanged.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) 
  target_indices = mpapply(dneighbors, toindices(merge(objs)))
  O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify '8' cells:**  `objects(I, T, F, F)` finds all connected objects in the grid where cells have the same value (T), connectivity is not diagonal (F), and background is not excluded (F). This effectively identifies all groups of '8's.
2. **Find Adjacent Cells:** `toindices(merge(objs))` retrieves the indices of all '8' cells. Then, `mpapply(dneighbors, ...)` finds all directly adjacent neighbors for each '8' cell index and merges them into a single set (`target_indices`).
3. **Fill with '1':**  `fill(I, 1, target_indices)` fills the grid `I` with the value '1' at the identified `target_indices`.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
  eights = ofcolor(I, 8) 
  neighbors_of_eights = mpapply(dneighbors, eights)
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbors_of_eights)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Locate '8's:** `ofcolor(I, 8)` directly identifies the indices of all cells with the value '8'.
2. **Adjacent Cells:** Similar to version 1, `mpapply(dneighbors, eights)` finds and merges the directly adjacent neighbors of all '8' cells.
3. **Fill:** `fill(I, 1, neighbors_of_eights)` changes the values at the adjacent indices to '1'.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I  
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 8:
        for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:
          ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
          if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] == 0:
            O = fill(O, 1, {(ni, nj)}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate and Check:** This version iterates through each cell of the grid `I`. 
2. **Adjacent Cell Modification:** If a cell contains '8', it iterates through its four direct neighbors (`di`, `dj`). If a neighbor is within the grid bounds and contains '0', its value is changed to '1' in the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
  shifted_right = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)
  shifted_left = shift(asobject(I), LEFT)
  shifted_down = shift(asobject(I), DOWN)
  shifted_up = shift(asobject(I), UP)
  combined = shifted_right | shifted_left | shifted_down | shifted_up
  target_cells = intersection(toindices(combined), asindices(I))
  O = fill(I, 1, target_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Shift and Combine:** This version cleverly shifts the entire grid (`asobject(I)`) in all four cardinal directions and combines the results into `combined`.
2. **Intersection for Adjacency:** The intersection of `combined` with the original grid indices (`asindices(I)`) identifies cells adjacent to the original '8' cells.
3. **Fill:** The identified `target_cells` are filled with '1'.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
    def is_adjacent_to_eight(loc):
        return any(I[i][j] == 8 for i, j in dneighbors(loc) if 0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0]))
    
    O = [[1 if is_adjacent_to_eight((i, j)) and I[i][j] == 0 else I[i][j] for j in range(len(I[0]))] for i in range(len(I))]
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Define Adjacency Function:** A helper function `is_adjacent_to_eight` checks if a given location is adjacent to an '8' cell within the grid.
2. **List Comprehension for Transformation:** A nested list comprehension iterates through each cell in `I`. If a cell is '0' and adjacent to an '8' (as determined by `is_adjacent_to_eight`), its value is changed to '1' in the output grid `O`.
3. **Tuple Conversion:** Finally, the nested list `O` is converted back into a tuple of tuples to match the expected grid format.

These five program versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the same grid transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
