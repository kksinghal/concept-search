## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific cells within the input grid and changing their values to '1'.  The location of these cells appears to be related to the position of the '8' valued objects within the grid. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* A '1' is placed directly to the right of the top-leftmost '8' in the object.
* Another '1' is placed directly to the left of the bottom-rightmost '8' in the object.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* A '1' is placed directly to the left of the bottom-rightmost '8' in each object.
* Another '1' is placed directly to the right of the top-leftmost '8' in each object.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  new_cells = set()
  for obj in objs:
    uppermost_row = uppermost(obj)
    leftmost_col = leftmost(obj)
    lowermost_row = lowermost(obj)
    rightmost_col = rightmost(obj)
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if i == uppermost_row and j == leftmost_col:
        new_cells.add((i, j + 1))
      if i == lowermost_row and j == rightmost_col:
        new_cells.add((i, j - 1))
  O = fill(I, 1, frozenset(new_cells))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies the '8'-valued objects within the grid.
2. **Iterate through objects:** The code iterates through each identified object.
3. **Find extreme cells:** Within each object, it finds the indices of the top-leftmost and bottom-rightmost '8' cells.
4. **Mark new cells:** It adds the indices of the cells to the right and left of the identified '8' cells to the `new_cells` set.
5. **Fill new cells:** Finally, it uses the `fill` function to change the value of the cells in the `new_cells` set to '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    ul = ulcorner(obj)
    lr = lrcorner(obj)
    O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({(ul[0], ul[1] + 1), (lr[0], lr[1] - 1)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Similar to version 1, this version identifies the '8'-valued objects.
2. **Iterate and modify:** It iterates through each object and directly modifies the grid `O`.
3. **Find corners and fill:** For each object, it finds the upper-left and lower-right corners using `ulcorner` and `lrcorner`. It then uses `fill` to change the values of the cells adjacent to these corners to '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 8:
        if I[i-1][j] != 8 and i > 0:
          O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({(i, j + 1)}))
        if  i < len(I) - 1 and I[i+1][j] != 8:
          O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({(i, j - 1)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through grid:** This version iterates directly through each cell of the grid.
2. **Check for '8' and boundaries:** When it encounters an '8', it checks if it's at the top or bottom boundary of its object by comparing its value with the cells above and below.
3. **Fill adjacent cells:** If it's a boundary cell, it fills the cell to its right or left with '1' accordingly.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  new_cells = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if index(I, (i, j + 1)) != 8 and index(I, (i, j - 1)) != 8:
        new_cells.add((i, j))
  O = fill(I, 1, frozenset(new_cells))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions, this identifies the '8'-valued objects.
2. **Find In-Between Cells:**  It iterates through the cells of each object and checks if the cells to the left and right are not '8'. If true, it marks this cell as a `new_cell`.
3. **Fill New Cells:** Finally, it fills all the `new_cells` with '1'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_right = shift(asobject(I), (0, 1))
  shifted_left = shift(asobject(I), (0, -1))
  intersection_right = toindices(intersection(shifted_right, asobject(I)))
  intersection_left = toindices(intersection(shifted_left, asobject(I)))
  O = fill(I, 1, intersection_right - intersection_left)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift and Intersect:** This version cleverly uses shifts and intersections. It shifts the entire grid (converted to an object) to the right and left. Then, it finds the intersection of these shifted objects with the original object, which gives the cells that have '8' on at least one side.
2. **Subtract Intersections:**  Subtracting the left intersection from the right intersection leaves only the cells that are on the right edge of '8' objects.
3. **Fill Target Cells:** Finally, it fills these target cells with '1'.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and power of the provided DSL.
