## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying cells diagonally adjacent to cells with the value '8' and changing their values to '1'. The original '8' cells remain unchanged.

**Example:**

Input Grid:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Output Grid:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 1 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 1 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices_8 = ofcolor(I, 8)
  target_indices = mfilter(lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]), 
                           mapply(ineighbors, indices_8))
  O = paint(I, recolor(1, target_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `indices_8 = ofcolor(I, 8)`: Identifies the indices of all cells with the value '8'.
2. `target_indices = ...`: 
    - `mapply(ineighbors, indices_8)`: Finds all diagonally adjacent cells to the '8' cells.
    - `mfilter(...)`: Filters out any indices that fall outside the grid boundaries.
3. `O = paint(I, recolor(1, target_indices))`: Creates a copy of the input grid (`I`) and changes the color of cells at `target_indices` to '1'.
4. Returns the modified grid (`O`).


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = [[I[i][j] for j in range(w)] for i in range(h)]
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == 8:
        for di, dj in [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]:
          ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
          if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w:
            O[ni][nj] = 1
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a copy of the input grid (`O`) as a list of lists.
2. Iterates through each cell in the input grid.
3. If the cell value is '8', it iterates through its diagonal neighbors.
4. For each valid neighbor (within grid boundaries), it sets the corresponding cell in the output grid to '1'.
5. Converts the list of lists back to a tuple of tuples (grid format) and returns the result.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grids = [shift(asobject(I), d) for d in [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]]
  overlay = I
  for g in shifted_grids:
    overlay = cellwise(overlay, [[v if (i,j) not in toindices(g) else 1 for j, v in enumerate(row)] for i, row in enumerate(overlay)], 0)
  return overlay
```

**Explanation:**

1. `shifted_grids = ...`: Creates four shifted versions of the input grid, each diagonally shifted by one unit.
2. `overlay = I`: Initializes the overlay grid with the input grid.
3. Iterates through each shifted grid and applies `cellwise` with the overlay.
4. `cellwise(...)`: For each cell, if the corresponding cell in the shifted grid is not empty (i.e., has been shifted), it sets the overlay cell to '1'; otherwise, keeps the original value.
5. Returns the final overlay grid.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, True, False)
  target_indices = set()
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 8:
      for _, (i, j) in obj:
        target_indices.update((i + di, j + dj) for di, dj in [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)])
  target_indices = mfilter(lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]), target_indices)
  return paint(I, recolor(1, target_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objs = objects(I, False, True, False)`: Extracts all objects from the input grid, including diagonal connections.
2. Iterates through each object:
   - If the object's color is '8', it iterates through its cells and adds the indices of their diagonal neighbors to `target_indices`.
3. `target_indices = mfilter(...)`: Removes any indices outside the grid boundaries.
4. `return paint(I, recolor(1, target_indices))`: Paints the cells at the `target_indices` with '1' on a copy of the input grid and returns the result.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 8:
        O = paint(O, {(1, (i+di, j+dj)) for di, dj in [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)] if 0 <= i+di < len(I) and 0 <= j+dj < len(I[0])})
      O[i][j] = val
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `O = canvas(0, shape(I))`: Creates an empty canvas (`O`) with the same dimensions as the input grid (`I`).
2. Iterates through each cell in the input grid.
3. If a cell contains '8', it calculates the indices of its valid diagonal neighbors (within grid boundaries).
4. It then paints these neighbor indices with '1' on the canvas `O`.
5. Finally, it directly copies the current cell value from the input grid to the canvas.
6. Returns the final canvas `O`.

These program versions demonstrate various approaches to achieve the desired transformation, utilizing different DSL functions and logic. Each version accomplishes the task while maintaining distinct code structures and function combinations.
