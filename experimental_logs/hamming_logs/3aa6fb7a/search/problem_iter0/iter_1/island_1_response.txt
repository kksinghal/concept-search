## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the cells directly adjacent (not diagonally) to the object formed by the digit '8' and changing their value to '1'. The original object remains unchanged.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- The '8' object has adjacent '0' cells at positions (1,2), (4,4).
- These cells are changed to '1' in the output grid.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- The '8' object has adjacent '0' cells at positions (1,4), (2,3), (5,3), (6,3).
- These cells are changed to '1' in the output grid. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions utilizing the provided DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  eights = ofcolor(I, 8) # Find all indices of '8' in the grid
  neighbors_of_eights = mpapply(dneighbors, eights, eights) # Find all direct neighbors of '8'
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbors_of_eights) # Fill the neighbor indices with '1'
  return O # Return the transformed grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`eights = ofcolor(I, 8)`:** Identifies the indices of all cells containing the value '8'.
2. **`neighbors_of_eights = mpapply(dneighbors, eights, eights)`:**  Applies the `dneighbors` function to each index in `eights`, finding all directly adjacent neighbors. The `mpapply` function then merges the resulting sets into a single set of indices.
3. **`O = fill(I, 1, neighbors_of_eights)`:**  Fills the cells at the identified neighbor indices with the value '1' in a copy of the input grid `I`.
4. **`return O`:**  Returns the transformed grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)  # Extract the object formed by '8'
  neighbors_indices = difference(backdrop(obj), toindices(obj)) # Find indices in bounding box but not part of the object
  filtered_neighbors = intersection(neighbors_indices, asindices(I)) # Keep only valid indices within grid boundaries
  O = fill(I, 1, filtered_neighbors)  # Fill the neighbor cells with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)`:**  Extracts the object formed by '8' from the input grid.
2. **`neighbors_indices = difference(backdrop(obj), toindices(obj))`:** Calculates the difference between the indices in the object's bounding box and the object's indices, effectively finding the surrounding cells.
3. **`filtered_neighbors = intersection(neighbors_indices, asindices(I))`:** Ensures that only valid indices within the grid's boundaries are considered.
4. **`O = fill(I, 1, filtered_neighbors)`:**  Fills the cells at the filtered neighbor indices with '1'.
5. **`return O`:** Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = objects(I, True, False, False) # Get all objects in the grid
  obj_8 = extract(obj, lambda x: color(x) == 8) # Find the object with color '8'
  neighbors_cells = mfilter(obj_8, lambda cell: index(I, add(cell[1], UP)) != 8 and 0 <= add(cell[1], UP)[0] < len(I))  
  neighbors_cells = combine(neighbors_cells, mfilter(obj_8, lambda cell: index(I, add(cell[1], DOWN)) != 8 and 0 <= add(cell[1], DOWN)[0] < len(I)))
  neighbors_cells = combine(neighbors_cells, mfilter(obj_8, lambda cell: index(I, add(cell[1], RIGHT)) != 8 and 0 <= add(cell[1], RIGHT)[1] < len(I[0])))
  neighbors_cells = combine(neighbors_cells, mfilter(obj_8, lambda cell: index(I, add(cell[1], LEFT)) != 8 and 0 <= add(cell[1], LEFT)[1] < len(I[0])))
  O = paint(I, recolor(1, toindices(neighbors_cells)))  # Paint the neighbor cells with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = objects(I, True, False, False)`:**  Extracts all objects from the grid.
2. **`obj_8 = extract(obj, lambda x: color(x) == 8)`:**  Finds the object with the color '8'.
3. **`neighbors_cells = ...`:**  This part iterates through each direction (UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT) and adds neighboring cells that are not part of the '8' object and are within the grid boundaries.
4. **`O = paint(I, recolor(1, toindices(neighbors_cells)))`:** Recolors the identified neighbor cells to '1' and paints them onto the grid.
5. **`return O`:** Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = objects(I, True, False, False)
  target_object = extract(obj, lambda x: color(x) == 8)
  shifted_objects = rapply([rbind(shift, UP), rbind(shift, DOWN), rbind(shift, LEFT), rbind(shift, RIGHT)], target_object)
  neighbor_cells =  mpapply(lambda obj, shifted_obj: difference(toindices(shifted_obj), toindices(obj)),  target_object, shifted_objects)
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbor_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = objects(I, True, False, False)`:** Extracts all objects from the grid.
2. **`target_object = extract(obj, lambda x: color(x) == 8)`:** Identifies the object with the color '8'.
3. **`shifted_objects = ...`:** Creates shifted copies of the target object in all four directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).
4. **`neighbor_cells = ...`:**  Finds the indices present in the shifted objects but not in the original object, representing the neighboring cells.
5. **`O = fill(I, 1, neighbor_cells)`:**  Fills the identified neighbor cells with '1'.
6. **`return O`:** Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = toindices(extract(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda x: color(x) == 8))  # Get indices of the '8' object
  shifted_objs = apply(lambda direction: shift(obj8, direction), [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT])  # Shift object in all directions
  neighbor_indices = mfilter(shifted_objs, lambda obj: len(intersection(obj, obj8)) == 0 and len(intersection(obj, asindices(I))) > 0) # Filter valid neighbors
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbor_indices)  # Fill neighbor cells with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj8 = ...`:**  Extracts the indices of the object formed by '8'.
2. **`shifted_objs = ...`:**  Creates shifted versions of the '8' object's indices in all four directions.
3. **`neighbor_indices = ...`:**  Filters the shifted indices to keep only those that are not part of the original object and fall within the grid's boundaries.
4. **`O = fill(I, 1, neighbor_indices)`:**  Fills the valid neighbor cells with '1'.
5. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.

These five program versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL. Each version utilizes a different combination of functions, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for spatial reasoning tasks.
