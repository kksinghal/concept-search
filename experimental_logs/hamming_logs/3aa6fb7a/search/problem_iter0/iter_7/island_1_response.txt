## Transformation Analysis:

The task is to identify and mark the cells directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to an object with color '8' in the input grid, but only if the neighbor cell is initially '0'.

**Example:**

* **Input:** A cell with value '8'.
* **Output:** The cell remains '8', and any adjacent cells with value '0' are changed to '1'.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated", each with an explanation of its logic:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8)  # Extract '8' object
  neighbors_indices = mfilter(
    prapply(lambda cell, d: add(cell, d), toindices(obj8), [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]), # Generate potential neighbors
    lambda cell: 0 <= cell[0] < len(I) and 0 <= cell[1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, cell) == 0 # Filter valid & '0' neighbors
  )
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbors_indices) # Fill valid neighbor cells with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '8' object:** Identify and extract the object consisting of cells with value '8'.
2. **Generate potential neighbors:** Calculate the indices of all potential neighbor cells by shifting the '8' object indices in all four directions (up, down, left, right).
3. **Filter valid & '0' neighbors:** Keep only the neighbor indices that fall within the grid boundaries and correspond to cells with value '0' in the input grid.
4. **Fill valid neighbor cells with '1':** Modify the input grid by changing the value of the filtered neighbor cells to '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8)  # Extract '8' object
  neighbor_cells = mfilter(
      mapply(lambda d: shift(toindices(obj8), d), [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]),
      lambda cell: 0 <= cell[0] < len(I) and 0 <= cell[1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, cell) == 0
  )
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbor_cells)  # Fill valid neighbor cells with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '8' object:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Generate shifted indices:** Shift the '8' object indices in all four directions.
3. **Filter valid & '0' neighbor indices:** Same as Version 1.
4. **Fill valid neighbor cells with '1':** Same as Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  marked = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 8:
        for di, dj in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
          ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
          if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] == 0:
            marked = fill(marked, 1, {(ni, nj)})
  return marked
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through the grid:** Loop through each cell of the input grid.
2. **Identify '8' cells:** Check if the current cell value is '8'.
3. **Check neighbors:** For each '8' cell, iterate through its four direct neighbors.
4. **Mark valid neighbors:** If a neighbor is within the grid boundaries and has a value of '0', change its value to '1' in the 'marked' grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8) # Extract '8' object
  neighbors_set = mfilter(rapply(lambda d: shift(obj8, d), [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]), lambda obj: len(intersection(toindices(obj), toindices(obj8))) == 0) # Find non-overlapping shifted objects
  neighbor_indices = mfilter(mapply(toindices, neighbors_set), lambda cell: 0 <= cell[0] < len(I) and 0 <= cell[1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, cell) == 0) # Get valid neighbor indices
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbor_indices) # Fill valid neighbors with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '8' object:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Generate shifted objects:** Create four new objects by shifting the '8' object in each direction.
3. **Filter overlapping objects:** Keep only the shifted objects that don't overlap with the original '8' object.
4. **Extract valid neighbor indices:** From the remaining shifted objects, extract indices that fall within the grid boundaries and correspond to cells with value '0'.
5. **Fill valid neighbors with '1':** Same as Version 1.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  neighbors = set()
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 8:
        if i > 0 and I[i-1][j] == 0:
          neighbors.add((i-1, j))
        if i < len(I)-1 and I[i+1][j] == 0:
          neighbors.add((i+1, j))
        if j > 0 and I[i][j-1] == 0:
          neighbors.add((i, j-1))
        if j < len(row)-1 and I[i][j+1] == 0:
          neighbors.add((i, j+1))
  return fill(I, 1, frozenset(neighbors))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** This version directly iterates through the grid, checking for '8's and their neighboring '0's.
2. **Add to Neighbors:** If a neighbor is valid and a '0', its coordinates are added to the `neighbors` set.
3. **Fill:** Finally, the `fill` function marks all the collected neighbor indices in the grid with '1'.

These five versions showcase distinct approaches to achieving the same outcome, utilizing various DSL functions and logical structures. Each version effectively identifies the '8' object and its valid neighboring '0' cells, marking them appropriately to generate the desired output grid.
