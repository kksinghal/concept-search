## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation identifies the outer perimeter cells of each connected object (considering only directly adjacent cells, not diagonals). Then, it changes the color of these perimeter cells to 1 while leaving the internal cells of the object unchanged. 

**Example:**

In Input_0, the '8's form a single connected object. The transformation identifies the outer perimeter cells of this object and changes their values to '1'. The internal '8's remain unchanged.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    # Find all objects
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T) 
    # Find the outer perimeter indices of each object
    perimeter_indices = mapply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), objs)
    # Fill the perimeter indices with 1
    O = fill(I, ONE, perimeter_indices)
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Identifies all connected objects in the grid `I`. `T, F, T` specifies objects are univalued, not diagonally connected, and without background.
2. **`perimeter_indices = mapply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), objs)`**: For each object, it calculates the difference between its bounding box (`backdrop`) and its actual indices (`toindices`), effectively finding the perimeter.
3. **`O = fill(I, ONE, perimeter_indices)`**:  Fills the identified perimeter indices in the original grid `I` with the value `ONE` (which is 1).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find indices of all non-background cells
  fg_indices = toindices(objects(I, T, F, T))
  # Find indices adjacent to non-background cells
  adjacent_indices = mapply(dneighbors, fg_indices)
  # Identify perimeter cells by finding adjacent indices not part of the objects
  perimeter_indices = difference(adjacent_indices, fg_indices)
  # Fill perimeter cells with 1
  O = fill(I, ONE, perimeter_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fg_indices = toindices(objects(I, T, F, T))`**:  Gets the indices of all non-background cells by finding all objects and extracting their indices.
2. **`adjacent_indices = mapply(dneighbors, fg_indices)`**: Finds all indices directly adjacent to the non-background cells.
3. **`perimeter_indices = difference(adjacent_indices, fg_indices)`**:  Identifies perimeter indices by keeping only the adjacent indices that are not part of the original object cells.
4. **`O = fill(I, ONE, perimeter_indices)`**: Fills the identified perimeter indices with 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Create a canvas of the same size as the input, filled with 1s
  O = canvas(ONE, shape(I))
  # Find all objects
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  # Fill the area covered by objects in the new canvas with the original values
  O = mapply(lambda obj: paint(O, obj), objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(ONE, shape(I))`**: Creates a new grid `O` with the same dimensions as input `I`, filled entirely with 1s.
2. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`**:  Identifies all connected objects in the input grid `I`.
3. **`O = mapply(lambda obj: paint(O, obj), objs)`**:  Paints each object from the input grid onto the new canvas `O`. This overwrites the 1s with the object's original values, effectively leaving only the perimeter as 1s.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find all object indices
  obj_indices = toindices(objects(I, T, F, T))
  # Check each cell in the grid
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  h, w = shape(I)
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      # If a cell is background and has a directly adjacent non-background cell, mark it as 1
      if (i,j) not in obj_indices and len(intersection(dneighbors((i, j)), obj_indices)) > 0:
        O = fill(O, ONE, {(i,j)})
      else:
        O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj_indices = toindices(objects(I, T, F, T))`**:  Extracts the indices of all object cells.
2. **`O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`**: Creates an empty canvas `O` of the same size as the input.
3. **Loop through each cell**: Iterates through each cell of the grid.
    - If the cell is not part of an object (`(i,j) not in obj_indices`) and has at least one directly adjacent neighbor that is part of an object (`len(intersection(dneighbors((i, j)), obj_indices)) > 0`), it's a perimeter cell and is filled with 1.
    - Otherwise, the cell takes the original value from the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Define a function to check if a cell is on the perimeter of an object
  def is_perimeter(i, j, obj_indices):
    return (i, j) not in obj_indices and len(intersection(dneighbors((i, j)), obj_indices)) > 0
  # Find all object indices
  obj_indices = toindices(objects(I, T, F, T))
  # Apply the is_perimeter function to each cell of the grid
  O = prapply(lambda i, j: ONE if is_perimeter(i, j, obj_indices) else index(I, (i, j)), *shape(I))
  return tuple(totuple(row) for row in totuple(O)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_perimeter` function**:  Defines a helper function to determine if a cell at `(i, j)` is a perimeter cell.  It's the same logic as in Version 4.
2. **`obj_indices = toindices(objects(I, T, F, T))`**: Extracts the indices of all object cells.
3. **`O = prapply(...)`**:  Applies the `is_perimeter` function to every possible cell coordinate generated from the grid's shape using `prapply`. This creates a set of sets, where each inner set represents a row, and each element is either 1 (perimeter) or the original cell value.
4. **`return tuple(totuple(row) for row in totuple(O))`**: Converts the set of sets into the desired grid (tuple of tuples) format. 

These five program versions offer different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL. Each version uses a distinct combination of functions and logic, demonstrating a variety of ways to solve the problem.
