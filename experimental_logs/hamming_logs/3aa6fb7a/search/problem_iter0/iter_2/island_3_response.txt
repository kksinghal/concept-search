## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the rightmost non-background cell of each distinct object (connected same-valued cells) and coloring the cell to its left with '1'.

**Input_0 Example:**

* The input grid has a single object formed by the digit '8'. 
* The rightmost '8's are at positions (2,2), (3,5) and (4,6).
* The transformation colors the cells left of these positions, (2,1), (3,4) and (4,5), with '1'.

**Input_1 Example:**

* The input has two separate '8' objects.
* The rightmost cells of each object are identified and the cells to their left are colored with '1'.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  right_edges = mpapply(lambda obj: frozenset({(i, j - 1) for (v, (i, j)) in obj if j == rightmost(obj)}), objs)
  return fill(I, 1, right_edges)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` isolates objects formed by connected same-value cells excluding the background.
2. **Find Right Edges:** `mpapply` iterates through each object. For each object, it finds cells at the rightmost column (`j == rightmost(obj)`) and creates a set of their left neighbors by decrementing their column index (`(i, j-1)`).
3. **Fill Cells:** `fill(I, 1, right_edges)` colors the identified cells with '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0,-1)), objs)
  right_edges =  mpapply(lambda obj, shifted_obj: toindices(intersection(obj, shifted_obj)), objs, shifted_objs) 
  return fill(I, 1, right_edges)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Shift Left:** `shifted_objs` shifts each object one cell to the left.
3. **Find Intersections:** `intersection(obj, shifted_obj)` finds common cells between the original and shifted object, representing the right edges.
4. **Fill Cells:** Same as Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  def find_right_edge_cells(obj):
    return frozenset((v, (i, j - 1)) for (v, (i, j)) in obj if j == rightmost(obj))
  right_edge_objs = mapply(find_right_edge_cells, objs)
  return paint(I, right_edge_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Find Right Edge Cells:** `find_right_edge_cells` function finds cells at the rightmost column of each object and includes their color information along with coordinates shifted one position to the left.
3. **Paint Right Edges:** `paint(I, right_edge_objs)` directly paints the identified cells onto the input grid, automatically replacing the original color with '1' (as implied by the provided examples).

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_object(obj):
    j_max = rightmost(obj)
    return frozenset((i, j - 1) for (i, j) in toindices(obj) if j == j_max)
  right_edges = mfilter(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), process_object)
  return fill(I, 1, right_edges) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Process Objects:** The `process_object` function identifies the rightmost column (`j_max`) of an object and returns the indices of cells immediately to the left of the rightmost cells.
2. **Filter and Merge:** `mfilter` applies `process_object` to each object and merges the resulting sets of indices into `right_edges`.
3. **Fill Cells:** Similar to previous versions, it fills the `right_edges` with '1'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_edge_condition(v, i, j, grid):
    return j < len(grid[0]) - 1 and grid[i][j + 1] != v and grid[i][j] != mostcolor(grid)
  right_edges = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0])) if right_edge_condition(I[i][j], i, j, I))
  return fill(I, 1, right_edges)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Right Edge Condition:**  The function `right_edge_condition` checks if a cell is a right edge by verifying:
    * It's not on the last column (`j < len(grid[0]) - 1`).
    * The cell to its right has a different value (`grid[i][j + 1] != v`).
    * The current cell is not the background color (`grid[i][j] != mostcolor(grid)`).
2. **Find Right Edges:** It iterates through all cells and adds those satisfying `right_edge_condition` to the `right_edges` set.
3. **Fill Cells:**  Fills the identified `right_edges` with '1'.

These are just a few examples, and many other variations using different DSL functions or logic are possible. The key is to effectively identify the rightmost non-background cells of each object and color the cell to their left.
