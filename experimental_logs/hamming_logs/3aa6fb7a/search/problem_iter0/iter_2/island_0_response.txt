## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying cells with the value '8' in the input grid and changing the color of their diagonally adjacent cells (excluding the cells outside the grid boundary) to '1'. The original '8' cells remain unchanged.

**Example:**

```
Input:       Output:
0 8 0        0 8 1 
0 0 0  --->  0 1 0
0 0 8        0 0 8
```

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 8:
        for di, dj in [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]:
          if 0 <= i+di < len(I) and 0 <= j+dj < len(I[0]):
            O = fill(O, 1, {(i + di, j + dj)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Iterate through each cell in the input grid `I`.
2.  If the cell value is '8', get its four diagonal neighbors.
3.  For each valid diagonal neighbor (within the grid boundary), fill the corresponding cell in the output grid `O` with '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices_8 = ofcolor(I, 8)
  target_indices = set()
  for i, j in indices_8:
    target_indices.update((i + di, j + dj) for di, dj in [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)])
  target_indices = frozenset((i, j) for i, j in target_indices if 0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0]))
  return paint(I, recolor(1, target_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Get indices of all cells with value '8' using `ofcolor`.
2.  For each '8' index, calculate its diagonal neighbor indices and add them to `target_indices`.
3.  Filter out invalid indices (outside the grid) from `target_indices`.
4.  Paint the output grid by recoloring the `target_indices` to '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, j in asindices(I):
    if I[i][j] == 8:
      for di, dj in [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]:
        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
        if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]):
          O = fill(O, 1, {(ni, nj)})
    else:
      O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Create a blank canvas `O` with the same shape as the input grid.
2.  Iterate through all cell indices of the input grid.
3.  If the cell value is '8', calculate diagonal neighbors and fill them with '1' in the output grid.
4.  Otherwise, copy the cell value from the input grid to the output grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(1, 
    frozenset((i + di, j + dj) for i, j in ofcolor(I, 8) 
    for di, dj in [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)] 
    if 0 <= i + di < len(I) and 0 <= j + dj < len(I[0]))))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  This version combines multiple steps into a single line for conciseness.
2.  It first identifies indices of '8' cells, then calculates their valid diagonal neighbors.
3.  Finally, it paints the output grid by recoloring those neighbor indices to '1'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(1, mfilter(lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]),
                                mapply(ineighbors, ofcolor(I, 8)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version further improves conciseness using `mfilter` and `mapply`.
2. It first gets indices of '8' cells, then calculates their diagonal neighbors using `mapply` and `ineighbors`.
3. Finally, it uses `mfilter` to keep only valid indices and paints the output grid by recoloring those indices to '1'.

These programs represent five different approaches using various combinations of DSL functions, achieving the same transformation logic. You can choose any of them for the "Program_to_be_generated" code.
