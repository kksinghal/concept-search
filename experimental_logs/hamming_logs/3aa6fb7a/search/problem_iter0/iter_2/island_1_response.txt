## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify the direct neighbors of the object composed of the digit '8' and replace their values with '1' while leaving the rest of the grid unchanged. 

**Example:**

In Input_0, the '8' object has the following neighbors:

* (1, 2) - Right of the topmost '8'
* (4, 3) - Left of the bottommost '8'

These locations are filled with '1' in the Output_0, while the rest of the grid remains identical to Input_0. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  eights = toindices(extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8)) # Find all indices of the '8' object
  shifted_objects = rapply(lambda direction: shift(eights, direction), [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]) # Shift indices in all directions
  neighbor_indices = mfilter(shifted_objects, lambda obj: len(intersection(obj, eights)) == 0 and len(intersection(obj, asindices(I))) > 0) # Filter valid neighbors
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbor_indices)  # Fill neighbor cells with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`eights = toindices(extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8))`**: This line identifies the object made of '8's and extracts its indices. 
2. **`shifted_objects = rapply(lambda direction: shift(eights, direction), [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT])`**: This line shifts the '8' object's indices up, down, left, and right, generating potential neighbor locations.
3. **`neighbor_indices = mfilter(shifted_objects, lambda obj: len(intersection(obj, eights)) == 0 and len(intersection(obj, asindices(I))) > 0)`**: This line filters out invalid neighbors. A valid neighbor shouldn't be part of the original '8' object and should fall within the grid boundaries.
4. **`O = fill(I, 1, neighbor_indices)`**: This line fills the identified neighbor indices with '1' in a copy of the input grid. 
5. **`return O`**: The modified grid is returned as the output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8) # Extract the '8' object
  neighbors_cells = mfilter(toindices(obj8), lambda cell: index(I, add(cell, UP)) != 8 and 0 <= add(cell, UP)[0] < len(I)) # Find upper neighbors
  neighbors_cells = combine(neighbors_cells, mfilter(toindices(obj8), lambda cell: index(I, add(cell, DOWN)) != 8 and 0 <= add(cell, DOWN)[0] < len(I))) # Find lower neighbors
  neighbors_cells = combine(neighbors_cells, mfilter(toindices(obj8), lambda cell: index(I, add(cell, RIGHT)) != 8 and 0 <= add(cell, RIGHT)[1] < len(I[0]))) # Find right neighbors
  neighbors_cells = combine(neighbors_cells, mfilter(toindices(obj8), lambda cell: index(I, add(cell, LEFT)) != 8 and 0 <= add(cell, LEFT)[1] < len(I[0]))) # Find left neighbors
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbors_cells) # Fill neighbor cells with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8)`**: Extracts the '8' object from the input grid.
2. **`neighbors_cells = ...`**: This section iteratively identifies neighbors in each direction (up, down, left, right) using `mfilter` and combines them using `combine`.
3. **`O = fill(I, 1, neighbors_cells)`**: Fills the identified neighbor cells with '1'.
4. **`return O`**: Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = objects(I, True, False, False)
  target_object = toindices(extract(obj, lambda x: color(x) == 8))
  neighbor_cells =  mpapply(lambda direction: difference(toindices(shift(target_object, direction)), target_object),  [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT])
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbor_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = objects(I, True, False, False)`**: Extracts all objects from the input grid.
2. **`target_object = toindices(extract(obj, lambda x: color(x) == 8))`**: Extracts the indices of the '8' object.
3. **`neighbor_cells =  mpapply(lambda direction: difference(toindices(shift(target_object, direction)), target_object),  [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT])`**: This line calculates the neighbor cells by shifting the target object in all four directions, converting the shifted object and original object to indices and then finding the difference between them using `difference` function. This way we can find the neighbor cells.
4. **`O = fill(I, 1, neighbor_cells)`**: This line fills the neighbor cells with '1'.
5. **`return O`**: This line returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  eights_obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8)
  neighbors_indices =  difference(mpapply(lambda d: toindices(shift(eights_obj, d)), [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]), toindices(eights_obj))
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbors_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`eights_obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8)`**: This line extracts the object containing the digit '8'.
2. **`neighbors_indices =  difference(mpapply(lambda d: toindices(shift(eights_obj, d)), [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]), toindices(eights_obj))`**: This line calculates the neighbor indices by shifting the '8' object in each direction, converting them to indices, and then finding the difference between the combined shifted indices and the original object's indices.
3. **`O = fill(I, 1, neighbors_indices)`**: This line fills the identified neighbor indices in the input grid with the digit '1'.
4. **`return O`**: Returns the modified grid.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = toindices(extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8))
  neighbor_cells = set()
  for cell in obj8:
    for d in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]:
      neighbor = add(cell, d)
      if neighbor not in obj8 and 0 <= neighbor[0] < len(I) and 0 <= neighbor[1] < len(I[0]):
        neighbor_cells.add(neighbor)
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbor_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj8 = toindices(extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8))`**: This extracts the indices of all cells belonging to the '8' object.
2. **`neighbor_cells = set()`**: Initializes an empty set to store the neighbor cell indices.
3. **`for cell in obj8: ...`**: Iterates through each cell of the '8' object.
4. **`for d in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]: ...`**: For each cell, it checks for neighbors in all four directions.
5. **`neighbor = add(cell, d)`**: Calculates the index of the potential neighbor cell.
6. **`if neighbor not in obj8 and 0 <= neighbor[0] < len(I) and 0 <= neighbor[1] < len(I[0]):`**: Checks if the potential neighbor is a valid neighbor - not part of the original '8' object and within the grid boundaries.
7. **`neighbor_cells.add(neighbor)`**: Adds the valid neighbor to the `neighbor_cells` set.
8. **`O = fill(I, 1, neighbor_cells)`**: Fills all the identified neighbor cells in the input grid with '1'.
9. **`return O`**: Returns the modified grid as output.
