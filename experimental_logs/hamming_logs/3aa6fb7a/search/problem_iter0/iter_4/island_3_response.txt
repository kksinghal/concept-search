## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify the rightmost edge of each distinct object formed by the digit '8' and place a '1' to the right of that edge. It's important to note that the transformation only applies to objects, meaning connected components of '8's, not individual '8' digits that are isolated.

**Input_0:**

- The top-most '8' object has a single '1' placed to its right.
- The middle '8' object has two '1's placed to its right, mirroring the two rightmost edges of the object.
- The bottom '8' has a single '1' placed to its right.

**Input_1:**

-  The transformation logic remains consistent, with '1's placed to the right of the rightmost edges of each '8' object.

## Code Improvement:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  right_edges = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: {(i, j + 1) for (v, (i, j)) in obj if j == rightmost(obj)})
  return fill(I, 1, right_edges)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`**: Identifies all distinct '8' objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`right_edges = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: {(i, j + 1) for (v, (i, j)) in obj if j == rightmost(obj)})`**: For each object, the lambda function identifies the rightmost cells and creates a set of indices representing the positions immediately to the right of those cells. `mfilter` then merges these sets into a single set `right_edges`.
3. **`return fill(I, 1, right_edges)`**:  Fills the input grid `I` with '1' at the indices specified by `right_edges`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(1, mfilter(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), lambda obj: {(i, j + 1) for (v, (i, j)) in obj if j == rightmost(obj)})))
```

**Explanation:**

This version achieves the same outcome as version 1 but condenses the code into a single line. It recolors the identified right edges to '1' and then paints them onto the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  return fill(I, 1, merge({{(i, j + 1) for (v, (i, j)) in obj if j == rightmost(obj)} for obj in objs}))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes set comprehension to achieve the same result as the previous versions. It iterates through each object, identifies its rightmost edges, and then merges the resulting sets of indices before filling them with '1'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
      if j == rightmost(obj):
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version takes a more iterative approach. It iterates through each object and its cells. If a cell is on the rightmost edge of the object, it fills the position to its right in a copy of the input grid (`O`) with '1'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(1, merge({frozenset({(i, j + 1) for (v, (i, j)) in obj if j == rightmost(obj)}) for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)}))) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version further condenses the code by combining the recoloring and painting steps within a single line. It uses nested set comprehension to identify and recolor the right edges before painting them onto the input grid.
