## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the object formed by the digit '8' and aims to change its directly adjacent cells to '1'. 

**Specifics:**

* **Direct Adjacency:** Only cells directly above, below, left, or right of an '8' cell are affected. Diagonal adjacency is not considered.
* **Grid Boundaries:** The transformation respects grid boundaries. Cells outside the grid are ignored.
* **Other Objects:** The transformation doesn't affect other objects or the background.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8) # Extract '8' object
  neighbor_indices = mfilter(
      prapply(lambda cell, d: add(cell, d), toindices(obj8), [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]), # Generate potential neighbors
      lambda cell: 0 <= cell[0] < len(I) and 0 <= cell[1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, cell) != 8 # Filter for valid & non-'8' neighbors
  )
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbor_indices) # Fill valid neighbor cells with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '8' Object:** `extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8)` identifies and extracts the object composed of '8's.
2. **Generate Potential Neighbors:** `prapply` applies `add` to each cell of the '8' object with all four directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to generate potential neighbor cells.
3. **Filter Valid Neighbors:**  `mfilter` keeps only cells that are:
    * Within grid boundaries: `0 <= cell[0] < len(I) and 0 <= cell[1] < len(I[0])`
    * Not part of the '8' object: `index(I, cell) != 8`
4. **Fill Neighbors:** `fill(I, 1, neighbor_indices)` fills the filtered neighbor cells with the value '1'.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  eights = toindices(extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8))
  shifted_neighbors = mapply(lambda d: shift(eights, d), [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT])
  valid_neighbors = intersection(shifted_neighbors, asindices(I))  
  neighbor_indices = difference(valid_neighbors, eights)
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbor_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '8' Indices:** Similar to version 1, but extracts indices directly using `toindices`.
2. **Shift and Merge Neighbors:** `mapply` applies `shift` to the '8' indices with all directions and merges the results, creating a set of potential neighbor indices.
3. **Keep Valid Neighbors:** `intersection` filters the neighbor indices to keep only those within the grid boundaries.
4. **Remove Original '8' Cells:** `difference` removes the original '8' cell indices from the neighbor indices.
5. **Fill Neighbors:** Similar to version 1. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8)
  neighbor_cells = mfilter(
      toindices(obj8),
      lambda cell: any(0 <= add(cell, d)[0] < len(I) and 0 <= add(cell, d)[1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, add(cell, d)) != 8 for d in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT])
  )
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbor_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '8' Object:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Filter for Neighbors:** `mfilter` iterates through each cell of the '8' object and checks if any of its direct neighbors:
    * Are within grid boundaries.
    * Don't belong to the '8' object.
3. **Fill Neighbors:** Similar to previous versions.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8)
    neighbors_cells = mfilter(rapply(lambda d: shift(toindices(obj8), d), [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]), lambda indices: len(intersection(indices, toindices(obj8))) == 0 and len(intersection(indices, asindices(I))) > 0)
    O = fill(I, 1, neighbors_cells)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '8' Object:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Generate Shifted Neighbors:** `rapply` applies `shift` with each direction to the indices of the '8' object, generating sets of shifted indices.
3. **Filter Valid Neighbors:** `mfilter` keeps only the sets of shifted indices that:
    * Don't intersect with the original '8' object: `len(intersection(indices, toindices(obj8))) == 0`
    * Have at least one cell within the grid boundaries: `len(intersection(indices, asindices(I))) > 0`
4. **Fill Neighbors:** Similar to previous versions.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8)
    neighbors_cells = difference(merge(apply(lambda d: toindices(shift(obj8, d)), [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT])), toindices(obj8)) 
    valid_neighbors = intersection(neighbors_cells, asindices(I))
    O = fill(I, 1, valid_neighbors)  
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '8' Object:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Shift and Merge Neighbors:**  `apply` shifts the '8' object in all directions, `toindices` gets the indices and `merge` combines the results.
3. **Remove Original '8' Cells:** `difference` removes the indices of the original '8' object from the set of shifted neighbors.
4. **Keep Valid Neighbors:** `intersection` keeps only the neighbor indices that fall within the grid boundaries.
5. **Fill Neighbors:** Similar to previous versions.


These five programs demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing a variety of DSL functions and logical operations. Each version offers a unique perspective on how to solve the problem within the constraints of the DSL.
