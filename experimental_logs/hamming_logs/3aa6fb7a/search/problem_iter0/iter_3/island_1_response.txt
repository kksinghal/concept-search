## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the object formed by the digit '8' in the input grid. The goal is to identify the direct, non-diagonal neighbors of this '8' object and change their values to '1' in the output grid.

**Example:**

In **Input_0**, the '8' object has the following neighbors:

- **(1, 2)** (right neighbor of the topmost '8')
- **(4, 4)** (left neighbor of the bottommost '8') 

These cells are filled with '1' in **Output_0**, while the rest of the grid remains unchanged.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  eights = toindices(extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8)) # Find indices of the '8' object
  neighbor_indices = mfilter(
      eights,
      lambda cell: (index(I, add(cell, UP)) != 8 and 0 <= add(cell, UP)[0] < len(I)) or 
                   (index(I, add(cell, DOWN)) != 8 and 0 <= add(cell, DOWN)[0] < len(I)) or
                   (index(I, add(cell, LEFT)) != 8 and 0 <= add(cell, LEFT)[1] < len(I[0])) or 
                   (index(I, add(cell, RIGHT)) != 8 and 0 <= add(cell, RIGHT)[1] < len(I[0]))
  ) # Filter for valid neighbor cells
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbor_indices)  # Fill neighbor cells with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the '8' object:** Extract the object composed of '8's from the input grid (`objects`, `extract`, `color`).
2. **Find neighbor indices:** For each cell in the '8' object, check if its up, down, left, and right neighbors are within the grid bounds and not part of the '8' object (`mfilter`, `add`, `index`).
3. **Fill neighbor cells:** Fill the identified neighbor cells with the value '1' (`fill`).


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8) # Extract the '8' object
  neighbors_cells = mfilter(rapply(lambda d: shift(toindices(obj8), d), [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]), lambda indices: len(intersection(indices, toindices(obj8))) == 0 and len(intersection(indices, asindices(I))) > 0)
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbors_cells) # Fill neighbor cells with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract the '8' object:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Shift object in all directions:** Shift the '8' object indices up, down, left, and right (`rapply`, `shift`).
3. **Identify valid neighbors:** Filter the shifted indices to keep only those not overlapping with the original '8' object but still within the grid bounds (`mfilter`, `intersection`).
4. **Fill neighbor cells:** Same as version 1.


**Program Version 3:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = toindices(extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8)) # Extract the '8' object indices
  shifted_objects = apply(lambda direction: shift(obj8, direction), [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]) # Shift indices in all directions
  neighbor_indices = mfilter(shifted_objects, lambda obj: len(intersection(obj, obj8)) == 0 and len(intersection(obj, asindices(I))) > 0) # Filter valid neighbors
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbor_indices)  # Fill neighbor cells with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '8' object indices:** Similar to version 2 but directly extracts indices.
2. **Shift indices:** Similar to version 2.
3. **Filter valid neighbors:** Similar to version 2.
4. **Fill neighbor cells:** Same as previous versions.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  eights = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8)  # Extract the '8' object
  neighbor_cells = difference(
      merge(apply(lambda d: toindices(shift(eights, d)), [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT])), # Shift and merge neighboring cells
      toindices(eights)  # Remove original '8' object cells
  )
  valid_neighbors = intersection(neighbor_cells, asindices(I))  # Keep cells within the grid
  O = fill(I, 1, valid_neighbors)  # Fill valid neighbor cells with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract the '8' object:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Shift and merge neighbors:** Shift the '8' object in all directions, convert to indices, and merge into a single set (`apply`, `shift`, `toindices`, `merge`).
3. **Remove original cells:** Remove the original '8' object indices from the merged set (`difference`).
4. **Find valid neighbors:**  Intersect the remaining indices with the grid indices to keep only valid neighbors (`intersection`, `asindices`).
5. **Fill neighbor cells:** Similar to previous versions.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8) # Extract the '8' object
  neighbor_indices = mfilter(prapply(lambda cell, d: add(cell, d), toindices(obj8), [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]), lambda cell: 0 <= cell[0] < len(I) and 0 <= cell[1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, cell) != 8)
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbor_indices)  # Fill neighbor cells with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract the '8' object:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Generate potential neighbor indices:**  Calculate all possible neighbor indices by adding direction vectors to each cell in the '8' object  (`prapply`, `add`).
3. **Filter valid neighbors:**  Keep only indices within the grid bounds and not part of the '8' object (`mfilter`, `index`).
4. **Fill neighbor cells:** Similar to previous versions.

Each program version uses a slightly different approach to achieve the same outcome. 

Remember that these programs are just a few examples, and there might be other valid solutions using different combinations of the DSL functions.
