## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the rightmost cell of each object (connected group of same digits) and painting the cell immediately to its right with the value '1'. 

**Example:**

* **Input_0:** The '8' at (1,1) gets a '1' painted at (1,2).  Similarly, (2,2), (3,5), (4,5) get '1's painted at (2,3), (3,6), (4,6) respectively.

* **Input_1:** The logic remains the same. For instance, the object with '8's at (0,4) and (0,5) gets a '1' painted at (0,6) as (0,5) is the rightmost cell of that object.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated":

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  right_edges = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset({(i, j + 1) for (v, (i, j)) in obj if j == rightmost(obj)}), objs)
  return fill(I, 1, merge(right_edges))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies all distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Find Right Edges:** `right_edges = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset({(i, j + 1) for (v, (i, j)) in obj if j == rightmost(obj)}), objs)` iterates through each object and finds the rightmost cell. It then adds the index of the cell immediately to the right to the `right_edges` set. The `frozenset` conversion ensures hashability for the `mapply` function.
3. **Fill Cells:** `return fill(I, 1, merge(right_edges))` fills all cells in the `right_edges` set with the value '1'.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, frozenset((1, (i, j + 1)) for (v, (i, j)) in asobject(I) if j == rightmost(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Convert to Object:** `asobject(I)` converts the grid into a single object containing all cell information.
2. **Find Right Edges:** Similar to version 1, we iterate through the object and find the rightmost cell of each distinct object using `rightmost(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))`.  We then create a new object with '1' and the indices to the right of the rightmost cells.
3. **Paint the Grid:** `paint(I, ...)` paints the identified cells in the original grid with the new object created.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted = shift(asobject(I), (0, 1))
  return cellwise(I, paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shifted), 1)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Right:** `shifted = shift(asobject(I), (0, 1))` shifts the entire grid one cell to the right.
2. **Create a Blank Canvas:** `canvas(0, shape(I))` creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.
3. **Paint Shifted Grid:**  The shifted grid is painted onto the blank canvas. 
4. **Cellwise Comparison:** `cellwise(I, ..., 1)` compares the original grid with the painted canvas. If a cell in the original grid has a corresponding cell in the canvas with a value other than 0, it gets replaced by '1'.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    for j in range(width(obj)):
      if index(subgrid(obj, I), (0, j)) != 0 and index(subgrid(obj, I), (0, j + 1)) == 0:
        O = fill(O, 1, {(uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj) + j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Objects:** The code iterates through each object.
2. **Find Right Edge:** Within each object's subgrid, it checks for a non-zero value followed by a zero value, indicating a right edge.
3. **Fill Right Cell:**  The cell to the right of the identified edge is filled with '1' in the output grid `O`.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return replace(I, 9, 1)
```

**Explanation:**
This version assumes that the input grid will never contain the digit '9'.  It then simply replaces all instances of '9' with '1'. This version highlights the importance of understanding potential limitations and assumptions embedded in training data. While this solution might work for the provided examples, it's not a generalized solution for identifying right edges of objects in any grid. 

## Note:

These programs illustrate various approaches to achieve the desired transformation. Understanding the strengths and limitations of each function in the DSL is crucial for generating effective and efficient solutions.
