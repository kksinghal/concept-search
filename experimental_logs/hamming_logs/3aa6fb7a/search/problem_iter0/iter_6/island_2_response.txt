## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying cells adjacent to the main object (connected components of the digit 8) and changing their value to 1. The original object and background remain unchanged. 

**Example:**

- **Input_0:**  The 8s form a single object. Cells directly above, below, and to the right of this object are changed to 1.
- **Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0, cells directly adjacent to the 8s (forming two separate objects) are changed to 1.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Identify the object formed by the digit 8
  obj = objects(I, T, F, T)
  # Find all indices adjacent to the object
  adjacent_indices = mapply(dneighbors, mapply(toindices, obj))
  # Create a new object with value 1 at the adjacent indices
  new_obj = recolor(ONE, adjacent_indices)
  # Paint the new object onto the input grid
  O = paint(I, new_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** We use `objects(I, T, F, T)` to find connected components of non-background values (8 in this case). 
2. **Adjacent Indices:**  `mapply(dneighbors, mapply(toindices, obj))` finds all directly adjacent indices to the object.
3. **Create new object:** `recolor(ONE, adjacent_indices)` creates a new object with value 1 at the identified adjacent indices.
4. **Paint the object:** `paint(I, new_obj)` paints the new object onto the original grid, resulting in the desired output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find all indices of the digit 8
  obj_indices = ofcolor(I, EIGHT)
  # Expand the indices to include their direct neighbors
  expanded_indices = mapply(dneighbors, obj_indices)
  # Find the difference between expanded indices and original indices
  adjacent_indices = difference(expanded_indices, obj_indices)
  # Fill the adjacent indices with value 1
  O = fill(I, ONE, adjacent_indices)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find object indices:** We locate all indices of the digit 8 using `ofcolor(I, EIGHT)`.
2. **Expand indices:** `mapply(dneighbors, obj_indices)` expands the set of indices to include their direct neighbors.
3. **Isolate adjacent indices:** `difference(expanded_indices, obj_indices)` removes the original object indices, leaving only the adjacent ones.
4. **Fill adjacent indices:** `fill(I, ONE, adjacent_indices)` fills the identified adjacent indices with the value 1. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    # Find all objects in the grid
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    # Find indices adjacent to each object
    adjacent_to_objs = mapply(lambda obj: delta(backdrop(toindices(obj))), objs)
    # Intersect adjacent indices with grid indices to stay within bounds
    valid_adjacent_indices = intersection(adjacent_to_objs, asindices(I))
    # Fill the valid adjacent indices with 1
    O = fill(I, ONE, valid_adjacent_indices)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find all objects:**  Identify all connected components (objects) in the grid.
2. **Find adjacent indices:** Calculate indices adjacent to each object's bounding box using `delta(backdrop(toindices(obj)))`.
3. **Validate indices:**  Intersect the adjacent indices with the grid's actual indices (`asindices(I)`) to handle edge cases. 
4. **Fill adjacent indices:**  Fill the final set of valid adjacent indices with the value 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    # Define a function to check for 8 in neighboring cells
    def is_adjacent_to_eight(loc):
        return any(index(I, n) == EIGHT for n in dneighbors(loc))
    
    # Apply the function to each cell in the grid
    O = canvas(ONE, shape(I))
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I)):
            if is_adjacent_to_eight((i, j)) and index(I, (i, j)) != EIGHT:
                O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})
            else:
                O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define adjacency check:** A helper function checks if a cell has the digit 8 as a direct neighbor.
2. **Iterate and apply:**  The code iterates through each cell of the grid. If a cell is adjacent to 8 and isn't 8 itself, it's filled with 1. Otherwise, the original cell value is retained.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    # Create a grid initially filled with the background color
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    # Iterate through objects in the grid
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        # Paint the object onto the new grid
        O = paint(O, obj)
        # Paint adjacent cells with 1
        O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize background grid:** A new grid is created, filled with the background color of the input.
2. **Iterate and paint:**  The code iterates through each object (connected component) in the original grid.
3. **Paint object and neighbors:** For each object, it's painted onto the new grid. Then, adjacent cells are calculated and painted with the value 1.

These five versions showcase diverse approaches to achieving the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
