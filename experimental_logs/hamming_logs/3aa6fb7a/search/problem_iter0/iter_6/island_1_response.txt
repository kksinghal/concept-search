## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to identify objects formed by connected '8's in the input grid. Then, it fills the cells directly above, below, left, and right of the '8' object with '1's, as long as these neighboring cells are within the grid boundaries and are not part of the '8' object itself.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8) # Extract '8' object
  neighbor_indices = mfilter(
      prapply(lambda cell, d: add(cell, d), toindices(obj8), [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]), # Generate potential neighbors
      lambda cell: 0 <= cell[0] < len(I) and 0 <= cell[1] < len(I[0]) and cell not in toindices(obj8) # Filter valid & non-'8' neighbors
  )
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbor_indices) # Fill valid neighbor cells with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '8' object:** `extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8)` finds and isolates the object formed by connected '8's in the input grid `I`.
2. **Generate potential neighbors:** `prapply(lambda cell, d: add(cell, d), toindices(obj8), [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT])` generates a set of all potential neighbor cells by adding the four direction vectors (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to each cell index of the '8' object.
3. **Filter valid & non-'8' neighbors:** The `mfilter` function filters the potential neighbors, ensuring they are:
    - Within the grid boundaries (`0 <= cell[0] < len(I)` and `0 <= cell[1] < len(I[0])`)
    - Not part of the '8' object itself (`cell not in toindices(obj8)`)
4. **Fill valid neighbor cells:** `fill(I, 1, neighbor_indices)` fills the remaining valid neighbor cells with the value '1'.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8) # Extract '8' object
  neighbors_set = mfilter(rapply(lambda d: shift(obj8, d), [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]), lambda obj: not intersection(toindices(obj), toindices(obj8))) # Find non-overlapping shifted objects
  neighbor_indices = mfilter(mapply(toindices, neighbors_set), lambda cell: 0 <= cell[0] < len(I) and 0 <= cell[1] < len(I[0])) # Get valid neighbor indices
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbor_indices) # Fill valid neighbors with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '8' object:** Similar to Version 1, this line extracts the '8' object.
2. **Find non-overlapping shifted objects:** This line shifts the entire '8' object in all four directions and keeps only the shifted versions that don't overlap with the original object using `intersection` and `mfilter`.
3. **Get valid neighbor indices:** This line extracts indices from the non-overlapping shifted objects and further filters them to ensure they lie within the grid boundaries.
4. **Fill valid neighbors with '1':** Similar to Version 1, this line fills the valid neighbor cells with '1'.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = toindices(extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8)) # Extract '8' object indices
  valid_neighbors = lambda cell: 0 <= cell[0] < len(I) and 0 <= cell[1] < len(I[0]) and cell not in obj8
  neighbor_indices = mfilter(merge(apply(lambda d: sfilter(apply(lambda cell: add(cell, d), obj8), valid_neighbors), [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT])), identity) # Calculate and filter neighbor indices
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbor_indices) # Fill valid neighbors with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '8' object indices:** Extract the indices of cells belonging to the '8' object.
2. **Define valid neighbor function:** Define a function `valid_neighbors` that checks if a cell is a valid neighbor (within grid boundaries and not part of the '8' object).
3. **Calculate and filter neighbor indices:**
    - For each direction, shift the '8' object indices and filter for valid neighbors.
    - Merge the results from all directions.
    - Use `identity` in `mfilter` to convert nested sets into a single set of valid neighbor indices.
4. **Fill valid neighbors with '1':** Similar to previous versions, fill the valid neighbor cells with '1'.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8) # Extract '8' object
  neighbor_cells = frozenset()
  for cell in toindices(obj8):
    for d in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]:
      neighbor = add(cell, d)
      if 0 <= neighbor[0] < len(I) and 0 <= neighbor[1] < len(I[0]) and neighbor not in toindices(obj8):
        neighbor_cells = neighbor_cells.union(frozenset({neighbor}))
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbor_cells) # Fill valid neighbors with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a loop-based approach to find valid neighbors:

1. **Extract '8' object:** Extract the '8' object.
2. **Iterate and check neighbors:**
    - Loop through each cell of the '8' object.
    - For each cell, calculate its four neighboring cells by adding direction vectors.
    - If a neighbor is within the grid boundaries and not part of the '8' object, add it to the `neighbor_cells` set.
3. **Fill valid neighbors with '1':** Fill the collected `neighbor_cells` with '1'.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 8) # Extract '8' object
  shifted_objects = apply(lambda d: shift(obj8, d), [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]) # Generate shifted objects
  neighbor_indices = mfilter(mapply(toindices, shifted_objects), lambda cell: 0 <= cell[0] < len(I) and 0 <= cell[1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, cell) != 8) # Filter valid neighbor indices
  O = fill(I, 1, neighbor_indices) # Fill valid neighbors with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on generating shifted objects and filtering their indices:

1. **Extract '8' object:** Extract the '8' object.
2. **Generate shifted objects:** Create a set of objects by shifting the '8' object in all four directions.
3. **Filter valid neighbor indices:**
    - Extract indices from all shifted objects.
    - Filter the indices to keep only those within grid boundaries and where the corresponding cell value in the input grid is not '8'.
4. **Fill valid neighbors with '1':** Fill the valid neighbor cells with '1'.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. They utilize various combinations of set operations, filtering, and object manipulation functions to arrive at the same output.
