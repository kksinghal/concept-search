## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects with the color '5' and moving them to a specific row based on the position of the '2' object. The '5' objects are split into left and right halves, which are then moved horizontally in opposite directions.

**Input 0:**

- All '5' objects are moved to the row above the '2' object.
- The left halves of the '5' objects are moved three steps to the left.
- The right halves of the '5' objects are moved three steps to the right.

**Input 1:**

- Similar to Input 0, but the '5' objects are horizontally mirrored before the movement.

**Input 2:**

- Same transformation as Input 1.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program:


### **Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  two_top = uppermost(ofcolor(I, 2)) - 1 # Row above the '2' object
  fives = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5) # Extract '5' objects

  def split_and_move(obj):
    left_half = frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < centerofmass(obj)[1]) # Split at center of mass
    right_half = obj - left_half
    return (shift(left_half, (two_top - lowermost(left_half), -3)),
            shift(right_half, (two_top - lowermost(right_half), 3)))

  moved_halves = mapply(split_and_move, fives)
  return paint(cover(I, recolor(0, ofcolor(I, 5))), merge(moved_halves)) # Clear '5' before painting
```

**Explanation:**

- **Identifies the target row:** `two_top` stores the row index above the '2' object.
- **Extracts '5' objects:** `fives` contains all objects with color '5'.
- **`split_and_move` function:** 
    - Splits each '5' object into left and right halves based on the center of mass.
    - Moves each half to the target row and shifts them horizontally by 3 units in opposite directions.
- **Applies the transformation:** Uses `mapply` to apply `split_and_move` to all '5' objects.
- **Paints the moved objects:** Clears the original '5' objects and paints the transformed objects onto the grid.


### **Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  target_row = uppermost(ofcolor(I, 2)) - 1
  return paint(
    cover(I, recolor(0, ofcolor(I, 5))), # Clear '5' objects
    mapply(
      lambda obj: shift(
        obj, (target_row - uppermost(obj), -3 if leftmost(obj) < len(I[0]) // 2 else 3)
      ),
      colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5)
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

- **Calculates target row:** `target_row` is the row above the '2' object.
- **Clears original '5' objects:** Uses `cover` to replace '5's with the background color.
- **`lambda` function for shifting:** 
    - Calculates the vertical shift based on the object's top row and the target row.
    - Determines the horizontal shift direction based on the object's leftmost column.
- **Applies the transformation and paints:** Similar to version 1, but uses a `lambda` function for conciseness.


### **Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  two_top = uppermost(ofcolor(I, 2)) 
  return paint(
    cover(I, recolor(0, ofcolor(I, 5))), # Clear existing '5' objects
    merge(
      apply(
        lambda obj: shift(obj, (two_top - lowermost(obj) - 1, -3)),
        colorfilter(objects(lefthalf(I), T, F, T), 5)
      ),
      apply(
        lambda obj: shift(obj, (two_top - lowermost(obj) - 1, 3)),
        colorfilter(objects(righthalf(I), T, F, T), 5)
      )
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

- **Determines target row:** `two_top` is the row index of the '2' object.
- **Clears original '5's:** Removes existing '5' objects.
- **Splits processing based on grid halves:** 
    - Processes the left and right halves of the grid separately using `lefthalf` and `righthalf`.
    - Applies the horizontal shift in the appropriate direction for each half.
- **Combines and paints:** Merges the transformed objects from both halves and paints them onto the grid.


### **Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  fives = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5)
  return paint(
    cover(I, recolor(0, ofcolor(I, 5))), # Clear '5' objects first
    mapply(
      lambda obj: shift(obj, (uppermost(ofcolor(I, 2)) - lowermost(obj) - 1, 
                              3 if rightmost(obj) > centerofmass(ofcolor(I, 2))[1] else -3)), 
      fives
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

- **Finds '5' objects:** `fives` stores all objects with color '5'.
- **Clears existing '5's:** Removes the original '5' objects from the grid.
- **`lambda` function for movement:**
    - Calculates the vertical shift based on the object's bottom row and the row above the '2' object.
    - Determines horizontal shift direction based on the object's position relative to the '2' object's center of mass.
- **Applies the transformation:** Uses `mapply` to apply the `lambda` function to all '5' objects.
- **Paints the transformed objects:** Paints the moved objects onto the cleared grid.


### **Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  two_top = uppermost(ofcolor(I, 2))
  five_objects = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5)

  def transform_object(obj):
    middle = width(obj) // 2
    left_part = frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < leftmost(obj) + middle)
    right_part = obj - left_part
    return (shift(left_part, (two_top - lowermost(left_part) - 1, -3)), 
            shift(right_part, (two_top - lowermost(right_part) - 1,  3)))

  transformed_objects = mapply(transform_object, five_objects)
  return paint(cover(I, recolor(0, ofcolor(I, 5))), merge(transformed_objects)) 
```

**Explanation:**

- **Identifies target row:** `two_top` stores the row above the '2' object.
- **Extracts '5' objects:** `five_objects` holds all objects with color '5'.
- **`transform_object` function:**
    - Divides each '5' object into left and right parts based on its width.
    - Moves each part to the target row and shifts them horizontally by 3 units in opposite directions.
- **Applies transformation and paints:**
    - Uses `mapply` to apply `transform_object` to all '5' objects.
    - Clears the original '5' objects and paints the transformed objects onto the grid.

These five program versions showcase different approaches to achieving the same transformation, using various DSL functions and logical structures. Each version provides a distinct and valid solution to the problem.
