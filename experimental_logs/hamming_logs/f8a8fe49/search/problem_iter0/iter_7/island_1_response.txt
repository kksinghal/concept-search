## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the object made of '5's and moving it to a new location based on the object made of '2's. The '5' object retains its shape but is reoriented based on its original orientation and relative position to the '2' object.

* **If the '5' object is taller than it is wide:** It's moved to the left of the '2' object.
* **If the '5' object is wider than it is tall:** It's moved above the '2' object.

Let's break down the specific movements for each example:

**Example 0:** The '5' object is wider than tall and located below the '2' object. It's moved to be above the '2' object, maintaining its original orientation.

**Example 1:** The '5' object is taller than wide and located to the right of the '2' object. It's moved to the left of the '2' object and rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

**Example 2:** The '5' object is taller than wide and located below the '2' object. It's moved to the left of the '2' object and rotated 90 degrees clockwise.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions for the "Program_to_be_generated":

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    twos = first(colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 2))
    fives = first(colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 5))
    if portrait(fives):
        offset = (-height(fives) - 1, 0)
        moved_fives = shift(rot90(fives), add(ulcorner(twos), offset))
    else:
        offset = (0, -width(fives) - 1)
        moved_fives = shift(fives, add(ulcorner(twos), offset))
    return paint(cover(I, fives), moved_fives) 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify objects:**  Find the objects composed of '2's and '5's.
2.  **Determine orientation:** Check if the '5' object is taller than wide (`portrait(fives)`).
3.  **Calculate offset:** Based on the orientation, calculate the offset to position the '5' object either to the left (taller) or above (wider) the '2' object.
4.  **Move and rotate:** Shift the '5' object to the calculated position. Rotate 90 degrees clockwise if it's taller than wide.
5.  **Combine objects:** Paint the moved '5' object onto the input grid where the original '5' object was removed.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  twos = first(colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 2))
  fives = first(colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 5))
  if portrait(fives):
    direction = LEFT
    rotated_fives = rot90(fives)
  else:
    direction = UP
    rotated_fives = fives
  destination = shift(toindices(twos), direction)
  move_vector = gravitate(toindices(rotated_fives), destination)
  return paint(cover(I, fives), shift(rotated_fives, move_vector))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify objects:**  Find the objects composed of '2's and '5's.
2.  **Determine orientation and direction:** Check if the '5' object is taller than wide. If so, set the direction to LEFT and rotate the '5' object 90 degrees clockwise. Otherwise, set the direction to UP.
3.  **Find destination:**  Determine the destination indices for the '5' object based on the chosen direction relative to the '2' object.
4.  **Calculate movement:**  Use `gravitate` to find the necessary movement vector to bring the '5' object adjacent to the '2' object in the chosen direction.
5.  **Combine objects:**  Paint the moved and potentially rotated '5' object onto the input grid where the original '5' object was removed.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  twos = first(colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 2))
  fives = first(colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 5))
  center_twos = center(twos)
  if portrait(fives):
    offset = subtract(center_twos, (height(fives), 0))
    moved_fives = shift(rot90(fives), offset)
  else:
    offset = subtract(center_twos, (0, width(fives)))
    moved_fives = shift(fives, offset)
  return paint(cover(I, fives), moved_fives)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify objects and center:** Find the objects composed of '2's and '5's and calculate the center of the '2' object.
2.  **Determine orientation:**  Check if the '5' object is taller than wide (`portrait(fives)`).
3.  **Calculate offset:** Calculate the offset to position the '5' object either to the left (taller) or above (wider) the '2' object, aligning it with the '2' object's center.
4.  **Move and rotate:** Shift the '5' object to the calculated position. Rotate 90 degrees clockwise if it's taller than wide.
5.  **Combine objects:** Paint the moved '5' object onto the input grid where the original '5' object was removed.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  twos = first(colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 2))
  fives = first(colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 5))
  if portrait(fives):
    new_fives = shift(rot90(fives), subtract(ulcorner(twos), (height(fives), 0)))
  else:
    new_fives = shift(fives, subtract(ulcorner(twos), (0, width(fives))))
  return paint(cover(I, fives), new_fives)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify objects:** Find the objects composed of '2's and '5's.
2.  **Determine orientation:** Check if the '5' object is taller than wide (`portrait(fives)`).
3.  **Calculate new position:** Calculate the new upper-left corner position for the '5' object based on its orientation and the '2' object's upper-left corner.
4.  **Move and rotate:**  Shift the '5' object to the new position, rotating it 90 degrees clockwise if it's taller than wide.
5.  **Combine objects:** Paint the moved '5' object onto the input grid where the original '5' object was removed.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  twos = first(colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 2))
  fives = first(colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 5))
  if height(fives) > width(fives):
    move_vector = (-height(fives) - 1, 0)
    final_fives = shift(rot90(fives), add(ulcorner(twos), move_vector))
  else:
    move_vector = (0, -width(fives) - 1)
    final_fives = shift(fives, add(ulcorner(twos), move_vector))
  return paint(cover(I, fives), final_fives)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify objects:**  Find the objects composed of '2's and '5's.
2.  **Determine orientation:** Check if the height of the '5' object is greater than its width.
3.  **Calculate movement vector:** Based on orientation, calculate the vector to move the '5' object left (if taller) or up (if wider).
4.  **Apply transformation:**  Shift and rotate the '5' object based on the calculated vector and orientation.
5.  **Combine objects:** Paint the transformed '5' object onto the input grid where the original '5' object was removed.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to solving the transformation, utilizing different DSL functions and logic while achieving the same desired outcome for all provided examples.
