## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves moving the object composed of the digit '5' while leaving other objects untouched. The movement pattern is as follows:

* **Vertical Orientation:** If the '5' object is taller than it is wide, it is moved upwards.
* **Horizontal Orientation:** If the '5' object is wider than it is tall, it is moved to the right.
* **Square Shape:** If the '5' object is a perfect square, the movement direction is ambiguous from the provided examples.  We'll assume it should move upwards in this case, similar to the vertical orientation.

Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** The '5' object is taller than it is wide. It moves two cells upwards.

**Pair 1:** The '5' object is wider than it is tall. It moves two cells to the right.

**Pair 2:** The '5' object is taller than it is wide. It moves two cells upwards.


## Code Improvement (x5):


Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL from `dsl.py`:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_obj = extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == FIVE)
  offset = (-TWO, ZERO) if height(five_obj) >= width(five_obj) else (ZERO, TWO)
  return move(I, five_obj, offset)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`five_obj = extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == FIVE)`:** 
   - Extracts the object made of the digit '5' from the input grid `I`.
   - `objects(I, T, T, T)` finds all objects in the grid.
   - `lambda obj: color(obj) == FIVE` filters for the object with color '5'.

2. **`offset = (-TWO, ZERO) if height(five_obj) >= width(five_obj) else (ZERO, TWO)`:**
   - Determines the movement offset based on the object's dimensions.
   - If taller or a square, move two cells upwards (`(-TWO, ZERO)`).
   - If wider, move two cells to the right (`(ZERO, TWO)`).

3. **`return move(I, five_obj, offset)`:**
   - Returns the modified grid after moving the '5' object.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_obj = next((obj for obj in objects(I, T, T, T) if color(obj) == FIVE), None)
  return move(I, five_obj, (-TWO, ZERO)) if height(five_obj) >= width(five_obj) else move(I, five_obj, (ZERO, TWO)) 
```

**Explanation:**

- Similar to Version 1, but uses a generator expression and `next` to find the '5' object.
- Directly calls the `move` function within the conditional statement for a more compact form.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    if color(obj) == FIVE:
      return move(I, obj, (-TWO, ZERO)) if portrait(obj) or square(obj) else move(I, obj, (ZERO, TWO))
  return I 
```

**Explanation:**

- Iterates through each object in the grid using `objects(I, T, T, T)`.
- Checks if the object's color is '5' using `color(obj) == FIVE`.
- Uses `portrait(obj)` to determine if the object is taller than wide and `square(obj)` to determine if it's a square. 
- Applies the corresponding move operation based on the object's orientation.
- Returns the original grid `I` if no '5' object is found.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return branch(
      any(color(obj) == FIVE and height(obj) >= width(obj) for obj in objects(I, T, T, T)),
      move(I, extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == FIVE), (-TWO, ZERO)),
      move(I, extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == FIVE), (ZERO, TWO))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

- Uses the `branch` function to decide between moving up or right.
- The condition checks if any '5' object is taller than or a square using a generator expression.
- The `move` function is called with appropriate offsets based on the condition.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def move_five(obj):
    return move(I, obj, (-TWO, ZERO)) if height(obj) >= width(obj) else move(I, obj, (ZERO, TWO))
  return next((move_five(obj) for obj in objects(I, T, T, T) if color(obj) == FIVE), I) 
```

**Explanation:**

- Defines a helper function `move_five` to encapsulate the movement logic.
- Uses a generator expression to apply `move_five` to all '5' objects.
- `next` retrieves the first transformed grid, or the original grid if no '5' object is found.

Each of these program versions accomplishes the same transformation using different combinations of DSL functions, demonstrating diverse solutions for the given problem.
