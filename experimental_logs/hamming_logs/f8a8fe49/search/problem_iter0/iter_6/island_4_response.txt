## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects made of the digit '5', splitting them vertically, and then moving these halves vertically and horizontally based on their initial position relative to the center of the grid.  

**Specifics:**

* **Vertical Split:** Each '5' object is cut vertically into two halves.
* **Vertical Movement:** Both halves are moved upwards such that their bottom aligns with the row immediately above the '2' object.
* **Horizontal Movement:** 
    * The left half is moved three steps to the left.
    * The right half is moved three steps to the right.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  two_top = uppermost(ofcolor(I, 2)) - 1 # Row above '2' object
  fives = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5) # Extract '5' objects

  def split_and_move(obj):
    left_half = frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < len(I[0]) // 2) 
    right_half = obj - left_half
    return (shift(left_half, (two_top - lowermost(left_half), -3)),
            shift(right_half, (two_top - lowermost(right_half), 3)))

  moved_halves = mapply(split_and_move, fives)
  return paint(cover(I, 5), merge(moved_halves))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Key Elements:** Find the row above the '2' object (`two_top`) and extract all '5' objects (`fives`).
2. **Split and Move Function:** Define a function (`split_and_move`) that:
    - Splits an object vertically into `left_half` and `right_half`.
    - Moves `left_half` up and three steps to the left.
    - Moves `right_half` up and three steps to the right.
3. **Apply Transformation:** Apply `split_and_move` to all '5' objects (`moved_halves`).
4. **Paint and Return:**  Clear all '5's from the grid, paint the transformed objects, and return the result. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_row = uppermost(ofcolor(I, 2)) - 1
  return paint(
    cover(I, 5),
    mapply(
      lambda obj: shift(
        obj, (target_row - lowermost(obj), -3 if leftmost(obj) < len(I[0]) // 2 else 3)
      ),
      colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5)
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Target Row:** Determine the row above the '2' object (`target_row`).
2. **Transform and Paint:** In a single `paint` operation:
    - Clear existing '5's from the grid.
    - For each '5' object found:
        - Calculate its vertical shift based on `target_row` and its bottom row.
        - Calculate its horizontal shift (-3 for left, 3 for right) based on its leftmost column relative to the grid's center.
        - Shift the object accordingly.
    - Paint the shifted objects onto the cleared grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  two_top = uppermost(ofcolor(I, 2))
  return paint(
    cover(I, 5),
    merge(
      apply(
        lambda obj: shift(obj, (two_top - lowermost(obj) - 1, -3)),
        colorfilter(objects(lefthalf(I), T, F, T), 5)
      ),
      apply(
        lambda obj: shift(obj, (two_top - lowermost(obj) - 1, 3)),
        colorfilter(objects(righthalf(I), T, F, T), 5)
      )
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Row:** Find the row above the '2' object (`two_top`).
2. **Process Halves Separately:** 
    - Extract '5' objects from the left half of the grid and apply a lambda function that moves them up and three steps to the left.
    - Extract '5' objects from the right half and apply a lambda function that moves them up and three steps to the right.
3. **Merge and Paint:** Merge the transformed objects from both halves. Clear all existing '5's from the grid. Paint the merged objects onto the cleared grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fives = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5)
  return paint(
    cover(I, 5),
    mapply(
      lambda obj: shift(obj, (uppermost(ofcolor(I, 2)) - lowermost(obj) - 1, 
                              3 if rightmost(obj) > centerofmass(ofcolor(I, 2))[1] else -3)), 
      fives
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extract all '5' objects (`fives`).
2. **Calculate Shifts:** For each '5' object:
    - Determine the vertical shift based on the row above the '2' object and the object's bottom row.
    - Determine the horizontal shift based on the object's rightmost column relative to the horizontal center of the '2' object. If it's to the right, shift three steps right, otherwise three steps left.
3. **Transform and Paint:** Clear all '5's from the grid. Apply the calculated shifts to each '5' object. Paint the shifted objects onto the cleared grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  two_top = uppermost(ofcolor(I, 2))
  five_objects = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 5)

  def transform_object(obj):
    middle = width(obj) // 2
    left_part  = frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < leftmost(obj) + middle)
    right_part = frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j >= leftmost(obj) + middle)
    return (shift(left_part, (two_top - lowermost(left_part) - 1, -3)), 
            shift(right_part, (two_top - lowermost(right_part) - 1,  3)))

  transformed_objects = mapply(transform_object, five_objects)
  return paint(cover(I, 5), merge(transformed_objects))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Row:** Find the row above the '2' object (`two_top`).
2. **Transform Object Function:** Define a function (`transform_object`) that:
    - Finds the middle column of the object.
    - Splits the object into `left_part` and `right_part` based on this middle column.
    - Moves the `left_part` up and three steps to the left.
    - Moves the `right_part` up and three steps to the right.
3. **Apply Transformation:**  Apply `transform_object` to each '5' object (`transformed_objects`).
4. **Paint and Return:**  Clear existing '5's from the grid. Paint the transformed objects onto the cleared grid, and return the result.
