## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the object composed of the digit '5'. Here's a breakdown:

* **Object Splitting:** The '5' object is split into two halves, maintaining their relative position.
* **Horizontal Mirroring:** The right half of the '5' object is horizontally mirrored.
* **Movement:** Both halves are moved towards the center of the '2' object.  The left half moves up and slightly to the right, while the mirrored right half moves up and slightly to the left.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, FIVE), I) # Get the '5' object
  left_five = toobject(ofcolor(lefthalf(I), FIVE), I) # Left half of '5'
  right_five =  hmirror(toobject(ofcolor(righthalf(I), FIVE), I)) # Mirrored right half of '5'
  target = centerofmass(toobject(ofcolor(I, TWO), I)) # Center of '2' object
  left_offset = gravitate(left_five,  shift(initset(target), (-2, 0))) # Calculate offset for left
  right_offset = gravitate(right_five, shift(initset(target), (-2, 0))) # Calculate offset for right
  moved_left = shift(left_five, left_offset) # Move left half
  moved_right = shift(right_five, right_offset) # Move right half
  O = paint(paint(cover(I, five_obj), moved_left), moved_right) # Combine on a cleared grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** The code identifies and extracts the '5' object and its left and mirrored right halves.
2. **Find Target:** It calculates the center of mass of the '2' object as the target location.
3. **Calculate Offsets:** Using `gravitate`, the code determines the necessary movements for each half to be adjacent to the target, adjusting for slight offsets.
4. **Move and Combine:** The halves are shifted, and the final output is created by painting them onto a cleared grid.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fives = ofcolor(I, FIVE)  # Get indices of '5' cells
  twos = ofcolor(I, TWO) # Get indices of '2' cells
  target = centerofmass(twos) # Find center of '2' object
  left_fives = sfilter(fives, lambda loc: loc[1] < len(I[0])//2) # Filter for left '5' indices
  right_fives = sfilter(fives, lambda loc: loc[1] >= len(I[0])//2) # Filter for right '5' indices
  left_shift = gravitate(left_fives, shift(initset(target), (-2, 0))) # Calculate left shift
  right_shift = gravitate(right_fives, shift(initset(target), (-2, 0))) # Calculate right shift
  O = paint(
      paint(
          cover(I, fives),  # Clear '5' from the grid
          toobject(shift(left_fives, left_shift), I)  # Paint left '5'
      ),
      toobject(shift(right_fives, right_shift), I) # Paint right '5'
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Elements:**  The code identifies indices of '5' and '2' cells and calculates the center of the '2' object.
2. **Split and Shift:** It separates '5' indices into left and right halves and calculates the shifts required for each half to reach the target.
3. **Reconstruct and Paint:** It clears the original '5' and paints the shifted halves onto the grid.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_indices = ofcolor(I, FIVE)
  two_indices = ofcolor(I, TWO)
  target = centerofmass(two_indices)
  left_five = toobject(sfilter(five_indices, lambda loc: loc[1] < len(I[0]) // 2), I)
  right_five = toobject(sfilter(five_indices, lambda loc: loc[1] >= len(I[0]) // 2), I)
  mirrored_right = hmirror(right_five)
  left_shifted = shift(left_five, subtract(target, (2, width(left_five) - 1))) 
  right_shifted = shift(mirrored_right, subtract(target, (2, 0)))
  O = paint(paint(cover(I, five_indices), left_shifted), right_shifted)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Prepare:** This version extracts '5' and '2' indices, calculates the center of '2', separates and mirrors the right half of the '5' object.
2. **Direct Shifting:** It directly calculates the target positions for both halves based on the '2' center and object widths, then shifts them.
3. **Final Output:**  The original '5' is cleared, and the shifted halves are painted onto the grid. 

## Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, FIVE), I) # Get the '5' object
  target = center(toobject(ofcolor(I, TWO), I)) # Get center of the '2' object
  left_five = toobject(sfilter(five_obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1] < target[1]), I) # Extract the left part of the '5'
  right_five = toobject(sfilter(five_obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1] >= target[1]), I) # Extract the right part of the '5'
  left_shifted = shift(left_five, (-2, target[1]-width(left_five))) # Move the left '5' up and to the right
  right_shifted = shift(hmirror(right_five), (-2, target[1])) # Mirror and move the right '5' up and to the left
  O = paint(paint(cover(I, five_obj), left_shifted), right_shifted) # Combine the moved objects on the cleared grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object and Target:**  Similar to previous versions, it extracts the '5' object and determines the center of the '2' object.
2. **Splitting at Target:** It splits the '5' object into left and right halves based on the horizontal position relative to the '2' center.
3. **Shifting and Mirroring:** It calculates the shifts needed to position the left half up and right, and the mirrored right half up and left.
4. **Final Composition:** The original '5' is removed, and the transformed halves are painted onto the grid.


## Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 5), I) # Extract the '5' object
  two_center = centerofmass(toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)) # Get the center of the '2' object
  
  # Split the '5' object horizontally based on the center of '2' object
  left_five = frozenset(filter(lambda c: c[1][1] < two_center[1], five_obj))
  right_five = frozenset(filter(lambda c: c[1][1] >= two_center[1], five_obj))
  
  # Define the target positions for the split '5' parts
  left_target = (two_center[0] - 2, two_center[1] - width(left_five))
  right_target = (two_center[0] - 2, two_center[1])
  
  # Move the split '5' parts to their target positions
  moved_left = shift(left_five, subtract(left_target, ulcorner(left_five)))
  moved_right = shift(hmirror(right_five), subtract(right_target, ulcorner(right_five)))
  
  # Paint the moved parts on the cleared grid
  O = paint(paint(cover(I, five_obj), moved_left), moved_right)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction and Center:** This version extracts the '5' object and finds the center of the '2' object.
2. **Center-Based Splitting:**  It splits the '5' object into left and right parts based on the horizontal position relative to the '2' center.
3. **Target Calculation:** It directly calculates the desired upper-left corner positions for both halves based on the '2' center and object widths. 
4. **Shifting and Mirroring:** It determines the required shifts to move the left half and the mirrored right half to their target positions.
5. **Final Output:**  It clears the grid of the original '5' and paints the moved halves onto the grid.
