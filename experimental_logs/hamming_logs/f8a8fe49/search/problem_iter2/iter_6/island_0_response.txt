## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking the '5' objects from the input grid and strategically placing them around the '2' object. The placement is consistent across all examples and appears to create a specific pattern relative to the '2' object.

**Specifics:**

* **Vertical Line of 5s:**  A vertical line of '5's is placed two columns to the right of the '2' object's center. The length of this line matches the height of the '2' object.
* **Horizontal Line of 5s:** A horizontal line of '5's is placed two rows above the '2' object's center. The length of this line matches the width of the '2' object.
* **Corner 5s:**  Single '5's are placed at the following locations relative to the '2' object's center:
    * One row above and one column to the left.
    * One row above and one column to the right.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  two = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  h = height(two)
  w = width(two)
  c = center(two)
  vline_5 = shift(recolor(5, {(i, 0) for i in range(h)}), (c[0] - h // 2, c[1] + 2))
  hline_5 = shift(recolor(5, {(0, j) for j in range(w)}), (c[0] - 2, c[1] - w // 2))
  corner_5s = merge([
      shift(recolor(5, {(0, 0)}), (c[0] - 1, c[1] - 1)),
      shift(recolor(5, {(0, 0)}), (c[0] - 1, c[1] + 1))
  ])
  return paint(cover(I, ofcolor(I, 5)), merge([vline_5, hline_5, corner_5s]))

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify key elements:**  Find the '2' object, its center, height, and width.
2. **Create pattern elements:** 
    * Generate a vertical line of '5's (`vline_5`) with the same height as the '2' object.
    * Generate a horizontal line of '5's (`hline_5`) with the same width as the '2' object.
    * Generate two single-cell '5' objects (`corner_5s`) for the corners.
3. **Position elements:** Shift each element to its correct position relative to the '2' object's center.
4. **Combine and paint:** Merge all the '5' elements, cover the original '5's in the input, and paint the new pattern onto the grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  two = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  h, w = shape(two)
  ci, cj = center(two)
  five = recolor(5, {(0, 0)})
  pattern = merge([
      shift(five, (ci - 2, j)) for j in range(cj - w // 2, cj + w // 2 + 1)
  ] + [
      shift(five, (i, cj + 2)) for i in range(ci - h // 2, ci + h // 2 + 1)
  ] + [
      shift(five, (ci - 1, cj - 1)),
      shift(five, (ci - 1, cj + 1))
  ])
  return paint(cover(I, ofcolor(I, 5)), pattern)

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify elements and dimensions:** Find the '2' object, its shape, and center coordinates.
2. **Create base element:** Create a single-cell '5' object (`five`) as a base for shifting.
3. **Generate pattern using list comprehensions:**
    * Create the horizontal line by shifting the base '5' horizontally across the desired width.
    * Create the vertical line by shifting the base '5' vertically across the desired height.
    * Add the two corner '5's by shifting the base '5' to their respective positions.
4. **Combine, cover, and paint:** Merge all pattern elements, cover existing '5's, and paint the pattern.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  two = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  h, w = shape(two)
  ci, cj = center(two)
  pattern = mapply(
      lambda pos: shift(recolor(5, {(0, 0)}), pos),
      [(ci - 2, j) for j in range(cj - w // 2, cj + w // 2 + 1)] +
      [(i, cj + 2) for i in range(ci - h // 2, ci + h // 2 + 1)] +
      [(ci - 1, cj - 1), (ci - 1, cj + 1)]
  )
  return paint(cover(I, ofcolor(I, 5)), pattern)

```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 2, but it utilizes the `mapply` function for a more compact representation:

1. **Identify elements and dimensions:** Same as Version 2.
2. **Generate position list:** Create a list of all target positions for the '5's based on the '2' object's shape and center.
3. **Apply transformation using `mapply`:**  Use `mapply` to apply a lambda function to each position in the list. This lambda function shifts a single-cell '5' object to the given position.
4. **Combine, cover, and paint:** Same as Version 2.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  two = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  ci, cj = center(two)
  h_range = interval(ci - height(two) // 2, ci + height(two) // 2 + 1, 1)
  w_range = interval(cj - width(two) // 2, cj + width(two) // 2 + 1, 1)
  five = recolor(5, {(0, 0)})
  pattern = merge([
      shift(five, (i, cj + 2)) for i in h_range
  ] + [
      shift(five, (ci - 2, j)) for j in w_range
  ] + [
      shift(five, (ci - 1, cj - 1)),
      shift(five, (ci - 1, cj + 1))
  ])
  return paint(cover(I, ofcolor(I, 5)), pattern)

```

**Explanation:**

This version introduces the `interval` function to define the ranges for the horizontal and vertical lines:

1. **Identify elements and center:** Find the '2' object and its center coordinates.
2. **Define ranges:** Use the `interval` function to create ranges for the row indices (`h_range`) and column indices (`w_range`) of the '5' pattern elements.
3. **Generate pattern elements:** Similar to Version 2, but iterate over the pre-defined ranges.
4. **Combine, cover, and paint:** Same as Version 2.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  two = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  c = center(two)
  five = recolor(5, {(0, 0)})
  pattern =  merge(
      rapply(
          lambda offset: shift(five, add(c, offset)), 
          [(0, 2), (-2, -1), (-2, 0), (-2, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1)] + 
          [(i - height(two) // 2, 2) for i in range(height(two))] + 
          [(-2, j - width(two) // 2) for j in range(width(two))]
      )
  )
  return paint(cover(I, ofcolor(I, 5)), pattern)

```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a combination of `rapply`, `add`, and list comprehensions:

1. **Identify elements and center:**  Find the '2' object and its center.
2. **Create offset list:** Generate a list of offsets from the center of the '2' object for each '5' position.
3. **Apply transformations using `rapply`:** Use `rapply` to apply a lambda function to each offset in the list. This lambda function shifts a single-cell '5' object by the calculated offset relative to the '2' object's center using the `add` function.
4. **Combine, cover, and paint:** Same as previous versions.


These five versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the language.
