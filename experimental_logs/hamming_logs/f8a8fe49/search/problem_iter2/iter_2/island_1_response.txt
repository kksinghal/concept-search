## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the object composed of the digit '5' and its relation to the object formed by the digit '2'. Here's a breakdown:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The '5' object is split into two parts based on a vertical division line passing through the center of mass of the '2' object.
* The left part of the '5' object is moved two rows above the '2' object and aligned with its left edge.
* The right part of the '5' object is mirrored horizontally, moved two rows above the '2' object, and aligned with its right edge. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* Similar to the previous transformation, the '5' object is split based on the vertical line through the '2' object's center of mass.
* The left part of the '5' object is moved two rows above the '2' object and shifted slightly to the left.
* The right part of the '5' object is moved two rows above the '2' object and shifted slightly to the right.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* This transformation follows the same pattern as Input_1 to Output_1. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  five_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, FIVE), I)
  two_center = centerofmass(toobject(ofcolor(I, TWO), I))
  left_five = toobject(sfilter(toindices(five_obj), lambda loc: loc[1] < two_center[1]), I)
  right_five = toobject(sfilter(toindices(five_obj), lambda loc: loc[1] >= two_center[1]), I)
  target = (two_center[0] - 2, two_center[1])
  left_shift = subtract((target[0], target[1] - width(left_five)), ulcorner(left_five))
  right_shift = subtract((target[0], target[1]), ulcorner(hmirror(right_five)))
  O = paint(paint(cover(I, five_obj), shift(left_five, left_shift)), shift(hmirror(right_five), right_shift))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify key elements:** Extract the '5' object and the center of mass of the '2' object.
2. **Split based on the center:** Divide the '5' object into left and right parts using the '2' object's center as a reference.
3. **Calculate target positions:** Determine the desired top-left corner for both the left and mirrored right parts of the '5' object.
4. **Calculate shifts:** Compute the necessary shift vectors for both parts.
5. **Apply transformations:**  Clear the original '5' object, shift and paint the left part, mirror, shift, and paint the right part.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  five_indices = ofcolor(I, FIVE)
  two_center = centerofmass(toobject(ofcolor(I, TWO), I))
  target_row = two_center[0] - 2
  O = I
  for i, j in five_indices:
    if j < two_center[1]:
      O = paint(O, {(FIVE, (target_row, two_center[1] - (two_center[1] - j)))})
    else:
      O = paint(O, {(FIVE, (target_row, two_center[1] + (j - two_center[1])))})
  O = cover(O, five_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find key locations:** Identify the indices of '5's and the center of mass of the '2' object.
2. **Determine the target row:** The '5's are always moved two rows above the '2' object.
3. **Iterate and paint:**  Loop through the '5' indices, calculating the new column position based on their relative position to the '2' object's center and painting them on the new row.
4. **Clear original '5's:** After placing all the transformed '5's, clear the original ones.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  five_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, FIVE), I)
  two_center = centerofmass(toobject(ofcolor(I, TWO), I))
  left_five = toobject(sfilter(toindices(five_obj), lambda loc: loc[1] < two_center[1]), I)
  right_five = toobject(sfilter(toindices(five_obj), lambda loc: loc[1] >= two_center[1]), I)
  O = paint(
      paint(
          cover(I, five_obj),
          shift(left_five, subtract((two_center[0] - 2, 0), (uppermost(left_five), 0)))
      ),
      shift(hmirror(right_five), subtract((two_center[0] - 2, two_center[1] * 2 - width(right_five)), (uppermost(right_five), 0)))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract elements:** Get the '5' object, center of mass of the '2' object, and split the '5' object.
2. **Shift left part:** Move the left part two rows above the '2' object while maintaining its original column position.
3. **Mirror and shift right part:**  Mirror the right part, move it two rows above the '2' object, and adjust its column position to align with the right edge of the '2' object.
4. **Combine:** Clear the original '5' object and paint both transformed parts.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  five_indices = ofcolor(I, FIVE)
  two_center_row = centerofmass(toobject(ofcolor(I, TWO), I))[0]
  left_five  = sfilter(five_indices, lambda cell: cell[1] < two_center[1])
  right_five = sfilter(five_indices, lambda cell: cell[1] >= two_center[1])
  shifted_left =  mapply(lambda cell: (cell[0], (two_center_row - 2, cell[1])), left_five)
  mirrored_right = mapply(lambda cell: (cell[0], (two_center_row - 2, two_center[1] * 2 - cell[1] - 1)), right_five)
  return paint(paint(cover(I, five_indices), toobject(shifted_left, I)), toobject(mirrored_right, I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get key data:**  Extract indices of '5's and the row of the '2' object's center.
2. **Split '5' indices:**  Divide '5' indices into left and right groups based on the center column of the '2' object.
3. **Shift and mirror:**  Shift the left indices two rows above the '2' object and mirror the right indices horizontally while positioning them on the same row.
4. **Paint and clear:**  Paint the transformed left and mirrored right '5's onto the grid and clear the original '5's.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  fives = ofcolor(I, FIVE)
  twos = ofcolor(I, TWO)
  target_row = uppermost(twos) - 2 
  left_fives = sfilter(fives, lambda loc: loc[1] < centerofmass(twos)[1])
  right_fives = sfilter(fives, lambda loc: loc[1] >= centerofmass(twos)[1])
  O = I
  for i, j in left_fives:
    O = paint(cover(O, {(i, j)}), {(FIVE, (target_row, j))})
  for i, j in right_fives:
    O = paint(cover(O, {(i, j)}), {(FIVE, (target_row, 2 * centerofmass(twos)[1] - j - 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '5's and '2's:**  Find the indices of '5's and '2's within the grid.
2. **Determine target row:**  The '5's are consistently moved two rows above the top of the '2' object.
3. **Split '5' indices:**  Divide the '5' indices into left and right groups based on the center column of the '2' object.
4. **Iterate and transform:** Loop through each group, erasing the original '5' and painting a new one at the target row with adjusted column positions for the right group to achieve mirroring.
