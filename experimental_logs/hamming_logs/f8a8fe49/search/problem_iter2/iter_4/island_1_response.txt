## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the '5' objects and mirroring them across the vertical centerline of the '2' object. 

**Input_0:**

1. The two vertical '5' objects are mirrored horizontally.
2. The mirrored objects are then positioned such that their top edges are two cells above the top edge of the '2' object and are horizontally centered around the vertical centerline of the '2' object.

**Input_1:**

1. The vertical '5' objects are mirrored horizontally.
2. The mirrored objects are then positioned to the sides of the '2' object, two cells above the top edge, maintaining the same horizontal distance from the '2' object's center as in the input.

**Input_2:**

1. This transformation is identical to Input_1.


## Program Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  two_center = centerofmass(toobject(ofcolor(I, TWO), I))  # Calculate the center of mass of the '2' object.
  five_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, FIVE), I)  # Extract the '5' object.
  mirrored_five = hmirror(five_obj)  # Mirror the '5' object horizontally.
  shifted_five = shift(mirrored_five, (two_center[0] - uppermost(mirrored_five) - 2, two_center[1] - centerofmass(mirrored_five)[1]))  # Calculate the shift amount to position the '5' object.
  O = paint(cover(I, five_obj), shifted_five)  # Paint the mirrored and shifted '5' object onto a cleared grid.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. We calculate the center of mass of the '2' object.
2. We extract the '5' object and create a mirrored copy.
3. We calculate the shift amount for the mirrored object to be positioned two cells above the '2' object and centered on its vertical centerline.
4. Finally, we paint the mirrored and shifted '5' object onto a grid where the original '5' object has been removed.


## Program Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  two_center = center(toindices(toobject(ofcolor(I, TWO), I)))  # Calculate the center of the '2' object.
  five_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, FIVE), I)  # Extract the '5' object.
  mirrored_five = hmirror(five_obj)  # Mirror the '5' object horizontally.
  left_five  = toobject(sfilter(toindices(five_obj), lambda cell: cell[1] < two_center[1]), I)
  right_five = toobject(sfilter(toindices(five_obj), lambda cell: cell[1] >= two_center[1]), I)
  left_shift = (two_center[0] - uppermost(left_five) - 2, two_center[1] - leftmost(left_five))
  right_shift = (two_center[0] - uppermost(right_five) - 2, two_center[1] + width(right_five) - leftmost(right_five))
  O = paint(paint(cover(I, five_obj), shift(left_five, left_shift)), shift(hmirror(right_five), right_shift))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. We find the center of the '2' object.
2. We separate the '5' object into left and right portions based on the '2' object's center.
3. We calculate individual shifts for the mirrored left and right portions of the '5' object.
4. We paint the mirrored and shifted '5' objects back onto the grid after removing the original '5' object.


## Program Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  two_indices = ofcolor(I, TWO)  # Find the indices of the '2' object.
  five_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, FIVE), I)  # Extract the '5' object.
  target_i = uppermost(two_indices) - 2  # Calculate the target row index for the mirrored '5' object.
  O = paint(
      cover(I, ofcolor(I, FIVE)),  # Clear the original '5' object.
      mapply(
          lambda obj: shift(
              hmirror(obj),  # Mirror each '5' object horizontally.
              (target_i - uppermost(obj), centerofmass(two_indices)[1] - centerofmass(obj)[1]),  # Calculate shift amount for each object.
          ),
          objects(I, T, F, T) if colorcount(I, FIVE) == 2 else {five_obj}  # Handle single and multiple '5' objects.
      )
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. We locate the '2' object and extract the '5' object.
2. We determine the target row for the mirrored '5' object based on the '2' object's position.
3. We handle cases with one or two '5' objects.
4. We mirror each '5' object, calculate its shift relative to the '2' object's center, and paint it onto the cleared grid.


## Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  two_center_j = centerofmass(toobject(ofcolor(I, TWO), I))[1]  # Get the column index of the '2' object's center.
  five_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, FIVE), I)  # Extract the '5' object.
  five_indices = toindices(five_obj)
  mirrored_fives = mapply(
      lambda indices: shift(
          hmirror(toobject(indices, I)),  # Mirror each connected component of '5's horizontally.
          (
              uppermost(toobject(ofcolor(I, TWO), I)) - 2 - uppermost(toobject(indices, I)), # Calculate vertical shift.
              two_center_j * 2 - (leftmost(toobject(indices, I)) + rightmost(toobject(indices, I))), # Calculate horizontal shift.
          ),
      ),
      sfilter(
          lambda indices: size(indices) > 0,  # Filter for non-empty index sets.
          (
              frozenset(filter(lambda loc: loc[1] < two_center_j, five_indices)), # Get indices of '5's to the left of '2' center.
              frozenset(filter(lambda loc: loc[1] >= two_center_j, five_indices)), # Get indices of '5's to the right of '2' center.
          )
      )
  )
  return paint(cover(I, five_obj), mirrored_fives)  # Paint mirrored '5's onto the cleared grid. 
```

**Explanation:**

1. We determine the vertical center of the '2' object.
2. We find all connected components of '5's in the grid.
3. For each connected component, we mirror it horizontally and calculate the required shift to position it correctly.
4. Finally, we paint the mirrored and shifted components back onto the grid after clearing the original '5's.


## Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  two_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, TWO), I)
  five_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, FIVE), I)
  two_uppermost = uppermost(two_obj)
  five_uppermost = uppermost(five_obj)
  O = paint(
    cover(I, five_obj), 
    shift(
      hmirror(five_obj),
      (two_uppermost - five_uppermost - 2, 2 * centerofmass(two_obj)[1] - (leftmost(five_obj) + rightmost(five_obj)))
    )
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Find the uppermost row of both the '2' object and the '5' object.
2. Calculate the horizontal shift based on the center of mass of the '2' object and the leftmost and rightmost points of the '5' object.
3. Mirror the '5' object horizontally.
4. Shift the mirrored '5' object to be two cells above the '2' object and horizontally centered. 
5. Paint the mirrored and shifted '5' object onto a grid where the original '5' object has been erased. 

These five program versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the target transformation, each employing a different combination of DSL functions and logic.
