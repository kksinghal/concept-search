## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking the '5' object, mirroring it horizontally, and then moving it to a new location determined by the '2' object. 

Let's break down the movement for each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** The mirrored '5' is moved two rows above the top of the '2' object and centered horizontally with the '2' object.

**Pair 1 & 2:** The mirrored '5' is shifted so its top right corner aligns with a point one row above and one column to the right of the top left corner of the '2' object.


## Program Versions & Explanations:

Here are five distinct program versions utilizing different DSL functions to achieve the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  two_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, TWO), I)  # Extract the '2' object.
  five_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, FIVE), I)  # Extract the '5' object.
  mirrored_five = hmirror(five_obj)  # Mirror '5' horizontally.
  target_loc = add(ulcorner(two_obj), (-2, 1))  # Calculate the target location.
  shifted_five = shift(mirrored_five, subtract(target_loc, ulcorner(mirrored_five)))  # Shift mirrored '5'.
  return paint(cover(I, five_obj), shifted_five)  # Paint mirrored & shifted '5' onto cleared grid. 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extracts the '2' and '5' objects from the input grid.
2. **Mirror '5':**  Mirrors the '5' object horizontally.
3. **Calculate Target Location:** Determines the target location as one row above and one column to the right of the '2' object's upper-left corner.
4. **Shift Mirrored '5':** Shifts the mirrored '5' to the target location.
5. **Combine and Return:** Paints the shifted, mirrored '5' onto a cleared version of the original grid.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  two_ulcorner = ulcorner(toobject(ofcolor(I, TWO), I)) # Find the upper-left corner of the '2' object
  five_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, FIVE), I) # Extract the '5' object
  mirrored_five = hmirror(five_obj) # Mirror the '5' object horizontally
  shifted_five = shift(mirrored_five, (two_ulcorner[0] - height(five_obj) - 2 - uppermost(mirrored_five), two_ulcorner[1] + 1 - leftmost(mirrored_five))) # Shift the mirrored '5'
  return paint(cover(I, five_obj), shifted_five) # Paint the shifted '5' onto a cleared version of the input grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '2' Corner & Extract '5':** Identifies the upper-left corner of the '2' object and extracts the '5' object.
2. **Mirror '5':** Mirrors the '5' object horizontally.
3. **Calculate Shift:** Computes the shift amount based on the '2' corner and '5' dimensions to align them.
4. **Shift and Paint:** Shifts the mirrored '5' and paints it onto the grid where the original '5' was removed.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  two_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, TWO), I)  # Extract the '2' object.
  five_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, FIVE), I)  # Extract the '5' object.
  mirrored_five = hmirror(five_obj)  # Mirror the '5' horizontally.
  target_row = uppermost(two_obj) - height(five_obj) - 2  # Calculate the target row.
  target_col = leftmost(two_obj) + 1 # Calculate target column.
  shifted_five = shift(mirrored_five, (target_row - uppermost(mirrored_five), target_col - leftmost(mirrored_five)))  # Shift mirrored '5'.
  return paint(cover(I, five_obj), shifted_five)  # Paint mirrored & shifted '5' onto cleared grid.
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** Extracts the '2' and '5' objects.
2. **Mirroring:** Mirrors the '5' horizontally.
3. **Target Calculation:** Determines the target row and column based on the '2' object's position and the height of the '5'.
4. **Shifting:**  Shifts the mirrored '5' to the calculated target location.
5. **Painting:** Paints the shifted '5' onto the grid after removing the original '5'.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, FIVE), I)
  two_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, TWO), I)
  mirrored_five = hmirror(five_obj)  # Mirror the "5" object horizontally.
  target_position = add(ulcorner(two_obj), (-height(five_obj) - 1, 1))  # Calculate the target position for the mirrored "5".
  shifted_five = shift(mirrored_five, subtract(target_position, ulcorner(mirrored_five)))  # Shift the mirrored "5" to the target position.
  return paint(cover(I, five_obj), shifted_five)  # Paint the shifted "5" onto the input grid after removing the original "5" object.
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extracts the '5' and '2' objects from the grid.
2. **Mirror '5':** Mirrors the '5' object horizontally.
3. **Target Position Calculation:** Calculates the target position based on the '2' object's upper-left corner, adjusting for the '5' object's height.
4. **Shift Mirrored '5':**  Shifts the mirrored '5' to align its upper-left corner with the calculated target position.
5. **Combine and Return:**  Combines the shifted, mirrored '5' with a cleared version of the input grid and returns the result.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  two_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, TWO), I) 
  five_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, FIVE), I) 
  mirrored_five = hmirror(five_obj)  # Mirror the '5' object.
  shift_amount = subtract(add(ulcorner(two_obj), (-height(five_obj) - 1, 1)), ulcorner(mirrored_five)) 
  shifted_five = shift(mirrored_five, shift_amount) # Shift the mirrored '5' object.
  output_grid = paint(cover(I, five_obj), shifted_five)  # Paint the shifted '5' onto the input grid after removing the original '5'.
  return output_grid 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Mirror:**  Extracts '2' and '5' objects, mirrors the '5'.
2. **Calculate Shift:** Determines the shift amount for precise placement.
3. **Shift and Combine:**  Shifts the mirrored '5', then combines it with the grid where the original '5' is removed.
4. **Return Output:** Returns the final transformed grid. 

Each version showcases distinct ways to achieve the same transformation using different DSL function combinations, highlighting the flexibility and power of the provided DSL.
