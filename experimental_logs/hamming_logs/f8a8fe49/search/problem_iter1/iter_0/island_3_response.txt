## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the object made of '5's and moving it to a new position relative to the object made of '2's. The '5' object retains its shape and orientation.

* **Input_0:** The '5' object is moved three cells down from its original position. 
* **Input_1:** The '5' object is moved three cells to the right and one cell down from its original position.
* **Input_2:** The '5' object is moved three cells to the right from its original position.

The pattern suggests the '5' object is always moved three cells to the right.  Additionally, the vertical movement seems dependent on the relative vertical positions of the '5' and '2' objects in the input.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  five_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, FIVE), I)
  two_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, TWO), I)
  target_j = rightmost(two_obj) + 1 
  target_i = uppermost(five_obj) + (uppermost(two_obj) - uppermost(five_obj)) // 2
  target_center = (target_i, target_j)
  shift_amount = subtract(target_center, centerofmass(five_obj))
  O = move(I, five_obj, shift_amount)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify the objects composed of '5's (five_obj) and '2's (two_obj) within the input grid (I).
2. **Calculate Target Position:** 
    -  The target column (`target_j`) is one cell to the right of the rightmost '2'.
    - The target row (`target_i`) is calculated based on the relative vertical positions of the '5' and '2' objects, ensuring the '5' object is roughly vertically centered relative to the '2' object.
3. **Calculate Shift:** Determine the shift amount (`shift_amount`) needed to move the '5' object to its target position.
4. **Move Object:**  Move the '5' object (`five_obj`) on the input grid (`I`) by the calculated `shift_amount`.

**Version 2**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  five_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, FIVE), I)
  two_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, TWO), I)
  horizontal_shift = (0, 3)
  vertical_shift = (uppermost(two_obj) - uppermost(five_obj)) // 2 - height(five_obj) // 2
  O = move(I, five_obj, add(horizontal_shift, (vertical_shift, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify the '5' object (`five_obj`) and the '2' object (`two_obj`).
2. **Calculate Shifts:**
    - `horizontal_shift`: Fixed shift of three cells to the right.
    - `vertical_shift`: Calculated to vertically center the '5' object relative to the '2' object.
3. **Combine Shifts:** Add the horizontal and vertical shift components.
4. **Move Object:** Move the '5' object by the combined shift.

**Version 3**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if index(I, (i,j)) == FIVE:
        O = paint(O, {(FIVE, (i, j + 3))})
        O = paint(O, {(ZERO, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** Loop through each cell of the grid.
2. **Identify and Move '5's:** If a cell contains '5', paint '5' three cells to the right and replace the original '5' with a '0'.

---

**Version 4**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  five_indices = ofcolor(I, FIVE)
  new_five_indices = shift(five_indices, (0, 3))
  O = I
  for i, j in five_indices:
    O = paint(O, {(ZERO, (i, j))})
  for i, j in new_five_indices:
    O = paint(O, {(FIVE, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '5' Indices:** Find all indices containing '5'.
2. **Calculate New Indices:** Shift the '5' indices three positions to the right.
3. **Replace and Paint:** Iterate over the original and new indices, replacing '5's at original positions with '0's and painting '5's at the new positions.

---

**Version 5**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  five_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, FIVE), I)
  two_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, TWO), I)
  five_center = centerofmass(five_obj)
  two_center = centerofmass(two_obj)
  shift_amount = (two_center[0] - five_center[0], 3)
  O = move(I, five_obj, shift_amount)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Centers:**  Find the '5' and '2' objects and their centers of mass.
2. **Calculate Shift:** The horizontal shift is fixed at 3. The vertical shift is the difference between the row indices of the two centers of mass.
3. **Move Object:** Move the '5' object by the calculated shift amount.
