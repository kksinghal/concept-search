## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying an object of a specific color (5 in this case) and moving its parts to different locations. Let's break it down for each example:

**Example 0:**

1. **Identify:**  The program identifies the object formed by the digit '5'.
2. **Split & Shift:** The leftmost column of the object is shifted upwards by 4 units. 
3. **Shift:** The rest of the object is shifted upwards by 1 unit.

**Example 1:**

1. **Identify:** Same as Example 0, the '5' object is identified.
2. **Shift:** The entire object is shifted left by 1 unit.

**Example 2:**

1. **Identify:** Same as previous examples.
2. **Shift:**  The entire object is shifted left by 1 unit.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = 5
  obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), target_color))
  left_col = toindices(crop(I, ulcorner(obj), (height(obj), 1)))
  rest_of_obj = toindices(crop(I, (ulcorner(obj)[0], ulcorner(obj)[1] + 1), (height(obj), width(obj) - 1)))
  O = paint(
    paint(
      cover(I, obj),
      recolor(target_color, shift(left_col, (4, 0)))
    ),
    recolor(target_color, shift(rest_of_obj, (1, 0)))
  )
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target:** `target_color = 5` sets the color of the object we want to manipulate.
2. **Extract Object:** `obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), target_color))` extracts the object formed by the `target_color`.
3. **Isolate Left Column:** `left_col = toindices(crop(I, ulcorner(obj), (height(obj), 1)))` isolates the indices of the leftmost column of the object.
4. **Isolate Remaining Object:** `rest_of_obj = toindices(crop(I, (ulcorner(obj)[0], ulcorner(obj)[1] + 1), (height(obj), width(obj) - 1)))` extracts indices of the object excluding the leftmost column.
5. **Shift and Paint Left Column:**  `recolor(target_color, shift(left_col, (4, 0)))` shifts the left column up by 4 units and paints it with `target_color`.
6. **Shift and Paint Remaining Object:** `recolor(target_color, shift(rest_of_obj, (1, 0)))` shifts the rest of the object up by 1 unit and paints it with `target_color`.
7. **Combine and Return:**  The shifted parts are painted onto a cleared canvas (created by `cover`) and returned as the final output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = 5
  obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), target_color))
  O = cover(I, obj) 
  for i, row in enumerate(crop(I, ulcorner(obj), shape(obj))):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == target_color:
        if j == 0:
          O = paint(O, {(target_color, (i + 4, j))}) 
        else:
          O = paint(O, {(target_color, (i + 1, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify & Clear:**  Similar to version 1, it identifies the target object and clears its original position on the grid.
2. **Iterate and Shift:** It iterates through each cell of the extracted object. If the cell contains the `target_color`, it shifts the cell up by 4 units if it's in the leftmost column (j==0) and by 1 unit otherwise.
3. **Paint & Return:** Each shifted cell is painted onto the cleared canvas and the final grid is returned.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    target_color = 5
    obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), target_color))
    left_col = crop(I, ulcorner(obj), (height(obj), 1))
    rest_of_obj = crop(I, (ulcorner(obj)[0], ulcorner(obj)[1] + 1), (height(obj), width(obj) - 1))
    O = paint(
        cover(I, obj),
        shift(asobject(left_col), (4, 0))
    )
    O = paint(
        O,
        shift(asobject(rest_of_obj), (1, 0))
    )
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

 This version is similar to version 1 but directly uses `crop` on the input grid to get subgrids representing the left column and the rest of the object. It then converts these subgrids to objects using `asobject` before shifting and painting them.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target = 5
  obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), target))
  O = paint(
      cover(I, obj), 
      recolor(target, shift(toindices(obj), (1, 0)))
  )
  O = paint(
    O,
    recolor(target, shift(toindices(crop(I, ulcorner(obj), (height(obj), 1))), (3, 0)))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
This version first shifts the entire object up by one unit and then shifts the leftmost column up by an additional three units.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    target_color = 5
    obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), target_color))
    O = cover(I, obj)
    for x, (i, j) in obj:
        new_i = i + 4 if j == leftmost(obj) else i + 1
        O = paint(O, {(x, (new_i, j))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
 This version iterates through each cell of the target object and determines the new row index (`new_i`) based on whether the cell is in the leftmost column or not. It then paints the cell at its new position on the cleared canvas.

These are just a few examples; many other valid solutions could be generated using different combinations of DSL functions.
