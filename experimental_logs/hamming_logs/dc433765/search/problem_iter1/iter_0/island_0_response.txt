## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to be moving the non-zero objects from the input grid to the center of the output grid, while maintaining their relative positions. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 
- The '3' and '4' move to the center column.
- The '3' moves one position down from its original position.
- The '4' moves two positions up from its original position.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The '3' and '4' move to the center column. 
- Both digits maintain their original row positions.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- The '3' and '4' move to the center column.
- Both digits maintain their original row positions.

**Input_3 to Output_3:**
- The '3' and '4' move to the center column.
- Both digits maintain their original row positions.

**Input_4 to Output_4:**
- The '3' moves to the center column and down three positions.
- The '4' moves to the center column and up three positions.

**Input_5 to Output_5:**
- The '3' and '4' move to the center column.
- Both digits maintain their original row positions.

**Input_6 to Output_6:**
- The '3' and '4' move to the center column.
- The '4' moves one position up from its original position. 
- The '3' moves two positions down from its original position.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  h, w = shape(I)
  center_col = w // 2
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for obj in objs:
    obj_center = centerofmass(obj)
    offset = (0, center_col - obj_center[1])
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, offset)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We identify the objects within the input grid `I`.
2. **Calculate Center:** We determine the center column `center_col` of the grid.
3. **Create Empty Canvas:**  We create an empty output grid `O` of the same size as the input, filled with zeros.
4. **Iterate & Shift:** We iterate over each object, calculate the offset needed to move its center to the center column, and paint the shifted object onto the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  h, w = shape(I)
  center_col = w // 2
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for obj in objs:
    new_obj = frozenset({(v, (i, center_col)) for v, (i, j) in obj})
    O = paint(O, new_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We identify the objects within the input grid `I`.
2. **Calculate Center:** We determine the center column `center_col` of the grid.
3. **Create Empty Canvas:**  We create an empty output grid `O` of the same size as the input, filled with zeros.
4. **Iterate & Center:** We iterate over each object, directly place its cells into the center column of the output grid while maintaining their row positions.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
    h, w = shape(I)
    center = (h//2, w//2)
    O = canvas(0, (h, w))
    for obj in objs:
        obj_center = centerofmass(obj)
        offset = subtract(center, obj_center)
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, offset))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects in the input grid.
2. **Calculate Center:** Find the center coordinates of the grid.
3. **Initialize Output:** Create an output grid filled with zeros.
4. **Iterate and Center:** For each object:
    - Calculate the offset required to move its center of mass to the grid's center.
    - Shift the object by the calculated offset.
    - Paint the shifted object onto the output grid. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    h, w = shape(I)
    center_col = w // 2
    O = canvas(0, (h, w))
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, v in enumerate(row):
            if v != 0:
                O = paint(O, {(v, (i, center_col))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Grid Dimensions:** Get the height and width of the input grid.
2. **Calculate Center Column:** Determine the horizontal center of the grid.
3. **Create Empty Canvas:** Create an output grid filled with zeros.
4. **Iterate and Move:** For each cell in the input grid:
    - If the cell value is not zero:
        - Paint the cell value onto the output grid at the same row but in the center column. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
    h, w = shape(I)
    mid = w // 2
    O = canvas(0, (h, w))
    for obj in objs:
        for v, (i, j) in obj:
            O = paint(O, {(v, (i, mid))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extract objects from the input grid.
2. **Grid Dimensions:** Determine the height and width of the grid.
3. **Find Middle Column:** Calculate the middle column index.
4. **Create Empty Output:** Generate an empty grid of the same size.
5. **Process Objects:** For each object in the input:
    - For each cell (value, coordinates) in the object:
        - Paint the cell value at the same row but in the middle column of the output grid.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressive power of the provided DSL.
