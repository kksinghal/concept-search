## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all the examples involves swapping the positions of the objects represented by the digits "3" and "4" while keeping the rest of the grid unchanged. 

**Example:**

Input:
```
3 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 4
```
Output:
```
0 0 0
0 3 0
0 0 4
```

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") in the specified DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj3 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), THREE))
  obj4 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), FOUR))
  O = paint(paint(cover(I, obj3), recolor(FOUR, obj3)), recolor(THREE, obj4))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Find the objects corresponding to digits '3' and '4' using `colorfilter` and `objects`.
2. **Erase and replace:**
   - Cover the object '3' with the background color using `cover`.
   - Paint the object '4' at the location of the erased object '3' using `paint` and `recolor`.
   - Paint the object '3' at the location of the erased object '4' using `paint` and `recolor`.
3. **Return output:** Return the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  three_loc = first(occurrences(I, ((THREE, (0, 0)),)))
  four_loc = first(occurrences(I, ((FOUR, (0, 0)),)))
  O = paint(paint(cover(I, {(THREE, three_loc)}), recolor(FOUR, {(THREE, three_loc)})), recolor(THREE, {(FOUR, four_loc)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find object locations:** Locate the top-left corner of objects '3' and '4' using `occurrences`.
2. **Swap colors:** 
    -  Cover the object '3' using `cover`.
    - Paint the color '4' at the location of '3' using `paint` and `recolor`.
    - Paint the color '3' at the location of '4' using `paint` and `recolor`.
3. **Return output:** Return the modified grid `O`.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj3 = asobject(crop(I, first(occurrences(I, ((THREE, (0, 0)),))), UNITY))
  obj4 = asobject(crop(I, first(occurrences(I, ((FOUR, (0, 0)),))), UNITY))
  O = paint(paint(cover(I, obj3), recolor(FOUR, obj4)), recolor(THREE, obj3))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** 
    - Extract the objects '3' and '4' by cropping a 1x1 grid at their locations using `crop`, `occurrences` and `asobject`.
2. **Swap objects:**
    - Cover the object '3' using `cover`.
    - Paint the object '4' at the location of object '3' using `paint` and `recolor`.
    - Paint the object '3' at the location of object '4' using `paint` and `recolor`.
3. **Return output:** Return the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices3 = ofcolor(I, THREE)
  indices4 = ofcolor(I, FOUR)
  O = paint(paint(cover(I, recolor(ZERO, indices3)), recolor(FOUR, indices3)), recolor(THREE, indices4))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find object indices:** Get the indices of all cells belonging to objects '3' and '4' using `ofcolor`.
2. **Swap colors at indices:**
    - Cover the object '3' by recoloring its indices to the background color (assumed to be 0) using `cover` and `recolor`. 
    - Paint the color '4' at the indices of '3' using `paint` and `recolor`.
    - Paint the color '3' at the indices of '4' using `paint` and `recolor`.
3. **Return output:** Return the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == THREE:
        O = paint(cover(O, {(THREE, (i, j))}), recolor(FOUR, {(THREE, (i, j))}))
      elif value == FOUR:
        O = paint(cover(O, {(FOUR, (i, j))}), recolor(THREE, {(FOUR, (i, j))}))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through grid:** Loop through each cell of the grid.
2. **Swap individual cells:**
   - If the cell value is '3', cover it and paint the color '4' at that location using `paint`, `cover`, and `recolor`. 
   - If the cell value is '4', cover it and paint the color '3' at that location using `paint`, `cover`, and `recolor`.
3. **Return output:** Return the modified grid `O`.
