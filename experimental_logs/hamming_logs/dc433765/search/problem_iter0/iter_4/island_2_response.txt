## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves swapping the locations of the digits '3' and '4' while keeping the rest of the grid unchanged.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj3 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), THREE))
  obj4 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), FOUR))
  O = paint(paint(cover(I, obj3), FOUR, toindices(obj3)), THREE, toindices(obj4))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify objects:** We find the objects representing the digits '3' and '4' using `colorfilter` and `objects`.
2.  **Swap colors:** We use a combination of `cover`, `paint`, and `toindices` to effectively swap the colors at the locations occupied by the objects.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  three_loc = first(occurrences(I, ((THREE, (0, 0)),)))
  four_loc = first(occurrences(I, ((FOUR, (0, 0)),)))
  O = paint(paint(cover(I, ((THREE, three_loc),)), FOUR, {four_loc}), THREE, {three_loc})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Find locations:** Instead of objects, we find the first occurrences of '3' and '4' using `occurrences`.
2.  **Swap colors:** Similar to version 1, we utilize `cover`, `paint` to swap colors at the identified locations.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj3 = asobject(crop(I, first(occurrences(I, ((THREE, (0, 0)),))), UNITY))
  obj4 = asobject(crop(I, first(occurrences(I, ((FOUR, (0, 0)),))), UNITY))
  O = paint(paint(cover(I, obj3), FOUR, toindices(obj4)), THREE, toindices(obj3))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Extract objects:** We find the location and then extract the objects representing '3' and '4' using `occurrences`, `crop`, and `asobject`.
2.  **Swap colors:** Similar to previous versions, we use `cover`, `paint`, and `toindices` to swap colors at the object locations.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  indices3 = ofcolor(I, THREE)
  indices4 = ofcolor(I, FOUR)
  O = paint(paint(cover(I, indices3), FOUR, indices3), THREE, indices4)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Find indices:** We directly identify the indices of cells containing '3' and '4' using `ofcolor`.
2.  **Swap colors:** We apply the same color swapping logic as before using `cover`, `paint`, and the obtained indices.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == THREE:
        O = paint(cover(O, {(THREE, (i, j))}), FOUR, {(i, j)})
      elif value == FOUR:
        O = paint(cover(O, {(FOUR, (i, j))}), THREE, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Iterate and swap:** We iterate through each cell of the grid. If the cell contains a '3', we replace it with '4' and vice versa using `cover` and `paint`, effectively swapping their positions.

These five versions demonstrate various approaches to achieving the desired transformation using the provided DSL. Each version utilizes different functions or combinations of functions, showcasing the flexibility and expressive power of the DSL for this task.
