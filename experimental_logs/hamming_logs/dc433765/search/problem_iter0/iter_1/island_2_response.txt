## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves swapping the locations of the digits '3' and '4' in the input grid while maintaining their original values. 

**Example:**

Input:
```
3 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 4
```

Output:
```
0 0 0
0 3 0
0 0 4
```

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    three_loc = first(occurrences(I, ((THREE, (0, 0)),)))
    four_loc = first(occurrences(I, ((FOUR, (0, 0)),)))
    O = paint(paint(fill(I, ZERO, three_loc), FOUR, three_loc), THREE, four_loc)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '3' and '4':** Find the indices (locations) of digits '3' and '4' in the input grid `I` and store them in `three_loc` and `four_loc` respectively.
2. **Replace '3' with '0':**  Fill the cell at `three_loc` with '0' using `fill`.
3. **Replace '0' with '4':** Paint the cell at `three_loc` (previously containing '3') with '4' using `paint`.
4. **Replace '4' with '3':** Paint the cell at `four_loc` (previously containing '4') with '3' using `paint`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  three_indices = ofcolor(I, THREE)
  four_indices = ofcolor(I, FOUR)
  O = fill(fill(I, FOUR, three_indices), THREE, four_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Indices:** Get all indices of '3' and '4' in the grid.
2. **Replace '3' with '4':** Fill all cells at indices in `three_indices` with '4'.
3. **Replace '4' with '3':** Fill all cells at indices in `four_indices` with '3'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  three_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I,T,F,F), THREE))
  four_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I,T,F,F), FOUR))
  O = paint(paint(cover(I, three_obj), FOUR, toindices(three_obj)), THREE, toindices(four_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Isolate the '3' and '4' objects from the grid.
2. **Cover Original Objects:** Remove the '3' and '4' objects from the grid.
3. **Paint at Swapped Locations:** Paint the '4' object at the '3' object's location and vice-versa.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == THREE:
        O = fill(O, FOUR, ((i,j),))
      elif I[i][j] == FOUR:
        O = fill(O, THREE, ((i,j),))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** Loop through each cell of the grid.
2. **Conditional Swap:** If the cell contains a '3', replace it with a '4'. If it contains a '4', replace it with a '3'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  three_obj = recolor(FOUR, first(colorfilter(objects(I,T,F,F), THREE)))
  four_obj = recolor(THREE, first(colorfilter(objects(I,T,F,F), FOUR)))
  O = paint(paint(I, three_obj), four_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Recolor:** Identify '3' and '4' objects, then create new objects with swapped colors ('3' becomes '4' and vice-versa).
2. **Paint New Objects:** Paint the newly colored objects onto the original grid.
