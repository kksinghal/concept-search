## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently swaps the positions of the digits '3' and '4' within the input grid, while maintaining their original values. 

**Example:**

Input:
```
0 0 3
0 0 0
4 0 0
```

Output:
```
0 0 4
0 0 0
3 0 0
```

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" along with their explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  three_indices = ofcolor(I, THREE)
  four_indices = ofcolor(I, FOUR)
  O = fill(fill(I, FOUR, three_indices), THREE, four_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify Indices:** Finds the indices of digits '3' and '4' using `ofcolor`.
2.  **Swap Values:**  Uses nested `fill` functions to first replace '3' with '4', then '4' with '3' at their respective indices.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  three_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I,T,F,F), THREE))
  four_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I,T,F,F), FOUR))
  O = paint(paint(cover(I, three_obj), recolor(FOUR, three_obj)), recolor(THREE, four_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Extract Objects:** Extracts the objects representing digits '3' and '4' using `objects` and `colorfilter`.
2.  **Swap and Paint:** Clears the original objects using `cover` and repaints them with swapped colors using `recolor` and `paint`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for three_loc in ofcolor(I, THREE):
    for four_loc in ofcolor(I, FOUR):
      O = switch(O, THREE, FOUR)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Iterate and Switch:** Iterates through every pair of '3' and '4' locations and uses `switch` to swap their values directly on the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  three_loc = ulcorner(ofcolor(I, THREE))
  four_loc = ulcorner(ofcolor(I, FOUR))
  O = move(move(I, toobject(three_loc, I), four_loc), toobject(four_loc, I), three_loc)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Locate and Move:** Finds the upper-left corners of '3' and '4' using `ulcorner`. 
2.  **Swap Objects:**  Moves the objects to each other's locations using `move`, effectively swapping their positions.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = replace(replace(I, THREE, FIVE), FOUR, THREE)
  O = replace(O, FIVE, FOUR)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Temporary Placeholder:** Uses a temporary placeholder value ('5') to avoid overwriting during the swap.
2.  **Two-Step Swap:** Replaces '3' with '5', then '4' with '3', and finally '5' with '4' to achieve the desired swap. 

## Conclusion

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to solving the transformation problem using the provided DSL. They showcase the flexibility of the DSL and highlight how different function combinations can achieve the same outcome.
