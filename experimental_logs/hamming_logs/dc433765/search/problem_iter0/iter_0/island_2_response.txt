## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves swapping the positions of the objects represented by the digits '3' and '4' in the input grid while maintaining their original shapes and orientations. All other digits remain in their original positions.

**Example:**

**Input:**
```
3 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 4 
```

**Output:**
```
0 0 0
0 3 0
0 0 4 
```

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
  three = ofcolor(I, THREE)
  four = ofcolor(I, FOUR)
  O = fill(fill(I, ZERO, three), THREE, four)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Object Locations:** `ofcolor` is used to find the indices of cells containing the digits '3' and '4' respectively, storing them in `three` and `four`.
2. **Erase Original Objects:** The input grid `I` is then filled with zeros at the locations stored in `three` effectively erasing the '3' object.
3. **Swap Objects:** Finally, the '3' digit is filled at the locations stored in `four`, effectively swapping the positions of the '3' and '4' objects.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
  obj3 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), THREE))
  obj4 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), FOUR))
  O = paint(paint(cover(I, obj3), recolor(THREE, obj4)), recolor(FOUR, obj3))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, F)` extracts all univalued objects from the grid. `colorfilter` then filters for objects with color '3' and '4' respectively. `first` takes the first (and assumed only) object from the filtered sets.
2. **Cover and Recolor:** The grid is cleared at the location of object '3' using `cover`. Then, object '4' is recolored to '3' and painted onto the grid. Finally, object '3' is recolored to '4' and painted onto the grid, effectively swapping the two objects.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
    three = asobject(crop(I,first(occurrences(I,((THREE,(0,0)),))),TWO_BY_TWO))
    four = asobject(crop(I,first(occurrences(I,((FOUR,(0,0)),))),TWO_BY_TWO))
    O = paint(paint(cover(I, three), recolor(THREE, four)), recolor(FOUR, three))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate and Extract Objects:** `occurrences` finds the upper-left corner locations of the objects '3' and '4'. `crop` then extracts a 2x2 subgrid containing each object. These subgrids are converted into objects using `asobject`.
2. **Cover and Recolor:** Similar to Version 2, the grid is cleared at the location of object '3'. Object '4' is then recolored to '3' and painted onto the grid, followed by object '3' being recolored to '4' and painted, achieving the swap.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
  p3 = first(occurrences(I, ((THREE, (0, 0)),)))
  p4 = first(occurrences(I, ((FOUR, (0, 0)),)))
  O = paint(paint(fill(I, ZERO, p3), THREE, p4), FOUR, p3)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate Objects:** `occurrences` finds the upper-left corner location of the '3' and '4' objects, representing their positions. 
2. **Erase and Paint:** The grid is cleared at the position of '3' using `fill`. Then, '3' is painted at the position of '4' and '4' is painted at the position of '3', effectively swapping them. This version directly manipulates the positions instead of the objects themselves.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
    obj3 = first(colorfilter(objs, THREE))
    obj4 = first(colorfilter(objs, FOUR))
    shifted_3 = shift(obj3, subtract(centerofmass(obj4), centerofmass(obj3)))
    shifted_4 = shift(obj4, subtract(centerofmass(obj3), centerofmass(obj4)))
    O = paint(paint(cover(I, obj3), shifted_3), shifted_4)
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects and Calculate Centers:**  Extract '3' and '4' objects and calculate their centers of mass using `centerofmass`.
2. **Calculate Shift Vectors:**  Calculate the vectors required to move each object to the other's center of mass using `subtract`.
3. **Shift and Paint:**  Shift both objects using the calculated vectors. Finally, clear the original positions and paint the shifted objects onto the grid, completing the swap.

Each version utilizes different DSL functions and approaches to achieve the desired object swapping, providing diverse and valid solutions to the problem.
