## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied in all input-output pairs appears to be **sorting the non-zero objects within the grid based on their values, moving the object with the smallest value to the top-most available position, and then the next smallest below it, and so on**. 

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Identify Non-Zero Objects:** The program needs to locate all distinct objects within the grid that are formed by non-zero values.
2. **Sort by Value:** These objects are then sorted based on their numerical values in ascending order. 
3. **Relocate to Top:**  Starting from the top row of the grid, the object with the smallest value is placed in the left-most available position.
4. **Sequential Placement:** The next smallest object is then placed below the previous object in the same column, and so on. The process continues for all objects in sorted order.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  sorted_objs = order(objs, lambda obj: color(obj))
  grid = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  i, j = 0, 0
  for obj in sorted_objs:
    grid = paint(grid, shift(normalize(obj), (i, j)))
    i += height(obj)
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Sort Objects:**  We extract all non-background objects (`objects` function with `without_bg=True`) and sort them by their color value (`order` function).
2. **Create Empty Canvas:** An empty grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color, is created (`canvas` function).
3. **Iterate and Place:**  We iterate through the sorted objects, normalize their position (`normalize` function), shift them to the appropriate row (`shift` function), and paint them onto the canvas (`paint` function).


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, True, False, True), key=lambda obj: color(obj))
  h, w = shape(I)
  grid = [[mostcolor(I) for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(h)]
  i = 0
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (row, col) in obj:
      grid[row + i][col] = v
    i += height(obj)
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Sort:** Similar to Version 1, we extract non-background objects and sort them based on color.
2. **Construct Grid:** We create an empty grid using nested list comprehensions, pre-filled with the background color.
3. **Direct Placement:** The code iterates through sorted objects and their cells, directly placing them onto the grid at calculated positions. This version avoids using the `normalize` and `shift` functions.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  grid = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  i = 0
  for val in sorted(palette(I) - {bg}):
    for obj in sizefilter(objs, colorcount(I, val)):
      grid = paint(grid, shift(normalize(obj), (i, 0)))
      i += height(obj)
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Sort Colors:** This version first identifies all colors present in the input (excluding background) and sorts them.
2. **Iterate through Colors:**  It iterates through each sorted color and selects objects of that color. 
3. **Place by Color:** Objects of the same color are then placed sequentially from top to bottom.



## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  non_zero_indices = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, mostcolor(I)))
  h, w = shape(I)
  sorted_indices = sorted(non_zero_indices, key=lambda loc: I[loc[0]][loc[1]])
  grid = [[mostcolor(I) for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(h)]
  i, j = 0, 0
  for row, col in sorted_indices:
    grid[i][j] = I[row][col]
    j += 1
    if j == w:
      j = 0
      i += 1
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Non-Zero Indices:** Instead of working with objects, this version identifies indices of all non-zero cells.
2. **Sort Indices:** These indices are then sorted based on the corresponding cell values.
3. **Place by Index:**  The code iterates through sorted indices and places the corresponding cell values onto the grid sequentially. 


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = sorted((toobject(obj, I) for obj in objects(I, True, False, False)), key=lambda obj: color(obj))
  grid = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  i = 0
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == bg:
      continue
    grid = paint(grid, shift(normalize(obj), (i, 0)))
    i += height(obj)
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects with Background:**  This version extracts all objects, including background objects, for potential flexibility.
2. **Sort and Filter:** Objects are sorted by color, and during placement, background objects are skipped.
3. **Simplified Placement:** The placement logic is simplified by leveraging existing functions (`normalize`, `shift`, `paint`) for clarity.
