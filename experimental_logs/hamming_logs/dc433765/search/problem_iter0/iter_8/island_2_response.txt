## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently swaps the positions of the digits "3" and "4" within the input grid while maintaining their original orientation.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  three_loc = ulcorner(ofcolor(I, THREE))
  four_loc = ulcorner(ofcolor(I, FOUR))
  O = paint(paint(cover(I, toobject(three_loc, I)), shift(toobject(three_loc, I), four_loc)), shift(toobject(four_loc, I), three_loc))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify key locations:** We find the upper-left corner locations of the digits "3" ( `three_loc`) and "4" (`four_loc`) using `ulcorner` and `ofcolor`.
2. **Create objects:** Using `toobject`, we create objects representing the digits "3" and "4" from their respective locations and the input grid `I`.
3. **Swap and paint:**  We use a combination of `cover`, `paint`, and `shift` to achieve the swap:
    * `cover(I, toobject(three_loc, I))`: Removes the "3" object from the grid.
    * `shift(toobject(three_loc, I), four_loc)`: Moves the "3" object to the location of "4".
    * `paint`: Paints the shifted "3" object onto the grid.
    * We repeat the same process for "4", moving it to "3"'s original location.
4. **Return output:**  The modified grid `O` with swapped digits is returned. 

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  three_obj = toobject(ulcorner(ofcolor(I, THREE)), I)
  four_obj = toobject(ulcorner(ofcolor(I, FOUR)), I)
  O = paint(paint(cover(I, three_obj), shift(three_obj, subtract(ulcorner(four_obj), ulcorner(three_obj)))), shift(four_obj, subtract(ulcorner(three_obj), ulcorner(four_obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object creation:** Similar to Version 1, we create objects `three_obj` and `four_obj` for digits "3" and "4".
2. **Calculate offset:**  Instead of directly using the locations, we calculate the offset (`subtract`) between the upper-left corners of the two objects. 
3. **Swap using offset:**  We utilize the calculated offset with `shift` to move the objects to their swapped positions before painting them onto the grid.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  three_indices = ofcolor(I, THREE)
  four_indices = ofcolor(I, FOUR)
  O = paint(paint(cover(I, three_indices), shift(three_indices, gravitate(three_indices, four_indices))), shift(four_indices, gravitate(four_indices, three_indices)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify indices:** We obtain the indices of cells containing "3" (`three_indices`) and "4" (`four_indices`) using `ofcolor`.
2. **Calculate gravitation:** We employ the `gravitate` function to determine the directions and distances needed to move each digit towards the other until they become adjacent.
3. **Shift and paint:** Using the calculated gravitation vectors, we shift the indices and paint the digits at their new locations on the grid.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def swap_digits(grid, val1, val2):
    loc1 = ulcorner(ofcolor(grid, val1))
    loc2 = ulcorner(ofcolor(grid, val2))
    return paint(paint(cover(grid, toobject(loc1, grid)), shift(toobject(loc1, grid), loc2)), shift(toobject(loc2, grid), loc1))
  
  O = swap_digits(I, THREE, FOUR)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Abstraction with `swap_digits` function:** We introduce a helper function `swap_digits` that generalizes the digit swapping logic for any two digit values.
2. **Apply function:** The `swap_digits` function is called with the input grid `I`, "3", and "4" to perform the swap. This promotes code reusability.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  three_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, THREE), I)
  four_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, FOUR), I)
  O = paint(cover(I, three_obj | four_obj), three_obj | shift(four_obj, subtract(ulcorner(three_obj), ulcorner(four_obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Creation:** We create objects representing the digits "3" and "4" using `toobject` and `ofcolor`.
2. **Combined Removal:** Instead of removing the objects individually, we combine them using the `|` operator and remove them together using `cover`.
3. **Shift and Combine:**  We calculate the offset between the upper-left corners of the objects using `subtract`. Then, we shift the "4" object by this offset using `shift`.  Finally, we combine the "3" object and the shifted "4" object using the `|` operator and paint them onto the grid. 
4. **Return Output:** The function returns the modified grid `O`.

These five versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL. They showcase various aspects of the language, such as object manipulation, location-based transformations, and code abstraction.
