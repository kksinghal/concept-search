## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently swaps the positions of the digits '3' and '4' while keeping the rest of the grid unchanged. 

**Example:**

Input:
```
3 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 4
```

Output:
```
0 0 0
0 3 0
0 0 4
```

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj3 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), THREE))
  obj4 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), FOUR))
  O = paint(paint(cover(I, obj3), THREE, toindices(obj4)), FOUR, toindices(obj3))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Find the objects consisting of '3' (obj3) and '4' (obj4) using `colorfilter` and `objects`.
2. **Cover original positions:** Remove both objects from the input grid (I) using `cover`.
3. **Paint '3' at '4's position:** Paint '3' at the indices where '4' was originally present using `paint` and `toindices`.
4. **Paint '4' at '3's position:** Paint '4' at the indices where '3' was originally present.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  three_loc = first(occurrences(I, ((THREE, (0, 0)),)))
  four_loc = first(occurrences(I, ((FOUR, (0, 0)),)))
  O = paint(paint(cover(I, ((THREE, three_loc),)), THREE, four_loc), FOUR, three_loc)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate digits:** Find the locations of '3' (three_loc) and '4' (four_loc) using `occurrences`.
2. **Cover '3':** Remove '3' from the input grid.
3. **Paint '3' at '4's location:** Paint '3' at the location of '4'.
4. **Paint '4' at '3's location:** Paint '4' at the location of '3'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = replace(replace(I, THREE, FIVE), FOUR, THREE)
  O = replace(O, FIVE, FOUR)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Temporary replacement:** Replace all occurrences of '3' with a temporary value '5' using `replace`.
2. **Swap '4' and '3':** Replace '4' with '3' (now at '5's position).
3. **Restore '4':** Replace the temporary value '5' back to '4'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj3 = asobject(crop(I, first(occurrences(I, ((THREE, (0, 0)),))), UNITY))
  obj4 = asobject(crop(I, first(occurrences(I, ((FOUR, (0, 0)),))), UNITY))
  O = paint(paint(cover(I, obj3), color(obj3), toindices(obj4)), color(obj4), toindices(obj3))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** Extract the single-cell objects containing '3' and '4' using `crop`, `occurrences`, and `asobject`.
2. **Follow the logic of Version 1:** Use the same paint-and-cover logic as Version 1, but with a generalized approach to object color using `color`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  three_indices = ofcolor(I, THREE)
  four_indices = ofcolor(I, FOUR)
  O = fill(fill(I, ZERO, three_indices), THREE, four_indices)
  O = fill(O, FOUR, three_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find indices:** Get the indices of all '3's (three_indices) and '4's (four_indices) using `ofcolor`.
2. **Clear and paint:** 
    - Fill the positions of '3' with '0' (or any placeholder value).
    - Fill the positions of '4' with '3'.
    - Fill the original positions of '3' with '4'.

These five versions provide diverse approaches to achieve the same grid transformation, showcasing different DSL function combinations and logic flow.
