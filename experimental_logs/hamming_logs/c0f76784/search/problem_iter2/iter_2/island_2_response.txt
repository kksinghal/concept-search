## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the grid (considering each digit as a distinct object) and then modifying these objects based on their properties and positions. Specifically, the transformation seems to follow these rules:

* **Object Expansion:** Objects with value '8' are expanded vertically downwards.
* **Value Replacement:** The newly added cells during expansion take on the value '7'.
* **Boundary Preservation:** The expansion only occurs within the existing boundaries of the object. No new columns are created.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I)  # Identify objects without background
    expanded_objs = set()
    for obj in objs:
        if 8 in palette(obj):  # Check if object contains color '8'
            top = uppermost(obj)
            bottom = lowermost(obj)
            left = leftmost(obj)
            right = rightmost(obj)
            for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
                for j in range(left, right + 1):
                    if (i, j) in toindices(obj):
                        expanded_objs.add((7 if grid[i][j] == 8 else grid[i][j], (i, j)))  # Expand downwards, replacing '8' with '7'
                    elif i > top and (i - 1, j) in toindices(obj):
                        expanded_objs.add((7, (i, j)))  # Fill newly added cells with '7'
        else:
            expanded_objs.add(obj)  # Keep other objects unchanged
    O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), frozenset(expanded_objs))  # Paint expanded objects onto a blank canvas
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:** We start by identifying all objects in the input grid using `fgpartition`.
2. **Expansion Logic:**
    * We iterate through each object. If an object contains the value '8', we determine its boundaries.
    * For each cell within the object's bounding box, we check:
        * If the cell is part of the original object, we add it to the `expanded_objs` set, replacing '8' with '7'.
        * If the cell is below the object and its upper neighbor was part of the object, we add it to `expanded_objs` with the value '7'.
    * Objects without the value '8' are added to `expanded_objs` without modification.
3. **Output Generation:** Finally, we paint the `expanded_objs` onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  def expand_obj(obj):
    if 8 in palette(obj):
      return recolor(7, toindices(obj) | {(i+1, j) for (i, j) in toindices(obj) if i < lowermost(obj)})
    return obj
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), frozenset(apply(expand_obj, objs)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:** Similar to Version 1, we identify objects using `fgpartition`.
2. **Expansion Logic:**
    * Define a helper function `expand_obj` which:
        * Checks if the object contains '8'.
        * If so, it recolors the object to '7' and adds cells below each object cell (except the bottom row) to the object.
        * If not, it returns the object unmodified.
    * Apply `expand_obj` to each object in `objs` using `apply`.
3. **Output Generation:** Paint the expanded objects onto a blank canvas like in Version 1.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(7, {(i + k, j) for (i, j) in toindices(obj) for k in range(2) if (i == uppermost(obj) and grid[i][j] == 8) or (k == 0)}), fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version compresses the logic into a single line using nested functions and lambda expressions.

1. **Object Identification:**  `fgpartition(I)` identifies objects.
2. **Expansion & Recoloring:**
    *  A lambda function is applied to each object, which:
       *  Iterates through each cell and its lower neighbor.
       *  If the cell is in the top row and has value '8', or if it's the original cell (k=0), it's included in a new set with color '7'.
3. **Painting:** The expanded and recolored cells are merged and painted onto the input grid.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    def expand_down(obj):
      shifted = shift(obj, (1, 0))
      return (obj | recolor(7, toindices(shifted) & backdrop(obj))) if 8 in palette(obj) else obj
    O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), frozenset(apply(expand_down, objs)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:** Objects are identified with `fgpartition`.
2. **Expansion Logic:**
    * `expand_down` function:
        * Shifts the object downwards.
        * If the object contains '8', it merges the original object with the shifted object after recoloring it to '7' and only keeping the intersection with the original object's backdrop.
        * If the object doesn't contain '8', it's returned unmodified.
3. **Output Generation:** Expanded objects are painted onto a blank canvas.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def process_cell(i, j):
    return 7 if (i > 0 and I[i - 1][j] == 8) or I[i][j] == 8 else I[i][j]
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  O = tuple(tuple(process_cell(i, j) for j in range(len(I[0]))) for i in range(len(I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Cell-wise Processing:** Instead of explicitly identifying objects, this version processes the grid cell by cell.
2. **Expansion & Recoloring:**
    * `process_cell` function:
        * For each cell, it checks if the cell above contains '8' or if the current cell itself contains '8'.
        * If either condition is true, it assigns the value '7' to the current cell in the output grid.
        * Otherwise, it keeps the original value.
3. **Output Generation:** The processed grid `O` is returned as the output.


Each of these versions provides a distinct way to achieve the desired transformation using the DSL functions. Versions 1 and 2 are more explicit in their object handling, while versions 3, 4 and 5 offer more compact and potentially more efficient solutions.
