## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects containing the digit '8'.  It extends these objects downward by one cell, filling the new cell with the digit '7'.  

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0:** The object containing '8's in the top-right corner extends downwards. The newly added cells are filled with '7'.
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the object with '8's extends downwards. Notice the '6' within the object remains unchanged.
* **Input_2:** The transformation is applied to two separate objects containing '8's, extending both downwards and filling the new cells with '7's. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_obj(obj):
    if 8 in palette(obj):
      return recolor(7, toindices(obj) | {(i + 1, j) for i, j in toindices(obj)})
    return obj
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), frozenset(apply(extend_obj, fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Divides the input grid `I` into objects excluding the background color.
2. **`apply(extend_obj, ...)`:** Applies the `extend_obj` function to each object.
3. **`extend_obj(obj)`:** Checks if the object contains the color '8'. If so, it returns a new object with the color '7' at the indices of the original object and one row below. If not, it returns the original object.
4. **`frozenset(...)`:** Converts the set of transformed objects back into a frozenset.
5. **`paint(canvas(...), ...)`:** Paints the transformed objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(7, {(i + 1, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if i < lowermost(obj)}) if 8 in palette(obj) else frozenset(), fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Same as in Version 1.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: ..., ...)`:** Applies a lambda function to each object.
3. **`lambda obj: ...`:** This lambda function checks for the presence of '8' in the object's palette. If found, it creates a set of indices one row below the existing object's indices and recolors them to '7'. If '8' is not present, it returns an empty frozenset.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges all the newly created index sets into a single frozenset.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the recoloured indices (representing the downward extension) onto the original input grid `I`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_down(obj):
    if 8 in palette(obj):
      return recolor(7, {(i + 1, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if (i + 1, j) not in toindices(obj)})
    return frozenset()
  return paint(I, merge(apply(extend_down, fgpartition(I)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Divides the input into objects.
2. **`apply(extend_down, ...)`:** Applies the `extend_down` function to each object.
3. **`extend_down(obj)`:**  Checks for the color '8' in the object. If found, it calculates indices one row below and only includes those not already part of the object, preventing overlapping extensions. It then recolors these indices to '7'. If '8' is absent, it returns an empty frozenset.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the sets of extended indices.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged indices onto the original input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def process_object(obj):
        if 8 in palette(obj):
            return recolor(7, toindices(shift(obj, DOWN)) - toindices(obj))
        return frozenset()
    return paint(I, merge(apply(process_object, fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Divides the input into objects.
2. **`apply(process_object, ...)`:** Applies the `process_object` function to each object.
3. **`process_object(obj)`:** Checks if the object contains the color '8'. If it does, it shifts the entire object down by one unit using `shift(obj, DOWN)`. It then calculates the difference between the shifted object's indices and the original object's indices using `toindices(shift(obj, DOWN)) - toindices(obj)`. This difference represents the new cells to be colored. Finally, it recolors these new cells to '7'. If the object does not contain '8', it returns an empty frozenset.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges all the new cell indices from all the objects.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the new cell indices onto the original input grid `I`. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(7,  {(i + 1, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if i < len(I) - 1 and I[i + 1][j] == mostcolor(I)} ) if 8 in palette(obj) else frozenset(), fgpartition(I))))

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Divides the input grid into objects.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: ..., ...)`:** Applies a lambda function to each object.
3. **`lambda obj: ...`:** Checks for the presence of '8' in the object. If found, it iterates through the object's indices. For each index `(i, j)`, it verifies if `i` is within the grid bounds and if the cell below `(i + 1, j)` contains the background color (`mostcolor(I)`). If both conditions hold, it includes this index `(i + 1, j)` for recoloring.
4. **`recolor(7, ...)`:**  Recolors the collected indices to '7', effectively extending the object downwards.
5. **`merge(...)`:** Merges all the extended indices from different objects.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged, recoloured indices onto the original input grid.
