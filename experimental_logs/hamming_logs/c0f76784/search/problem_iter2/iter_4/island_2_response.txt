## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects containing the color '8' downwards by one cell and recoloring them to '7'. Other objects remain unchanged.

**Example Breakdown:**

- In Input_0, the '8's in the top-right object are extended downwards, turning the object into a solid '7' block. 
- In Input_1, the '8's in the two objects on the right are extended downwards, forming larger '7' objects.
- In Input_2,  only the '8's in the top-right object are extended downwards, the bottom-right object is unmodified as it does not contain any '8's.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def expand_obj(obj):
    if 8 in palette(obj):
      expanded_indices = toindices(obj) | {(i + 1, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if i < lowermost(obj)}
      return recolor(7, expanded_indices)
    return obj
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), frozenset(apply(expand_obj, fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Extracts all objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **`apply(expand_obj, ...)`:** Applies the `expand_obj` function to each object.
3. **`expand_obj(obj)`:** 
    - Checks if the object contains the color '8' using `8 in palette(obj)`.
    - If it does:
        - `toindices(obj) | {(i + 1, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if i < lowermost(obj)}`: Creates a new set of indices that includes the original object's indices and indices one row below, effectively expanding the object downwards.
        - `recolor(7, ...)`: Recolors the expanded set of indices to '7'.
    - If it doesn't, it returns the object unchanged.
4. **`frozenset(...)`:** Converts the result of `apply` into a frozenset of objects.
5. **`paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), ...)`:**  Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid and paints the transformed objects onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    def extend_down(obj):
        return recolor(7, toindices(obj) | {(i + 1, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if i < lowermost(obj)}) if 8 in palette(obj) else obj
    return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), frozenset(obj if 8 not in palette(obj) else extend_down(obj) for obj in objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Extracts objects (excluding background) from the input grid.
2. **`extend_down(obj)`:**  This function is applied to objects containing '8'. It expands the object downwards and recolors it to '7'.
3. **`paint(canvas(...), ...)`:** Creates a blank canvas and paints the transformed objects onto it. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      7 if any(8 == I[i + k][j] for k in range(2) if 0 <= i + k < len(I)) else I[i][j] 
      for j in range(len(I[0]))
    ) for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`for i in range(len(I))`:** Iterates through each row.
2. **`for j in range(len(I[0]))`:** Iterates through each cell in the row.
3. **`any(8 == I[i + k][j] for k in range(2) if 0 <= i + k < len(I))`:** Checks if the current cell or the one below it contains '8', ensuring we don't go out of bounds.
4. **`7 if ... else I[i][j]`:** If an '8' is found, the current cell is replaced with '7', otherwise it keeps its original value.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_cell(i, j, obj):
    return 7 if (i, j) in toindices(obj) and any(8 == I[r][j] for r in range(i, min(i + 2, len(I)))) else I[i][j]
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      process_cell(i, j, obj) 
      for j in range(len(I[0]))
    ) for obj in fgpartition(I) for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Extracts objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **`process_cell(i, j, obj)`:** This function checks if a cell at (i, j) belongs to an object and has an '8' below it. If so, it changes the cell value to '7'.
3. The nested loops iterate over each object, row, and cell of the grid, applying `process_cell` to modify the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def expand_downwards(grid, obj):
        for i, j in toindices(obj):
            if 8 == grid[i][j] and i + 1 < len(grid):
                grid = fill(grid, 7, {(i, j), (i + 1, j)})
        return grid
    return merge(apply(rbind(expand_downwards, I), fgpartition(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Extracts objects from the input, excluding the background.
2. **`expand_downwards(grid, obj)`:** Expands an object downwards by one cell and fills it with '7' if the object contains '8'.
3. **`rbind(expand_downwards, I)`:** Creates a partially applied function with the grid (I) fixed as the first argument to `expand_downwards`.
4. **`apply(..., fgpartition(I))`:** Applies the partially applied `expand_downwards` function to each object. 
5. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the modified objects back into a single grid.
