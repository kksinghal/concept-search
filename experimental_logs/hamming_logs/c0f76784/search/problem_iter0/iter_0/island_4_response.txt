## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the input grid (clusters of the same digit) and applying specific color changes based on their position and shape. 

- **Outbox Highlighting:** The area surrounding each object (its "outbox") is highlighted with a specific color. This is evident in all outputs where digits 7 and 8 form the outbox.
- **Shape-Dependent Color Change:**  The color of an object changes based on its shape. Specifically:
    - **Horizontal Lines:** Horizontal lines of digits are changed to 8 (see Output_0, Output_1, Output_2).
    - **Vertical Lines:** Vertical lines of digits are changed to 7 (see Output_0, Output_1, Output_2).
    - **Single Cells:** Single cell objects are changed to 6 (see Output_0, Output_1). 


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  outboxes = mapply(outbox, objs)
  O = fill(I, SEVEN, outboxes)
  for obj in objs:
    if hline(obj):
      O = fill(O, EIGHT, toindices(obj))
    elif vline(obj):
      O = fill(O, SEVEN, toindices(obj))
    elif size(obj) == 1:
      O = fill(O, SIX, toindices(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Highlight Outboxes:** `mapply(outbox, objs)` finds the outbox of each object and `fill(I, SEVEN, outboxes)` fills those outboxes with the digit 7 in the initial output grid `O`.
3. **Shape-Based Color Change:** The code iterates through each object:
    - `hline(obj)` checks if the object is a horizontal line. If true, `fill(O, EIGHT, toindices(obj))` fills the object with 8.
    - `vline(obj)` checks if the object is a vertical line. If true, `fill(O, SEVEN, toindices(obj))` fills the object with 7.
    - `size(obj) == 1` checks if the object is a single cell. If true, `fill(O, SIX, toindices(obj))` fills the object with 6.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  hlines = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), hline)
  vlines = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), vline)
  single_cells = sizefilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 1)
  outboxes = mapply(outbox, objects(I, T, F, T))
  O = fill(I, SEVEN, outboxes)
  O = fill(O, EIGHT, hlines)
  O = fill(O, SEVEN, vlines)
  O = fill(O, SIX, single_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects by Shape:** This version first identifies objects of specific shapes:
    - `mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), hline)` finds all horizontal lines.
    - `mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), vline)` finds all vertical lines.
    - `sizefilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 1)` finds all single-cell objects.
2. **Highlight Outboxes:** Similar to Version 1, this version finds and fills the outboxes of all objects with 7.
3. **Shape-Based Color Change:** The code directly fills the pre-identified shapes with their corresponding colors: 8 for horizontal lines, 7 for vertical lines, and 6 for single cells.

## Program Version 3: 

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = fill(O, SEVEN, outbox(obj))
    if width(obj) > height(obj):
      O = fill(O, EIGHT, toindices(obj))
    elif height(obj) > width(obj):
      O = fill(O, SEVEN, toindices(obj))
    elif size(obj) == 1:
      O = fill(O, SIX, toindices(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** This version identifies all objects in the input grid.
2. **Iterative Filling:** It iterates through each object and performs the following:
   -  Fills the outbox of each object with 7.
   -  Compares the width and height of the object to determine its shape:
     - If `width(obj) > height(obj)`, it's a horizontal line, filled with 8.
     - If `height(obj) > width(obj)`, it's a vertical line, filled with 7.
     - If `size(obj) == 1`, it's a single cell, filled with 6. 

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        O = fill(O, SEVEN, delta(obj))  # Highlight the delta instead of outbox
        if hline(obj):
            O = fill(O, EIGHT, toindices(obj))
        elif vline(obj):
            O = fill(O, SEVEN, toindices(obj))
        elif size(obj) == 1:
            O = fill(O, SIX, toindices(obj))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **Delta Highlighting:** This version highlights the "delta" of each object - the cells directly surrounding it but not part of it - with the digit 7 using `fill(O, SEVEN, delta(obj))`. 
- **Shape-Based Changes:** The rest of the logic remains the same as Version 1, identifying horizontal lines, vertical lines, and single cells, and filling them with the respective digits.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    def transform_object(obj):
        if hline(obj): return fill(I, EIGHT, toindices(obj))
        if vline(obj): return fill(I, SEVEN, toindices(obj))
        if size(obj) == 1: return fill(I, SIX, toindices(obj))
        return I
    
    O = fill(I, SEVEN, mapply(outbox, objects(I, T, F, T)))
    return last(apply(transform_object, objects(I, T, F, T))) 
```

**Explanation:**

- **Function for Object Transformation:** This version defines a helper function `transform_object(obj)` that takes an object as input and applies the shape-based color changes: 8 for horizontal lines, 7 for vertical lines, and 6 for single cells. If the object doesn't match any of these shapes, it returns the original grid. 
- **Applying the Transformation:** 
   - It first fills the outboxes of all objects with 7.
   - Then, it uses `apply(transform_object, objects(I, T, F, T))` to apply the `transform_object` function to each object in the grid. 
   - Finally, it uses `last(...)` to select the final transformed grid from the results.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version prioritizes different aspects, such as code readability, efficiency, and the use of specific DSL functions.
