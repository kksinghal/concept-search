## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be recoloring specific parts of objects based on their size and position:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The single '5' object remains unchanged.
* The 3x5 object has its middle column recolored to '6'.
* The 5x3 object has its middle row recolored to '8'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The single '5' objects remain unchanged.
* The 5x3 object has its middle row recolored to '8'.
* The 3x5 object has its middle column recolored to '7'.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The single '5' objects remain unchanged.
* The 6x1 object has its middle two elements recolored to '8'.
* The 1x6 object has its middle two elements recolored to '7'.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  obj_list = list(objs)
  for i, obj in enumerate(obj_list):
    h = height(obj)
    w = width(obj)
    if h > 1 and w > 1:
      if h > w:
        middle_row = uppermost(obj) + h // 2
        obj_list[i] = recolor(8, frozenset((middle_row, j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)))
      else:
        middle_col = leftmost(obj) + w // 2
        obj_list[i] = recolor(h + 5, frozenset((i, middle_col) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)))
  O = paint(I, merge(frozenset(obj_list)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Use `objects(I, T, F, T)` to get a set of all objects in the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:** Loop through each object:
   - Calculate height (`h`) and width (`w`).
   - If both `h` and `w` are greater than 1, it's not a single-cell object.
   - If `h > w`, recolor the middle row to '8'.
   - If `w > h`, recolor the middle column to '6' for horizontal objects, and '7' for vertical objects by adding height to base color 5. 
3. **Paint Objects:** Use `paint()` to draw the modified objects back onto the input grid.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def recolor_obj(obj):
    h = height(obj)
    w = width(obj)
    if h > 1 and w > 1:
      if h > w:
        return recolor(8, shift(crop(asindices(I), ulcorner(obj), (h, 1)), (h // 2, 0)))
      else:
        return recolor(w + 5, shift(crop(asindices(I), ulcorner(obj), (1, w)), (0, w // 2)))
    return obj
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  recolored_objs = apply(recolor_obj, objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`recolor_obj` Function:** Defines a function to recolor an object based on its dimensions.
    - Extracts the middle row or column as a single-cell width/height patch using `crop` and `shift`.
    - Recolors the extracted patch using `recolor`.
2. **Identify Objects:** Identifies all objects in the grid.
3. **Apply Recoloring:** Applies the `recolor_obj` function to each object using `apply`.
4. **Paint Objects:** Paints the recolored objects onto the input grid.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def process_object(obj):
    h, w = shape(obj)
    if min(h, w) > 1:
      color_to_fill = 8 if h > w else w + 5
      center_i, center_j = centerofmass(obj)
      return recolor(color_to_fill, frozenset({(center_i, j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)}) if h > w else {(i, center_j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)})
    return obj
  O = paint(I, merge(apply(process_object, objects(I, T, F, T))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`process_object` Function:** Defines a function to handle each object.
    - Calculates the shape and determines if it needs recoloring.
    - Determines the color to fill based on the shape.
    - Uses `centerofmass` to get the center coordinates.
    - Recolors the middle row or column based on the shape.
2. **Process and Paint:** Applies `process_object` to each object and paints the results on the grid.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    def modify_object(obj):
        h, w = shape(obj)
        if h > 1 and w > 1:
            if h > w:
                offset = (h // 2, 0)
                new_patch = shift(crop(asindices(I), ulcorner(obj), (1, w)), offset)
                return recolor(8, new_patch)
            else:
                offset = (0, w // 2)
                new_patch = shift(crop(asindices(I), ulcorner(obj), (h, 1)), offset)
                return recolor(h+5, new_patch)
        return obj

    objects_set = objects(I, T, F, T)
    modified_objects = frozenset(modify_object(obj) for obj in objects_set)
    final_grid = paint(I, merge(modified_objects))
    return final_grid

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`modify_object` Function:** This function takes an object and recolors its middle row or column based on its dimensions. It calculates the offset needed to reach the middle and uses `crop` and `shift` to get the desired cells.
2. **Object Processing:**  It iterates through each object in the grid using `objects` and applies the `modify_object` function.
3. **Final Output:** Finally, it paints the modified objects onto the original grid using `paint` and returns the result.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def transform_object(obj):
    if len(obj) > 1:
      upmost_row = uppermost(obj)
      leftmost_col = leftmost(obj)
      h, w = shape(obj)
      if h > w:
        middle_row_indices = frozenset((upmost_row + h // 2, j) for j in range(leftmost_col, leftmost_col + w))
        return recolor(8, middle_row_indices)
      else:
        middle_col_indices = frozenset((i, leftmost_col + w // 2) for i in range(upmost_row, upmost_row + h))
        return recolor(h + 5, middle_col_indices)
    return obj

  objects_in_grid = objects(I, T, F, T)
  transformed_objects = frozenset(transform_object(obj) for obj in objects_in_grid)
  output_grid = paint(I, merge(transformed_objects))
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`transform_object` Function:** This function identifies the middle row or column of an object and recolors it. 
    - It calculates the indices of the middle row/column based on the object's height and width. 
    - If the object is taller than it is wide, it recolors the middle row to '8'. 
    - If it's wider than it is tall, it recolors the middle column to '6' if horizontal, and '7' if vertical by adding the height to 5.
2. **Object Iteration and Transformation:** It iterates through each object in the grid and applies the `transform_object` function.
3. **Output Generation:** Finally, it paints the transformed objects onto the original grid and returns the result. 

These different versions use various DSL functions and strategies to achieve the same output, highlighting the flexibility of the provided DSL.
