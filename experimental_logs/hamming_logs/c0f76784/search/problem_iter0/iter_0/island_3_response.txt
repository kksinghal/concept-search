## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place in each example involves recoloring specific cells within each object based on their position relative to the object's center. Let's break down the pattern:

* **Central Column:** The column containing the object's center remains unchanged.
* **Columns Left of Center:**  Moving leftward from the center, each column is recolored sequentially with a new color (6, then 7, etc.).
* **Columns Right of Center:** Moving rightward from the center, each column is recolored sequentially with a new color (8, then 9, etc.).

**Example:**

In Output_0, the top-right object (all 5s) has its central column unchanged. To the left, the adjacent column becomes 8, and to the right, the adjacent column becomes 8.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  new_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    center_j = centerofmass(obj)[1]
    new_obj = set()
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if j < center_j:
        new_obj.add((6 + center_j - j - 1, (i, j)))
      elif j > center_j:
        new_obj.add((8 + j - center_j - 1, (i, j)))
      else:
        new_obj.add((v, (i, j)))
    new_objs.add(frozenset(new_obj))
  O = paint(I, merge(new_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `fgpartition(I)` separates the input grid into distinct objects, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate Objects:**  The code iterates through each object (`obj`).
3. **Find Center:** `centerofmass(obj)[1]` calculates the column index (`j`) of the object's center.
4. **Recolor Logic:**  
    - `j < center_j`:  For columns left of the center, recolor using `6 + center_j - j - 1`.
    - `j > center_j`:  For columns right of the center, recolor using `8 + j - center_j - 1`.
    - `j == center_j`: Keep the original color.
5. **Rebuild Grid:** The modified objects are merged (`merge`) and painted back onto the input grid (`paint`).


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  recolored_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    center_col = centerofmass(obj)[1]
    left_part = sfilter(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1] < center_col)
    right_part = sfilter(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1] > center_col)
    recolored_left =  frozenset({(6 + center_col - j - 1, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in left_part})
    recolored_right = frozenset({(8 + j - center_col - 1, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in right_part})
    recolored_objs.add(frozenset(recolored_left | obj | recolored_right))
  O = paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object & Center Identification:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Split Object:**  The object is split into three parts: left of center (`left_part`), right of center (`right_part`), and the central column (implicitly kept unchanged).
3. **Recolor Parts:** The `recolored_left` and `recolored_right` sets apply the color logic using set comprehension.
4. **Recombine and Paint:**  The recolored parts are combined with the original central column and painted onto the grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        center_j = centerofmass(obj)[1]
        for dj in range(1, width(obj)):
            if center_j - dj >= 0:
                O = fill(O, 6 + dj - 1, shift(toindices(obj), (0, -dj)))
            if center_j + dj < len(I[0]):
                O = fill(O, 8 + dj - 1, shift(toindices(obj), (0, dj))) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Iterate Columns:**  Instead of recoloring individual cells, this version iterates through columns (`dj`) outward from the center.
3. **Fill Columns:**  `shift(toindices(obj), (0, -dj))` and `shift(toindices(obj), (0, dj))` calculate the indices of columns to the left and right of the center, respectively. `fill` is used to recolor these columns.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def recolor_object(obj):
    c = centerofmass(obj)[1]
    return frozenset(
      (6 + c - j - 1 if j < c else 8 + j - c - 1 if j > c else v, (i, j))
      for v, (i, j) in obj
    )
  O = paint(I, merge(apply(recolor_object, fgpartition(I))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`recolor_object` Function:** This version defines a helper function to encapsulate the recoloring logic for a single object. It uses a nested conditional expression within a set comprehension for conciseness.
2. **Apply and Paint:** `apply` applies `recolor_object` to each object, and the results are merged and painted back onto the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def process_row(i, row):
    for obj in sfilter(fgpartition(row), lambda o: len(o) > 1):
      center_j = centerofmass(obj)[1]
      for j in range(len(row)):
        if (v, (0, j)) in obj:
          if j < center_j:
            row = fill(row, 6 + center_j - j - 1, {(0, j)})
          elif j > center_j:
            row = fill(row, 8 + j - center_j - 1, {(0, j)})
    return row
  O = tuple(process_row(i, row) for i, row in enumerate(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Row-wise Processing:** This version processes the grid row by row.
2. **`process_row` Function:**  This function identifies objects within a row, finds the object center's column index, and recolors cells based on their position relative to the center.
3. **Apply to Rows:** `process_row` is applied to each row, and the modified rows are combined to form the output grid.
