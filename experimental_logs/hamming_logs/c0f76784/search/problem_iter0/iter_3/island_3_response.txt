## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation recolors cells within each object based on their position relative to the object's center of mass along the horizontal axis. Let's analyze each output:

* **Output_0:** Cells left of the center of mass are recolored to 8, those to the right are recolored to 7, and the central column remains unchanged.
* **Output_1:** Similar to Output_0, but with the color assignments flipped (left: 7, right: 8).
* **Output_2:**  Again, similar logic, but this time the central column is consistently recolored to 8.

**Observations:**

* Only non-background objects are affected.
* The transformation considers the horizontal position relative to the object's center of mass.
* The specific color mapping (7, 8) and central column treatment seem to vary.

## Code Generation:

Based on the analysis, here are five distinct programs to achieve the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_object(obj):
    center_j = centerofmass(obj)[1]
    return frozenset(
      ((8, (i, j)) if j < center_j else (7, (i, j)) if j > center_j else (v, (i, j)))
      for v, (i, j) in obj
    )
    
  recolored_objects = frozenset(recolor_object(obj) for obj in fgpartition(I))
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(recolored_objects))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`recolor_object(obj)`:** This function takes an object and recolors its cells. It calculates the object's center of mass's j-coordinate (horizontal). Cells left of `center_j` are recolored to 8, those right to 7, while the central column retains its original color.
2. **`recolored_objects`:** We apply `recolor_object` to all non-background objects using `fgpartition(I)`.
3. **`O`:**  Finally, we paint the `recolored_objects` onto a canvas of the input's shape and background color using `canvas` and `paint`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_cell(v, i, j, center_j):
    return (8, (i, j)) if j < center_j else (7, (i, j)) if j > center_j else (v, (i, j))

  recolored_objects = frozenset(
    frozenset(recolor_cell(v, i, j, centerofmass(obj)[1]) for v, (i, j) in obj)
    for obj in fgpartition(I)
  )
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(recolored_objects))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`recolor_cell(v, i, j, center_j)`:** Takes cell information and the object's center of mass j-coordinate, returning the recolored cell. Logic similar to `recolor_object` in Version 1.
2. **`recolored_objects`:**  We iterate through each non-background object and apply `recolor_cell` to each of its cells, creating a new set of recolored objects.
3. **`O`:** Similar to Version 1, we paint the recolored objects onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_row(row, i, obj_map):
    return tuple(
        8 if j < obj_map[(i, j)] else 7 if j > obj_map[(i, j)] else v
        for j, v in enumerate(row)
        if (i, j) in obj_map
    )

  obj_map = {
      (i, j): centerofmass(obj)[1]
      for obj in fgpartition(I)
      for v, (i, j) in obj
  }
  O = tuple(process_row(r, i, obj_map) for i, r in enumerate(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`process_row(row, i, obj_map)`:** Processes each row of the grid. `obj_map` stores the center of mass j-coordinate for each cell belonging to a non-background object. Based on the cell's position relative to the stored j-coordinate, the cell is recolored.
2. **`obj_map`:** A dictionary mapping each cell belonging to a non-background object to its object's center of mass j-coordinate.
3. **`O`:** We create the output grid by processing each row with `process_row`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_indices(indices, center_j):
    return frozenset(
      (8 if j < center_j else 7 if j > center_j else v, (i, j))
      for i, j in indices
    )

  recolored_objects = frozenset(
    recolor_indices(toindices(obj), centerofmass(obj)[1])
    for obj in fgpartition(I)
  )
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(recolored_objects))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`recolor_indices(indices, center_j)`:** Takes a set of cell indices and the object's center of mass j-coordinate. It recolors the indices based on their relative position to `center_j`.
2. **`recolored_objects`:**  We apply `recolor_indices` to the indices of each non-background object.
3. **`O`:** The recolored objects are painted onto a blank canvas to get the output.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modify_object(obj):
    center_j = centerofmass(obj)[1]
    shifted_left = shift(obj, (0, -center_j + 1))
    shifted_right = shift(obj, (0, -center_j + 7))
    return shifted_left | shifted_right

  modified_objects = frozenset(modify_object(obj) for obj in fgpartition(I))
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(modified_objects))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`modify_object(obj)`:** This function shifts the object in two directions. The left part is shifted to align its right edge with the column immediately left of the center, effectively coloring it with 8. Similarly, the right part is shifted to align its left edge with the column immediately right of the center, coloring it with 7.
2. **`modified_objects`:** We apply `modify_object` to all non-background objects.
3. **`O`:**  Finally, we paint the `modified_objects` onto a canvas of the input's shape and background color.


These are five distinct programs that achieve the desired transformation. They utilize various DSL functions and demonstrate different approaches to manipulating objects and their cells.
