## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently splits each distinct object (a connected group of identical non-zero digits) in the input grid into two halves along the vertical axis. The left half retains the original color, while the right half is recolored. The recoloring follows these rules:

* **Rule 1:** If a cell lies exactly on the vertical line dividing the object in half, it retains its original color.
* **Rule 2:** If a cell lies to the left of the dividing line, it is recolored to 8.
* **Rule 3:** If a cell lies to the right of the dividing line, it is recolored to 7.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" utilizing the provided DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def ccgecabciejfeaafiedfbceafjggeebe(I):
  def recolor_cell(v, i, j, center_j):
    if j < center_j:
      return 8, (i, j)
    elif j > center_j:
      return 7, (i, j)
    else:
      return v, (i, j)

  def process_row(row, i, obj_map, center_j_map):
    return tuple(
        recolor_cell(v, i, j, center_j_map[(i, j)])
        for j, v in enumerate(row)
        if (i, j) in obj_map
    )

  obj_map = {
      (i, j) for obj in fgpartition(I) for v, (i, j) in obj
  }
  center_j_map = {
      (i, j): centerofmass(obj)[1]
      for obj in fgpartition(I)
      for v, (i, j) in obj
  }
  O = tuple(process_row(r, i, obj_map, center_j_map) for i, r in enumerate(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`recolor_cell` function:** Determines the new color of a cell based on its position relative to the object's center.
2. **`process_row` function:**  Applies `recolor_cell` to each cell belonging to an object in a row.
3. **`obj_map`:** A set containing indices of all cells belonging to any object.
4. **`center_j_map`:** A dictionary mapping each cell in an object to the column index of that object's center of mass.
5. **Final loop:** Iterates through each row, applying the `process_row` function to recolor the cells and constructs the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def ccgecabciejfeaafiedfbceafjggeebe(I):
  def recolor_object(obj):
    center_j = centerofmass(obj)[1]
    return frozenset(
        (8 if j < center_j else 7 if j > center_j else v, (i, j))
        for v, (i, j) in obj
    )

  O = paint(I, merge(apply(recolor_object, fgpartition(I))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`recolor_object` function:** Takes an object and returns a new object with the same indices but recolored according to the rules.
2. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Extracts all foreground objects from the input grid.
3. **`apply(recolor_object, fgpartition(I))`:** Applies the `recolor_object` function to each object.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the recolored objects.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the merged, recolored objects onto a copy of the input grid to generate the output.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def ccgecabciejfeaafiedfbceafjggeebe(I):
  def split_and_recolor(obj):
    cj = centerofmass(obj)[1]
    left = frozenset((8, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < cj)
    right = frozenset((7, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j > cj)
    center = frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j == cj)
    return left, right, center

  recolored_parts = merge(apply(split_and_recolor, fgpartition(I)))
  O = paint(I, merge(recolored_parts))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`split_and_recolor` function:** Splits an object into three parts: left, right, and center, recoloring each part according to the rules.
2. **`apply(split_and_recolor, fgpartition(I))`:** Applies the splitting and recoloring function to each object in the input.
3. **`merge(...)`:** Merges all the resulting parts.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the merged parts onto a copy of the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def ccgecabciejfeaafiedfbceafjggeebe(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  recolored_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    center_j = centerofmass(obj)[1]
    new_obj = frozenset()
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if j < center_j:
        new_obj = new_obj.union(frozenset({(8, (i, j))}))
      elif j > center_j:
        new_obj = new_obj.union(frozenset({(7, (i, j))}))
      else:
        new_obj = new_obj.union(frozenset({(v, (i, j))}))
    recolored_objs = recolored_objs.union(frozenset({new_obj}))
  O = paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:**  Iterates through each foreground object.
2. **Calculate center:** Calculates the column index of the object's center of mass.
3. **Recolor cells:**  Iterates through each cell in the object, recoloring it based on its position relative to the center.
4. **Paint recolored objects:**  Paints the recolored objects onto a copy of the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def ccgecabciejfeaafiedfbceafjggeebe(I):
  O = I
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    center_j = centerofmass(obj)[1]
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if j < center_j:
        O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j))})
      elif j > center_j:
        O = paint(O, {(7, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** Iterates through each foreground object.
2. **Calculate center:**  Calculates the column index of the object's center of mass.
3. **Recolor cells:** Iterates through each cell in the object and directly paints the cell on the output grid with the new color based on its position relative to the center. 


These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the target transformation using the DSL functions. They showcase different levels of abstraction, from directly manipulating individual cells to operating on entire objects.
