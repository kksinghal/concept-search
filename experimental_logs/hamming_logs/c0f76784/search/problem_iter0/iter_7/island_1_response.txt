## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the largest and smallest objects (excluding the background) in the input grid. The area surrounding the largest object is filled with the value '8', while the area surrounding the smallest object is filled with the value '7'. Additionally, a single cell at the center of the largest object is filled with the value '6'.

**Input 0:**

* Largest object: The group of '5's on the top right and bottom left.
* Smallest object: The single '5' near the center of the grid.
* Transformation: The '8's form a border around the largest object, the '7's form a border around the smallest '5', and a '6' is placed at the center of the largest object.

**Input 1:**

* Largest object: The group of '5's forming a 'C' shape.
* Smallest object: The two horizontally connected '5's near the top of the grid.
* Transformation: The '8's form a border around the 'C' shape, the '7's form a border around the two connected '5's, and a '6' is placed at the center of the 'C' shape.

**Input 2:**

* Largest object: The two separate groups of '5's.
* Smallest object: The single '5' near the center of the grid.
* Transformation: The '8's form borders around both groups of '5's, the '7's form a border around the smallest '5', and a '6' is placed at the center of the top group of '5's.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  largest = argmax(objs, size)
  smallest = argmin(objs, size)
  O = fill(I, 8, delta(largest))
  O = fill(O, 7, inbox(smallest))
  O = fill(O, 6, toindices(toobject({(6, center(largest))}, I))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts all objects from the input grid `I`, excluding the background.
2. **Find largest and smallest:** `largest = argmax(objs, size)` and `smallest = argmin(objs, size)` determine the largest and smallest objects based on their size.
3. **Fill around largest:** `O = fill(I, 8, delta(largest))` fills the cells surrounding the largest object with '8'.
4. **Fill around smallest:** `O = fill(O, 7, inbox(smallest))` fills the cells directly surrounding the smallest object with '7'.
5. **Fill center of largest:** `O = fill(O, 6, toindices(toobject({(6, center(largest))}, I)))` places a '6' at the center of the largest object.
6. **Return output:** `return O` returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  largest = argmax(objs, lambda obj: width(obj) * height(obj))
  smallest = argmin(objs, lambda obj: width(obj) * height(obj))
  O = paint(fill(I, 8, backdrop(largest)), recolor(7, outbox(smallest)))
  O = fill(O, 6, toindices(toobject({(6, centerofmass(largest))}, I)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Find largest and smallest:** Uses `lambda` expressions to calculate object area (`width * height`) for determining the largest and smallest.
3. **Fill around largest and smallest:**  Combines `fill` and `paint` to simultaneously fill '8's around the largest object and '7's around the smallest object's outer boundary.
4. **Fill center of largest:**  Uses `centerofmass` to find a central point within the largest object and places a '6' there.
5. **Return output:** Same as Version 1.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    largest = argmax(objs, size)
    smallest = argmin(objs, size)
    O = paint(fill(I, 8, delta(largest)), recolor(7, inbox(smallest)))
    O = fill(O, 6, toindices(toobject({(6, center(largest))}, I))) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Uses `fgpartition` to directly partition the grid into objects, excluding the background.
2. **Find largest and smallest:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Fill around largest and smallest:** Same as Version 2.
4. **Fill center of largest:** Same as Version 1.
5. **Return output:** Same as Version 1.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  objs_size = apply(size, objs)
  largest = list(objs)[list(objs_size).index(max(objs_size))]
  smallest = list(objs)[list(objs_size).index(min(objs_size))]
  O = fill(I, 8, delta(largest))
  O = fill(O, 7, inbox(smallest))
  O = fill(O, 6, toindices(toobject({(6, center(largest))}, O)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Calculate object sizes:**  `objs_size = apply(size, objs)` calculates the size of each object.
3. **Find largest and smallest:**  Finds the indices of the largest and smallest sizes in `objs_size` and retrieves the corresponding objects from `objs`.
4. **Fill around largest and smallest:** Same as Version 1.
5. **Fill center of largest:** Same as Version 1.
6. **Return output:** Same as Version 1.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  largest = max(objs, key=len)
  smallest = min(objs, key=len)
  O = fill(I, 8, delta(largest))
  O = fill(O, 7, inbox(smallest))
  O = fill(O, 6, astuple(center(largest))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Find largest and smallest:** Uses the `max` and `min` functions with the `key=len` argument to find the largest and smallest objects based on their size.
3. **Fill around largest and smallest:** Same as Version 1.
4. **Fill center of largest:** Directly uses the output of `center(largest)` to fill the center cell with '6'.
5. **Return output:** Same as Version 1.
