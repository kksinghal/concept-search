## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring the cells of each object in the input grid based on their position relative to the object's center of mass along the horizontal axis. Cells to the left of the center of mass are recolored to '8', cells to the right are recolored to '7', and the cells at the center remain unchanged. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The top '5' object's center of mass lies in the middle column. Hence, cells to the left are recolored to '8', cells to the right are recolored to '7', and the center column remains '5'.
* The bottom '5' object's center of mass also lies in the middle column, resulting in a similar recoloring pattern.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* Both '5' objects are recolored following the same logic, with cells to the left of the center of mass becoming '8' and cells to the right becoming '7'.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* Similar to the previous examples, both '5' objects undergo recoloring based on their center of mass.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, each using a different combination of DSL functions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_obj(obj):
    center_j = centerofmass(obj)[1]
    return frozenset((8 if j < center_j else (7 if j > center_j else v), (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj)

  recolored_objs = apply(recolor_obj, fgpartition(I))
  O = paint(cover(I, merge(fgpartition(I))), merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Partitions the input grid `I` into objects, excluding the background.
2. **`recolor_obj(obj)`:** Defines a function to recolor an object `obj` based on the rule: cells left of the center of mass are '8', right are '7', and center remains unchanged.
3. **`apply(recolor_obj, fgpartition(I))`:** Applies the `recolor_obj` function to each object in the partitioned grid.
4. **`merge(fgpartition(I))`:**  Merges the partitioned objects back into a single object set.
5. **`cover(I, ...)`:**  Replaces the original objects with the background color in the input grid.
6. **`paint(..., ...)`:** Paints the recolored objects onto the covered grid, resulting in the final output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_cell(obj, v, i, j):
    return (8 if j < centerofmass(obj)[1] else (7 if j > centerofmass(obj)[1] else v), (i, j))

  recolored_objs = mpapply(lambda obj: frozenset(recolor_cell(obj, v, i, j) for v, (i, j) in obj), fgpartition(I))
  O = paint(cover(I, merge(fgpartition(I))), recolored_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses `mpapply` and a nested function for a slightly different approach to recoloring.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(cover(I, merge(fgpartition(I))), 
                 merge(apply(lambda obj: frozenset((8 if j < centerofmass(obj)[1] else (7 if j > centerofmass(obj)[1] else v), (i, j))
                                                  for v, (i, j) in obj), 
                             fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version condenses the code into a single line by nesting function calls and using lambda functions for conciseness.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_object(obj):
    cm_j = centerofmass(obj)[1]
    left_cells = sfilter(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1] < cm_j)
    right_cells = sfilter(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1] > cm_j)
    center_cells = sfilter(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1] == cm_j)
    return (recolor(8, left_cells), recolor(7, right_cells), center_cells)

  recolored_parts = apply(process_object, fgpartition(I))
  O = paint(cover(I, merge(fgpartition(I))), merge(merge(recolored_parts)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version separates the recoloring into distinct steps for left, right, and center cells using `sfilter` for finer control.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  recolored = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    cm_j = centerofmass(obj)[1]
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      new_v = 8 if j < cm_j else (7 if j > cm_j else v)
      recolored = insert((new_v, (i, j)), recolored)
  O = paint(cover(I, merge(objs)), recolored)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses an iterative approach with explicit loops to process each object and cell, offering a more procedural style. 

Each version of "Program_to_be_generated" utilizes different functions and logic from the DSL to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the versatility of the language. Remember that these are just five examples, and many other valid and distinct solutions could be generated using the DSL functions.
