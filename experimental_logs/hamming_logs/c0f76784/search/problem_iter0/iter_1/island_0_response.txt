## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions) of a specific color (5 in this case) and modifying the color of cells surrounding these objects based on their position relative to the object. 

* **Inner Border:** Cells directly adjacent to the object (excluding diagonals) are colored with value 8.
* **Outer Border (Conditional):** Cells further out (again, excluding diagonals), specifically those forming the outer boundary of the object's bounding box, are colored with:
    * Value 7 if they are below the object.
    * Value 6 if they are to the right of the object.

Let's break down each input-output pair:

* **Pair 0:** The top object gets an inner border of 8. The bottom object gets both an inner border of 8 and an outer border of 7 below.
* **Pair 1:** The top object gets an inner border of 7. The bottom object gets an inner border of 8, an outer border of 7 below, and an outer border of 6 to the right.
* **Pair 2:** Both objects get an inner border of 8 and an outer border of 7 below. 

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Get objects, not diagonally connected, without background
  inner_border = mapply(delta, objs) # Find cells adjacent to objects 
  O = fill(I, 8, inner_border) # Fill adjacent cells with 8

  for obj in objs:
    bottom_border = shift(
        intersection(
          backdrop(obj), 
          frozenset((i, j) for i in range(lowermost(obj) + 1, lowermost(obj) + 2) for j in range(30))
        ),
        (0, 0)
    ) # Identify cells forming the bottom outer border
    right_border = shift(
        intersection(
          backdrop(obj),
          frozenset((i, j) for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + 2) for i in range(30))
        ),
        (0, 0)
    ) # Identify cells forming the right outer border
    O = fill(O, 7, bottom_border) # Fill bottom border cells with 7
    O = fill(O, 6, right_border) # Fill right border cells with 6

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts objects formed by the color 5, considering only direct adjacency (not diagonal).
2. **Inner Border:** `mapply(delta, objs)` finds cells directly surrounding each object, and `fill(I, 8, inner_border)` colors them with 8.
3. **Iterate and Handle Borders:** For each object:
    *  `bottom_border` and `right_border` identify the cell indices forming the bottom and right outer borders respectively using `intersection` and `backdrop`.
    *  `fill(O, 7, bottom_border)` and `fill(O, 6, right_border)` color these borders with 7 and 6 respectively.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = fill(O, 8, delta(obj))  # Inner border with 8
    for i, j in backdrop(obj): 
      if i == lowermost(obj) + 1:  # Check if cell is below the object
        O = fill(O, 7, {(i,j)})
      if j == rightmost(obj) + 1:  # Check if cell is to the right of the object
        O = fill(O, 6, {(i,j)})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** The code iterates through each identified object.
2. **Inner Border:** `fill(O, 8, delta(obj))` directly colors the inner border with 8 for the current object.
3. **Check and Fill Outer Border:** It then iterates through cells in the object's bounding box (`backdrop(obj)`) and uses conditional checks (`if i == lowermost(obj) + 1` and `if j == rightmost(obj) + 1`) to determine if a cell belongs to the bottom or right outer borders, filling them with 7 and 6 respectively.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] == 5:  # Find cells belonging to an object
                for di, dj in [(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)]:  # Check adjacent cells 
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] != 5:
                        O = fill(O, 8, {(ni, nj)})  # Inner border 
                if i + 1 < len(I):
                    O = fill(O, 7, {(i + 1, j)})  # Bottom border
                if j + 1 < len(I[0]):
                    O = fill(O, 6, {(i, j + 1)})  # Right border
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** Iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Identify Object Cells:** Checks if the cell value is 5 (indicating object presence).
3. **Handle Adjacent Cells:** For each object cell, it checks its four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) and colors them 8 if they are not part of the object, effectively creating the inner border.
4. **Bottom and Right Borders:** Directly colors the cell below and to the right of each object cell with 7 and 6 respectively, handling the outer border.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = fill(I, 8, mapply(delta, objs))  # Apply inner border first

  bottom_objs = frozenset(
      shift(obj, (1, 0)) for obj in objs if lowermost(obj) < len(I) - 1
  ) # Shift objects down and filter those that go out of bounds
  right_objs = frozenset(
      shift(obj, (0, 1)) for obj in objs if rightmost(obj) < len(I[0]) - 1
  ) # Shift objects right and filter those that go out of bounds

  O = underfill(O, 7, mapply(toindices, bottom_objs))  # Apply bottom border only under background
  O = underfill(O, 6, mapply(toindices, right_objs))  # Apply right border only under background 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Inner Border:** Similar to previous versions, it identifies objects and applies the inner border of 8 using `delta` and `fill`.
2. **Shift and Filter:** It shifts the objects down (`bottom_objs`) and right (`right_objs`) and filters out shifted objects that would be out of bounds.
3. **Conditional Outer Border:** It uses `underfill` to apply the outer border colors (7 below, 6 right) only to cells that are currently background, ensuring that the inner border is not overwritten.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
    O = I
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    for obj in objs:
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, delta(obj)))  # Paint inner border
        for (i, j) in delta(obj):
            if i == lowermost(obj) + 1:
                O = paint(O, {(7, (i, j))})  # Paint bottom border
            if j == rightmost(obj) + 1:
                O = paint(O, {(6, (i, j))})  # Paint right border
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Paint:** It iterates through identified objects and uses `paint` for precise color application.
2. **Inner Border:** `recolor(8, delta(obj))` creates a new object representing the inner border with color 8, which is then painted onto the grid.
3. **Outer Border with Check:** Similar to version 2, it iterates through the object's delta and uses conditional checks to identify and paint the bottom and right borders. 

These five program versions showcase diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation in the given DSL, utilizing different function combinations, iteration techniques, and conditional logic.
