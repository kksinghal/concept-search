## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring the left and right halves of each distinct object (excluding the background) in the input grid. The left half is re-colored to 8, and the right half is re-colored to 7. 

**Let's break it down with examples:**

* **Input 0:** The top-left 5-object has its left half colored 8 and right half colored 7. Similarly, the bottom-left 5-object is re-colored.
* **Input 1:**  Again, both 5-objects are re-colored based on their left and right halves. 
* **Input 2:**  The transformation is applied consistently to both 5-objects. 

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_cell(obj, v, i, j):
    cm_j = centerofmass(obj)[1]
    return (8 if j < cm_j else (7 if j > cm_j else v), (i, j))

  recolored_objs = frozenset(
      recolor_cell(obj, v, i, j) 
      for obj in fgpartition(I) 
      for v, (i, j) in obj
  )
  O = paint(cover(I, merge(fgpartition(I))), recolored_objs)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`recolor_cell(obj, v, i, j)`:** This helper function takes an object, its cell value (v), and cell coordinates (i, j). It calculates the object's center of mass's column index (`cm_j`). If the cell's column index (`j`) is less than `cm_j`, it recolors the cell to 8 (left half). If `j` is greater than `cm_j`, it recolors to 7 (right half). Otherwise, it keeps the original color.

2. **`recolored_objs`:**  This part iterates through each object (`obj`) in the foreground partition (`fgpartition(I)`) and applies the `recolor_cell` function to each cell within the object. The result is a set of re-colored cells.

3. **`O = paint(...)`:** This part first covers the original foreground objects on the input grid (`cover(I, merge(fgpartition(I)))`) and then paints the re-colored cells (`recolored_objs`) onto the grid, resulting in the final output grid `O`.


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_obj(obj):
    cm_j = centerofmass(obj)[1]
    return frozenset(
        (8 if j < cm_j else (7 if j > cm_j else v), (i, j)) 
        for v, (i, j) in obj
    )

  recolored_objs = mapply(recolor_obj, fgpartition(I))
  O = paint(cover(I, merge(fgpartition(I))), recolored_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`recolor_obj(obj)`:** This helper function takes an object and recolors its cells based on their position relative to the object's center of mass's column index (`cm_j`).

2. **`recolored_objs`:** This part uses `mapply` to apply the `recolor_obj` function to each object in the foreground partition, resulting in a set of re-colored objects.

3. **`O = paint(...)`:**  Similar to version 1, this paints the `recolored_objs` onto a cleared version of the input grid.


### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  recolored_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    cm_j = centerofmass(obj)[1]
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      new_v = 8 if j < cm_j else (7 if j > cm_j else v)
      recolored_objs = insert((new_v, (i, j)), recolored_objs)
  O = paint(cover(I, merge(fgpartition(I))), recolored_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Looping through objects and cells:** This version directly iterates through each object and its cells, calculating the new color based on the center of mass and adding the re-colored cell to `recolored_objs`.

2. **Painting:**  Similar to previous versions, this part handles painting the re-colored objects.


### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def left_half(obj):
        cm_j = centerofmass(obj)[1]
        return frozenset((8, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < cm_j)
    
    def right_half(obj):
        cm_j = centerofmass(obj)[1]
        return frozenset((7, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j > cm_j)
    
    left_recolored = mapply(left_half, fgpartition(I))
    right_recolored = mapply(right_half, fgpartition(I))

    O = paint(cover(I, merge(fgpartition(I))), left_recolored | right_recolored)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`left_half(obj)` & `right_half(obj)`:** These functions specifically extract and recolor the left and right halves of an object, respectively.

2. **`left_recolored` & `right_recolored`:** These apply the half-recoloring functions to all foreground objects.

3. **`O = paint(...)`:** This combines the re-colored halves and paints them onto a cleared input grid.


### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def recolor_half(obj, side):
        cm_j = centerofmass(obj)[1]
        return frozenset(
            (8 if side == 'left' else 7, (i, j)) 
            for v, (i, j) in obj 
            if (j < cm_j if side == 'left' else j > cm_j)
        )

    left_recolored = mapply(lambda obj: recolor_half(obj, 'left'), fgpartition(I))
    right_recolored = mapply(lambda obj: recolor_half(obj, 'right'), fgpartition(I))

    O = paint(cover(I, merge(fgpartition(I))), left_recolored | right_recolored)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`recolor_half(obj, side)`:** This function recolors either the left or right half of an object based on the `side` argument.

2. **`left_recolored` & `right_recolored`:** These apply the `recolor_half` function with specific side arguments to all foreground objects.

3. **`O = paint(...)`:**  Similar to version 4, this combines and paints the re-colored object halves. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
