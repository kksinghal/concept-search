## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation recolors the digits in the input grid based on their position relative to the center of mass of their respective objects. 

**Logic:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The grid is partitioned into distinct objects, where each object consists of connected cells with the same digit (excluding the background color, which is the most common color).

2. **Calculate Center of Mass:** For each object, its center of mass is calculated. This point represents the average position of all the cells within the object.

3. **Recolor Based on Position:**  Digits within each object are recolored based on their horizontal (j) position relative to the object's center of mass (center_j):
    * **Left of Center:** Digits to the left (j < center_j) are recolored incrementally starting from 6 (6, 7, 8...). 
    * **Right of Center:**  Digits to the right (j > center_j) are recolored incrementally starting from 8 (8, 9, 10...).
    * **Center:** The digit at the center (j == center_j) retains its original value.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_object(obj):
    center_j = centerofmass(obj)[1]
    return frozenset(
      ((6 + center_j - j - 1) if j < center_j else (8 + j - center_j - 1) if j > center_j else v, (i, j))
      for v, (i, j) in obj
    )

  O = paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
      merge(apply(recolor_object, fgpartition(I)))
  ) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`recolor_object(obj)` Function:**
   - Calculates the center of mass `center_j` of the input `obj`.
   - Iterates through each cell `(v, (i, j))` in the object.
   - Recolors the cell based on its `j` coordinate relative to `center_j` using the logic described in the transformation analysis.
   - Returns the recolored object.

2. **Main Program:**
   - Creates a blank canvas `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` of the same size as the input `I`, filled with the background color.
   - Partitions the input grid `I` into foreground objects using `fgpartition(I)`.
   - Applies the `recolor_object` function to each object using `apply`.
   - Merges all the recolored objects back into a single object set using `merge`.
   - Paints the merged objects onto the blank canvas using `paint`.
   - Returns the final recolored grid `O`.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_row(row, i, obj_map):
    return tuple(
        (6 + obj_map[(i, j)][1] - j - 1) if j < obj_map[(i, j)][1] else (8 + j - obj_map[(i, j)][1] - 1) if j > obj_map[(i, j)][1] else v
        for j, v in enumerate(row)
        if (i, j) in obj_map
    )

  obj_map = {
      (i, j): (v, centerofmass(obj)[1])
      for obj in fgpartition(I)
      for v, (i, j) in obj 
  }
  O = tuple(process_row(r, i, obj_map) for i, r in enumerate(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`process_row(row, i, obj_map)` Function:**
   - Takes a row `row`, its index `i`, and a dictionary `obj_map` as input.
   - `obj_map` stores the center of mass for each cell belonging to a foreground object.
   - Iterates through each cell `(j, v)` in the row.
   - If the cell belongs to a foreground object (checked using `(i, j) in obj_map`), it recolors the cell based on its position relative to the object's center of mass retrieved from `obj_map`.
   - Returns the processed row.

2. **Main Program:**
   - Creates a dictionary `obj_map` to store the center of mass for each cell belonging to a foreground object.
   - Iterates through each row `r` and its index `i` in the input grid `I`.
   - Calls `process_row` to recolor the row based on the information in `obj_map`.
   - Combines the processed rows to form the output grid `O`.
   - Returns the recolored grid `O`.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    center_j = centerofmass(obj)[1]
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if j < center_j:
        O = fill(O, 6 + center_j - j - 1, {(i, j)})
      elif j > center_j:
        O = fill(O, 8 + j - center_j - 1, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Main Program:**
   - Creates a blank canvas `O` filled with the background color.
   - Iterates through each foreground object `obj` obtained using `fgpartition(I)`.
   - Calculates the object's center of mass `center_j`.
   - Iterates through each cell `(v, (i, j))` within the object.
   - Recolors the cell on the canvas `O` directly based on its position relative to `center_j`, using the `fill` function with the appropriate color.
   - Returns the final recolored grid `O`.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_cell(i, j, center_j):
    return (6 + center_j - j - 1) if j < center_j else (8 + j - center_j - 1) if j > center_j else I[i][j]
  
  obj_map = {}
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    center_j = centerofmass(obj)[1]
    obj_map.update({(i, j): center_j for v, (i, j) in obj})

  O = tuple(
    tuple(recolor_cell(i, j, obj_map.get((i, j), j)) for j in range(len(I[0])))
    for i in range(len(I))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`recolor_cell(i, j, center_j)` Function:**
   - Takes the cell coordinates `(i, j)` and the object's center of mass `center_j` as input.
   - Returns the new color for the cell based on its position relative to `center_j` or the original color if `center_j` is not provided (meaning it's a background cell).

2. **Main Program:**
   - Creates a dictionary `obj_map` to store the center of mass `center_j` for each cell belonging to a foreground object.
   - Iterates through each cell in the input grid `I` using nested loops.
   - Retrieves the `center_j` from `obj_map` for the current cell, defaulting to `j` (the cell's own column index) if the cell doesn't belong to any foreground object.
   - Calls `recolor_cell` to get the new color for the cell.
   - Assembles the recolored cells into the output grid `O`.
   - Returns the recolored grid `O`.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_indices(indices, center_j):
    return frozenset(
      ((6 + center_j - j - 1) if j < center_j else (8 + j - center_j - 1), (i, j)) 
      for i, j in indices
    )
  
  recolored_objects = (
    recolor_indices(toindices(obj), centerofmass(obj)[1]) 
    for obj in fgpartition(I)
  )
  
  O = paint(
    canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
    merge(recolored_objects)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`recolor_indices(indices, center_j)` Function:**
   - Takes a set of cell indices `indices` and the object's center of mass `center_j`.
   - Recolors the indices based on their position relative to `center_j` using a generator expression.
   - Returns a set of recolored indices.

2. **Main Program:**
   - Creates a generator expression `recolored_objects` that iterates through foreground objects, extracts their indices, recolors them using `recolor_indices`, and yields the recolored indices.
   - Creates a blank canvas filled with the background color.
   - Merges the recolored objects from the generator into a single object set using `merge`.
   - Paints the merged recolored objects onto the canvas using `paint`.
   - Returns the final recolored grid `O`.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation. They showcase the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL by employing various function combinations and program structures.
