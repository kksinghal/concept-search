## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid and then modifying them based on their shape:

* **Objects taller than they are wide:** A vertical line is drawn through the center of the object, replacing existing digits with the digit '8'.
* **Objects wider than they are tall:** A horizontal line is drawn through the center of the object, replacing existing digits with the digit '7'.
* **Square objects or single-cell objects:** Remain unchanged.

Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**
* The top-left 5x5 object is taller than it is wide. A vertical line of '8's is drawn through its center.
* The bottom-left 4x4 object is wider than it is tall. A horizontal line of '7's is drawn through its center.

**Input_1:**
* The top-left 4x5 object is wider than it is tall. A horizontal line of '7's is drawn through its center.
* The bottom-left 5x4 object is taller than it is wide. A vertical line of '8's is drawn through its center.

**Input_2:**
* The top 6x6 object is wider than it is tall. A horizontal line of '8's is drawn through its center.
* The bottom 4x4 object is wider than it is tall. A horizontal line of '7's is drawn through its center.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modify_obj(obj):
    h = height(obj)
    w = width(obj)
    if h > 1 and w > 1:
      if h > w:
        centerline = shift(crop(asindices(I), ulcorner(obj), (h, 1)), (h // 2 - 1, 0))
        return paint(I, recolor(8, centerline))
      else:
        centerline = shift(crop(asindices(I), ulcorner(obj), (1, w)), (0, w // 2 - 1))
        return paint(I, recolor(7, centerline))
    return I
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  modified_grid = I
  for obj in objs:
    modified_grid = modify_obj(obj)
  O = modified_grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`modify_obj(obj)` function:** This function takes an object as input and modifies it based on its shape. 
   - `h = height(obj)` and `w = width(obj)` calculate the height and width of the object.
   - If the object is not a single cell (h > 1 and w > 1):
     - If the object is taller than it is wide (h > w):
       -  `centerline = shift(crop(asindices(I), ulcorner(obj), (h, 1)), (h // 2 - 1, 0))` extracts a vertical line of indices through the center of the object.
       -  `return paint(I, recolor(8, centerline))` paints the extracted centerline onto the grid with the digit '8'.
     - Otherwise (object is wider than tall):
       -  `centerline = shift(crop(asindices(I), ulcorner(obj), (1, w)), (0, w // 2 - 1))` extracts a horizontal line of indices through the center of the object.
       -  `return paint(I, recolor(7, centerline))` paints the extracted centerline onto the grid with the digit '7'.
   - If the object is a single cell, the grid remains unchanged.

2. **Main Program:**
   - `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects in the input grid.
   - `modified_grid = I` initializes the output grid as a copy of the input.
   - The `for obj in objs:` loop iterates through each object and modifies the grid using `modify_obj(obj)`.
   - Finally, `O = modified_grid` assigns the modified grid to the output variable `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modify_obj(obj):
    h = height(obj)
    w = width(obj)
    if h > w and h > 1 and w > 1:
      return paint(I, recolor(8, shift(
        toindices(
          extract(
            objects(
              crop(I, ulcorner(obj), (h, w)), T, F, F),
              lambda x: size(x) == h)), (h // 2 - 1, 0))))
    elif w >= h and h > 1 and w > 1:
      return paint(I, recolor(7, shift(
        toindices(
          extract(
            objects(
              crop(I, ulcorner(obj), (h, w)), T, F, F), 
              lambda x: size(x) == w)), (0, w // 2 - 1))))
    else:
      return I
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = modify_obj(obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a slightly different approach by extracting the central line from a cropped version of the input grid containing only the object.

1. **`modify_obj(obj)` function:**
   - Similar to Version 1, it calculates the height and width and checks if it's a multi-cell object.
   - If taller than wide:
     - `crop(I, ulcorner(obj), (h, w))` creates a subgrid containing only the current object.
     - `objects(..., T, F, F)` identifies objects within this subgrid (including single-cell objects).
     - `extract(..., lambda x: size(x) == h)` finds the object representing the full-height vertical line.
     -  The rest is similar to Version 1, recoloring the line with '8' and painting it onto the grid.
   - If wider than tall:
     - The logic is mirrored, extracting a horizontal line and recoloring it with '7'.
   - Single-cell objects leave the grid unchanged.

2. **Main Program:**
   - Similar to Version 1, it identifies objects and iterates through them, applying the `modify_obj` function to each.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def modify_grid(grid, obj, color, offset):
        return paint(grid, recolor(color, shift(crop(asindices(grid), ulcorner(obj), (1 if height(obj) <= width(obj) else height(obj), 1 if height(obj) >= width(obj) else width(obj))), offset)))
  
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        if height(obj) > width(obj):
            O = modify_grid(O, obj, 8, (height(obj) // 2 - 1, 0))
        elif height(obj) < width(obj):
            O = modify_grid(O, obj, 7, (0, width(obj) // 2 - 1))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version introduces a separate `modify_grid` function for clarity.

1. **`modify_grid(grid, obj, color, offset)` function:**
   - Takes the grid, object, desired color, and line offset as input.
   -  `crop(asindices(grid), ulcorner(obj), (height if height > width else width, 1 if height > width else width))` extracts either a vertical or horizontal line of indices through the object's center based on its shape.
   - `shift(..., offset)` moves the line to the correct position.
   -  `recolor(color, ...)` applies the desired color to the line.
   -  `paint(grid, ...)` paints the colored line onto the grid.

2. **Main Program:**
   - Similar to previous versions, it identifies objects and iterates through them.
   - For each object:
     - It calls `modify_grid` with appropriate parameters depending on whether the object is taller or wider.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def line_through_center(obj, value):
    h = height(obj)
    w = width(obj)
    if h > w:
      return recolor(value, shift(crop(asindices(I), ulcorner(obj), (h, 1)), (h // 2 - 1, 0)))
    else:
      return recolor(value, shift(crop(asindices(I), ulcorner(obj), (1, w)), (0, w // 2 - 1)))
  
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if height(obj) != width(obj) and height(obj) > 1 and width(obj) > 1:
      if height(obj) > width(obj):
        O = paint(O, line_through_center(obj, 8))
      else:
        O = paint(O, line_through_center(obj, 7))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version introduces a `line_through_center` function to encapsulate line extraction and coloring.

1. **`line_through_center(obj, value)` function:**
   -  Takes the object and desired digit value as input.
   - Based on the object's shape (taller or wider), it extracts a vertical or horizontal line of indices through the center, using similar logic to previous versions.
   - `recolor(value, ...)` applies the desired color to the line.
   - Returns the colored line.

2. **Main Program:**
   - Similar structure to previous versions.
   - For each object:
     - If it's not square and has more than one cell:
       - Calls `line_through_center` with the appropriate color ('8' for taller, '7' for wider).
       - Paints the returned line onto the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def draw_line(grid, obj):
        h, w = height(obj), width(obj)
        start = ulcorner(obj)
        if h > w:
            return paint(grid, recolor(8, frozenset((start[0] + i, start[1]) for i in range(h))))
        elif w > h:
            return paint(grid, recolor(7, frozenset((start[0], start[1] + j) for j in range(w))))
        return grid
    
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        O = draw_line(O, obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on creating a `draw_line` function to handle both line drawing and painting.

1. **`draw_line(grid, obj)` function:**
   - Takes the grid and object as input.
   - Calculates height, width, and starting point of the object.
   -  If taller than wide:
     -  Creates a vertical line of indices from the starting point to the bottom of the object.
     -  Colors the line with '8' and paints it onto the grid.
   -  If wider than tall:
     -  Creates a horizontal line of indices from the starting point to the right edge of the object.
     - Colors the line with '7' and paints it onto the grid.
   -  Returns the modified grid.

2. **Main Program:**
   - Iterates through all objects in the input grid.
   -  For each object, calls `draw_line` to modify the grid.
   -  Returns the final modified grid.
