## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of a specific color (5 in this case) and replacing the leftmost cell of each object with a different color (1) based on its position. Specifically:

- **Color Replacement:** All occurrences of the digit '5' are replaced with the digit '2'.
- **Leftmost Cell Marking:** For each object (connected group of '2's), the leftmost cell is replaced with the digit '1'.

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** The top three '5's are grouped, and their leftmost cell is replaced with '1'. Similarly, the bottom three '5's and the two '5's on the right have their leftmost cells replaced.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**  Each group of '5's is treated as a separate object. The leftmost cell of each group is replaced with '1', regardless of its relative position within the group.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:** Similar to the previous examples, each connected group of '5's has its leftmost cell replaced with '1'. 


## Program to be Generated:

**Version 1: Utilizing `objects` and Direct Modification**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = replace(I, 5, 2)  # Replace all 5s with 2s
  for obj in objects(O, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    leftmost_index = min(toindices(obj), key=lambda x: x[1]) # Find leftmost index
    O = fill(O, 1, {leftmost_index})  # Replace leftmost cell with 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Replace Target Color:** We start by replacing all occurrences of the target color '5' with '2' using `replace(I, 5, 2)`. 
2. **Iterate Through Objects:** Using `objects(O, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`, we iterate through each connected group of '2's (representing the original objects) while excluding the background.
3. **Find Leftmost Cell:**  `min(toindices(obj), key=lambda x: x[1])` efficiently finds the index of the leftmost cell within each object.
4. **Replace with Marker:** Finally, we use `fill(O, 1, {leftmost_index})` to replace the identified leftmost cell with the marker color '1'.


**Version 2:  Leveraging `asobject` and Set Operations**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  obj = asobject(replace(I, 5, 2)) # Get object representation after replacing 5s
  leftmost_cells = frozenset((v, (i, min(j for _, (k, j) in obj if k == i))) for v, (i, _) in obj if v == 2)
  return paint(replace(I, 5, 0), leftmost_cells) # Paint leftmost cells onto a cleared grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Representation:** Replace '5's with '2's and convert the grid to an object representation using `asobject`.
2. **Find Leftmost Cells:**  Use a set comprehension to find the leftmost cell for each row within the object. 
3. **Paint onto Cleared Grid:**  Replace all '5's in the original grid with '0' (clearing them). Then, paint the identified leftmost cells (with value '1') onto this cleared grid using `paint`.


**Version 3: Row-wise Iteration and First Occurrence Marking**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = replace(I, 5, 2)  # Replace 5s with 2s
  for i, row in enumerate(O):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 2:
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})  # Mark the first '2' in each row as '1'
        break  # Move to the next row
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Target Color Replacement:** Replace all instances of '5' with '2'.
2. **Row-wise Scan:** Iterate through each row of the grid.
3. **First Occurrence Marking:** For each row, find the first occurrence of '2' and replace it with '1'. Then, stop processing the current row and move to the next.


**Version 4: Exploiting `hsplit` and Recursive Application**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  if width(I) == 1: # Base Case: If a single column, replace 5 with 1
    return tuple(((1,) if v == 5 else (v,)) for v in I)
  left, right = hsplit(I, 2) # Split grid into left and right halves
  return hconcat(program_v4(left), program_v4(right)) # Recursively process and combine
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Base Case:** If the grid has a single column, replace '5' with '1' and return.
2. **Recursive Splitting:** Split the grid into left and right halves using `hsplit(I, 2)`.
3. **Recursive Processing:** Recursively apply the `program_v4` function to both halves.
4. **Combine Results:**  Concatenate the results from the left and right halves using `hconcat` to get the final output.

**Version 5: Utilizing `occurrences` and Direct Index Manipulation**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = replace(I, 5, 0) # Clear all 5s 
  indices = occurrences(I, {(5, (0, 0))}) # Find occurrences of single-cell object '5'
  for i, j in indices:
    O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)}) # Place '1' at the found indices
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Clear Target Cells:**  Replace all occurrences of '5' with '0' to create a blank canvas.
2. **Find Occurrences:** Use `occurrences(I, {(5, (0, 0))})` to find all locations in the original grid where a single-cell object with value '5' exists. 
3. **Mark Occurrences:** Iterate through the found indices and use `fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})` to place '1' at each location.
