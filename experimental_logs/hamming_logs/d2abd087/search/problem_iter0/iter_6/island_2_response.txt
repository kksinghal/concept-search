## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently swaps the colors of the smallest and largest objects in the grid, excluding the background (most frequent color).

**Input 0:**

* **Largest object (color 5):**  The 'L' shaped object.
* **Smallest object (color 5):** The small horizontal line.
* **Transformation:** The 'L' shaped object becomes color 2, and the small horizontal line becomes color 5.

**Input 1:**

* **Largest object (color 5):** The 'C' shaped object.
* **Smallest object (color 5):** The single cell object at the top right.
* **Transformation:** The 'C' shaped object becomes color 2, and the single cell object becomes color 5.

**Input 2:**

* **Largest object (color 5):** The scattered 'S' shaped object. 
* **Smallest object (color 5):** The small vertical line on the left edge.
* **Transformation:** The scattered 'S' shaped object becomes color 2, and the small vertical line becomes color 5.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions for achieving this transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract foreground objects
  sorted_objs = sorted(objs, key=size)  # Sort objects by size
  smallest = sorted_objs[0]
  largest = sorted_objs[-1]
  return paint(paint(I, recolor(color(smallest), largest)), recolor(color(largest), smallest))  # Swap colors
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies distinct foreground objects.
2. **Sort Objects:** `sorted(objs, key=size)` sorts objects based on their size.
3. **Identify Smallest & Largest:**  The first and last elements of the sorted list represent the smallest and largest objects, respectively.
4. **Swap Colors:**  The `paint` function is used twice to first paint the largest object with the smallest object's color and then vice-versa, effectively swapping their colors.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    size_color_objs = tuple((size(obj), color(obj), obj) for obj in objs)  # Create tuples (size, color, object)
    largest = max(size_color_objs, key=lambda x: x[0])[2]  # Get the largest object
    smallest = min(size_color_objs, key=lambda x: x[0])[2]  # Get the smallest object
    return paint(paint(I, recolor(color(smallest), largest)), recolor(color(largest), smallest))  # Swap colors
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects and Information:** Create tuples containing size, color, and the object itself for easier comparison and manipulation.
2. **Find Largest & Smallest:** Utilize `max` and `min` functions with a lambda function to directly extract the largest and smallest objects from the tuples based on size.
3. **Swap Colors:**  Similar to Version 1, use double `paint` to swap the colors of the identified objects.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  sizes = apply(size, objs)
  smallest_size = minimum(sizes)
  largest_size = maximum(sizes)
  def swap_colors(v, loc):
    for obj in objs:
      if contained(loc, toindices(obj)):
        if size(obj) == smallest_size:
          return color(largest_obj)
        elif size(obj) == largest_size:
          return color(smallest_obj)
    return v
  return tuple(tuple(swap_colors(v, (i, j)) for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects and Sizes:**  Similar to previous versions, extract objects and find the smallest and largest sizes.
2. **Cell-wise Color Swapping:** Define a `swap_colors` function that iterates through each cell and checks its object membership. If the cell belongs to the smallest or largest object, it returns the color of the other; otherwise, it retains its original color.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  if len(objs) < 2: return I # Handle cases with less than two objects
  obj_sizes = ((size(obj), color(obj), obj) for obj in objs)
  largest_obj = max(obj_sizes, key=lambda x: x[0])
  smallest_obj = min(obj_sizes, key=lambda x: x[0])
  grid = paint(I, recolor(largest_obj[1], smallest_obj[2]))
  return paint(grid, recolor(smallest_obj[1], largest_obj[2]))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Handle Edge Cases**: Added a condition to handle input with less than two objects, in which case input is returned as output.
2. **Extract Objects and Information:**  Similar to version 2, create tuples containing size, color, and the object itself for easier comparison and manipulation.
3. **Find Largest & Smallest:** Utilize `max` and `min` functions with a lambda function to directly extract the largest and smallest objects from the tuples based on size.
4. **Swap Colors:**  Instead of double paint in previous versions, this version first paints the smallest object with the color of largest object and then paints largest object with the color of smallest object. 

**Program Version 5** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  if len(objs) < 2: return I  # Handle cases with less than two objects
  small_obj = argmin(objs, key=lambda obj: size(obj))
  large_obj = argmax(objs, key=lambda obj: size(obj))
  return paint(paint(I, recolor(color(large_obj), small_obj)), recolor(color(small_obj), large_obj))  # Swap colors
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Handle Edge Cases**: Added a condition to handle input with less than two objects, in which case input is returned as output.
2. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies distinct foreground objects.
3. **Identify Smallest & Largest:**  Utilize `argmax` and `argmin` functions with a lambda function to directly extract the largest and smallest objects based on size.
4. **Swap Colors:**  Similar to Version 1, use double `paint` to swap the colors of the identified objects.
