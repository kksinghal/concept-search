## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve two main steps:

1. **Recoloring:** All digits '5' in the input grid are replaced by '2' in the output grid. 
2. **Conditional Recoloring:** Digits in the input grid that are not '0' or '5' are replaced by '1' in the output grid if they are part of an object whose uppermost cell is at an even row index. Otherwise, they are replaced by '1'.

Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** 

* All '5's are replaced by '2's.
* The top left '5' object starts at an even row index (2), so its remaining digits are replaced by '1's.
* The bottom '5' object starts at an odd row index (6), so its remaining digits remain unchanged.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* All '5's are replaced by '2's.
* All other non-zero digits are part of objects starting at even row indices (0, 2, 6), so they are all replaced by '1's.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* All '5's are replaced by '2's.
* The top left and bottom '5' objects start at even row indices (0, 8), so their remaining digits are replaced by '1's.
* The remaining '5' objects start at odd row indices (1, 5), so their remaining digits remain unchanged.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the DSL:

**Version 1: Using `objects` and `uppermost`**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = replace(I, 5, 2)  # Replace all '5's with '2's
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False):
    if index(I, first(obj)[1]) != 0 and even(uppermost(obj)): 
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, obj))
    else:
      O = paint(O, recolor(index(I, first(obj)[1]), obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Replace 5s:** Replaces all occurrences of '5' with '2'.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** Iterates through each object (connected component) in the grid.
3. **Check Row Parity:** For each object, checks if the row index of its uppermost cell is even.
4. **Conditional Recoloring:** 
    * If even and not 0, recolors the object to '1'. 
    * Otherwise, recolors the object to its original color.
5. **Return Modified Grid:** Returns the modified grid.

**Version 2: Using `partition` and direct indexing**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = replace(I, 5, 2)  # Replace all '5's with '2's
  for obj in partition(I):
    i, j = first(obj)[1]
    if I[i][j] != 0 and even(i):
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, obj))
    else:
      O = paint(O, recolor(I[i][j], obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Replace 5s:** Replaces all occurrences of '5' with '2'.
2. **Partition the Grid:** Divides the grid into objects based on connected components of same values.
3. **Iterate and Recolor:** Iterates through each object, checks the row index of its first cell, and recolors it to '1' if the row is even and the value is not '0', otherwise, keeps the original value.
4. **Return Modified Grid:** Returns the grid with recolored objects.

**Version 3: Using nested loops and conditional recoloring**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    O = canvas(0, (h, w))
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if I[i][j] == 5:
                O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j))})
            elif I[i][j] != 0 and even(i):
                O = paint(O, {(1, (i, j))})
            else:
                O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Creates an empty canvas 'O' of the same size as the input 'I'.
2. **Iterate through Cells:** Uses nested loops to visit each cell in the input grid.
3. **Conditional Recoloring:** 
    * If the cell value is '5', paints the corresponding cell in 'O' with '2'.
    * If the cell value is not '0' and its row index is even, paints the corresponding cell in 'O' with '1'.
    * Otherwise, keeps the original cell value in 'O'.
4. **Return Output Grid:** Returns the completely filled output grid.

**Version 4: Using `apply` and lambda functions**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    recolor_func = lambda x: 2 if x == 5 else (1 if x != 0 and even(x[0]) else x)
    O = apply(lambda row: tuple(apply(recolor_func, enumerate(row))), I)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Recoloring Function:** A lambda function is defined to handle the recoloring logic based on the cell value and its row index.
2. **Apply Function to Rows:** Applies the `recolor_func` to each cell of every row in the input grid using nested `apply` functions.
3. **Return Modified Grid:** Returns the resulting grid after the recoloring is applied.

**Version 5: Using list comprehension and conditional logic**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = tuple(
        tuple(
            2 if cell == 5 else (1 if cell != 0 and even(i) else cell) 
            for j, cell in enumerate(row)
        )
        for i, row in enumerate(I)
    )
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Nested List Comprehension:** Uses nested list comprehension to process the input grid cell by cell.
2. **Conditional Recoloring:** 
    * Replaces '5' with '2'.
    * For other non-zero values, checks if the row index is even. If so, replaces them with '1'. Otherwise, keeps the original value.
3. **Return Output Grid:** Returns the transformed grid as a tuple of tuples.


These are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code. Each version utilizes different functions and approaches from the DSL to achieve the same goal, showcasing the flexibility and versatility of the provided DSL.
