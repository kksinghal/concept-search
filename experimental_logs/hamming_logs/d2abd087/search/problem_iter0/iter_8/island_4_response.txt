## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently applies the following logic:

1. **Recolor:** All occurrences of the digit '5' in the input grid are replaced with the digit '2'.
2. **Leftmost Marking:** Within each object formed by connected '2's (horizontally and vertically), the leftmost '2' is replaced with a '1'.

Let's break down this logic for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

*  Four distinct '5'-objects are present.
*  Each '5'-object is recolored to a '2'-object.
*  The leftmost '2' in each '2'-object is marked as '1'.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

*  Six distinct '5'-objects are present.
*  Recoloring and leftmost marking are applied as described above.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

*  Eight distinct '5'-objects are present.
*  The same recoloring and leftmost marking logic is applied.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = replace(I, 5, 2) # Replace all 5s with 2s
  for obj in objects(O, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    min_j = leftmost(obj)
    target_cell = extract(toindices(obj), lambda x: x[1] == min_j) # Find leftmost index
    O = fill(O, 1, {target_cell})  # Replace leftmost cell with 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Recolor:**  The code begins by replacing all occurrences of '5' with '2' using the `replace` function.
2. **Object Iteration:** It then iterates through each object in the grid using the `objects` function. By setting `univalued=True`, `diagonal=False`, and `without_bg=True`, it ensures that only connected regions of '2's are considered as objects.
3. **Leftmost Identification:** For each object, it finds the leftmost index by first finding the minimum column index (`min_j`) and then using the `extract` function to find the cell within the object's indices that corresponds to `min_j`.
4. **Marking:**  Finally, the `fill` function replaces the value at the identified leftmost index with '1'.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  I = replace(I, 5, 2)
  def mark_leftmost(obj):
    j = minimum(apply(lambda x: x[1], obj)) #find minimum column index
    return frozenset({(1, (i,j)) if c == 2 and j == minimum(apply(lambda x: x[1], obj)) else (c, (i,j)) for c, (i, j) in obj})
  return paint(I, merge(apply(mark_leftmost, objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Recolor:** Similar to Version 1, replaces all '5's with '2's using `replace`.
2. **`mark_leftmost` Function:** Defines a helper function `mark_leftmost` that:
    * Takes an object as input.
    * Finds the minimum column index (`j`) within the object.
    * Iterates through each cell of the object and replaces the value with '1' if it's the leftmost '2' in the object, otherwise retains the original value.
3. **Apply and Paint:**
    * Applies the `mark_leftmost` function to each object in the grid using `apply`.
    * Merges the resulting objects back into a single object set using `merge`.
    * Paints the modified objects onto the original grid using `paint`.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = replace(I, 5, 2)
  def process_row(row):
    found = False
    new_row = []
    for v in row:
      if v == 2 and not found:
        new_row.append(1)
        found = True
      else:
        new_row.append(v)
    return tuple(new_row)
  return tuple(process_row(row) for row in O) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Recolor:** Replaces all occurrences of '5' with '2' using `replace`.
2. **`process_row` Function:** Defines a helper function `process_row` that processes each row individually.
   * Iterates through each value in the row.
   * If it encounters a '2' and hasn't found a '2' in the row yet, it replaces it with '1' and marks that a '2' has been found.
   * Otherwise, it keeps the original value.
3. **Row-wise Processing:** Applies the `process_row` function to each row in the recolored grid using a list comprehension, effectively marking the leftmost '2' in each row as '1'. 


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    first_found = False
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if I[i][j] == 5 and not first_found:
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
        first_found = True
      elif I[i][j] == 5:
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterative Approach:**  This version iterates through each cell in the grid using nested loops, processing one column at a time.
2. **Column-wise Marking:** For each column:
    * It uses a flag `first_found` to track whether it has encountered a '5' in that column.
    * If it encounters a '5' and `first_found` is False, it replaces it with a '1' using the `fill` function and sets `first_found` to True.
    * If it encounters a '5' and `first_found` is True, it replaces it with a '2' using `fill`.
3. **In-Place Modification:** The code modifies the grid `O` directly within the loops.



**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def helper(grid, j, found):
    if j == width(grid):
      return grid
    for i in range(height(grid)):
      if grid[i][j] == 5:
        grid = fill(grid, 1 if not found else 2, {(i, j)})
        found = True
    return helper(grid, j + 1, found)
  return helper(replace(I, 5, 2), 0, False)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Recolor:** Replaces all '5's with '2's using `replace`.
2. **Recursive `helper` Function:** Defines a recursive helper function `helper` that:
   * Takes the grid, current column index (`j`), and a flag `found` (indicating if a '2' has been encountered in the column) as input.
   * Base Case: If `j` reaches the width of the grid, it returns the modified grid.
   * Recursive Step:
     * Iterates through each cell in the current column.
     * If it encounters a '2':
       * It replaces it with '1' if `found` is False (first '2' in the column), otherwise with '2'.
       * Sets `found` to True.
     * Recursively calls itself with the next column index (`j + 1`) and the updated `found` flag.
3. **Initial Call:** Calls the `helper` function with the recolored grid, starting column index 0, and initial `found` flag set to False.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, using different DSL functions and logic structures. Each version effectively recolors '5's to '2's and marks the leftmost '2' within each connected object as '1', resulting in the desired output grids.
