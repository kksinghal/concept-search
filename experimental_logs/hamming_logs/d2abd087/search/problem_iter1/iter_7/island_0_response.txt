## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on recoloring objects in the grid based on their position relative to the smallest object. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

- Identify the smallest object (the single '5' at the top).
- Objects to the right of this smallest object are recolored to '2'.
- All other objects (including the smallest) are recolored to '1'.

**Input_1:**

- The smallest object is again the single '5' at the top.
- Objects to the right of the smallest object are recolored to '1'.
- Objects below and to the left of the smallest object are recolored to '2'. 

**Input_2:**

-  The smallest object is the single '5' at the bottom right.
- Objects to the right of the smallest object are recolored to '1'.
- All other objects (including the smallest) are recolored to '2'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  smallest = argmin(objs, size)
  return paint(I, merge(
    recolor(1, merge(sfilter(objs, lambda o: rightmost(o) <= rightmost(smallest)))),
    recolor(2, merge(sfilter(objs, lambda o: rightmost(o) > rightmost(smallest))))
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, True, False, True)` extracts all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Find Smallest:** `smallest = argmin(objs, size)` finds the smallest object.
3. **Recolor based on Position:** 
    - Objects whose rightmost point is less than or equal to the smallest object's rightmost point are grouped and recolored to '1'.
    - Objects whose rightmost point is greater than the smallest object's rightmost point are grouped and recolored to '2'.
4. **Paint and Return:** The recolored objects are merged and painted back onto the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  smallest = argmin(objs, size)
  return paint(I, merge(
    apply(lambda o: recolor(2 if rightmost(o) > rightmost(smallest) else 1, o), objs)
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identical to Version 1 Steps 1 & 2.**
2. **Simplified Recoloring:** This version uses `apply` to iterate over each object and recolor it based on the condition within the lambda function.  If the object's rightmost point is greater than the smallest object's rightmost point, it's recolored to '2', otherwise '1'.
3. **Identical to Version 1 Step 4.**


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  min_j = rightmost(argmin(objs, size))
  return paint(I, merge(
    frozenset(recolor(1 if rightmost(obj) <= min_j else 2, obj) for obj in objs)
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identical to Version 1 Step 1.**
2. **Pre-calculate Rightmost:**  Instead of recalculating the smallest object's rightmost point repeatedly, this version pre-calculates and stores it as `min_j`.
3. **Recolor using Set Comprehension:**  It uses a set comprehension for a more concise way of recoloring objects based on the pre-calculated `min_j`.
4. **Identical to Version 1 Step 4.**

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  smallest = argmin(objs, lambda o: (rightmost(o), size(o)))
  return paint(I, merge(
    recolor(1, merge(sfilter(objs, lambda o: rightmost(o) <= rightmost(smallest)))),
    recolor(2, merge(sfilter(objs, lambda o: rightmost(o) > rightmost(smallest))))
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identical to Version 1 Step 1.**
2. **Modified "Smallest" Definition:** In this version, `argmin` now uses a lambda function to find the object with the smallest rightmost point. If multiple objects have the same rightmost point, it prioritizes the smaller object based on size.
3. **Identical to Version 1 Steps 3 & 4.**

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  s = argmin(objs, size)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda o: recolor(1 if any(j > rightmost(s) for _, (_, j) in o) else 2, o), objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identical to Version 1 Steps 1 & 2.**
2. **Check for Any Point Exceeding:** This version iterates through each object (`o`) using `apply`. Inside the lambda function, it checks if **any** cell in the object has a column index (`j`) greater than the rightmost column index of the smallest object (`s`). If so, the object is recolored to '1', otherwise '2'.
3. **Identical to Version 1 Step 4.**
