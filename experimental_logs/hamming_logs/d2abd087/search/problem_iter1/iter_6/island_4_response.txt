## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to recolor objects based on their relative horizontal position to the smallest object.

* **Input_0:** The smallest object (two cells) dictates the recoloring. Objects to its left are recolored to '1', while objects to its right are recolored to '2'.

* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the smallest object determines the recoloring. Objects on its left are '2', and objects on its right are '1'.

* **Input_2:** Again, the smallest object acts as the dividing line. Objects on its left are recolored to '1', and objects on its right are recolored to '2'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the DSL provided:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  target = argmin(objs, size)
  return paint(I, merge(
    frozenset(recolor(1 if ulcorner(obj)[1] < leftmost(target) else 2, obj) for obj in objs)
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** It identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Find Smallest Object:** It finds the smallest object and stores it as 'target'.
3. **Recolor Based on Position:** It iterates through each object. If the object's leftmost column is strictly less than the target's leftmost column, it's recolored to '1'; otherwise, it's recolored to '2'.
4. **Paint and Return:** It paints the recolored objects onto the original grid and returns the result.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  target_x = leftmost(argmin(objs, size))
  return paint(I, merge(
    frozenset(recolor(2 if any(j >= target_x for i, j in toindices(obj)) else 1, obj) for obj in objs)
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** It identifies all objects on the grid.
2. **Find Dividing Line:**  It determines the 'target_x' which is the column index of the leftmost cell of the smallest object.
3. **Recolor Based on Position:** It iterates through each object. If any cell within the object has a column index greater than or equal to 'target_x', the entire object is recolored to '2'; otherwise, it's recolored to '1'.
4. **Paint and Return:** It paints the recolored objects onto the original grid and returns the result.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  target = argmin(objs, size)
  return paint(I, merge(
    frozenset(branch(any(j < leftmost(target) for i, j in toindices(obj)), recolor(1, obj), recolor(2, obj)) for obj in objs)
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** It identifies all objects on the grid.
2. **Find Smallest Object:** It finds the smallest object and stores it as 'target'.
3. **Recolor Based on Position:** For each object, it checks if any cell has a column index less than the leftmost column of the 'target'. If true, it recolors the object to '1'; otherwise, it recolors it to '2' using the `branch` function.
4. **Paint and Return:** It paints the recolored objects onto the original grid and returns the result.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  min_obj = argmin(objs, size)
  return paint(I, merge(
    frozenset(branch(position(obj, min_obj)[1] < 0, recolor(1, obj), recolor(2, obj)) for obj in objs)
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects on the grid.
2. **Smallest Object:** Find the smallest object (`min_obj`).
3. **Relative Position:** For each object (`obj`), determine its relative horizontal position (`position(obj, min_obj)[1]`) to the smallest object.
4. **Conditional Recoloring:** If the relative horizontal position is negative (meaning `obj` is to the left of `min_obj`), recolor `obj` to '1', otherwise recolor to '2'.
5. **Paint and Return:** Paint the recolored objects onto the original grid and return the result.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  min_j = min(j for obj in objs for i, j in toindices(obj))
  return paint(I, merge(
    frozenset(recolor(1 if any(j < min_j for i, j in toindices(obj)) else 2, obj) for obj in objs)
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** It identifies all objects on the grid.
2. **Find Leftmost Column:** It finds the smallest column index (`min_j`) across all objects. This implicitly uses the leftmost point of the smallest object as a reference.
3. **Recolor Based on Position:** It iterates through each object. If any cell in the object has a column index less than 'min_j', it recolors the entire object to '1'; otherwise, it recolors it to '2'.
4. **Paint and Return:** It paints the recolored objects onto the original grid and returns the result.

These five versions showcase different ways to achieve the same transformation. Some are more concise, while others might be more efficient depending on the specific implementation of the DSL.
