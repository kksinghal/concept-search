## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves recoloring objects based on their relative positions to the smallest object in the grid. 

**General Logic:**

1. **Identify the smallest object:** Find the object with the fewest cells.
2. **Recolor based on relative position:**
    - Objects to the **right** of the smallest object are recolored to **2**.
    - All other objects (including the smallest) are recolored to **1**.

**Specific Examples:**

- **Input_0:** The smallest object (two '1' cells) is recolored to '2', and the larger object (five '2' cells) is also recolored to '2' because it's to the right.
- **Input_1:** The smallest object (single '1' cell) remains '1'. The object with five '1' cells is recolored to '2' because it's to the right of the smallest. The object with four '2' cells remains '2' as it's not to the right of the smallest.
- **Input_2:** The smallest object (single '1' cell) remains '1'. The object with three '2' cells is recolored to '2' because it's to the right. The other objects remain unchanged.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  smallest = argmin(objs, size)
  return paint(
    I, 
    merge(
      apply(
        lambda o: recolor(2 if leftmost(o) > leftmost(smallest) else 1, o),
        objs
      )
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, T, T, T)` extracts all objects from the grid.
2. **Find the smallest:** `argmin(objs, size)` determines the smallest object.
3. **Recolor:** For each object `o`, `recolor(2 if leftmost(o) > leftmost(smallest) else 1, o)` recolors it to '2' if it's to the right of the smallest, and '1' otherwise.
4. **Paint and merge:** The recolored objects are merged and painted back onto the grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  min_leftmost = leftmost(argmin(objs, size))
  return paint(I, merge(recolor(2 if leftmost(obj) > min_leftmost else 1, obj) for obj in objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Similar to Version 1, but calculates the minimum leftmost index (`min_leftmost`) only once for efficiency.**

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  smallest_obj = argmin(objs, size)
  right_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: leftmost(obj) > leftmost(smallest_obj))
  return paint(paint(I, recolor(1, merge(objs))), recolor(2, merge(right_objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identifies objects and the smallest object.**
2. **Explicitly filters objects to the right of the smallest object (`right_objs`).**
3. **Recolors all objects to '1' first, then recolors the `right_objs` to '2', ensuring the correct final coloring.**

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  smallest_idx = argmin(asindices(I), lambda idx: index(I, idx))
  return paint(
    I, 
    merge(
      recolor(2 if index(I, (i,j)) != 0 and j > smallest_idx[1] else 1, {(index(I, (i, j)), (i, j))}) 
      for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0]))
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Finds the index (`smallest_idx`) of the smallest non-zero value in the grid.**
2. **Iterates through every cell and recolors based on its value and column position relative to `smallest_idx`.**

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  min_obj = argmin(objs, size)
  return paint(I, merge(branch(leftmost(o) > leftmost(min_obj), recolor(2, o), recolor(1, o)) for o in objs)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Similar to Version 1 but utilizes the `branch` function for a more concise way to choose between recoloring to '1' or '2'.**

These five versions demonstrate distinct logic and function combinations to achieve the same transformation. Each version has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of code length, efficiency, and readability.
