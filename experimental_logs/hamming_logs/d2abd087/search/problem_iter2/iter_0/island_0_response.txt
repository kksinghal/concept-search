## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently recolors objects in the grid based on their position relative to the smallest object. 

* **Objects to the left of or above the smallest object are recolored to '1'.**
* **Objects to the right of or below the smallest object are recolored to '2'.**
* **The smallest object retains its original color.**

This pattern holds true for all three input-output examples.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  target = argmin(objs, size)
  def recolor_func(obj):
    if obj == target: return obj 
    return recolor(1 if ulcorner(obj)[0] + ulcorner(obj)[1] <= ulcorner(target)[0] + ulcorner(target)[1] else 2, obj)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(recolor_func, objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all distinct objects in the grid `I`.
2. **Find Smallest:** `target = argmin(objs, size)` finds the smallest object by size.
3. **Recolor Function:** `recolor_func(obj)` determines the new color for each object:
   - If the object is the smallest (`obj == target`), keep its color.
   - Otherwise, recolor based on position:
     - Calculate the sum of row and column indices of the upper-left corner for both the current object and the smallest object.
     - If the sum for the current object is less than or equal to the sum for the smallest object, recolor to '1'.
     - Otherwise, recolor to '2'.
4. **Apply Recoloring:** `apply(recolor_func, objs)` applies the recoloring logic to all objects.
5. **Paint Grid:** `paint(I, merge(...))` paints the recolored objects back onto the original grid.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  target = argmin(objs, size)
  def recolor_func(obj):
    if obj == target: return obj
    return recolor(1 if any(i <= ulcorner(target)[0] and j <= ulcorner(target)[1] for i, j in toindices(obj)) else 2, obj)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(recolor_func, objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Smallest:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Recolor Function:** `recolor_func(obj)` determines the new color:
   - Keep the color of the smallest object.
   - For other objects, check if any cell's indices (i, j) are both less than or equal to the upper-left corner indices of the smallest object. If so, recolor to '1'; otherwise, recolor to '2'.
3. **Apply Recoloring and Paint:** Same as Version 1.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  target = argmin(objs, size)
  left_objs = frozenset(obj for obj in objs if rightmost(obj) < leftmost(target))
  right_objs = objs - left_objs - {target}
  return paint(I, merge(
    {recolor(1, merge(left_objs)),
     recolor(2, merge(right_objs)),
     target}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Smallest:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Categorize Objects:**
   - `left_objs`: Objects entirely to the left of the smallest object.
   - `right_objs`: Objects not on the left and not the smallest object itself.
3. **Recolor and Paint:**
   - Recolor `left_objs` to '1', `right_objs` to '2', and keep the smallest object as is.
   - Paint the recolored objects back onto the grid.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  target = argmin(objs, size)
  def recolor_func(obj):
    if obj == target: return obj
    return recolor(2 if any(i >= lrcorner(target)[0] or j >= lrcorner(target)[1] for i, j in toindices(obj)) else 1, obj)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(recolor_func, objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Smallest:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Recolor Function:**
   - Keep the color of the smallest object.
   - For other objects, check if any cell's indices (i, j) are greater than or equal to the lower-right corner indices of the smallest object. If so, recolor to '2'; otherwise, recolor to '1'.
3. **Apply Recoloring and Paint:** Same as Version 1.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  target = argmin(objs, size)
  def condition(obj):
    return any(i <= ulcorner(target)[0] and j <= ulcorner(target)[1] for i, j in toindices(obj)) or obj == target
  return paint(I, merge(
    frozenset(recolor(1 if condition(obj) else 2, obj) for obj in objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Smallest:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Recolor Function:**
   - Define a condition `condition(obj)` that checks if an object is either the smallest object or has any cell with indices less than or equal to the upper-left corner indices of the smallest object.
   - Recolor objects to '1' if they meet the condition; otherwise, recolor to '2'.
3. **Apply Recoloring and Paint:** Same as Version 1.
