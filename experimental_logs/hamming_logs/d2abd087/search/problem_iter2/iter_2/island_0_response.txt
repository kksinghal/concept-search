## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring objects based on their position relative to a target object. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Target Object:** The smallest object is the target (two cells with value '1').
2. **Recoloring:** Objects to the right of the target object are recolored to '2'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. **Target Object:**  The smallest object is the target (one cell with value '1').
2. **Recoloring:** Objects to the left of the target object are recolored to '2'.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

1. **Target Object:** The smallest object is the target (one cell with value '1').
2. **Recoloring:** Objects to the right of the target object are recolored to '2'. 

**Overall Logic:** The transformation consistently identifies the smallest object as the target. Then, it recolors other objects to '2' if they are located on a specific side (left or right) relative to the target object. 

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, each with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  target = argmin(objs, size)
  return paint(I, merge(
    frozenset(recolor(2 if leftmost(obj) > leftmost(target) else 1, obj) for obj in objs)
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, T, T)` extracts all objects from the input grid (`I`).
2. **Find Target:**  `target = argmin(objs, size)` identifies the smallest object as the target.
3. **Recolor Objects:**  The code iterates through each object (`obj`) in `objs`:
    - `leftmost(obj) > leftmost(target)` checks if the object is to the right of the target.
    - If true, `recolor(2, obj)` recolors the object to '2'; otherwise, it remains '1'.
4. **Paint Output:** `paint(I, ...)` paints the recolored objects back onto the input grid to generate the output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  target_j = leftmost(argmin(objs, size))
  return paint(I, merge(
    frozenset(recolor(2 if any(j > target_j for i, j in toindices(obj)) else 1, obj) for obj in objs)
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

- Similar to Version 1, but instead of comparing `leftmost` directly, it iterates through each cell's column index (`j`) within an object to determine its position relative to the target's leftmost column (`target_j`).

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, True, True)
    target = argmin(objs, size)
    return paint(I, merge(
        frozenset(
            recolor(2, obj) if any((i, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j > rightmost(target)) else obj
            for obj in objs
        )
    ))
```

**Explanation:**

- Uses `rightmost(target)` to find the rightmost column of the target object.
- Iterates through cell indices within each object and recolors the object to '2' if any cell has a column index greater than the target's rightmost column.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, True, True)
  target = argmin(objs, size)
  return paint(I, merge(
      frozenset(recolor(1 if obj == target else (2 if position(obj, target)[1] == 1 else 1), obj) for obj in objs)
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

- Employs the `position(obj, target)` function to determine the relative position of each object to the target.
- If the object is to the right (`position(obj, target)[1] == 1`), it's recolored to '2'.

**Program Version 5:** 

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, True, True)
  target = argmin(objs, lambda obj: width(obj) * height(obj))
  return paint(I, merge(
      frozenset(
          recolor(2, obj) if any(j > leftmost(target) for i,j in toindices(obj)) else obj 
          for obj in objs
      )
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

- Calculates the target object's size using `width(obj) * height(obj)` within `argmin` for potential variation in target selection. 
- Recolors objects to '2' if any of their cell's column indices (`j`) exceed the target's leftmost column. 


These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation using different DSL functions and logic, demonstrating a diverse range of solutions.
