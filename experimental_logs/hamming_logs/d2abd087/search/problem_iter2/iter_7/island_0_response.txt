## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently recolors objects in the input grid based on their position relative to the smallest object. The smallest object retains its original color.

* **Input_0:** The smallest object (two '1's) dictates the recoloring. Objects to its left are recolored to '2', while the object to its right remains '1'.
* **Input_1:**  The smallest object (single '1') is the reference. Objects to its left become '2', those to its right remain '1'.
* **Input_2:** The isolated '1' is the smallest object. Objects to its left become '1', those to its right become '2'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  target = argmin(objs, size)
  return paint(I, merge(
    frozenset(recolor(2 if ulcorner(obj)[1] < ulcorner(target)[1] else color(obj), obj) for obj in objs)
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, T, T)` extracts all objects from the input grid (`I`).
2. **Find Smallest:**  `target = argmin(objs, size)` finds the smallest object.
3. **Recolor Based on Position:**  Iterate through each object (`obj`):
    * `ulcorner(obj)[1] < ulcorner(target)[1]` checks if the object's upper-left corner is to the left of the smallest object's upper-left corner.
    * If true, recolor to '2' (`recolor(2, obj)`); otherwise, keep the original color (`color(obj)`).
4. **Paint Back:** `paint(I, merge(...))` paints the recolored objects back onto the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  min_j = min(ulcorner(obj)[1] for obj in objs)
  return paint(I, merge(
    frozenset(recolor(2 if ulcorner(obj)[1] == min_j else color(obj), obj) for obj in objs)
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Find Leftmost Column:** `min_j = min(ulcorner(obj)[1] for obj in objs)` determines the leftmost column containing an object.
3. **Recolor Based on Column:** Iterates through objects:
    *  If an object's upper-left corner is in the leftmost column, recolor it to '2'.
    * Otherwise, keep the original color.
4. **Paint Back:** Same as Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  target = argmin(objs, size)
  return paint(I, merge(
    frozenset(branch(ulcorner(obj)[1] < ulcorner(target)[1], recolor(2, obj), obj) for obj in objs)
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Smallest:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Conditional Recoloring:** Uses `branch` for a more direct approach:
    * `ulcorner(obj)[1] < ulcorner(target)[1]` acts as the condition.
    *  If true (object is left of the smallest), recolor to '2' (`recolor(2, obj)`).
    *  If false, keep the object unchanged (`obj`).
3. **Paint Back:** Same as Version 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  target = argmin(objs, size)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(
    lambda obj: branch(ulcorner(obj)[1] < ulcorner(target)[1], lambda x: recolor(2, x), identity)(obj), objs
  )))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Smallest:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Lambda for Conditional Recoloring:** Uses a lambda function within `apply`:
    *  The lambda function takes an object (`obj`) as input.
    *  `branch(ulcorner(obj)[1] < ulcorner(target)[1], lambda x: recolor(2, x), identity)` conditionally applies either `recolor(2, x)` or the `identity` function (which returns the input unchanged) based on the object's position relative to the smallest.
3. **Paint Back:** Same as Version 1.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  target_j = ulcorner(argmin(objs, size))[1] 
  return paint(I, merge(
    frozenset({(2 if j < target_j else c, (i, j)) for c, (i, j) in obj} for obj in objs)
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Find Smallest Object's Column:** `target_j = ulcorner(argmin(objs, size))[1]` extracts the column index of the smallest object's upper-left corner.
3. **Directly Recolor Cells:** Iterates through objects and their cells:
    * For each cell `(c, (i, j))` in an object, recolor it to '2' if its column index (`j`) is less than the target column (`target_j`); otherwise, retain its original color (`c`).
4. **Paint Back:** Same as Version 1.


These five versions showcase diverse ways to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL. Each leverages different functions and logic, offering distinct solutions to the problem.
