## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying the smallest object in the grid and changing the color of objects based on their position relative to the smallest object.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**  All objects to the right of the smallest object are recolored to 2.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** All objects to the left of the smallest object are recolored to 2.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** All objects to the right of the smallest object are recolored to 2.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  smallest = argmin(objs, size)
  return paint(I, merge([recolor(2 if leftmost(obj) > leftmost(smallest) else color(obj), obj) for obj in objs]))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Find Smallest:** `smallest = argmin(objs, size)` finds the smallest object.
3. **Recolor Based on Position:** Objects to the right of the smallest object (`leftmost(obj) > leftmost(smallest)`) are recolored to 2, others retain their original color.
4. **Paint and Merge:** The recolored objects are merged and painted back onto the input grid.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  min_leftmost = leftmost(argmin(objs, size))
  return paint(I, merge([recolor(2 if leftmost(o) > min_leftmost else color(o), o) for o in objs]))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all distinct objects.
2. **Find Leftmost Position of Smallest:** `min_leftmost = leftmost(argmin(objs, size))` finds the column index of the leftmost cell of the smallest object.
3. **Recolor Based on Position:**  Objects with their leftmost point at a column index greater than `min_leftmost` are recolored to 2.
4. **Paint and Merge:** Recolored objects are merged and painted onto the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  smallest_idx = argmin(enumerate(objs), lambda x: size(x[1]))[0]
  return paint(I, merge([recolor(2 if i > smallest_idx else color(obj), obj) for i, obj in enumerate(objs)]))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all distinct objects.
2. **Find Index of Smallest:** `smallest_idx = argmin(enumerate(objs), lambda x: size(x[1]))[0]` finds the index of the smallest object in the `objs` tuple.
3. **Recolor Based on Index:** Objects with an index greater than `smallest_idx` in the `objs` tuple are recolored to 2.
4. **Paint and Merge:** Recolored objects are merged and painted onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  smallest = argmin(objs, size)
  return paint(I, merge([smallest] + [recolor(2 if leftmost(obj) > leftmost(smallest) else color(obj), obj) for obj in objs - {smallest}]))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all distinct objects.
2. **Find Smallest:** `smallest = argmin(objs, size)` finds the smallest object.
3. **Recolor Based on Position:** Similar to version 1, but the smallest object is explicitly excluded from recoloring.
4. **Paint and Merge:** The smallest object and recolored objects are merged and painted onto the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, T, T, T), key=lambda obj: leftmost(obj))
  smallest_idx = next(i for i, obj in enumerate(objs) if obj == argmin(objs, size))
  return paint(I, merge([recolor(2 if i > smallest_idx else color(obj), obj) for i, obj in enumerate(objs)]))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Sort:** `objs = sorted(objects(I, T, T, T), key=lambda obj: leftmost(obj))` identifies all objects and sorts them based on their leftmost column index.
2. **Find Index of Smallest:** `smallest_idx = next(i for i, obj in enumerate(objs) if obj == argmin(objs, size))` finds the index of the smallest object in the *sorted* `objs` tuple.
3. **Recolor Based on Index:** Objects with an index greater than `smallest_idx` in the sorted `objs` tuple are recolored to 2.
4. **Paint and Merge:** Recolored objects are merged and painted onto the input grid.
