## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves rotating each object within the grid by 90 degrees clockwise. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

* The object consisting of digits '1' rotates 90 degrees clockwise.
* The object consisting of digits '2' rotates 90 degrees clockwise.
* The object consisting of digit '8' rotates 90 degrees clockwise (effectively no change as it's a single cell).

**Input_1:**

* The object consisting of digits '2' rotates 90 degrees clockwise.
* The object consisting of digits '4' rotates 90 degrees clockwise.
* The object consisting of digit '9' rotates 90 degrees clockwise.

**Input_2:**

* The object consisting of digits '5' rotates 90 degrees clockwise.
* The object consisting of digits '8' rotates 90 degrees clockwise.

**Input_3:**

* The object consisting of digits '2' rotates 90 degrees clockwise.
* The object consisting of digits '3' rotates 90 degrees clockwise.
* The object consisting of digits '9' rotates 90 degrees clockwise.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, True, False)
  rotated_objs = frozenset({frozenset({(color(obj), (j, height(grid)-1-i)) for color, (i, j) in obj}) for obj in objs})
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), merge(rotated_objs)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(grid, True, True, False)` identifies all objects within the input grid.
2. **Rotate Objects:** For each object, the code iterates over its cells, calculates the new coordinates after a 90-degree clockwise rotation (`(j, height(grid)-1-i)`), and constructs a new object with rotated cells.
3. **Paint Rotated Objects:**  A new canvas is created with the background color of the original grid. Then, the rotated objects are painted onto this canvas using `paint`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  return rot90(rot90(rot90(grid)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the `rot90` function, which performs a 90-degree clockwise rotation on a grid, three times to achieve the desired 270-degree rotation, which is equivalent to rotating each object by 90 degrees clockwise. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  return rot270(grid)
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly uses the `rot270` function to perform a 270-degree anti-clockwise rotation on the grid, which is equivalent to rotating each object by 90 degrees clockwise.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, True, False)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), rot90(toindices(obj))), objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(grid, True, True, False)` identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Rotate and Recolor:**  For each object:
    - `toindices` extracts the object's indices.
    - `rot90` rotates these indices by 90 degrees.
    - `recolor` creates a new object with the rotated indices and the original object's color.
3. **Paint Rotated Objects:**  The rotated objects are painted onto a new canvas with the background color of the original grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  return dmirror(hmirror(grid))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Horizontal Mirroring:** `hmirror(grid)` mirrors the grid horizontally.
2. **Diagonal Mirroring:** `dmirror(...)` then mirrors the horizontally mirrored grid along the main diagonal. 

This combination of mirroring operations effectively results in a 90-degree clockwise rotation of all objects within the grid.
