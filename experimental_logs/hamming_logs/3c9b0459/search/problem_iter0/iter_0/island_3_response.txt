## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place in all the examples involves rotating each object in the input grid by 90 degrees counterclockwise. The background color remains unchanged. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0 to Output_0:** The '1' object, the '8' object, and the '2' object have all been rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise.
* **Input_1 to Output_1:**  Similar to the previous example, the '9', '4', and '2' objects have all undergone a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.
* **Input_2 to Output_2:** The '8' object and the '5' object maintain their positions after the rotation due to symmetry but are effectively rotated within their position.
* **Input_3 to Output_3:** Once again, all the objects, '3', '2', and '9', are rotated counterclockwise by 90 degrees.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Extract objects, non-diagonal
  x2 = apply(lambda o: rot270(toobject(o, I)), x1)  # Rotate each object
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create a canvas with background color
  O = apply(lambda o: paint(O, o), x2) # Paint rotated objects onto the canvas
  return first(O)  # Return the first (and only) grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify individual objects within the input grid.
2. **Rotate Objects:**  Rotate each extracted object by 270 degrees clockwise (equivalent to 90 degrees counterclockwise).
3. **Create Background Canvas:** Generate a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color.
4. **Paint Objects:**  Place the rotated objects onto the canvas.
5. **Return Result:** Output the modified grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (j, height(I)-1-i))})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Background Canvas:** Create an empty grid filled with the background color and having the same dimensions as the input.
2. **Iterate and Rotate:** Go through each cell of the input grid. For every cell at (i, j), paint the corresponding color from the input to the output grid at the rotated position (j, height - 1 - i), effectively rotating each cell 90 degrees counterclockwise.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = rot90(I) # Rotate the entire grid clockwise by 90 degrees
  x2 = objects(x1, True, False, True) # Extract objects from the rotated grid
  x3 = apply(lambda o: rot270(toobject(o, x1)), x2) # Rotate each object back by 270 degrees clockwise
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create a blank canvas
  O = apply(lambda o: paint(O, o), x3) # Paint the rotated-back objects onto the canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initial Rotation:** Rotate the entire input grid by 90 degrees clockwise.
2. **Object Extraction:**  Identify and extract objects from this rotated grid.
3. **Rotate Objects Back:** Rotate each extracted object counterclockwise by 270 degrees (equivalent to rotating 90 degrees counterclockwise from the original orientation).
4. **Create Background Canvas:** Generate a blank canvas.
5. **Paint and Return:** Paint the rotated objects onto the canvas and output the resulting grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = apply(lambda r: tuple(reversed(r)), rot90(I))  # Rotate and reverse each row
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Rotate:** Perform a 90-degree clockwise rotation on the entire input grid.
2. **Reverse Rows:**  Reverse each row of the rotated grid to achieve the counterclockwise rotation effect.
3. **Return:**  Output the resulting grid.

**Program Version 5** 

```python
def solve(I):
  return rot270(dmirror(rot90(I))) # Rotate, mirror diagonally, and rotate back
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Rotate:** Rotate the entire input grid clockwise by 90 degrees.
2. **Diagonal Mirror:**  Mirror the rotated grid along the main diagonal.
3. **Rotate Back:** Rotate the mirrored grid counterclockwise by 270 degrees (equivalent to 90 degrees clockwise) to achieve the final rotated output.


These programs offer different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL. Each version leverages a unique combination of functions, demonstrating the diverse range of solutions possible within the DSL's capabilities.
