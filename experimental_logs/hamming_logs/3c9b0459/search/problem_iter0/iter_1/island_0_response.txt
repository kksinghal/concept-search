## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to be rotating the input grid by 270 degrees clockwise. Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**
```
2 2 1
2 1 2
2 8 1
```
**Output_0:**
```
1 8 2
2 1 2
1 2 2
```
Here, the top-right corner '1' moves to the top-left corner. Similarly, other elements shift positions by a quarter turn clockwise.

**Input_1, Input_2, Input_3:** These examples follow the same 270-degree clockwise rotation pattern.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:** (Inspired by `rot90` function being applied thrice in `hecfjjfadhddefadjabbfeafaiaabghe`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = rot90(I)
  O = rot90(O)
  O = rot90(O)
  return O
```
**Explanation:** This version directly applies the `rot90` function three times, effectively rotating the grid 270 degrees clockwise.

**Version 2:** (Inspired by the concept of transposing and mirroring from previous examples)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = dmirror(I)
  O = vmirror(O)
  return O
```
**Explanation:** This version first mirrors the input grid diagonally using `dmirror`. Then, it mirrors the result vertically using `vmirror`. This combination achieves the 270-degree clockwise rotation.

**Version 3:** (Inspired by breaking down rotation into horizontal and vertical flips)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = hmirror(I)
  O = vmirror(O)
  return O
```
**Explanation:** This version first mirrors the input grid horizontally using `hmirror`, and then mirrors the result vertically using `vmirror`. This sequence also results in a 270-degree clockwise rotation.

**Version 4:** (Inspired by manipulating indices directly)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      O = fill(O, I[j][w - i - 1], ((i, j),))
  return O
```
**Explanation:** This version iterates through each cell of the input grid. For every cell (i, j), it calculates the corresponding position (j, w-i-1) in the rotated output grid and sets the value accordingly.

**Version 5:** (Inspired by utilizing object representation and shifting)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = asobject(I)
  O = frozenset({(v, (j, len(I[0]) - i - 1)) for v, (i, j) in O})
  return togrid(O, shape(I))
```
**Explanation:** This version first converts the input grid into an object representation using `asobject`. Then, it modifies the indices of each cell within the object to reflect the 270-degree rotation. Finally, it converts the transformed object back into a grid using `togrid`, specifying the original shape.

**Note:** 
* These programs assume the existence of a `togrid` function (not explicitly provided in the DSL), which reconstructs a grid from an object given its shape. 
* The provided code versions are distinct in their logic and function usage. Each offers a different approach to achieve the same 270-degree clockwise rotation.
