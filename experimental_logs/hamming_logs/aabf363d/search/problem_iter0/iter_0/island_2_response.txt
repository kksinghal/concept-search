## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation recolors the primary object in the input grid with the color found in the bottom left corner of the input grid. The background color remains unchanged.

**Input 0:**

* **Primary object:** Cells with value '2'.
* **Bottom left corner color:** '4'
* **Transformation:** All '2's are replaced with '4's.

**Input 1:**

* **Primary object:** Cells with value '3'.
* **Bottom left corner color:** '6'
* **Transformation:** All '3's are replaced with '6's.


## Program Version 1:

```python
def solve(I):
  # Extract the color from the bottom left corner
  x1 = crop(I, (-1,-1), (1,1))
  x2 = index(x1, ORIGIN)
  # Identify the object to be recolored (excluding background)
  x3 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  x4 = mostcommon(x3) 
  # Recolor the object 
  O = paint(cover(I, x4), recolor(x2, x4))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `x1 = crop(I, (-1,-1), (1,1))`: Extracts the bottom left corner cell as a single-celled grid.
2. `x2 = index(x1, ORIGIN)`: Gets the color value of the extracted cell.
3. `x3 = objects(I, T, F, T)`: Identifies all distinct objects in the grid, excluding the background.
4. `x4 = mostcommon(x3)`: Selects the most common object (the primary object in this case).
5. `O = paint(cover(I, x4), recolor(x2, x4))`: 
    * `cover(I, x4)`:  Replaces the primary object in the input grid with background color.
    * `recolor(x2, x4)`: Creates a new object identical to the primary object but with the color from the corner.
    * `paint(...)`: Paints the recolored object onto the grid where the original object was.


## Program Version 2:

```python
def solve(I):
  # Get the new color from the bottom left corner
  new_color = I[-1][0]
  # Recolor the objects directly
  O = tuple(tuple(new_color if v != 0 else 0 for v in row) for row in I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `new_color = I[-1][0]`: Directly accesses the color value in the bottom-left corner of the input grid.
2. `O = tuple(tuple(new_color if v != 0 else 0 for v in row) for row in I)`: Iterates through each cell in the grid and replaces its value with `new_color` if it's not the background color (0), effectively recoloring the primary object.


## Program Version 3:

```python
def solve(I):
  # Identify the object to be recolored (assuming it's the only non-background object)
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  x2 = first(x1)
  # Extract the recoloring color 
  x3 = crop(I, (-1,-1), (1,1))
  x4 = index(x3, ORIGIN)
  # Recolor and paint the object
  O = paint(I, recolor(x4, x2)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)`:  Identifies all objects in the grid except the background.
2. `x2 = first(x1)`: Assumes the first object is the only non-background object and selects it.
3. `x3 = crop(I, (-1,-1), (1,1))`: Extracts the bottom left corner cell.
4. `x4 = index(x3, ORIGIN)`: Retrieves the color value from the extracted cell.
5. `O = paint(I, recolor(x4, x2))`:  Recolors the identified object with the extracted color and paints it directly onto the input grid.


## Program Version 4:

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find the color to use for recoloring
  target_color = I[-1][0]
  # Identify all non-background colors
  old_colors = palette(I) - {0}
  # Replace each non-background color with the target color
  O = I
  for old_color in old_colors:
    O = replace(O, old_color, target_color)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `target_color = I[-1][0]`: Gets the color from the bottom left corner.
2. `old_colors = palette(I) - {0}`:  Finds all distinct colors in the grid except the background color (0).
3. `O = I`: Initializes the output grid as a copy of the input.
4. The loop iterates through each `old_color` and uses `replace(O, old_color, target_color)` to replace all instances of `old_color` with `target_color` in the output grid.

## Program Version 5:

```python
def solve(I):
  # Directly access and replace the color of the object (assuming only one non-background object exists)
  O = tuple(
      tuple(I[-1][0] if cell != 0 else 0 for cell in row) 
      for row in I
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly modifies the input grid cell by cell. It iterates through each row and cell, replacing the cell's value with the color from the bottom left corner (`I[-1][0]`) only if the cell is not part of the background (value not 0). This assumes there's only one object besides the background.


These versions use different approaches and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same outcome, showcasing diverse code generation capabilities.
