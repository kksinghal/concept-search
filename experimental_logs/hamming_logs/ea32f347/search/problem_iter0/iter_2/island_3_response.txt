## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to follow these rules:

1. **Recolor:** The digit '5' is always replaced. The replacement color depends on the object's position:
   * **Rightmost Object:** The rightmost object (containing the cell with the highest column index) formed by '5's is always recolored to '2'. 
   * **Other Objects:** All other objects formed by '5's are recolored to '1'.
2. **Fill:** Digits other than '0' and the recolored '5's are replaced with '4'.

**Let's break it down for each example:**

* **Input_0:** 
   * The rightmost vertical line of '5's becomes '2'.
   * The other vertical line of '5's becomes '1'.
* **Input_1:** 
   *  The rightmost vertical line of '5's becomes '2'.
   *  The other vertical line of '5's becomes '1'.
* **Input_2:** 
   *  The rightmost vertical line of '5's becomes '2'.
   *  The horizontal line of '5's becomes '1'.
* **Input_3:** 
   *  The rightmost vertical line of '5's becomes '2'.
   *  The other two lines of '5's become '1'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the `Program_to_be_generated` function using the DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Get all objects, treating diagonals as connected
  rightmost_obj = argmax(objs, lambda o: rightmost(toindices(o))) # Find the rightmost object
  O = replace(I, FIVE, ONE)  # Replace all '5's with '1' initially
  O = paint(O, TWO, rightmost_obj)  # Recolor the rightmost object to '2'
  O = paint(O, FOUR,  mfilter(objs, lambda o: color(o) != FIVE and color(o) != ZERO)) # Recolor other non-zero digits to '4'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We begin by identifying all connected objects in the input grid `I` using `objects(I, T, T, T)`. 
2. **Find Rightmost:**  The `argmax` function helps us locate the rightmost object based on the maximum column index (`rightmost`) of its cells.
3. **Initial Recoloring:** We replace all occurrences of '5' with '1' as a starting point.
4. **Rightmost Recolor:** The rightmost object is then specifically targeted and recolored to '2'.
5. **Final Recoloring:** Finally, we iterate through the remaining objects, recoloring any non-zero and non-'5' digits to '4'.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  rightmost_indices = toindices(argmax(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: rightmost(toindices(o))))  
  O = fill(I, ONE, mfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == FIVE and not contained(first(rightmost_indices), toindices(o)))) 
  O = fill(O, FOUR, mfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) != FIVE and color(o) != ZERO))
  return paint(O, TWO, rightmost_indices)  
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Rightmost Indices:** We identify the indices of the rightmost object directly.
2. **Fill Non-Rightmost:** We fill all '5's that are not part of the rightmost object with '1'.
3. **Fill Others:** Similar to before, non-zero, non-'5' digits are filled with '4'.
4. **Paint Rightmost:** Finally, we paint the pre-identified rightmost indices with '2'.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  rightmost_obj = argmax(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: rightmost(toindices(o)))
  O = paint(fill(I, ZERO, mfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) != FIVE)), ONE, mfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == FIVE and o != rightmost_obj))
  return paint(O, TWO, rightmost_obj)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Rightmost Object:**  Identify the rightmost object.
2. **Fill and Paint:** In a single step, we fill everything except non-'5' digits with '0', then paint all '5' objects except the rightmost one with '1'.
3. **Paint Rightmost:** Paint the rightmost object with '2'.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  rightmost_index = argmax(asindices(I), lambda idx: idx[1] if I[idx[0]][idx[1]] == FIVE else NEG_ONE)
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == FIVE:
        O = fill(O, TWO if (i, j) == rightmost_index else ONE, {(i, j)}) 
      elif val != ZERO:
        O = fill(O, FOUR, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Rightmost Index:**  Find the index of the rightmost '5' directly.
2. **Iterative Filling:** Iterate through the grid, filling cells based on their values and the rightmost index.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  rightmost_obj_indices = toindices(argmax(objs, lambda o: rightmost(toindices(o))))
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    target_color = TWO if intersection(rightmost_obj_indices, toindices(obj)) else (ONE if color(obj) == FIVE else FOUR)
    O = paint(O, target_color, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object and Indices:** Identify objects and the indices of the rightmost object.
2. **Canvas Initialization:** Create a blank canvas of '0's.
3. **Object Painting:** Iterate through objects, painting them based on their color and relation to the rightmost object. 

These five programs showcase different ways to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each program analyzes the input grid, identifies key elements like the rightmost object, and applies the recoloring logic to produce the desired output.
