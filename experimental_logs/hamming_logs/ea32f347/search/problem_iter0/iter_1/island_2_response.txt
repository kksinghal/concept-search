## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation recolors objects on the grid based on their size. The largest object gets color 1, the second largest gets color 2, and so on. However, there's a catch: 

* **Specific Color Assignment:** The colors assigned to the objects are not sequential. The second largest object always receives color 4, and the smallest object always receives color 2. The rest of the objects receive colors sequentially, starting from color 3, based on their size.

Let's break down the transformations for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
* The largest object (7 cells) is recolored to 1.
* The second largest object (3 cells) is recolored to 4.
* The smallest object (1 cell) is recolored to 2.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
* Same logic as Input_0 to Output_0.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
* Same logic as Input_0 to Output_0.

**Input_3 to Output_3:**
* Same logic as Input_0 to Output_0.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_version_1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  objs_sorted = order(objs, size)
  recolored_objs = mpapply(
      lambda i, obj: recolor({0: 1, 1: 4, 2: 2}.get(i, i + 3), obj),
      interval(0, size(objs_sorted), 1),
      objs_sorted
  )
  O = paint(I, recolored_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies all distinct objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`objs_sorted = order(objs, size)`:** Sorts the objects based on their size in ascending order.
3. **`recolored_objs = ...`:**  This part iterates through the sorted objects and applies the recoloring logic:
    *  `interval(0, size(objs_sorted), 1)`: Creates a sequence of indices for each object.
    *  `{0: 1, 1: 4, 2: 2}.get(i, i + 3)`: A dictionary maps the first three indices (0, 1, 2) to their designated colors (1, 4, 2). For other indices, it assigns colors sequentially starting from 3.
4. **`O = paint(I, recolored_objs)`:** Paints the recolored objects onto a copy of the input grid.


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_version_2(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  size_mapping = {
      size(obj): {0: 1, 1: 4}.get(i, i + 3) 
      for i, obj in enumerate(order(objs, lambda obj: -size(obj)))
  }
  recolored_objs = mpapply(lambda obj: recolor(size_mapping[size(obj)], obj), objs)
  O = paint(I, recolored_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies distinct objects in the input grid.
2. **`size_mapping = ...`:** Creates a dictionary mapping object sizes to their designated colors. It sorts objects by size (descending) and uses a dictionary to handle specific color assignments for the largest and second largest objects.
3. **`recolored_objs = ...`:** Recolors each object based on its size and the corresponding color from `size_mapping`.
4. **`O = paint(I, recolored_objs)`:**  Paints the recolored objects back onto the input grid.


### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_version_3(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  def recolor_func(obj, color_map = {1: 2, 2: 4}):
      s = size(obj)
      color = color_map.pop(s, len(color_map) + 2)
      return recolor(color, obj)
  recolored_objs = mpapply(recolor_func, order(objs, lambda obj: -size(obj)))
  O = paint(I, recolored_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts distinct objects from the input grid.
2. **`recolor_func(...)`:** Defines a function to recolor an object. It uses a dictionary `color_map` to handle special cases for the smallest and second largest objects. If the object's size is not in the dictionary, it assigns a color sequentially.
3. **`recolored_objs = ...`:** Sorts the objects by size (descending) and applies the `recolor_func` to each object.
4. **`O = paint(I, recolored_objs)`:**  Combines the recolored objects back onto the input grid.


### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_version_4(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  def get_color(obj, used_colors= {1, 2}):
    obj_size = size(obj)
    color = 4 if obj_size == 2 else 1
    while color in used_colors:
      color += 1
    used_colors.add(color)
    return color
  recolored_objs = mpapply(lambda obj: recolor(get_color(obj), obj), objs)
  O = paint(I, recolored_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Finds all distinct objects in the input grid.
2. **`get_color(...)`:** Defines a function to determine the color for an object. It handles the special cases for the smallest and second largest objects directly. For other sizes, it finds the next available color not in `used_colors`.
3. **`recolored_objs = ...`:** Applies the `get_color` function to recolor each object.
4. **`O = paint(I, recolored_objs)`:** Paints the recolored objects onto the input grid.


### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_version_5(I):
  objs = order(objects(I, T, F, T), size)
  recolored_objs = tuple(recolor({1: 2, 2: 4}.get(i+1, i+3), obj) for i, obj in enumerate(objs))
  O = paint(I, recolored_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = order(objects(I, T, F, T), size)`:** Finds and sorts all distinct objects by size in ascending order.
2. **`recolored_objs = ...`:**  Iterates through the sorted objects and recolors them:
    *  `{1: 2, 2: 4}.get(i+1, i+3)`:  Uses a dictionary to map the smallest and second largest object indices (1 and 2) to their designated colors (2 and 4).  For other indices, assigns colors sequentially starting from 3.
3. **`O = paint(I, recolored_objs)`:** Paints the recolored objects back onto the input grid.


These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation while adhering to the provided DSL. They highlight the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for solving spatial reasoning tasks.
