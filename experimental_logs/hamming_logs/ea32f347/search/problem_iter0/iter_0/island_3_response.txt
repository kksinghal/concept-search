## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) and then replacing them with different digits based on their original value:

* **5 becomes 1:** All occurrences of digit '5' are replaced with '1'.
* **Other than 5 & 0 become 4:**  Any digit other than '5' and '0' (background) is replaced with '4'.
* **Rightmost object's value become 2:** The rightmost object on the grid, regardless of its original value, is transformed to have the value '2'. 

This logic holds true for all input-output pairs.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  rightmost_obj = argmax(objs, rbind(rightmost, toindices))
  O = paint(
      paint(
        fill(I, ONE, mfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == FIVE)), 
        FOUR, 
        mfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) != FIVE)), 
      TWO, 
      rightmost_obj
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Find rightmost object:** `rightmost_obj = argmax(objs, rbind(rightmost, toindices))` determines the rightmost object by comparing the `rightmost` index of each object.
3. **Replace 5 with 1:** `fill(I, ONE, mfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == FIVE))` creates a new grid where all '5's are replaced with '1's.
4. **Replace other digits with 4:** `paint(..., FOUR, mfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) != FIVE))` paints over the previous grid, replacing all digits except '5' and '0' with '4'.
5. **Replace rightmost object with 2:** `paint(..., TWO, rightmost_obj)` finally paints the rightmost object with '2'.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  rightmost_obj = argmax(objs, lambda obj: rightmost(toindices(obj)))
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    new_color = TWO if obj == rightmost_obj else (ONE if color(obj) == FIVE else FOUR)
    O = paint(O, recolor(new_color, toindices(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects and rightmost:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Iterate through objects:** The code iterates through each identified object.
3. **Determine new color:** For each object, it decides the new color: '2' for the rightmost, '1' if the original color was '5', and '4' otherwise.
4. **Paint object:** It recolors the object with the new color and paints it onto a copy of the input grid. 


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = replace(I, FIVE, ONE)
  for i, row in enumerate(O):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != ZERO:
        O = fill(O, FOUR, {(i, j)})
  rightmost_indices = argmax(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda obj: rightmost(toindices(obj)))
  O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, rightmost_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Replace 5 with 1:** Directly replaces all occurrences of '5' with '1'.
2. **Replace non-zeros with 4:** Iterates through each cell, filling non-zero values with '4'.
3. **Find and paint rightmost:** Identifies and recolors the rightmost object with '2' similar to previous versions.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    rightmost_j = max(j for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, val in enumerate(row) if val != ZERO)
    O = replace(I, FIVE, ONE)
    O = tuple(tuple(TWO if j == rightmost_j and val != ZERO else (FOUR if val != ZERO else ZERO) for j, val in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(O))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find rightmost column:** Determines the rightmost column containing a non-zero value.
2. **Replace 5 with 1:** Directly replaces '5' with '1'.
3. **Replace based on column and value:** Iterates through the grid, replacing values: '2' for cells in the rightmost column with non-zero values, '4' for other non-zero values, and '0' remains unchanged. 


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val == FIVE:
                O = fill(O, ONE, {(i,j)})
            elif val != ZERO:
                O = fill(O, FOUR, {(i,j)})
    rightmost_obj = argmax(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda obj: rightmost(toindices(obj)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, rightmost_obj))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create empty canvas:** Starts with an empty grid of the same size as the input.
2. **Fill 1 and 4 based on input:** Iterates through the input grid, filling the new grid with '1' for '5's and '4' for other non-zero values. 
3. **Find and paint rightmost:**  Identifies and paints the rightmost object with '2'. 


These five versions utilize different combinations of DSL functions and logic flow to achieve the same transformation.  They demonstrate the flexibility of the DSL and provide diverse solutions to the problem.
