## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to involve the following steps:

1. **Identify Primary and Secondary Objects:**  The input grids contain objects formed by connected cells of the same digit (excluding the background digit '0'). The primary object is the largest object (by area). All other objects are considered secondary.

2. **Recolor Objects:** The primary object is recolored to '1', and the secondary objects are recolored to '2'.

3. **Create Outlines:**  An outline ('4') is drawn around each secondary object ('2'). The outline is one cell away from the object in all directions.

**Example (Input 0):**

- **Input:** The primary object is the '5' shape, and there's a single secondary object (the isolated '5').
- **Output:** The '5' shape becomes '1', the isolated '5' becomes '2', and a '4' outline surrounds the isolated '2'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions in the DSL, each with an explanation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Identify the largest object 
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  x2 = argmax(x1, size)
  
  # Recolor the largest object to 1
  x3 = replace(I, mostcolor(x2), ONE)
  
  # Identify and recolor smaller objects to 2
  x4 = difference(x1, {x2})
  x5 = mfilter(x4, rbind(toindices, x3))
  x6 = fill(x3, TWO, x5)
  
  # Draw outlines around the smaller objects
  x7 = mapply(outbox, x4)
  O = fill(x6, FOUR, x7)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Largest Object (x1-x2):** `objects` extracts all objects, and `argmax(x1, size)` finds the largest one (`x2`).
2. **Recolor Primary (x3):**  `replace` recolors the largest object to '1'.
3. **Recolor Secondary (x4-x6):**  `difference` finds secondary objects.  `mfilter` gets their indices, and `fill` recolors them to '2'.
4. **Draw Outlines (x7-O):** `mapply(outbox, x4)` calculates outline indices, and `fill` draws them with '4'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find all objects
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  
  # Find the most frequent color and replace it with 1
  x2 = mostcolor(I) 
  x3 = replace(I, x2, ONE)
  
  # Recolor other objects to 2 and draw outlines
  x4 = mfilter(x1, rbind(toindices, x3))
  x5 = fill(x3, TWO, x4)
  x6 = mapply(lambda x: delta(toindices(x)), x1)
  O = fill(x5, FOUR, x6)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Objects (x1):** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Recolor Primary (x2-x3):**  Finds the most common color (primary object) and replaces it with '1'.
3. **Recolor & Outline (x4-O):**  `mfilter` gets indices of all objects (excluding background). `fill` recolors them to '2', `delta` calculates outlines, and another `fill` draws them.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Identify objects
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  
  # Find and recolor the largest object 
  x2 = argmax(x1, size)
  x3 = recolor(ONE, toindices(x2)) 
  x4 = paint(I, x3)
  
  # Recolor remaining objects and draw outlines 
  x5 = difference(x1, {x2})
  x6 = mapply(rbind(toobject, x4), x5)
  x7 = mapply(compose(rbind(fill, FOUR), delta), x6)
  O = merge([paint(x4, obj) for obj in x7])
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects (x1):** As before.
2. **Process Primary (x2-x4):** Finds largest object, recolors it directly to '1' using `recolor`, and paints it onto a copy of the input.
3. **Process Secondary (x5-O):**  Finds secondary objects.  `mapply` and nested functions recolor them to '2', calculate outlines, and paint them onto the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Identify and recolor objects
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  x2 = argmax(x1, size)
  x3 = replace(I, mostcolor(x2), ONE)
  x4 = difference(x1, {x2})
  x5 = mapply(rbind(toindices, x3), x4)
  x6 = fill(x3, TWO, x5)
  
  # Draw outlines using box function
  x7 = mapply(rbind(toobject, x3), x4)
  x8 = mapply(box, x7)
  O = fill(x6, FOUR, x8) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Recolor (x1-x6):**  Similar to previous versions, identifies and recolors primary and secondary objects. 
2. **Outlines with `box` (x7-O):** This version leverages the `box` function to directly calculate the outline indices of the recolored secondary objects (`x7`) and draws them (`x8`, `O`). 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find objects and background color
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  x2 = mostcolor(I)
  
  # Create a blank canvas
  x3 = canvas(x2, shape(I))
  
  # Paint largest object onto the canvas
  x4 = argmax(x1, size)
  x5 = recolor(ONE, toindices(x4))
  x6 = paint(x3, x5)
  
  # Process smaller objects: recolor and add outlines
  x7 = difference(x1, {x4})
  x8 = [(recolor(TWO, toindices(obj)), outbox(obj)) for obj in x7]
  O = merge([paint(fill(x6, FOUR, o[1]), o[0]) for o in x8])
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization (x1-x3):**  Identifies objects and background, then creates a blank canvas filled with the background color.
2. **Process Primary (x4-x6):**  Finds and recolors the largest object to '1' and paints it onto the canvas.
3. **Process Secondary (x7-O):**  Finds secondary objects.  For each, it recolors to '2', calculates the outline, and paints both onto the canvas. 

## Conclusion:

These five program versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation. Each leverages the DSL functions in unique ways, demonstrating the flexibility of the language and the potential for diverse solutions.
