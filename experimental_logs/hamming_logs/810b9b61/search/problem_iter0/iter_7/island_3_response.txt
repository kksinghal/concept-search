## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied in all the examples involves identifying objects formed by a specific digit (1 in these cases) and then replacing those objects with another digit (3 in these cases). The key difference lies in how objects are defined:

**Input 0 & Output 0:** Objects are defined by connected pixels of the same value (1) horizontally and vertically, excluding diagonal connections. 

**Input 1 & Output 1:** Same as above.

**Input 2 & Output 2:**  Same as above.

## Program to be Generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  ones = colorfilter(objs, 1)
  threes = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), ones)
  return paint(I, merge(threes))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)`:** This identifies objects formed by connected pixels of the same value (using `univalued=True`), considering only horizontal and vertical connections (using `diagonal=False`).
2. **`ones = colorfilter(objs, 1)`:** This filters the objects to keep only those composed of the digit '1'.
3. **`threes = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), ones)`:** This iterates over the filtered objects and replaces the color of each object from '1' to '3'.
4. **`return paint(I, merge(threes))`:** This paints the modified objects back onto the original grid, effectively replacing all '1' objects with '3' objects.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1) 
  return fill(I, 3, ones)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = ofcolor(I, 1)`:**  This identifies the indices of all grid cells containing the value '1'.
2. **`return fill(I, 3, ones)`:** This fills the grid `I` with the value '3' at the indices stored in `ones`, effectively replacing all occurrences of '1' with '3'.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return replace(I, 1, 3)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`replace(I, 1, 3)`:** This function directly replaces all occurrences of the digit '1' with the digit '3' in the input grid `I`.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  threes = frozenset((3, (i, j)) for i, r in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(r) if v == 1)
  return paint(I, threes)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`threes = frozenset((3, (i, j)) for i, r in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(r) if v == 1)`:** This creates a new object `threes` containing all cells with value '1' in the input grid `I`, but with their values replaced by '3'. 
2. **`return paint(I, threes)`:** This paints the `threes` object onto the original grid, effectively replacing all occurrences of '1' with '3'.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(3 if v == 1 else v for v in row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses list comprehension for a more Pythonic approach:

1. **`(3 if v == 1 else v for v in row)`:** This iterates through each value `v` in each `row` of the grid. If `v` is equal to 1, it's replaced with 3; otherwise, it remains unchanged. 
2. **`tuple(tuple(...) for row in I)`:** This applies the inner list comprehension to each row in the grid `I` and converts the resulting lists back into tuples to maintain the grid structure. 

All five versions achieve the same outcome: replacing objects composed of the digit '1' with the digit '3' while preserving other elements in the grid. They demonstrate different approaches to achieve this transformation using various functions from the provided DSL.
