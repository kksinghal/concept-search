## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying objects formed by the digit '1' within the input grid and recoloring these objects to the digit '3'. 

**Detailed Analysis:**

* **Input_0 to Output_0:** All connected components of '1's are replaced by '3's, while other digits remain unchanged.
* **Input_1 to Output_1:** Same as the previous transformation, showing the logic applies to multiple disconnected components of '1's.
* **Input_2 to Output_2:** This reinforces the previous observation, confirming the transformation targets specifically the digit '1'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using different DSL functions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:** Using `objects` and `paint`

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)  # Extract connected objects of same color
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1)    # Filter objects with color 1
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), target_objs)  # Recolor to 3
  O = I                                   # Initialize output grid
  for obj in recolored_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)                   # Paint each recolored object onto output
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 
1. **Extract objects:** Identify connected components of identical digits using `objects`.
2. **Filter by color:** Isolate objects consisting solely of the digit '1' using `colorfilter`.
3. **Recolor:**  Change the color of the extracted objects to '3' using `recolor`.
4. **Paint:**  Overlay each recolored object onto a copy of the input grid using `paint`.

**Program Version 2:** Using `partition` and `paint`

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = partition(I)                 # Partition the grid based on color
  O = I                               # Initialize output grid
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 1:               # Check if the object's color is 1
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, obj))  # Recolor to 3 and paint on output grid
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)              # Paint the object as is
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Partition:**  Divide the grid into objects where each object comprises cells of the same digit using `partition`.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:** Loop through each object, recoloring those with color '1' to '3' using `recolor`.
3. **Paint:**  Overlay each object, including the recolored ones, onto a copy of the input grid using `paint`.

**Program Version 3:**  Using `ofcolor` and `fill`

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices = ofcolor(I, 1)           # Find indices of cells with color 1
  O = fill(I, 3, indices)           # Fill those indices with color 3
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Locate target cells:** Directly obtain the indices of all cells containing '1' using `ofcolor`.
2. **Fill with new color:**  Replace the values at the identified indices with '3' using `fill`.

**Program Version 4:** Using list comprehension and `astuple`

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = tuple(
      tuple(
          3 if v == 1 else v              # Replace 1 with 3, keep other values
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      ) 
      for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through cells:** Nested loop traverses the grid row by row, accessing individual cells.
2. **Conditional replacement:** Within the loop, check each cell's value. If it's '1', replace it with '3'; otherwise, retain the original value.

**Program Version 5:** Using `apply` and lambda function

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  recolor_func = lambda x: 3 if x == 1 else x  # Define a recoloring function
  O = apply(
      lambda row: tuple(apply(recolor_func, row)),  # Apply to each row
      I
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Recoloring function:**  Define a lambda function `recolor_func` to replace '1' with '3' and keep other values unchanged.
2. **Apply to rows:**  Employ the `apply` function to apply `recolor_func` to each cell within each row of the grid.


These versions demonstrate diverse approaches to solve the given transformation task, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL.
