## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves recoloring all occurrences of the digit "1" to the digit "3" while preserving the positions of all other digits. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

* **Input_0 to Output_0:**  All instances of the digit "1" are replaced with "3". For example, the "1 1 1" clusters in the input become "3 3 3" in the output.
* **Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the first pair, every "1" digit transforms into a "3" digit, maintaining its original position within the grid. 
* **Input_2 to Output_2:** Again, each "1" is replaced by a "3" while the remaining grid structure and digit values stay the same. 


## Program_to_be_generated: with score 0

### Program Version 1:
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return replace(I, 1, 3) 
```

**Explanation:**
This version directly utilizes the `replace` function from the DSL. It efficiently replaces all occurrences of "1" with "3" in the input grid `I`, producing the desired output.


### Program Version 2:
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  ones = colorfilter(objs, 1)
  threes = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), ones)
  return paint(I, merge(threes))
```

**Explanation:**
This version first identifies all objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid `I` using `objects`. Then, it filters for objects with color "1" using `colorfilter`. Next, it uses `mapply` to apply `recolor` to each object in `ones`, changing their color to "3". Finally, it paints all the recolored objects back onto the input grid using `paint`.


### Program Version 3:
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  return fill(I, 3, indices) 
```

**Explanation:**
This version identifies the indices of all cells containing "1" using `ofcolor`. It then uses the `fill` function to replace the values at those indices with "3" in the input grid `I`.


### Program Version 4:
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      O = paint(O, {(3 if val == 1 else val, (i, j))}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
This version iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`. If the cell value is "1", it paints a "3" at the corresponding location in a new canvas `O`. Otherwise, it paints the original cell value.


### Program Version 5:
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(3 if v == 1 else v for v in r) for r in I)
```

**Explanation:**
This version uses nested list comprehensions. It iterates through each row and each value in the input grid `I`. If the value is "1", it's replaced with "3"; otherwise, the original value is kept.
