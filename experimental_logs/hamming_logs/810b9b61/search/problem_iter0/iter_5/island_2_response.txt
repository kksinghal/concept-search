## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces all occurrences of the digit '1' with the digit '3' in all input-output pairs.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """Replaces all occurrences of the digit '1' with the digit '3'."""
  return replace(I, 1, 3) 
```

**Explanation:**

This program directly uses the `replace` function from the DSL. 
- It takes the input grid `I`.
- It identifies all cells with the value '1'.
- It replaces those cells' values with the value '3'.

This effectively transforms the input grids by replacing all '1's with '3's, matching the observed output.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """Replaces all occurrences of the digit '1' with the digit '3'."""
  objs = asobject(I)
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda x: x[0] == 1)
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda x: (3, x[1]), filtered_objs)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolored_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This program utilizes a combination of object manipulation and grid functions.
- It converts the input grid `I` into an object representation using `asobject`.
- It filters the objects to keep only those with color '1' using `sfilter`.
- It iterates through the filtered objects and replaces their color with '3' using `apply`.
- It creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid using `canvas`.
- Finally, it paints the recolored objects onto the blank canvas using `paint`.

This approach effectively achieves the desired transformation by manipulating the grid as an object representation and then painting the modified objects back onto a canvas.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """Replaces all occurrences of the digit '1' with the digit '3'."""
  indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  O = fill(I, 3, indices)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages the `ofcolor` and `fill` functions for a more direct approach.
- It identifies the indices of all cells with value '1' in the input grid `I` using `ofcolor`.
- It uses the `fill` function to replace the values at the identified indices with '3'. 

This method provides a concise way to achieve the desired transformation by directly targeting and modifying cells based on their value.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """Replaces all occurrences of the digit '1' with the digit '3'."""
  return tuple(tuple(3 if v == 1 else v for v in row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes nested list comprehensions for a more Pythonic approach.
- It iterates through each row of the input grid `I`.
- For every value `v` in the row, it checks if the value is '1'.
- If the value is '1', it replaces it with '3'; otherwise, it keeps the original value.

This method leverages Python's list comprehension feature for a compact and efficient way to achieve the desired transformation.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """Replaces all occurrences of the digit '1' with the digit '3'."""
  modified_grid = []
  for row in I:
    new_row = []
    for value in row:
      if value == 1:
        new_row.append(3)
      else:
        new_row.append(value)
    modified_grid.append(tuple(new_row))
  return tuple(modified_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested loops for a more explicit and beginner-friendly approach.
- It iterates through each row of the input grid `I`.
- For each row, it creates a new empty list `new_row`.
- For every value in the original row, it checks if the value is '1'.
- If the value is '1', it appends '3' to the `new_row`; otherwise, it appends the original value.
- After processing all values in a row, it appends the `new_row` to the `modified_grid`.

This method provides a clear and step-by-step implementation of the transformation, suitable for understanding the underlying logic.
