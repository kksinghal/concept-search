## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring objects formed by the digit '1' to the digit '3', while leaving all other digits unchanged.

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  recolored_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), filtered_objs)
  O = I
  for obj in recolored_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We use `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)` to identify all connected components ('objects') of the same digit within the input grid `I`.
2. **Filter Objects:**  Using `sfilter`, we keep only the objects where the `color` (the digit they consist of) is '1'.
3. **Recolor Objects:** We iterate through each filtered object using `mapply` and recolor them to '3' using the `recolor` function.
4. **Paint to Output:** Starting with the original grid `I`, we iteratively paint each recolored object onto the output grid `O` using the `paint` function.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)  
  O = replace(I, 1, 0)  
  return fill(O, 3, ones) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1's:** `ofcolor(I, 1)` identifies the indices of all cells containing the digit '1'.
2. **Replace '1's with '0's:** `replace(I, 1, 0)` replaces all occurrences of '1' with '0' in the input grid, essentially erasing the original objects.
3. **Fill with '3's:**  We use `fill(O, 3, ones)` to fill the output grid `O` with the digit '3' at the indices stored in `ones`. 

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(3 if v == 1 else v for v in row)
        for row in I
    )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested list comprehensions for a more direct approach:

1. **Iterate through Rows and Cells:** It iterates through each row and then each cell (`v`) within the input grid `I`.
2. **Conditional Replacement:** If the cell value `v` is '1', it's replaced with '3'; otherwise, it remains unchanged.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 1:
        O = paint(O, {(3, (i, j))}) 
      else:
        O = paint(O, {(value, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** `canvas(0, shape(I))` creates an empty grid (`O`) of the same size as the input, filled with '0's. 
2. **Iterate and Paint:**  It iterates through each cell of the input, painting the corresponding cell in the output grid. If the input cell is '1', it's painted as '3'; otherwise, it's painted with its original value.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_cell(v):
    return 3 if v == 1 else v
  return tuple(tuple(recolor_cell(v) for v in row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Helper Function:** A helper function `recolor_cell` encapsulates the logic of replacing '1' with '3'. 
2. **Apply to Grid:** Nested list comprehensions apply the `recolor_cell` function to each cell in the input grid `I`.

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation. Each leverages various DSL functions and offers varying levels of abstraction and code conciseness.
