## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying objects comprised of the digit '1' and recoloring them to the digit '3'. Let's break down each example:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** All occurrences of '1' are replaced with '3', regardless of their shape or position. 

**Input_1 -> Output_1:** Similar to Input_0, all '1' digits are replaced by '3'.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:** Again, all occurrences of '1' are replaced with '3'.


## Program to be Generated: 

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return replace(I, 1, 3) 
```

**Explanation:** 
This version directly utilizes the `replace` function from the DSL. It efficiently replaces all instances of '1' in the input grid `I` with '3', effectively achieving the desired transformation. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = partition(I)
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1)
  recolored_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), target_objs)
  O = I
  for obj in recolored_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 
This version first partitions the input grid `I` into individual objects using the `partition` function. Then, it identifies objects consisting solely of the color '1' using `colorfilter`. Next, it uses `mapply` to apply the `recolor` function to each identified object, changing their color to '3'. Finally, it iterates through the recolored objects and paints them onto a copy of the original grid using `paint`, creating the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  return fill(I, 3, indices)
```

**Explanation:** 
This version first identifies the indices of all cells containing the value '1' in the input grid `I` using `ofcolor`. It then utilizes the `fill` function to replace the values at these indices with '3', effectively generating the output grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      O = fill(O, 3 if value == 1 else value, {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 
This version iterates through every cell of the input grid `I`.  For each cell, it checks if the value is '1'. If it is, it fills the corresponding cell in a new canvas `O` (initialized with '0's) with '3'; otherwise, it fills with the original value.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(tuple(3 if v == 1 else v for v in row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:** 
This version uses nested list comprehensions to achieve the transformation. It iterates through each row and within each row, it iterates through each value. If the value is '1', it's replaced with '3'; otherwise, it remains unchanged. The transformed data is then converted back into a tuple of tuples, representing the output grid.

These five program versions provide distinct approaches to perform the color replacement task. Each leverages different DSL functions or combinations, showcasing the versatility of the provided DSL for solving this image transformation problem.
