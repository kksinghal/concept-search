## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve recoloring all the connected components of the value '1' in the input grid to the value '3' in the output grid, while keeping the rest of the grid unchanged.

**Example:**

* **Input:** A grid with connected components of '1's and other digits.
* **Output:** The same grid where all the '1's in connected components are replaced by '3's, while other digits remain the same.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL, along with explanations of how they achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:** (Using `objects` and `recolor`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  recolored_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), filtered_objs)
  O = I
  for obj in recolored_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify connected components:**  `objects(I, True, False, False)` finds all connected components in the input grid `I`. `univalued=True` ensures that only connected components with the same value are considered.
2. **Filter for components of '1':** `sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)` selects only the objects that consist of the value '1'.
3. **Recolor the filtered objects:** `mapply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), filtered_objs)` applies the `recolor` function to each filtered object, replacing the '1's with '3's.
4. **Paint the recolored objects back onto the original grid:**  The code iterates through the `recolored_objs` and uses `paint` to apply them to a copy of the input grid `I`, resulting in the output grid `O`.


**Version 2:** (Using `partition` and list comprehension)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  parts = partition(I)
  recolored = tuple(tuple(3 if v == 1 else v for v in row) for row in I)
  for obj in parts:
    if color(obj) == 1:
      recolored = paint(recolored, recolor(3, obj))
  return recolored 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition the grid:** `partition(I)` divides the input grid `I` into objects based on cell values.
2. **Create a recolored grid:** A new grid `recolored` is created by replacing all occurrences of '1' with '3' in the input grid `I`.
3. **Paint the recolored objects:** The code iterates through each object in `parts`. If the object's color is '1', it is recolored to '3' and painted onto the `recolored` grid.


**Version 3:** (Using `replace` and `objects`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
    ones = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
    O = replace(I, 1, 3) if ones else I
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects` function identifies all connected components.
2. **Find object with '1':** `extract` function finds the object consisting only of '1's.
3. **Replace if '1' exists:** If an object with '1' is found, the `replace` function replaces all '1's with '3's in the grid. Otherwise, the input grid is returned unchanged.

**Version 4:** (Using nested loops and conditional replacement)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = [[v for v in row] for row in I]
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v == 1:
        O[i][j] = 3
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a copy of the grid:** A new grid `O` is created as a nested list, copying values from the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate and replace:** The code iterates through each cell of the grid. If a cell's value is '1', it is replaced with '3' in the new grid `O`.


**Version 5:** (Using `asobject`, `sfilter` and `paint`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = asobject(I)
  filtered_obj = sfilter(obj, lambda cell: cell[0] == 1)
  recolored_obj = recolor(3, filtered_obj)
  O = paint(I, recolored_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Convert grid to object:** `asobject(I)` converts the entire input grid `I` into a single object.
2. **Filter cells with '1':** `sfilter(obj, lambda cell: cell[0] == 1)` selects only the cells in the object with the value '1'.
3. **Recolor the filtered cells:** `recolor(3, filtered_obj)` changes the value of all filtered cells to '3'.
4. **Paint the recolored cells onto the original grid:**  `paint(I, recolored_obj)` applies the recolored cells onto the input grid `I`, producing the output grid `O`.


Each of these five versions provides a distinct approach to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL and the potential for diverse solutions.
