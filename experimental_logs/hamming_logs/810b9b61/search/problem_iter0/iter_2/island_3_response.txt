## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves recoloring all instances of the digit '1' to the digit '3' while leaving all other digits unchanged. This applies to all input-output pairs provided.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return replace(I, 1, 3)
```

**Explanation:**

This program directly utilizes the `replace` function from the DSL. It takes the input grid `I` and replaces all occurrences of the value '1' with the value '3'. This effectively implements the observed transformation for all input-output pairs.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=False)
  recolored_objs = frozenset(recolor(3, obj) if color(obj) == 1 else obj for obj in objs)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

This version first identifies all distinct objects in the input grid `I` using the `objects` function. Then, it iterates through each object, recoloring those with color '1' to '3' using `recolor`. Finally, it paints the recoloured objects onto a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input grid, effectively achieving the desired transformation.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices_to_recolor = ofcolor(I, 1)
  return fill(I, 3, indices_to_recolor)
```

**Explanation:**

This program first identifies the indices of all cells in the input grid `I` that have the value '1' using the `ofcolor` function. Then, it uses the `fill` function to replace the values at these indices with '3', achieving the target transformation.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(3 if v == 1 else v for v in row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly iterates through each row and cell of the input grid `I`. If the cell value is '1', it replaces it with '3'; otherwise, it keeps the original value. This explicit iteration achieves the desired recoloring.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  condition = matcher(identity, 1)
  new_value = lambda x: 3
  return tuple(tuple(branch(condition(v), new_value(v), v) for v in row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a `condition` function to check if a value equals '1' and a `new_value` function to return '3'. It then iterates through the grid, using the `branch` function to apply the `new_value` function only to cells that satisfy the `condition`, thereby replacing '1' with '3' and leaving other values unchanged.
