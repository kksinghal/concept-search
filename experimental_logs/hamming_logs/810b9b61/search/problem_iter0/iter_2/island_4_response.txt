## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves two steps:

1. **Identifying Objects:**  Identify connected components of the digit '1' in the input grid. Two '1's are considered connected if they are directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally).
2. **Recoloring Objects:** Recolor all the identified '1' objects to the digit '3', leaving other digits unchanged. 

**Examples:**

* **Input_0:**  There are several '1' objects, including a horizontal line, a plus-sign shape, and a square. All these objects are recolored to '3' in the output.
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, but with fewer and simpler '1' objects.
* **Input_2:** Similar to the previous inputs, demonstrating the transformation's consistency across different grid configurations.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """Identifies '1' objects and repaints them as '3'."""
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)  # Find objects formed by '1's
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1)  # Select objects with color '1'
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), target_objs)  # Recolor to '3'
  O = paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))  # Paint the recolored objects onto a copy of the input grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, True, False, False)`: Identifies connected components of '1's in the grid `I`.
2. `colorfilter(objs, 1)`: Filters the identified objects to select only those composed of the digit '1'.
3. `apply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), target_objs)`: Applies the `recolor` function to each object in `target_objs`, changing their color to '3'.
4. `merge(recolored_objs)`: Merges the recolored objects into a single set of cells.
5. `paint(I, ...)`: Paints the merged, recolored objects onto a copy of the input grid `I`, resulting in the final output grid `O`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """Recolors connected '1's to '3' using cellwise replacement."""
  def recolor_condition(value, loc):
    return 3 if contained((1, loc), objects(I, True, False, False)) else value
  O = cellwise(I, I, 0) # Create a copy of the input grid
  O = prapply(recolor_condition, range(height(I)), range(width(I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `recolor_condition(value, loc)`: This nested function checks if a cell at location `loc` belongs to a '1' object using `objects`. If it does, it returns '3'; otherwise, it returns the original cell value.
2. `cellwise(I, I, 0)`: Creates a copy of the input grid `I`.
3. `prapply(recolor_condition, range(height(I)), range(width(I)))`: Applies the `recolor_condition` function to every cell in the grid, effectively recoloring connected '1's to '3'. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """Recolors '1' objects to '3' using object iteration and painting."""
  O = I  # Start with a copy of the input grid
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    if color(obj) == 1:
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `O = I`: Starts with a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. `for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):`: Iterates through each connected object identified by the `objects` function.
3. `if color(obj) == 1:`:  Checks if the object's color is '1'.
4. `O = paint(O, recolor(3, obj))`: If the object's color is '1', it is recolored to '3' and painted onto the output grid `O`. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """Uses a recursive approach to recolor connected '1's to '3'."""
  def recolor_recursive(grid, i, j):
    if i < 0 or i >= height(grid) or j < 0 or j >= width(grid) or grid[i][j] != 1:
      return
    grid[i][j] = 3
    recolor_recursive(grid, i + 1, j)
    recolor_recursive(grid, i - 1, j)
    recolor_recursive(grid, i, j + 1)
    recolor_recursive(grid, i, j - 1)
  G = [list(row) for row in I]  # Convert the input grid to a list of lists
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if G[i][j] == 1:
        recolor_recursive(G, i, j)
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in G)  # Convert back to a tuple of tuples
```

**Explanation:**

1. `recolor_recursive(grid, i, j)`:  A recursive function that takes the grid and a cell's coordinates as input. It checks if the current cell is within bounds and has a value of '1'. If so, it recolors the cell to '3' and recursively calls itself for the adjacent cells.
2. The main function converts the input grid `I` into a list of lists for easier modification. It then iterates through every cell, and if a cell has the value '1', it calls the `recolor_recursive` function to recolor the connected component. Finally, it converts the modified grid back to a tuple of tuples and returns it.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """Recolors '1' objects to '3' using flood fill logic."""
  def flood_fill(grid, i, j, target, replacement):
    if i < 0 or i >= height(grid) or j < 0 or j >= width(grid) or grid[i][j] != target:
      return
    grid[i][j] = replacement
    flood_fill(grid, i + 1, j, target, replacement)
    flood_fill(grid, i - 1, j, target, replacement)
    flood_fill(grid, i, j + 1, target, replacement)
    flood_fill(grid, i, j - 1, target, replacement)

  G = [list(row) for row in I]  # Make the grid mutable
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if G[i][j] == 1:
        flood_fill(G, i, j, 1, 3)
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in G)  # Convert back to a tuple of tuples
```

**Explanation:**

1. `flood_fill(grid, i, j, target, replacement)`: This function implements a flood fill algorithm. It takes the grid, cell coordinates, the target color (`1` in our case), and the replacement color (`3`). It recursively traverses and recolors connected cells with the target color.
2. The main function converts the input grid `I` to a list of lists for mutability. It then iterates through all cells, and if a cell has the value '1', it triggers the `flood_fill` function to recolor the connected component.  Finally, it converts the modified grid back to a tuple of tuples and returns it.

These five versions provide different approaches to accomplish the same transformation. While they achieve the same result, they showcase diverse programming logic and DSL function combinations.
