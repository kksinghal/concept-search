## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves recoloring objects with a specific value (1) to another value (3) while leaving the rest of the grid unchanged. 

**Example Breakdown:**

- **Input_0 to Output_0:** All occurrences of the digit '1' are replaced with '3', while the rest of the grid remains the same.
- **Input_1 to Output_1:**  Similarly, '1's are replaced with '3's, keeping the other grid elements unchanged.
- **Input_2 to Output_2:** The same pattern repeats â€“ '1's become '3's, with no other modifications.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)  # Extract objects from the grid
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1) # Filter objects with color 1
  recolored_objs = apply(rbind(recolor, 3), target_objs)  # Recolor filtered objects to 3
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))  # Paint recolored objects onto a blank canvas
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, False)` identifies connected regions of the same color ('1' in this case) as distinct objects within the input grid `I`.
2. **Filter by Color:**  `colorfilter(objs, 1)` isolates the objects that have the color value '1'.
3. **Recolor Objects:** `apply(rbind(recolor, 3), target_objs)` iterates over the filtered objects and uses `recolor` to change their color to '3'.
4. **Paint on Canvas:** A new canvas of the same size as the input grid is created using `canvas(0, shape(I))`, filled with '0's. The recolored objects are then painted onto this canvas using `paint` to generate the output `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = replace(I, 1, 3) # Directly replace 1s with 3s
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version simplifies the process by directly utilizing the `replace` function to substitute all occurrences of '1' in the input grid `I` with '3', generating the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices = ofcolor(I, 1)  # Get indices of cells with color 1
  O = fill(I, 3, indices)  # Fill those indices with color 3
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Indices:** `ofcolor(I, 1)` directly finds the indices of all cells within the input grid `I` that have the color value '1'.
2. **Fill with New Color:** `fill(I, 3, indices)` uses the collected indices to modify the input grid `I` directly. It fills the specified cells with the new color '3', producing the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I # Create a copy of the input grid
  for i in range(len(I)): # Iterate through rows
    for j in range(len(I[0])): # Iterate through columns
      if O[i][j] == 1: # Check if the cell value is 1
        O[i][j] = 3 # Replace 1 with 3
  return O # Return modified grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version employs a more iterative approach:

1. **Copy Input:** It creates a copy of the input grid `I` as `O` to avoid modifying the original. 
2. **Iterate and Replace:** It uses nested loops to traverse each cell of the grid `O`. If a cell contains the value '1', it's replaced with '3'. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  condition = lambda x: x == 1  # Define a condition to check for value 1
  new_value = lambda x: 3 if x == 1 else x  # Define a function to replace 1 with 3, otherwise keep the value
  O = apply(lambda row: tuple(new_value(cell) for cell in row), I) # Apply the replacement function to each cell in each row
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

This version emphasizes functional programming concepts:

1. **Define Condition and Replacement:** It defines a `condition` function to identify cells with value '1' and a `new_value` function to perform the replacement.
2. **Apply Transformation:**  It uses `apply` to apply the `new_value` function to every cell in the input grid `I`, effectively replacing all '1's with '3's and generating the output grid `O`.


These five distinct programs provide different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressive power of the provided DSL.
