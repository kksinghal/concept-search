## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves replacing the color '1' with the color '3' within the input grid.  

**Let's break down the transformation:**

* **Color Replacement:** The core logic is to find all instances of the digit '1' and replace them with the digit '3'.  

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program(I):
  """Replaces color 1 with color 3 in the grid."""
  return replace(I, 1, 3)
```

**Explanation:**

* `replace(I, 1, 3)`: This function directly replaces all occurrences of '1' with '3' in the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program(I):
  """Identifies objects of color 1 and repaints them to color 3."""
  objs = partition(I) 
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1)
  recolored_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), target_objs)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs)) 
```

**Explanation:**

* `partition(I)`: Divides the grid `I` into objects based on connected components of the same color.
* `colorfilter(objs, 1)`: Filters the objects to select those with color '1'.
* `mapply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), target_objs)`: Applies the `recolor` function to each object in `target_objs`, changing their color to '3'.
* `canvas(0, shape(I))`: Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid `I`, filled with '0'.
* `merge(recolored_objs)`: Combines all the recolored objects.
* `paint(..., ...)`:  Paints the combined recolored objects onto the blank canvas.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program(I):
  """Iterates through grid cells, replacing 1 with 3."""
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  return tuple(tuple(3 if I[i][j] == 1 else I[i][j] for j in range(w)) for i in range(h))
```

**Explanation:**

* This version uses nested loops to iterate through each cell in the grid.
* For each cell, it checks if the value is '1'. If it is, it replaces it with '3'; otherwise, it keeps the original value. 

**Program Version 4**

```python
def program(I):
  """Uses a lambda function with cell-wise condition for replacement."""
  return tuple(tuple(branch(v == 1, 3, v) for v in row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

* This version iterates through each row and cell using nested loops.
* `branch(v == 1, 3, v)`:  For each cell value `v`, this checks if it's equal to '1'. If true, it returns '3'; otherwise, it returns the original value `v`.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def program(I):
  """Applies a custom function to each cell to replace 1 with 3."""
  def recolor_cell(v):
    return 3 if v == 1 else v
  return apply(lambda row: tuple(apply(recolor_cell, row)), I)
```

**Explanation:**

* `recolor_cell(v)`:  A helper function that takes a cell value `v` and returns '3' if it's '1', otherwise returning the original value.
* `apply(lambda row: tuple(apply(recolor_cell, row)), I)`:  Applies the `recolor_cell` function to each cell in each row of the grid `I`.
