## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all input-output pairs involves identifying objects formed by the digit '1' and recoloring them to the digit '3'. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**  All occurrences of '1' are replaced with '3'.
**Input_1 -> Output_1:** Same as above, showcasing that other digits remain untouched.
**Input_2 -> Output_2:** Same logic applies, reinforcing the consistency of the transformation.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = partition(I)  # Partition the grid into objects based on color
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1)  # Filter objects to get those with color 1
  recolored_grid = I  # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input
  for obj in target_objs:
    recolored_grid = paint(recolored_grid, recolor(3, obj)) # Paint each target object with color 3
  return recolored_grid  
```

**Explanation:**

1. **partition(I):** Divides the input grid `I` into distinct objects based on adjacent cells with the same color.
2. **colorfilter(objs, 1):** Selects only the objects that have the color '1'.
3. **recolored_grid = I:** Initializes an output grid as a copy of the input.
4. **for obj in target_objs:** Iterates through each object with color '1'.
5. **recolor(3, obj):**  Changes the color of the current object to '3'.
6. **paint(recolored_grid, ...):**  Applies the recolored object to the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices = ofcolor(I, 1)  # Get indices of cells with color 1
  O = fill(I, 3, indices)  # Fill those indices with color 3
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **ofcolor(I, 1):**  Directly identifies the indices of all cells containing the value '1' in the input grid `I`.
2. **fill(I, 3, indices):** Creates a new grid `O` where the cells at the identified indices are filled with the value '3', effectively replacing all '1's with '3's.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return replace(I, 1, 3)  # Directly replace all occurrences of 1 with 3
```

**Explanation:**

1. **replace(I, 1, 3):**  This function directly substitutes all instances of the value '1' in the input grid `I` with the value '3', offering the most concise solution.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 1:
        O = paint(O, {(3, (i, j))})  # Paint individual cells with color 3 if they were originally 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **O = I:** Initializes an output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **for i, row in enumerate(I):** Iterates through each row of the input grid with its index `i`.
3. **for j, val in enumerate(row):** Iterates through each value `val` in the row with its index `j`.
4. **if val == 1:** Checks if the current cell value is '1'.
5. **paint(O, {(3, (i, j))}):** If the cell value is '1', it paints the corresponding cell in the output grid `O` with the value '3'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(tuple(3 if v == 1 else v for v in r) for r in I)
```

**Explanation:**

This program uses nested list comprehensions to iterate through each cell of the input grid and replace any cell with value 1 with value 3, while leaving other cells unchanged. 


These program versions utilize various DSL functions and demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation. This diversity allows for flexibility and efficiency depending on the specific context and potential constraints of the overall game.
