## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves recoloring all occurrences of the digit '1' to the digit '3' while leaving all other digits unchanged.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = replace(I, 1, 3)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This program uses the `replace` function directly to substitute all occurrences of '1' with '3' in the input grid `I`, effectively achieving the desired transformation.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  O = fill(I, 3, indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- `ofcolor(I, 1)` identifies the indices of all cells containing the value '1'.
- `fill(I, 3, indices)` then fills those specific indices with the value '3', modifying the input grid to produce the output.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = partition(I)
    target_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1)
    recolored_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), target_objs)
    O = I
    for obj in recolored_objs:
        O = paint(O, obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- `partition(I)` divides the grid into objects based on cell values.
- `colorfilter(objs, 1)` selects objects consisting only of '1's.
- `mapply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), target_objs)` applies the `recolor` function to each selected object, changing '1's to '3's.
- Finally, the program iterates through the recolored objects and paints them onto a copy of the input grid, resulting in the output.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This program iterates through every cell in the input grid. If a cell contains '1', it uses `fill` to replace that specific cell with '3' in the output grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  condition = lambda x: x == 1
  replacer = lambda x: 3 if condition(x) else x
  O = tuple(tuple(replacer(v) for v in r) for r in I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- A `condition` function is defined to check if a cell value is '1'.
- A `replacer` function applies the condition and replaces '1' with '3', otherwise keeping the original value.
- The program uses nested tuple comprehensions to apply the `replacer` to each cell in the input grid, generating the output grid.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches using the DSL to achieve the same transformation. They showcase the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for solving this image transformation problem.
