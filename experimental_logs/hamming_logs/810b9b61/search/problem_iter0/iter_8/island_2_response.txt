## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces all occurrences of the digit '1' within the input grid with the digit '3' in the output grid.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return replace(I, 1, 3)
```

**Explanation:**

This program directly leverages the `replace` function from the DSL. It takes the input grid `I`, identifies all instances of the digit '1' (`replacee`), and substitutes them with the digit '3' (`replacer`). This effectively achieves the desired transformation for all input-output pairs.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """Replaces '1' with '3' using nested functions."""
  return apply(lambda row: apply(lambda cell: 3 if cell == 1 else cell, row), I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through the input grid `I` row by row using the `apply` function. For each `row`, it applies another `apply` function to individually access each `cell`. If the `cell` is equal to '1', it's replaced with '3'; otherwise, it remains unchanged. This nested approach achieves the transformation without explicitly using the `replace` function.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """Replaces '1' with '3' by constructing a new grid."""
  return tuple(tuple(3 if I[i][j] == 1 else I[i][j] for j in range(len(I[0]))) for i in range(len(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly constructs a new grid based on the input grid `I`. It iterates through the rows and columns using nested loops with indices `i` and `j`, respectively.  If the value at `I[i][j]` is '1', it places a '3' in the corresponding position of the new grid; otherwise, it copies the original value. This explicit grid construction provides an alternative solution.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """Replaces '1' with '3' using objects."""
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=True, without_bg=False)
  filtered_objs = frozenset(recolor(3, obj) if color(obj) == 1 else obj for obj in objs)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(filtered_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the concept of objects from the DSL. First, it identifies all objects in the input grid `I` using `objects`. It then iterates through each `obj`, recoloring those with color '1' to '3' using `recolor`. Finally, it reconstructs the grid by painting the modified objects onto a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """Replaces '1' with '3' using indices and fill."""
  indices_to_replace = ofcolor(I, 1)
  return fill(I, 3, indices_to_replace)
```

**Explanation:**

This version first identifies the indices of all cells containing the value '1' using the `ofcolor` function. It then utilizes the `fill` function to replace the values at these specific `indices_to_replace` with the digit '3' within the input grid `I`. This approach focuses on manipulating the grid based on cell indices.
