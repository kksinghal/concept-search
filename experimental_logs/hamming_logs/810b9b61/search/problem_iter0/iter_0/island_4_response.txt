## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces all occurrences of a specific digit with the digit '3' while preserving other digits. Let's analyze each input-output pair to confirm:

**Pair 0:** Every '1' in the input grid is replaced by a '3' in the output grid. Other digits remain unchanged.

**Pair 1:**  The same pattern as Pair 0. Every '1' becomes a '3', and other digits are preserved.

**Pair 2:** Again, all instances of the digit '1' are transformed into '3', while the rest of the grid remains identical.

## Code Generation:

Based on the analysis, the core transformation logic involves identifying and replacing a specific digit.  We can achieve this using the DSL functions provided. Let's explore five distinct program versions:

**Program Version 1: Using `replace`**

```python
def solve(I):
  """Replaces all instances of the digit '1' with '3'."""
  O = replace(I, 1, 3) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **`solve(I)`:** Defines the main function taking the input grid `I`.
2. **`replace(I, 1, 3)`:**  This function directly substitutes all occurrences of '1' in the input grid `I` with the digit '3', generating the output grid `O`.
3. **`return O`:** The modified grid `O` is returned as the output.

**Program Version 2: Utilizing `objects` and `paint`**

```python
def solve(I):
  """Identifies objects of '1' and repaints them as '3'."""
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1)
  recolored_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), target_objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, False)`:** Extracts objects from the grid `I`, treating each '1' as a distinct object.
2. **`colorfilter(objs, 1)`:** Filters the extracted objects, keeping only those consisting of the digit '1'.
3. **`mapply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), target_objs)`:** Applies the `recolor` function to each object in `target_objs`, changing their color to '3'.
4. **`paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))`:**  Merges the recolored objects and paints them onto a copy of the input grid `I`, producing the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 3: Leveraging `asindices` and `fill`**

```python
def solve(I):
  """Fills locations of '1' with '3' using indices."""
  indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  O = fill(I, 3, indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`:**  Gets the indices of all cells in the input grid `I` that contain the value '1'.
2. **`fill(I, 3, indices)`:**  Fills the cells at the obtained `indices` with the value '3' on a copy of the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 4: Combining `partition` and `recolor`**

```python
def solve(I):
  """Partitions grid and recolors partitions of '1' to '3'."""
  parts = partition(I)
  target_part = extract(parts, lambda p: color(p) == 1)
  recolored = recolor(3, target_part)
  O = paint(I, recolored)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`partition(I)`:** Divides the grid into partitions where each partition represents a connected area of the same digit.
2. **`extract(parts, lambda p: color(p) == 1)`:** Finds the partition containing the digit '1'.
3. **`recolor(3, target_part)`:** Changes the color of the extracted partition to '3'.
4. **`paint(I, recolored)`:** Paints the recolored partition onto a copy of the input grid, resulting in the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 5: Employing nested loops**

```python
def solve(I):
  """Iterates through the grid and replaces '1' with '3'."""
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = [[0 for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(h)]
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      O[i][j] = 3 if I[i][j] == 1 else I[i][j]
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Nested Loops:**  Iterates over each cell of the input grid `I` using nested loops.
2. **Conditional Replacement:**  If the cell value is '1', it's replaced by '3'; otherwise, the original value is retained in the output grid `O`. 

These five versions demonstrate diverse ways to accomplish the digit replacement task within the constraints of the DSL. Choose the version that best suits your preference and coding style.
