## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation replaces all occurrences of a specific color (in this case, the digit '1') with another color (the digit '3') while leaving other colors unchanged.

**Example:**

* **Input:**  A grid containing the digits '0', '1', and potentially others.
* **Output:** The same grid where all occurrences of the digit '1' are replaced with the digit '3'. All other digits remain the same.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = replace(I, ONE, THREE)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`replace(I, ONE, THREE)`:** This function directly replaces all occurrences of the value `ONE` (which is 1) with the value `THREE` (which is 3) in the input grid `I`, effectively achieving the desired transformation.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def condition(x): return x != ONE
  O = fill(I, THREE, ofcolor(I, ONE))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`ofcolor(I, ONE)`:** This function identifies the indices of all cells in the input grid `I` that contain the value `ONE`.
2. **`fill(I, THREE, ...)`:** This function takes the input grid `I` and fills the cells at the indices returned by `ofcolor` with the value `THREE`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = partition(I)
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE)
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj), filtered_objs)
  O = I
  for obj in recolored_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`partition(I)`:** This function segments the input grid `I` into individual objects based on their color, returning a set of objects.
2. **`sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE)`:**  This filters the objects to keep only those where the color is equal to `ONE`.
3. **`apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj), filtered_objs)`:** This applies the `recolor` function to each filtered object, changing their color to `THREE`.
4. **Loop:** The code iterates through the recolored objects and paints them onto a copy of the original grid `I` (using `paint`), ultimately replacing all occurrences of '1' with '3'.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I)):
            if index(I, (i,j)) == ONE:
                O = fill(O, THREE, {(i,j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterating through cells:** The code iterates through each cell of the grid using nested loops.
3. **Conditional replacement:** For each cell, it checks if the value at that location in the input grid `I` is equal to `ONE`. If it is, it uses the `fill` function to replace the value at the same location in the output grid `O` with `THREE`.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def modify_cell(v, loc):
    return (THREE, loc) if v == ONE else (v, loc)
  O = asobject(I)
  O = apply(lambda cell: modify_cell(*cell), O)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), O)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asobject(I)`:** Converts the input grid `I` into an object representation.
2. **`apply(lambda cell: modify_cell(*cell), O)`:**  Applies the `modify_cell` function to each cell (value-location pair) in the object `O`.
3. **`modify_cell(v, loc)`:** This helper function checks if the cell value `v` is equal to `ONE`. If it is, it replaces the value with `THREE` while keeping the location `loc` the same. Otherwise, it returns the original cell unchanged.
4. **`paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), O)`:**  Creates a new canvas filled with `ZERO` values having the same shape as the input grid. Then, it paints the modified object `O` onto this canvas, resulting in the desired output grid.


These are just a few examples, and many other valid and distinct solutions are possible using the provided DSL functions. Each version showcases different approaches to achieve the same goal, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
