## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to recolor all instances of a specific color (in these examples, it's the digit '1') to another color (in these examples, it's the digit '3'), while keeping the rest of the grid unchanged.

**Input 0:**  All occurrences of the digit '1' are replaced with the digit '3'.

**Input 1:** Same as Input 0.

**Input 2:** Same as Input 0.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" in the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return replace(I, 1, 3)
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the `replace` function to directly substitute all occurrences of the digit '1' with the digit '3' in the input grid 'I'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = partition(I)
  filtered_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1)
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), filtered_objs)
  O = I
  for obj in recolored_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version first partitions the input grid 'I' into individual objects based on color using the `partition` function. It then filters for objects with the color '1' using `colorfilter`. The `apply` function then uses a lambda expression to recolor the filtered objects to '3' using `recolor`. Finally, it iterates through the recolored objects and paints them onto a copy of the original grid using `paint`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  O = fill(I, 3, indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version first identifies the indices of all cells with the color '1' using `ofcolor`. Then, it fills those specific indices in the input grid 'I' with the color '3' using the `fill` function, generating the output grid 'O'. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        O = paint(O, {(3, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each cell of the input grid 'I'. If the cell's value is '1', it paints a new object with color '3' at that location on a copy of the original grid using `paint`. This effectively replaces all '1's with '3's.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return switch(replace(I, 1, 3), 3, 1)
```

**Explanation:**

This version initially replaces all instances of '1' with '3' using the `replace` function. Then, it cleverly applies the `switch` function to swap the colors '3' and '1', effectively reverting any unintended replacements and ensuring only the original '1's are changed to '3's. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired color replacement transformation using the provided DSL functions. Each version leverages unique function combinations and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressive power of the DSL.
