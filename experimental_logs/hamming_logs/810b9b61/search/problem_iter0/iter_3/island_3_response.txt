## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves these steps:

1. **Identify objects:** Objects are groups of connected cells with the same value.
2. **Recolor specific objects:** Only objects with a value of '1' are recolored to '3'. All other values remain unchanged.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Version 1:** (Using `objects` and list comprehension)

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  recolored_objs = frozenset({recolor(THREE, obj) if color(obj) == ONE else obj for obj in objs})
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)`:**  Identifies all objects within the input grid `I`. We set `univalued=True` to group only cells with the same value and `diagonal=False` to consider only directly adjacent cells.
2. **`recolored_objs = frozenset({recolor(THREE, obj) if color(obj) == ONE else obj for obj in objs})`:**  Iterates through each identified object (`obj`). If the `color(obj)` is equal to `ONE`, it recolors the object to `THREE` using the `recolor` function. Otherwise, it keeps the object unchanged.
3. **`O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))`:** Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid filled with zeros (`canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`). Then, it paints all the recolored objects onto this canvas using the `paint` function after merging all objects using `merge` function.
4. **`return O`:** Returns the final transformed grid.

**Version 2:** (Using `partition` and `apply`)

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = partition(I)
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj) if color(obj) == ONE else obj, objs)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = partition(I)`:** Partitions the input grid into objects based on cell values using the `partition` function.
2. **`recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj) if color(obj) == ONE else obj, objs)`:** Applies a lambda function to each object in `objs`. This lambda function recolors the object to '3' if its color is '1', otherwise keeps it unchanged.
3. **`O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))`:** Similar to version 1, this line creates a blank canvas and paints the transformed objects onto it.
4. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.

**Version 3:** (Using nested loop and conditional replacement)

```python
def program_v3(I):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    O = [[0 for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(h)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if I[i][j] == 1:
                O[i][j] = 3
            else:
                O[i][j] = I[i][j]
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h, w = len(I), len(I[0])`:** Gets the height and width of the input grid.
2. **`O = [[0 for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(h)]`:** Creates an empty output grid `O` with the same dimensions as the input.
3. **Nested loop:** Iterates over each cell in the input grid `I`.
4. **`if I[i][j] == 1: O[i][j] = 3 else: O[i][j] = I[i][j]`:** If the cell value in the input is '1', the corresponding cell in the output is set to '3'. Otherwise, the cell value is copied from the input to the output.
5. **`return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)`:** Returns the output grid as a tuple of tuples.

**Version 4:** (Using `replace` function twice)

```python
def program_v4(I):
  temp_grid = replace(I, 1, 3)
  O = replace(temp_grid, 1, 0)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`temp_grid = replace(I, 1, 3)`:** Replaces all occurrences of '1' with '3' in the input grid `I` and stores the result in `temp_grid`. 
2. **`O = replace(temp_grid, 1, 0)`:** Replaces all remaining occurrences of '1' (which were originally '0') in `temp_grid` with '0' and stores the result in the output grid `O`.
3. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.

**Version 5:** (Using lambda function and `apply` on grid rows)

```python
def program_v5(I):
    recolor_row = lambda row: tuple(3 if val == 1 else val for val in row)
    O = tuple(apply(recolor_row, I))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`recolor_row = lambda row: tuple(3 if val == 1 else val for val in row)`:** Defines a lambda function `recolor_row` that takes a row as input. This function iterates through each value in the row and replaces '1' with '3' while keeping other values unchanged.
2. **`O = tuple(apply(recolor_row, I))`:** Applies the `recolor_row` function to each row of the input grid `I` using the `apply` function. This effectively recolors all '1's to '3's in the grid.
3. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid `O`. 

These are five distinct programs that achieve the desired transformation by leveraging different DSL functions and programming paradigms. Each version provides a unique approach to solve the problem, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
