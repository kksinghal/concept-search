## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces specific occurrences of the digit '1' with the digit '3', while leaving other digits untouched. The key is that only '1's that are part of a connected object (considering only direct neighbors, not diagonal) are being recolored. 

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** All connected groups of '1's are replaced by '3's.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  The same logic applies, highlighting that isolated '1's remain unchanged.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** Reinforces the pattern â€“ only the connected '1's within the object are transformed.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """Recolors connected '1's to '3' using object identification."""
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)  # Find connected objects of '1's
  recolored_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1) # Filter for objects with color '1'
  O = I # Start with the original grid
  for obj in recolored_objs:
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, obj)) # Paint each '1' object as '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Connected Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, False)` finds all connected objects in the grid, considering only directly adjacent cells and excluding background.
2. **Filter for '1' Objects:**  `sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)` keeps only the objects consisting entirely of the digit '1'.
3. **Iterative Recoloring:** The code iterates through the filtered objects and uses `paint` to recolor them to '3' on a copy of the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """Recolors connected '1's to '3' using cell-based conditions."""
  def recolor_condition(i, j):
    return 3 if contained((1, (i, j)), objects(I, True, False, False)) else index(I, (i,j))
  O = prapply(recolor_condition, range(height(I)), range(width(I)))
  return tuple(totuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Cell-Based Condition:** `recolor_condition(i, j)` checks if the cell at (i, j) belongs to a connected '1' object using `objects` and `contained`. If so, it returns '3'; otherwise, it returns the original cell value.
2. **Apply to All Cells:** `prapply` applies this condition to all cell indices generated by `range(height(I))` and `range(width(I))`.
3. **Construct Output Grid:**  The result is converted back into a tuple of tuples to match the grid format.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """Recolors connected '1's to '3' by iterating over objects."""
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    if color(obj) == 1:
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Objects:** It iterates over all connected objects in the grid obtained using `objects`.
2. **Check and Recolor:** For each object, it checks if its color (obtained using `color`) is '1'. If so, it uses `recolor` to change the object's color to '3' and then paints it back onto the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """Recolors connected '1's to '3' using a nested approach."""
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) == 1 and contained((1, (i, j)), objects(I, True, False, False)):
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(1, (i, j))}))
      else:
        O = paint(O, {(index(I, (i, j)), (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** An empty canvas is created using `canvas` with the same dimensions as the input.
2. **Iterate and Check:** The code iterates through every cell in the input grid.
3. **Conditional Recoloring:**  For each cell, it checks if the cell value is '1' and if it belongs to a connected '1' object. If both conditions are met, it recolors the cell to '3' and paints it onto the canvas. Otherwise, the original cell value is painted onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """Recolors connected '1's to '3' using a functional approach."""
  def recolor_cell(obj):
    return recolor(3, obj) if color(obj) == 1 else obj
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  recolored_objs = apply(recolor_cell, objs)
  O = I
  for obj in recolored_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Recoloring Function:** `recolor_cell` takes an object as input, recolors it to '3' if its color is '1', and returns the object.
2. **Apply to Objects:**  `apply` applies this function to all connected objects identified in the input grid.
3. **Paint Recolored Objects:** The code iterates through the recolored objects and paints them onto a copy of the input grid.


These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation, each with its own logic and use of DSL functions.
