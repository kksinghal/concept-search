## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying objects formed by the digit '1' in the input grid and recoloring them to '3' in the output grid. Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:** All connected groups of '1's are replaced with '3's, while the rest of the grid remains unchanged.

**Input_1 - Output_1:** Similar to Input_0, the connected '1' groups become '3's, and other digits remain the same.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**  Again, connected groups of '1' are replaced by '3's, with other values staying the same.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """Identifies '1' objects and repaints them as '3'."""
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)  # Find objects formed by '1's
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1)  # Select objects with color '1'
  recolored_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), target_objs)  # Recolor to '3'
  O = paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))  # Paint the recolored objects onto a copy of the input grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`objects(I, True, False, False)`**: Identifies connected groups of '1's as objects within the input grid `I`.
2.  **`colorfilter(objs, 1)`**: Filters the identified objects to select only those where the color is '1'.
3.  **`mapply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), target_objs)`**: Applies the `recolor` function to each object in `target_objs`, changing their color from '1' to '3'.
4.  **`paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))`**: Merges the recolored objects and paints them onto a copy of the input grid `I`, resulting in the output grid `O`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """Iterates through the grid, recoloring '1's to '3's."""
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))  # Create an empty canvas of the same size as input
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        O = paint(O, {(3, (i, j))})  # Paint '3' at the current location if it's a '1' in the input
      else:
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))}) # Otherwise, paint the original value
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`h, w = len(I), len(I[0])`**: Gets the height and width of the input grid.
2.  **`O = canvas(0, (h, w))`**: Creates a new grid `O` filled with '0's, having the same dimensions as the input grid.
3.  The nested loop iterates over each cell of the input grid.
4.  If the cell value is '1', it paints a '3' at the corresponding location in the output grid.
5.  Otherwise, it paints the original cell value from the input grid onto the output grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """Utilizes 'replace' function for direct substitution."""
  O = replace(I, 1, 3)  # Replace all occurrences of '1' with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 
This version directly employs the `replace` function to find all instances of '1' in the input grid and replace them with '3', producing the output grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """Identifies '1' indices and repaints them as '3'."""
  indices = ofcolor(I, 1) # Get indices of all '1's in the grid
  recolored_obj = recolor(3, indices)  # Recolor those indices to '3'
  O = paint(I, recolored_obj)  # Paint the recolored object onto the input grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`indices = ofcolor(I, 1)`**: This function directly extracts the indices of all cells containing the value '1' from the input grid `I`. 
2. **`recolored_obj = recolor(3, indices)`**: The `recolor` function then transforms these indices into an object representation, where the value at each index is changed to '3'.
3. **`O = paint(I, recolored_obj)`**:  Finally, the `paint` function overlays this recolored object onto a copy of the original input grid `I`, resulting in the desired output grid `O` where all '1's have been replaced by '3's.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """Uses lambda function for conditional recoloring."""
  O = apply(lambda row: tuple(3 if v == 1 else v for v in row), I)  # Recolor '1's to '3's row-wise
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`apply(lambda row: ..., I)`**: This applies a lambda function to each row of the input grid `I`.
2.  **`lambda row: tuple(3 if v == 1 else v for v in row)`**: This lambda function iterates through each value `v` in the row. If `v` is equal to 1, it's replaced by 3; otherwise, it remains unchanged. The result is converted back to a tuple to maintain the grid structure.

All five versions achieve the same outcome of recoloring '1's to '3's while maintaining other grid elements. They showcase the flexibility and diverse approaches possible within the provided DSL.
