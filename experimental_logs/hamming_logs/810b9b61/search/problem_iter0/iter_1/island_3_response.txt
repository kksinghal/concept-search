## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves recoloring all occurrences of the digit '1' to the digit '3', while preserving all other digits and the overall structure of the grid.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return replace(I, 1, 3)
```

**Explanation:** This version utilizes the `replace` function from the DSL to directly substitute all instances of the digit '1' with the digit '3' in the input grid (`I`). This simple approach effectively implements the observed transformation.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=True, without_bg=False)
  recolored = frozenset(recolor(3, obj) if color(obj) == 1 else obj for obj in objs)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in recolored:
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version first identifies all distinct objects in the input grid using `objects` (including single-cell objects). Then, it iterates through each object and uses `recolor` to change the color of objects with color '1' to '3'. Finally, it paints all the objects onto a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input, effectively replacing all '1's with '3's.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices_to_change = ofcolor(I, 1)
  O = I
  for i, j in indices_to_change:
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version first identifies the indices of all cells containing the digit '1' using `ofcolor`. Then, it iterates through these indices and uses `fill` to change the value at each of those locations to '3'. This approach directly modifies the input grid to achieve the desired transformation.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(3 if v == 1 else v for v in row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:** This version uses nested list comprehensions to iterate through each cell in the input grid. If the cell value is '1', it's replaced with '3'; otherwise, the original value is kept. This approach constructs a new grid with the desired transformation.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  f = lambda x: 3 if x == 1 else x
  return apply(lambda row: tuple(apply(f, row)), I)
```

**Explanation:** This version defines a lambda function `f` that represents the transformation logic (replacing '1' with '3'). Then, it utilizes the `apply` function twice - first to apply `f` to each cell in a row, and then to apply this row-wise transformation to each row in the input grid. This functional approach constructs a new grid reflecting the desired transformation.
