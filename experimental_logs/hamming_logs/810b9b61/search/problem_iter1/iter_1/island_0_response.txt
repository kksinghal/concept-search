## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently recolors objects composed of '1' values to '3' if their width is greater than or equal to 3. The remaining objects, including those composed of other values, are left untouched.

**Specific Examples:**

* **Input_0:** Two objects composed of '1's have a width greater than or equal to 3 and are recolored to '3'. Other '1' objects and the '1 1' object remain unchanged.
* **Input_1:** Only one object meets the criteria and is recolored.
* **Input_2:**  The large object composed of '1's is recolored, while the smaller '1 1' object remains unchanged.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1 and width(obj) >= 3)
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), filtered_objs)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs | (objs - filtered_objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)` extracts all connected objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Filter Objects:** `sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1 and width(obj) >= 3)` selects objects composed of '1's with width greater than or equal to 3.
3. **Recolor Objects:** `apply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), filtered_objs)` recolors the selected objects to '3'.
4. **Combine Objects:** `merge(recolored_objs | (objs - filtered_objs))` combines the recolored objects with the remaining unchanged objects.
5. **Paint to Canvas:** `paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), ...)` paints the combined objects onto a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(3, mfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda o: color(o) == 1 and width(o) >= 3)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a more compressed approach:

1. **Identify and Filter:** It identifies objects as before but directly filters them using `mfilter` based on color and width within the `recolor` function's patch argument.
2. **Direct Recoloring:**  `recolor(3, ...)` directly recolors the filtered indices to '3' on the original grid `I`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
  changed_cells = mpapply(lambda v, ind: (3, ind) if v == 1 and len({j for i, j in ofcolor(I, v)}) >= 3 else (v, ind), I, asindices(I))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), changed_cells)
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on individual cells instead of objects:

1. **Cellwise Iteration:** `mpapply` iterates through cell values and indices using `I` and `asindices(I)`.
2. **Conditional Recoloring:**  It recolors a cell to '3' if its value is '1' and the width of the '1'-colored area (calculated using `ofcolor` and set length) is greater than or equal to 3.
3. **Painting:** It paints the modified cells onto a new canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
  condition = lambda obj: color(obj) == 1 and width(obj) >= 3
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(
    frozenset(recolor(3, obj) if condition(obj) else obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, False))
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

This version predefines the filtering condition for clarity:

1. **Condition Definition:** `condition = lambda obj: color(obj) == 1 and width(obj) >= 3` defines the object selection criteria.
2. **Object Iteration and Recoloring:** It iterates through objects and applies recoloring based on the predefined `condition`.
3. **Painting:** Similar to previous versions, it paints the result on a canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
  def process_object(obj):
    return recolor(3, obj) if color(obj) == 1 and width(obj) >= 3 else obj
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(process_object, objects(I, True, False, False))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a separate function for object processing:

1. **`process_object` Function:** This function encapsulates the logic for recoloring based on color and width.
2. **Object Processing and Painting:** It applies the `process_object` function to each object and paints the result on a canvas.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation while adhering to the provided DSL. Each version highlights different aspects of the DSL and provides alternative solutions for learning and comparison.
