## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation recolors all objects containing the value '1' to '3', except for the object containing the bottom-left corner of the grid.

**Input 0:**

* The object in the bottom-left corner containing '1' remains unchanged.
* All other objects containing '1' are recolored to '3'.

**Input 1:**

* The object in the bottom-left corner contains only '0', so it remains unchanged.
* All objects containing '1' are recolored to '3'.

**Input 2:**

* The object in the bottom-left corner containing '1' remains unchanged.
* All other objects containing '1' are recolored to '3'.

## Program & Explanations:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Recolors objects containing '1' to '3', except for the bottom-left object.
  """
  corner_obj = next(obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, False) if llcorner(objects(I, True, False, False)) in toindices(obj))
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), 
              merge(frozenset(recolor(3, obj) if obj != corner_obj and 1 in palette(obj) else obj 
                              for obj in objects(I, True, False, False)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the corner object:** `corner_obj = next(obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, False) if llcorner(objects(I, True, False, False)) in toindices(obj))` finds the object containing the bottom-left corner.
2. **Recolor other objects:** Iterate through all objects. If an object is not the `corner_obj` and contains '1', recolor it to '3'.
3. **Paint and return:** Paint the recolored objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Recolors objects containing '1' to '3', except for the bottom-left object.
  """
  corner_loc = llcorner(objects(I, True, False, False))
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)),
              merge(frozenset(recolor(3, obj) if any(index(I,loc) == 1 for loc in toindices(obj)) and corner_loc not in toindices(obj) else obj 
                              for obj in objects(I, True, False, False))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the corner location:** `corner_loc = llcorner(objects(I, True, False, False))` identifies the bottom-left corner location.
2. **Recolor based on location:** Iterate through each object. If an object contains '1' (checked by iterating through its indices) and does *not* contain the `corner_loc`, recolor it to '3'.
3. **Paint and return:** Paint the objects onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Recolors objects containing '1' to '3', except for the bottom-left object.
  """
  corner_obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: llcorner(objects(I, True, False, False)) in toindices(obj))
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), 
              merge(frozenset(branch(obj != corner_obj and colorcount(obj, 1) > 0, recolor(3, obj), obj) 
                              for obj in objects(I, True, False, False))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract the corner object:** `corner_obj = extract(...)` directly extracts the object containing the bottom-left corner.
2. **Conditional recoloring:**  Iterate through objects. For each object, use `branch` to check: 
    * If the object is *not* the `corner_obj` and has at least one cell with value '1', recolor it to '3'.
    * Otherwise, keep the object unchanged.
3. **Paint and return:** Paint the resulting objects onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Recolors objects containing '1' to '3', except for the bottom-left object.
  """
  corner_loc = llcorner(objects(I, True, False, False))
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), 
               merge({branch(any(index(I, loc) == 1 for loc in toindices(obj)) and corner_loc not in toindices(obj),
                              recolor(3, obj),
                              obj) 
                      for obj in objs}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Pre-compute objects and corner location:** This version pre-computes the `corner_loc` and the set of `objs` for efficiency.
2. **Conditional recoloring within set comprehension:**  Use set comprehension to iterate through `objs`.  For each object, `branch` checks if it contains '1' and doesn't contain the `corner_loc`. If true, it's recolored, otherwise kept as is.
3. **Paint and return:**  The result is painted onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Recolors objects containing '1' to '3', except for the bottom-left object.
  """
  corner_index = llcorner(objects(I, True, False, False))
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), 
               merge(frozenset(
                   branch(1 in palette(obj) and corner_index not in toindices(obj), 
                          recolor(3, obj), 
                          obj) 
                   for obj in objects(I, True, False, False))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate the bottom-left corner index:** `corner_index = llcorner(objects(I, True, False, False))` gets the index.
2. **Iterate through objects and recolor:** Use `branch` to check if the current object contains '1' and if the `corner_index` is not present in its indices. If both conditions are true, recolor the object to '3', else keep it unchanged.
3. **Paint the objects:** Paint the resulting objects onto a blank canvas and return the final grid.


These are five distinct programs using different combinations of DSL functions. They demonstrate the flexibility of the DSL in expressing the desired transformation.
