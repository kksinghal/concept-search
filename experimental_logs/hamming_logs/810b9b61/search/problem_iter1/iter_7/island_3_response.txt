## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently recolors all objects except those containing the digit '1'. The chosen recolor value is '3'.  Let's break down the transformation for each example:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** All objects formed by digits other than '1' are recolored to '3'. The objects formed by '1' retain their original color.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**  Similar to Input_0, only objects not containing '1' are recolored to '3'. Note that isolated '1' digits are also considered objects.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**  The pattern continues â€“ objects without '1' are recolored to '3', while those with '1' remain unchanged.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Recolors all objects not containing '1' to '3'.
  """
  objs_to_recolor = sfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: 1 not in {v for v, _ in obj})
  O = paint(I, recolor(3, merge(objs_to_recolor)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:**  Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`sfilter(...)`:** Filters the objects, keeping only those where '1' is not present in the object's values.
3. **`merge(...)`:**  Combines the filtered objects' cells into a single set of indices.
4. **`recolor(3, ...)`:** Recolors the combined indices to '3'.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Applies the recoloring to the input grid `I`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Iterates through the grid, recoloring cells based on object membership.
  """
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = canvas(3, shape(I)) 
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if any(1 in {val for val, _ in obj} and (i, j) in toindices(obj) for obj in objs):
        O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`canvas(3, shape(I))`:** Creates a canvas filled with '3' and the same dimensions as the input.
3. **`for` loops:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
4. **`if any(...)`:** Checks if the current cell belongs to any object containing '1'.
5. **`paint(O, {(v, (i, j))})`:**  If the cell belongs to an object with '1', its original color is painted onto the canvas `O`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Finds objects containing '1', then paints them onto a canvas of '3'.
  """
  one_objs = sfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: 1 in {v for v, _ in obj})
  O = canvas(3, shape(I))
  for obj in one_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Identifies all objects in the input.
2. **`sfilter(...)`:**  Filters objects, keeping only those containing '1'.
3. **`canvas(3, shape(I))`:** Creates a canvas filled with '3' and the same dimensions as the input.
4. **`for obj in one_objs:`:** Iterates through the objects containing '1'.
5. **`paint(O, obj)`:** Paints each object onto the canvas `O`, effectively restoring their original color.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Recolors the grid to '3', then paints back objects containing '1'. 
  """
  one_objs = sfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: 1 in {v for v, _ in obj})
  O = recolor(3, asindices(I)) 
  O = paint(I, recolor(3, O))
  for obj in one_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:**  Identifies all objects in the input.
2. **`sfilter(...)`:** Filters objects, keeping only those containing '1'.
3. **`recolor(3, asindices(I))`:**  Creates a set of indices representing all grid cells and recolors them to '3'.
4. **`paint(I, recolor(3, O))`:** Paints the recolored indices onto the input grid `I`, effectively making the entire grid '3'.
5. **`for obj in one_objs:`:** Iterates through objects containing '1'.
6. **`paint(O, obj)`:** Paints each object onto the recolored grid `O`, restoring their original colors.

**Version 5:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Uses cellwise comparison to recolor objects not containing '1'.
  """
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  one_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    if 1 in {v for v, _ in obj}:
      one_grid = paint(one_grid, obj)
  O = cellwise(one_grid, I, 3)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Identifies all objects in the input.
2. **`canvas(0, shape(I))`:** Creates an empty canvas with the same dimensions as the input.
3. **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterates through all objects.
4. **`if 1 in {v for v, _ in obj}:`:** Checks if the object contains '1'.
5. **`one_grid = paint(one_grid, obj)`:** If the object contains '1', paint it onto the initially empty canvas.
6. **`cellwise(one_grid, I, 3)`:** Performs a cellwise comparison between the canvas (containing only objects with '1') and the input grid. If the cells match, the original color is kept; otherwise, it's replaced with '3'. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
