## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently recolors all objects with the value '1' to the value '3' while maintaining the rest of the grid unchanged.  

**Let's break down the logic:**

1. **Identify objects:** The code needs to identify all distinct objects on the grid. An object is a group of connected cells with the same value.
2. **Filter by value:** It should then isolate the objects with the value '1'.
3. **Recolor:** The selected objects should have their color changed from '1' to '3'.
4. **Reconstruct grid:** Finally, the code needs to reconstruct the grid, incorporating the recolored objects while leaving other elements untouched.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions, leveraging different DSL functions:

**Version 1:**  (Inspired by Program_A's object-based approach but simplifies the logic)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
               frozenset({recolor(3, obj) if color(obj) == 1 else obj 
                         for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(...)`:** Identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Set comprehension:** Iterates through each object (`obj`).
   -  `recolor(3, obj)`: If the `color(obj)` is 1, it recolors the object to 3.
   -  `else obj`: Otherwise, keeps the object as is.
3. **`paint(...)`:** Paints the modified objects onto a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input grid. 

**Version 2:** (Leverages cell-wise operations for a different approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(tuple(3 if cell == 1 else cell for cell in row) for row in I) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Nested loops:** Iterates over each cell in the grid using nested loops for rows and columns.
2. **Conditional recoloring:**  If a cell's value (`cell`) is 1, it's replaced with 3; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
3. **Tuple reconstruction:** The modified cells are used to reconstruct the grid. 

**Version 3:** (Uses `replace` function for a concise solution)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return replace(I, 1, 3)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`replace(I, 1, 3)`:**  Directly replaces all occurrences of '1' in the grid `I` with '3'. 

**Version 4:**  (Combines `ofcolor` and `fill` for a targeted approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, 3, ofcolor(I, 1))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`:**  Gets the indices of all cells with the value '1'.
2. **`fill(I, 3, ...)`:** Fills the identified indices with the value '3' in the grid `I`. 

**Version 5:** (Employs `apply` for a functional programming style)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return apply(lambda row: tuple(3 if cell == 1 else cell for cell in row), I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`lambda` function:** Defines an anonymous function to process each row.
   - This function replaces '1' with '3' for each cell in the row.
2. **`apply(...)`:** Applies the defined function to each row of the grid `I`.
