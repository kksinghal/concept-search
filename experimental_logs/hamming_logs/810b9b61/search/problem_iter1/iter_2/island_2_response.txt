## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves changing the color of specific objects within the grid. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** All objects formed by the digit '1' that are not connected to the object at the bottom right corner of the grid are recolored to the digit '3'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  Similar to the previous transformation, all objects formed by the digit '1' that are not connected to the object at the bottom right corner of the grid are recolored to the digit '3'.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** Again, all objects formed by the digit '1' that are not connected to the object at the bottom right corner of the grid are recolored to the digit '3'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, each utilizing different DSL functions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  corner_obj = toobject(llcorner(I), I) # Identify the object at the lower left corner
  other_objs = difference(objects(I, T, F, F), {corner_obj}) # Get all other objects
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), other_objs) # Recolor other objects to '3'
  covered_grid = cover(I, merge(other_objs)) # Cover the original other objects
  return paint(covered_grid, merge(recolored_objs)) # Paint the recolored objects
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify corner object:** We use `toobject` and `llcorner` to get the object at the lower left corner.
2. **Get other objects:** `objects` retrieves all objects, and `difference` removes the corner object.
3. **Recolor:** `apply` applies `recolor` to each object in `other_objs`, changing their color to '3'.
4. **Cover and Paint:** We cover the original objects using `cover` and then paint the recolored objects using `paint`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  corner_color = index(I, llcorner(I)) # Get the color of the lower left corner object
  return replace(I, 1, 3) if corner_color != 1 else I # Replace all '1's with '3's if the corner isn't '1'
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get corner color:** `index` and `llcorner` are used to get the color at the lower left corner.
2. **Conditional Replacement:** We use `replace` to change all '1's to '3's only if the corner color is not '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  corner_loc = llcorner(I) # Get the location of the lower left corner
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # Get all objects
  connected_to_corner = lambda obj: corner_loc in toindices(obj) # Function to check connection to corner
  other_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: not connected_to_corner(obj)) # Filter objects not connected to corner
  return paint(cover(I, merge(other_objs)), merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), other_objs))) # Cover, recolor, and paint
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Corner Location & Objects:**  We get the corner location and all objects.
2. **Connection Check:** `connected_to_corner` checks if an object contains the corner location.
3. **Filter and Transform:** `sfilter` keeps objects not connected to the corner. Then, we cover, recolor, and paint as in Version 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  corner_obj = toobject(llcorner(I), I) # Identify the object at the lower left corner
  return paint(I, recolor(3, difference(asobject(I), corner_obj))) # Recolor and paint directly
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Corner Object:** Get the object at the lower left corner.
2. **Direct Recolor and Paint:** We use `difference` to get all cells except the corner object, recolor them to '3', and paint them back onto the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # Get all objects
  corner_obj =  extract(objs, lambda obj: llcorner(I) in toindices(obj)) # Extract the corner object
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), difference(objs, {corner_obj})) # Recolor other objects
  return paint(cover(I, merge(difference(objs, {corner_obj}))), merge(recolored_objs)) # Cover, paint recolored objects
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Objects and Corner Object:** We get all objects and then `extract` the corner object.
2. **Recolor and Transform:**  Similar to previous versions, we recolor the non-corner objects and paint them onto the grid after covering the originals.

These five programs offer diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformation, each utilizing a distinct combination of DSL functions.
