## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently recolors all objects formed by the digit '1' to the digit '3', except for the bottom-leftmost object containing a '1'. 

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**  All objects made of '1's are recolored to '3's except the object at the bottom left corner (spanning rows 12-14, columns 0-2).

**Input_1 - Output_1:**  Similar to the previous example, all objects formed by '1's are recolored to '3's except the bottom leftmost object (spanning rows 8-10, columns 0-3).

**Input_2 - Output_2:**  Again, all objects formed by '1's become '3's, except for the bottom leftmost one (spanning rows 6-8, columns 0-1).


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Finds the bottom-leftmost object containing a '1', 
  then recolors all other objects containing '1' to '3'.
  """
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  corner_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: llcorner(obj) == llcorner(objs)) 
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), 
              merge(frozenset(recolor(3, obj) if obj != corner_obj and 1 in palette(obj) else obj 
                              for obj in objs))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** It first identifies all objects in the input grid `I` using `objects(I, True, False, False)`.
2. **Locate Corner Object:** It finds the bottom-leftmost object using `extract` and `llcorner` to compare the lower-left corners of all objects with the overall lower-left corner of all objects combined.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** It iterates through all objects. If an object is not the corner object and contains the color '1', it recolors that object to '3' using `recolor`. Finally, it paints all objects, modified or not, onto a blank canvas of the input's shape using `paint`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Iterates through objects, recoloring those containing '1' to '3',
  unless they occupy the same minimum row and column as the bottom-leftmost '1'.
  """
  min_row, min_col = float('inf'), float('inf')
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 1:
        min_row, min_col = min(min_row, i), min(min_col, j)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)),
              merge(frozenset(recolor(3, obj) if 1 in palette(obj) and not (uppermost(obj) == min_row and leftmost(obj) == min_col) else obj
                              for obj in objects(I, True, False, False))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Bottom-Leftmost '1':** It first iterates through the grid to find the minimum row and column indices containing the digit '1', which represents the location of the bottom-leftmost '1'.
2. **Recolor Based on Location:**  It identifies objects using `objects` and iterates through them. If an object contains '1' and its upper-left corner doesn't match the previously found minimum row and column, it recolors the object to '3'. 
3. **Paint:** Finally, it paints all objects onto a blank canvas using `paint`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Creates a mask based on the bottom-leftmost object containing '1' and 
  uses it to selectively recolor objects. 
  """
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  corner_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: llcorner(obj) == llcorner(objs))
  mask = canvas(0, shape(I)) 
  mask = paint(mask, corner_obj)
  return paint(replace(I, 1, 3), 
              merge({toobject(ofcolor(mask, 1), I)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Object Mask:**  It identifies all objects and the corner object. Then it creates a blank canvas (`mask`) and paints the corner object onto it. This mask will be used to protect the corner object from recoloring.
2. **Apply Mask and Recolor:**  It replaces all '1's in the input grid with '3's. Then, it uses the mask to extract the indices of the original corner object (where the mask has '1's). Finally, it paints this extracted object back onto the recolored grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Directly modifies the input grid, recoloring objects containing '1'
  except the one at the bottom-left corner of the grid.
  """
  out = [list(row) for row in I] # Create a mutable copy
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  corner_loc = llcorner(objs)
  for obj in objs:
    if 1 in palette(obj) and llcorner(obj) != corner_loc:
      for _, (i, j) in obj:
        out[i][j] = 3
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in out)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Mutable Copy:**  Creates a mutable copy of the input grid `I` for modification.
2. **Identify Objects and Corner:**  Identifies all objects and determines the lower-left corner coordinates (`corner_loc`) of all objects combined.
3. **Iterative Recoloring:** Iterates through the objects. If an object contains '1' and its lower-left corner doesn't match `corner_loc`, it iterates through the object's cells and directly changes the corresponding cells in the `out` grid to '3'.
4. **Return Modified Grid:** Returns the modified `out` grid.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Uses recursion to recolor objects containing '1' to '3' from top to bottom,
  stopping when it encounters an object at the bottom left corner.
  """
  def recolor_recursive(grid, start_row=0, start_col=0):
    for i in range(start_row, len(grid)):
      for j in range(start_col, len(grid[0])):
        if grid[i][j] == 1:
          obj = toobject(initset((i, j)), grid)
          if i == len(grid) - 1 and j == 0: # Bottom-left corner object
            return paint(replace(grid, 1, 3), obj)
          else:
            return recolor_recursive(paint(replace(grid, 1, 3), obj), i, j + 1)
    return grid
  return recolor_recursive(I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Recursive Function:** Defines a recursive function `recolor_recursive` that takes the grid and optional starting row and column as input.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:** It iterates through the grid from the given starting position. Upon finding a '1', it considers the object at that location. 
3. **Bottom-Left Check:** It checks if the current object is at the bottom-left corner. If so, it recolors all other '1's to '3's and returns the grid with the corner object preserved.
4. **Recursive Call:** If not at the bottom-left corner, it recolors the current object to '3' and recursively calls itself with the modified grid and updated starting position to continue recoloring from the next cell.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
