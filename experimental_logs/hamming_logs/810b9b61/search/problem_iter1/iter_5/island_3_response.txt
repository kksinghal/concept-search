## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 - Output 0:** All objects made of '1's that are above the highest object containing a '1' are recolored to '3'. 

**Input 1 - Output 1:**  All objects made of '1's that are above the highest object containing a '1' are recolored to '3', except for the object directly above it.

**Input 2 - Output 2:** All '1's are replaced with '3's, except for the '1's that form a horizontal line directly below an object made of '3's. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Finds the highest object with '1', recolors objects above it, 
  except for the one directly above if it contains a '1'.
  """
  highest_one_obj = argmax(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: uppermost(obj) if 1 in {v for v, _ in obj} else -1) 
  line = uppermost(highest_one_obj)
  above_objects = sfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: uppermost(obj) < line and 1 in {v for v, _ in obj})
  if above_objects:
    above_objects = remove(argmax(above_objects, lambda obj: uppermost(obj)), above_objects)
  O = paint(I, recolor(3, merge(above_objects)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the highest object with '1':**  We find this object using `argmax` with a custom function that prioritizes objects containing '1' and uses `uppermost` to find the highest. 
2. **Identify objects above:**  We use `sfilter` to select objects that are both above the highest '1' object and contain a '1'.
3. **Exclude the object directly above:** We use `remove` to potentially exclude the object directly above the highest '1' object from being recolored. 
4. **Recolor and paint:**  We recolor the remaining objects to '3' and paint them onto the original grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Iterates through rows, recoloring objects based on the presence of '1's 
  and a flag indicating whether the highest '1' object has been passed.
  """
  h = height(I)
  found_one = False
  O = I
  for i in range(h):
    row_objs = sfilter(objects(crop(I, (i, 0), (1, width(I))), True, False, True), lambda obj: 1 in {v for v, _ in obj})
    if row_objs:
      if not found_one:
        found_one = True
      else:
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, merge(row_objs)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:**  We loop through each row of the grid.
2. **Check for '1' objects:** For each row, we extract objects and check if they contain a '1'.
3. **Flag and recolor:** We use a flag (`found_one`) to track if we've passed the highest object with a '1'. If we have and encounter another '1' object, we recolor it to '3'.

**Version 3 (Focus on preserving '1's below '3's):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Identifies '1's below '3's and preserves them, recoloring 
  all other '1's to '3'.
  """
  ones_below_threes = set()
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    if 3 in {v for v, _ in obj}:
      for i, j in toindices(obj):
        if 0 <= i + 1 < height(I) and I[i + 1][j] == 1:
          ones_below_threes.add((i + 1, j))
  O = replace(I, 1, 3)
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, frozenset((O[i][j], (i, j)) for i, j in ones_below_threes)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1's below '3's:** Iterate through objects and store the indices of '1's directly below '3's.
2. **Replace all '1's:**  Recolor all '1's to '3'.
3. **Restore '1's below '3's:** Paint the preserved '1' indices back onto the grid.

**Version 4 (Building on replacing '1's):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Replaces all '1's with '3's and then uses the presence 
  of '3's to determine which '3's should be reverted back to '1's. 
  """
  O = replace(I, 1, 3)
  for i in range(1, height(O)):
    for j in range(width(O)):
      if O[i][j] == 3 and O[i - 1][j] == 3:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(3, (i, j))}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Replace all '1's:** Recolor all '1's to '3'.
2. **Revert specific '3's:**  Iterate through the grid, and if a '3' is found directly below another '3', revert it back to '1'.

**Version 5 (Using `cellwise` for direct comparison):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Creates a shifted version of the input grid and uses 
  'cellwise' to compare and selectively recolor based on '1's and '3's. 
  """
  shifted_I = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shift(asobject(I), (1, 0)))
  O = cellwise(I, shifted_I, 0)
  O = replace(O, 1, 3)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create shifted grid:** Generate a shifted version of the input grid, moving all elements down by one row.
2. **Cellwise comparison:** Use `cellwise` to compare the original and shifted grids. Cells that match will retain their original value, while mismatches will become '0'.
3. **Recolor remaining '1's:** Finally, replace all remaining '1's with '3's.
