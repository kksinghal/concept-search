## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking each unique object (defined as connected pixels of the same color, excluding the background color) in the input grid, rotating it 90 degrees clockwise, and then moving it downwards by a distance equal to its original height. 

**Example Breakdown:**

Let's look at Input_1 and Output_1 to understand this:

**Input_1:**

```
0 0 0 0 6 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 2 2 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 5 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

- We have three objects: '6', '11', and '222'. 

**Output_1:**

```
0 0 0 0 6 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 2 2 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
6 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 0 0 0 0
2 2 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
```

- '6' (height 1) is rotated clockwise and moved down by 1 unit.
- '11' (height 1) is rotated clockwise and moved down by 1 unit.
- '222' (height 1) is rotated clockwise and moved down by 1 unit.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
      merge(
          apply(
              lambda obj: shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (height(obj), 0)),
              fgpartition(I)
          )
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  This identifies all the objects (excluding background) in the input grid `I`.
2. **`lambda obj: ...`:**  This defines an anonymous function that will be applied to each object.
    - **`toindices(obj)`:** Extracts the indices of the object's cells.
    - **`toobject(toindices(obj), I)`:**  Reconstructs the object from its indices and the input grid.
    - **`rot90(...)`:** Rotates the object 90 degrees clockwise.
    - **`shift(..., (height(obj), 0))`:** Moves the rotated object downwards by its height.
3. **`apply(..., fgpartition(I))`:** Applies the above transformation to each object in the grid.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Combines the transformed objects back into a single set of cells.
5. **`paint(canvas(...), ...)`:** Creates a new canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background color, and then paints the transformed objects onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  moved_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    moved_objs = moved_objs | {shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (height(obj), 0))}
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(moved_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a for loop instead of the `apply` function, but the logic within the loop is the same as in Version 1. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for obj in fgpartition(I):
        O = paint(O, shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (height(obj), 0)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iteratively paints each transformed object onto a new canvas instead of merging them at the end.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def transform_object(obj):
    return shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (height(obj), 0))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(transform_object, fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a separate function `transform_object` for clarity, then applies this function to each object using `apply`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
      merge(
          frozenset(
              shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (height(obj), 0)) 
              for obj in fgpartition(I)
          )
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a generator expression within the `merge` function to achieve the same result as applying the `transform_object` function in Version 4.
