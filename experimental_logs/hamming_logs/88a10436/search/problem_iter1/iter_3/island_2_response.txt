## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking each distinct object (a group of connected, same-valued digits), mirroring it vertically, and then shifting the mirrored object downwards by a distance equal to the object's height. The original object remains in place.

**Input_0:**

* The object '1 3' is mirrored and shifted down to become '1 3' positioned below.
* The object '2 2 1' is mirrored and shifted down to become '2 2 1' positioned below. 

**Input_1:**

* The object '1 1' is mirrored and shifted down to become '1 1' positioned below.
* The object '2 2 2' is mirrored and shifted down to become '2 2 2' positioned below.
* The object '6' is mirrored and shifted down to become '6' positioned below.

**Input_2:**

* The object '3 1' is mirrored and shifted down to become '3 1' positioned below.
* The object '3 3 1' is mirrored and shifted down to become '3 3 1' positioned below.
* The object '2 2' is mirrored and shifted down to become '2 2' positioned below.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" that accomplish the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge((fgpartition(I), apply(lambda obj: shift(vmirror(obj), (height(obj), 0)), fgpartition(I)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  The input grid `I` is partitioned into distinct objects, excluding the background (most frequent color).
2. **`lambda obj: shift(vmirror(obj), (height(obj), 0))`:** This anonymous function takes an object `obj`, mirrors it vertically using `vmirror(obj)`, and then shifts the mirrored object downwards by its height using `shift(..., (height(obj), 0))`.
3. **`apply(..., fgpartition(I))`:** The anonymous function is applied to each object obtained from `fgpartition(I)`, resulting in a set of transformed objects.
4. **`merge((fgpartition(I), ...))`:** The original objects from `fgpartition(I)` and the transformed objects are merged into a single set.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Finally, the merged set of objects is painted onto the input grid `I`, producing the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge((fgpartition(I), {shift(vmirror(obj), (height(obj), 0)) for obj in fgpartition(I)})))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes set comprehension for a more concise way to generate the transformed objects. The logic remains the same as in Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  transformed_objs = set()
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    mirrored_obj = vmirror(obj)
    shifted_obj = shift(mirrored_obj, (height(obj), 0))
    transformed_objs.add(shifted_obj)
  return paint(I, fgpartition(I) | transformed_objs) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through the objects, mirrors and shifts them individually, and then combines them with the original objects before painting them onto the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def transform_object(obj):
    return shift(vmirror(obj), (height(obj), 0))
  return paint(I, fgpartition(I) | apply(transform_object, fgpartition(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a separate function `transform_object` for clarity and applies it to each object using `apply`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def mirror_and_shift(obj):
    mirrored = vmirror(obj)
    shifted = shift(mirrored, (height(mirrored), 0))
    return shifted
  return paint(I,  {obj for pair in rapply((identity, mirror_and_shift), fgpartition(I)) for obj in pair})
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes `rapply` to apply both the `identity` function (which returns the original object) and a custom `mirror_and_shift` function to each object. This creates pairs of original and transformed objects. The final set comprehension then flattens these pairs back into a single set before painting. 

Each of these versions achieves the same result through different approaches, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL.
