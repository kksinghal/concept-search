## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all three examples involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit excluding the background color) and rotating them 90 degrees counter-clockwise around a pivot point. The pivot point is always the location of the digit '5'. After rotation, the objects are shifted such that the pivot point occupies the cell immediately below its original position.

**Example Breakdown:**

- **Input_0:** The object consisting of digits '1', '2', and '3' is rotated around the '5' at (5,5), resulting in the object being positioned with '2' at (5,4), '2' at (5,5), '1' at (5,6), '3' at (6,6), etc.
- **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the object is rotated around the '5' at (5,1). Notice how the single '6' digit forms its own object and is also rotated.
- **Input_2:** Again, the same rotation logic applies, with the '5' at (2,4) acting as the pivot.

## Program to be Generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    pivot = first(ofcolor(I, FIVE))
    def transform(obj):
      return shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(shift(obj, (-pivot[0], -pivot[1]))), 
                                     crop(I, (0, 0), (pivot[0] + height(obj), width(I))))), 
                   (pivot[1], pivot[0] + 1 - height(obj)))
    return paint(fill(I, mostcolor(I), asindices(I)), 
                 merge(apply(transform, fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Pivot:** `pivot = first(ofcolor(I, FIVE))` finds the location of the '5'.
2. **Transform Function:** 
   - `shift(obj, (-pivot[0], -pivot[1]))`: Shifts the object so its top-left corner aligns with the pivot.
   - `crop(I, (0, 0), (pivot[0] + height(obj), width(I))))`: Creates a subgrid encompassing the object and the area it will occupy after rotation.
   - `toobject(toindices(...), ...)`: Converts the shifted object indices back to an object within the subgrid.
   - `rot90(...)`: Rotates the subgrid containing the object.
   - `shift(..., (pivot[1], pivot[0] + 1 - height(obj)))`: Shifts the rotated object to its final position.
3. **Apply Transformation:**  `merge(apply(transform, fgpartition(I)))` applies the `transform` function to each object (excluding background) and merges them.
4. **Paint Objects:** `paint(fill(I, mostcolor(I), asindices(I)), ...)` creates a blank canvas and paints the transformed objects onto it.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_i, five_j = first(ofcolor(I, FIVE))
  def reposition(obj):
    return shift(obj, (five_j, five_i + 1 - height(obj)))
  return paint(fill(I, mostcolor(I), asindices(I)), 
               merge(apply(compose(reposition, rot90), 
                           apply(asobject, 
                                 apply(lambda obj: subgrid(shift(obj, (-five_i, -five_j)), I), 
                                       fgpartition(I))))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Pivot:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Reposition Function:** Shifts the object to its final position after rotation.
3. **Nested Apply Functions:**
   - `apply(lambda obj: subgrid(shift(obj, (-five_i, -five_j)), I), fgpartition(I))`: Extracts subgrids containing each object, shifted to align with the origin.
   - `apply(asobject, ...)`: Converts the shifted subgrids to objects.
   - `apply(compose(reposition, rot90), ...)`: Rotates each object and then repositions it using the `reposition` function.
4. **Paint and Merge:** Similar to Version 1.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    five_loc = first(ofcolor(I, FIVE))
    return paint(fill(I, mostcolor(I), asindices(I)), 
                 merge(apply(lambda obj: 
                             shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj),
                                                crop(I, (five_loc[0] - height(obj) + 1, five_loc[1]), (height(obj), width(obj))))),
                                   (five_loc[1], five_loc[0] + 1 - height(obj))), 
                           fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version takes a slightly different approach by cropping the subgrid containing each object before rotating it. This avoids having to shift the object twice.

1. **Find Pivot:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Lambda Function:**
   - `crop(I, (five_loc[0] - height(obj) + 1, five_loc[1]), (height(obj), width(obj))))`: Crops the subgrid containing the object.
   - `toobject(toindices(obj), ...)`: Converts the cropped subgrid to an object.
   - `rot90(...)`: Rotates the object.
   - `shift(..., (five_loc[1], five_loc[0] + 1 - height(obj)))`: Shifts the object to its final position.
3. **Apply, Merge, and Paint:** Similar to previous versions.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    row, col = first(ofcolor(I, FIVE))
    def transform(obj):
      shifted_obj = shift(obj, (-row, -col))
      return shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(shifted_obj), I)), (col + 1 - width(shifted_obj), row))
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(transform, fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version simplifies the code by first shifting the object to align its top-left corner with the origin before rotating it.

1. **Find Pivot:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Transform Function:**
   - `shifted_obj = shift(obj, (-row, -col))`: Shifts the object to align with the origin.
   - `toobject(toindices(shifted_obj), I)`: Converts the shifted object indices to an object within the original grid.
   - `rot90(...)`: Rotates the object.
   - `shift(..., (col + 1 - width(shifted_obj), row))`: Shifts the object to its final position.
3. **Canvas, Apply, Merge, and Paint:** Similar to previous versions.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  p = first(ofcolor(I, FIVE))
  def f(o):
    return shift(rot90(asobject(subgrid(shift(o, (-p[0], -p[1])),
                                         crop(I, (0, 0), (p[0] + height(o), width(I)))))),
                 (p[1], p[0] + 1 - height(o)))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(f, fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version combines elements from previous versions, using a combination of shifting, cropping, and rotating to achieve the desired transformation.

1. **Find Pivot:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Function f:** 
   - `shift(o, (-p[0], -p[1]))`: Shifts the object to align with the origin.
   - `crop(I, (0, 0), (p[0] + height(o), width(I))))`: Crops a subgrid to encompass the object and its rotated position.
   - `subgrid(..., ...)`: Extracts the shifted object within the cropped subgrid.
   - `asobject(...)`: Converts the extracted subgrid to an object.
   - `rot90(...)`: Rotates the object.
   - `shift(..., (p[1], p[0] + 1 - height(o)))`: Shifts the object to its final position.
3. **Apply, Merge, and Paint:** Similar to previous versions.


Each version uses a slightly different combination of DSL functions, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the language. They all achieve the same goal of rotating objects around the '5' pivot point and positioning them correctly in the output grid.
