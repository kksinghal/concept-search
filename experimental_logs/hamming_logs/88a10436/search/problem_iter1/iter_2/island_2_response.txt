## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves mirroring the non-background objects in the input grid vertically and then shifting them downwards. The amount of shift is equal to the height of the mirrored object. The mirrored and shifted objects are then painted back onto the original grid, resulting in a vertically symmetrical arrangement of the original objects with the background retained.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The object consisting of digits '1', '2', and '3' is mirrored vertically and shifted down by 3 units (its height).
* **Input_1:** The object consisting of digit '6' is mirrored and shifted down by 1 unit, and the object consisting of digits '1' and '2' is mirrored and shifted down by 3 units.
* **Input_2:** The object consisting of digit '5' is mirrored and shifted down by 1 unit, and the object consisting of digits '1', '2', and '3' is mirrored and shifted down by 4 units.

## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge((fgpartition(I), apply(lambda obj: shift(vmirror(obj), (height(obj), 0)), fgpartition(I)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `fgpartition(I)`: Identifies and separates all non-background objects in the input grid `I`.
2. `apply(lambda obj: shift(vmirror(obj), (height(obj), 0)), fgpartition(I))`: This part applies a lambda function to each object:
    * `vmirror(obj)`: Mirrors the object vertically.
    * `shift(..., (height(obj), 0))`: Shifts the mirrored object downwards by its height.
3. `merge(...)`: Combines the original objects with their mirrored and shifted counterparts.
4. `paint(I, ...)`: Paints the combined objects onto the original input grid `I`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  transformed_objs = {shift(vmirror(obj), (height(obj), 0)) for obj in fgpartition(I)}
  return paint(I, transformed_objs | fgpartition(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `fgpartition(I)`: Extracts non-background objects from grid `I`.
2. `transformed_objs = {shift(vmirror(obj), (height(obj), 0)) for obj in ...}`: Uses a set comprehension to store transformed objects:
    * `vmirror(obj)`: Mirrors each object vertically.
    * `shift(..., (height(obj), 0))`: Shifts the mirrored object down by its height.
3. `transformed_objs | fgpartition(I)`: Combines the transformed objects with the original objects using set union.
4. `paint(I, ...)`: Paints the combined set of objects onto the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  mirrored_objs = {vmirror(obj) for obj in objs}
  shifted_objs = {shift(obj, (height(obj), 0)) for obj in mirrored_objs}
  return paint(I, objs | shifted_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objs = fgpartition(I)`: Isolates non-background objects from the grid `I`.
2. `mirrored_objs = {vmirror(obj) for obj in objs}`: Creates a set containing vertically mirrored versions of each object.
3. `shifted_objs = {shift(obj, (height(obj), 0)) for obj in mirrored_objs}`: Generates a set containing each mirrored object shifted downwards by its height.
4. `paint(I, objs | shifted_objs)`: Paints both the original and shifted objects onto the initial grid `I` using set union.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def transform_object(obj):
    mirrored = vmirror(obj)
    shifted = shift(mirrored, (height(mirrored), 0))
    return shifted
  transformed_objs = apply(transform_object, fgpartition(I))
  return paint(I, merge((fgpartition(I), transformed_objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. Defines a helper function `transform_object` to encapsulate the mirroring and shifting operations on a single object.
2. `fgpartition(I)`: Extracts the non-background objects from the input grid `I`.
3. `apply(transform_object, ...)`: Applies the `transform_object` function to each extracted object.
4. `merge((fgpartition(I), transformed_objs))`: Combines the original objects and the transformed objects.
5. `paint(I, ...)`: Paints the combined set of objects onto the original input grid `I`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def mirror_and_shift(obj):
    return shift(vmirror(obj), (height(obj), 0))
  return paint(I, merge(rapply((identity, mirror_and_shift), fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. Defines a function `mirror_and_shift` that combines the vertical mirroring and downward shifting of an object.
2. `fgpartition(I)`: Identifies and extracts the non-background objects from the input grid `I`.
3. `rapply((identity, mirror_and_shift), ...)`: Applies both the `identity` function (which returns the input unchanged) and the `mirror_and_shift` function to each extracted object, creating a tuple of the original and transformed object.
4. `merge(...)`: Merges the tuples of original and transformed objects into a single set.
5. `paint(I, ...)`: Paints the merged set of objects onto the original input grid `I`.
