## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking each distinct object (a group of connected, same-valued cells) within the input grid, rotating it 90 degrees clockwise, and then placing it below its original position in the output grid. 

Here's a detailed breakdown:

**Input 0:**
- The '1' object is rotated and placed one row below.
- The '2' object is rotated and placed one row below.
- The '3' object is rotated and placed one row below.
- The '5' object remains unchanged as it consists of only one cell.

**Input 1:**
- The '1' object is rotated and placed below.
- The '2' object is rotated and placed below.
- The '5' object remains unchanged.
- The '6' object remains unchanged.

**Input 2:**
- The '1' object is rotated and placed below.
- The '2' object is rotated and placed below.
- The '3' object is rotated and placed below.
- The '5' object remains unchanged.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  moved_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    new_obj = shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj),I)), (height(obj), 0))
    moved_objs = moved_objs | {new_obj}
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(moved_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** `fgpartition(I)` identifies all the objects in the input grid `I` excluding the background.
2. **Iterate and Transform:**  The code iterates over each object `obj`. 
    - `toindices(obj)` extracts the indices of the object.
    - `toobject(toindices(obj),I)` converts the indices back to an object using the original grid. This is done to utilize the `rot90` function which operates on grids.
    - `rot90(...)` rotates the object 90 degrees clockwise.
    - `shift(..., (height(obj), 0))` shifts the rotated object downwards by its height.
    - `moved_objs` stores all the transformed objects.
3. **Construct Output:** 
    - `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
    - `merge(moved_objs)` combines all transformed objects.
    - `paint(..., ...)` paints the combined objects onto the canvas, resulting in the final output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (height(obj),0))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1, `fgpartition(I)` identifies the objects.
2. **Iterate, Transform, and Paint:** The code iterates through each object and directly paints the transformed object onto the canvas in each iteration, simplifying the process.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
                 merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (height(obj), 0)), 
                             fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:** 
This version combines the iteration and painting into a single line using `apply` and `merge` for a more compact representation.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  transformed_objs = frozenset(shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (height(obj), 0)) for obj in fgpartition(I))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(transformed_objs))
```

**Explanation:**
This version utilizes set comprehension to generate the set of transformed objects directly. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def transform_object(obj):
        return shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (height(obj), 0))
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(transform_object, fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**
This version defines a helper function `transform_object` to encapsulate the object transformation logic, improving readability.
