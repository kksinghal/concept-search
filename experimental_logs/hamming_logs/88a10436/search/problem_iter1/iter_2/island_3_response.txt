## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all three examples can be described as follows:

1. **Identify the 'pivot'**: Locate the cell containing the digit '5'.
2. **Rotate and Shift**: 
    - Rotate each object (group of connected non-background digits) 90 degrees clockwise.
    - Shift the rotated objects such that their top-left corner aligns with one cell below and to the right of the 'pivot'.

**Example:**

In Input_0, the 'pivot' is at (5, 5).  The object { (2, (0, 0)), (2, (1, 0)), (1, (1, 1)), (1, (2, 1)), (3, (2, 2)) } is rotated 90 degrees clockwise and then shifted down by 6 and right by 6 to achieve the output. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_loc = first(ofcolor(I, FIVE))
  def transform_obj(obj):
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, (-five_loc[0] - 1, -five_loc[1]))
    rotated_obj =  asobject(rot90(subgrid(shifted_obj, canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)))))
    return shift(rotated_obj, (five_loc[1] + 1, five_loc[0]))
  transformed_objs = apply(transform_obj, fgpartition(I))
  O = paint(fill(I, mostcolor(I), asindices(I)), merge(transformed_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`five_loc = first(ofcolor(I, FIVE))`**: Finds the location (row, column) of the 'pivot' (digit 5).
2. **`transform_obj(obj)` function**: Defines a function to transform each object:
    - **`shifted_obj = shift(obj, (-five_loc[0] - 1, -five_loc[1]))`**: Shifts the object so that the cell to the right and below the 'pivot' becomes the origin.
    - **`rotated_obj =  asobject(rot90(subgrid(shifted_obj, canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)))))`**: Creates a canvas of the same size as input, pastes shifted object onto it, rotates the canvas 90 degrees clockwise and converts it back to an object. 
    - **`return shift(rotated_obj, (five_loc[1] + 1, five_loc[0]))`**:  Shifts the rotated object to its final position.
3. **`transformed_objs = apply(transform_obj, fgpartition(I))`**:  Applies the `transform_obj` function to all objects in the input grid.
4. **`O = paint(fill(I, mostcolor(I), asindices(I)), merge(transformed_objs))`**: Clears the input grid and paints the transformed objects onto it.
5. **`return O`**: Returns the transformed grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  pivot = first(ofcolor(I, FIVE))
  def transform(obj):
    return shift(rot90(asobject(subgrid(shift(obj, (-pivot[0] - 1, -pivot[1])), I))), (pivot[1] + 1, pivot[0]))
  return paint(fill(I, mostcolor(I), asindices(I)), merge(apply(transform, fgpartition(I)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version achieves the same result as Version 1 but condenses the code into a single line by nesting functions. It directly calculates and applies the shifts and rotation within the `transform` function.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_i, five_j = first(ofcolor(I, FIVE))
  def reposition(obj):
    return shift(obj, (five_j + 1 - height(obj), five_i))
  return paint(fill(I, mostcolor(I), asindices(I)), merge(apply(compose(reposition, rot90), apply(asobject, apply(lambda obj: subgrid(obj,I), fgpartition(I))))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version separates the shifting logic into a separate function, `reposition`, making the code more modular. It uses `compose` to chain the `reposition` and `rot90` functions for a cleaner application on the objects. 

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_loc = first(ofcolor(I, FIVE))
  return paint(fill(I, mostcolor(I), asindices(I)), 
               merge(apply(lambda obj: 
                           shift(rot90(asobject(
                               subgrid(shift(obj, (-five_loc[0] - 1, -five_loc[1])), I))), 
                                 (five_loc[1] + 1, five_loc[0])), 
                          fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version eliminates the separate `transform_obj` function and instead uses a lambda function within the `apply` function to directly transform each object. This leads to a more compact code structure.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  row, col = first(ofcolor(I, FIVE))
  def transform(obj):
    return shift(rot90(asobject(subgrid(obj, I))), (col + 1 - width(obj), row))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(transform, fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version simplifies the shifting calculation by using the width of the object instead of manually calculating the shift based on its height.  It also streamlines the final painting by first creating a blank canvas and then directly painting the transformed objects. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
