## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation reflects each object without its background color to a position below its original location. The vertical offset of this reflection is twice the object's height.

**Input 0:**

* The objects (2, 1, 3) are identified.
* Each object is mirrored vertically.
* Each mirrored object is shifted down by twice its height.
* The mirrored objects are painted onto the original grid.

**Input 1:**

* Same logic as Input 0 applied to objects (6, 1, 2, 5).

**Input 2:**

* Same logic as Input 0 applied to objects (5, 2, 3, 1).

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: combine(obj, shift(vmirror(obj), (2 * height(obj), 0))), fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Identifies and separates objects in the input grid `I`, excluding the background.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: ..., fgpartition(I))`:**  Applies a lambda function to each identified object.
3. **`combine(obj, shift(vmirror(obj), (2 * height(obj), 0)))`:** 
    * `vmirror(obj)`: Mirrors the object vertically.
    * `shift(..., (2 * height(obj), 0))`: Shifts the mirrored object down by twice its height.
    * `combine(obj, ...)`: Combines the original object with its shifted and mirrored counterpart.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges all the transformed objects back into a single object set.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the combined object set onto the original grid `I`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  reflected_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(vmirror(obj), (2 * height(obj), 0)), fgpartition(I))
  return paint(I, combine(fgpartition(I), reflected_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Identifies objects (without background) in the grid.
2. **`mapply(lambda obj: ..., fgpartition(I))`:** Applies a lambda function to each object and merges the results.
3. **`shift(vmirror(obj), (2 * height(obj), 0))`:** Mirrors the object vertically, then shifts it down by twice its height.
4. **`combine(fgpartition(I), reflected_objs)`:** Combines the original objects with their reflected counterparts.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the combined objects onto the original grid. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_grid = I
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(vmirror(obj), (2 * height(obj), 0)))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Extracts objects (excluding background) from the grid.
2. **`for obj in ...`:** Iterates over each identified object.
3. **`shift(vmirror(obj), (2 * height(obj), 0))`:**  Mirrors the object vertically and then shifts it down by twice its height.
4. **`paint(new_grid, ...)`:** Paints the transformed object onto a copy of the input grid (`new_grid`).
5. **`return new_grid`:** Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(prapply(lambda obj, ref_obj: branch(equality(obj, ref_obj), obj, shift(vmirror(obj), (2 * height(obj), 0))), fgpartition(I), fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Identifies objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **`prapply(lambda obj, ref_obj: ..., fgpartition(I), fgpartition(I))`:** Applies a lambda function to pairs of objects from the cartesian product of the object set with itself.
3. **`branch(equality(obj, ref_obj), obj, shift(vmirror(obj), (2 * height(obj), 0)))`:** 
    * `equality(obj, ref_obj)`: Checks if the two objects are the same.
    * If they are the same, the original object is returned.
    * If they are different, the second object is mirrored vertically and shifted down by twice its height.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges all the transformed objects into a single object set.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the combined object set onto the original grid `I`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, merge((obj | shift(vmirror(obj), (2 * height(obj), 0)) for obj in fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Identifies objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **`(obj | shift(vmirror(obj), (2 * height(obj), 0)) for obj in ...`:** For each identified object:
    * `vmirror(obj)`:  Mirrors the object vertically.
    * `shift(..., (2 * height(obj), 0))`: Shifts the mirrored object down by twice its height.
    * `obj | ...`:  Combines the original object and its transformed version.
3. **`merge(...)`:**  Merges all the combined objects into a single object set.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the combined object set onto the original input grid `I`.


Each program version implements the same fundamental transformation but uses a different combination of DSL functions, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
