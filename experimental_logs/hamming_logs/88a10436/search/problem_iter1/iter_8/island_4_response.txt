## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation for all input-output pairs involves rotating specific objects within the grid 90 degrees clockwise and then moving them. 

**Specifics:**

* **Object Selection:** The transformation targets only objects formed by non-background colors. The background color is the most frequent color in the grid.
* **Rotation and Shift:** Each selected object is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Then, it is shifted horizontally to the right by a distance equal to its original height.
* **Placement:** The rotated and shifted objects are placed on a blank canvas of the same size as the original grid, filled with the background color. 

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
      merge(
          apply(
              lambda obj: shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (0, height(obj))),
              fgpartition(I)
          )
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Identifies all objects formed by non-background colors in the input grid `I`.
2. **`lambda obj: shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (0, height(obj)))`:** Defines a lambda function that, for each object `obj`:
    * **`toindices(obj)`:** Extracts the indices of the object's cells.
    * **`toobject(toindices(obj), I)`:** Converts the object's indices back to an object representation using the values from the input grid `I`.
    * **`rot90(...)`:** Rotates the object 90 degrees clockwise.
    * **`shift(..., (0, height(obj)))`:** Shifts the rotated object to the right by its height.
3. **`apply(..., fgpartition(I))`:** Applies the lambda function to each object obtained from `fgpartition(I)`.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges all the transformed objects into a single object.
5. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid, filled with the background color.
6. **`paint(..., ...)`:** Paints the merged transformed object onto the canvas.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  transformed_objs = set()
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    transformed_obj = shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (0, height(obj)))
    transformed_objs.add(transformed_obj)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(transformed_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a for loop instead of `apply` to iterate over the objects and apply the transformation, making it more explicit. The logic remains the same as version 1.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
      merge(
        frozenset(
          shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (0, height(obj))) for obj in fgpartition(I)
        )
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a generator expression within the `frozenset` function to apply the transformation to each object from `fgpartition(I)`. The result is then merged and painted onto the canvas.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def transform_object(obj):
    return shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (0, height(obj)))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(transform_object, fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a separate function `transform_object` to encapsulate the object transformation logic. This improves code readability and organization.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    transformed_obj = shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (0, height(obj)))
    O = paint(O, transformed_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly paints each transformed object onto the canvas iteratively within the loop, instead of merging them first. This might be slightly less efficient but offers a different approach to achieving the same result.
