## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking each non-background object in the input grid, rotating it 90 degrees clockwise, and then shifting it downwards by a distance equal to its height. 

**Example:**

Consider the object '1' in Input_0:

```
2 2 1
  1 
```

After rotation and shifting, it becomes:

```
     2
     2
     1
     1 
```


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
    merge(
      apply(
        lambda obj: shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (height(obj), 0)),
        fgpartition(I)
      )
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** This function partitions the input grid `I` into a set of objects, excluding the background.
2. **`lambda obj: ...`:**  This defines an anonymous function that takes each object `obj` as input and applies the following transformations:
   - **`toindices(obj)`:** Extracts the indices of the object's cells.
   - **`toobject(toindices(obj), I)`:**  Reconstructs the object from its indices and the input grid.
   - **`rot90(...)`:**  Rotates the object 90 degrees clockwise.
   - **`shift(..., (height(obj), 0))`:** Shifts the rotated object downwards by its height.
3. **`apply(lambda obj: ..., fgpartition(I))`:**  Applies the anonymous transformation function to each object in the set of non-background objects.
4. **`merge(...)`:**  Combines the transformed objects into a single object set.
5. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:**  Creates a blank canvas with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid.
6. **`paint(canvas(...), merge(...))`:**  Paints the merged, transformed objects onto the blank canvas, resulting in the final output grid.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  transformed_objs = set()
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    transformed_objs.add(shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (height(obj), 0)))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(transformed_objs)) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a for loop instead of the `apply` function to apply the transformations to each object, enhancing readability. 

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
    merge(
      frozenset(
        shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (height(obj), 0)) for obj in fgpartition(I)
      )
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a generator expression within `frozenset` for a more compact way of applying the transformations.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def transform_object(obj):
    return shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (height(obj), 0))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(transform_object, fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a separate function `transform_object` to encapsulate the transformation logic, improving code organization.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    O = paint(O, shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (height(obj), 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iteratively paints each transformed object onto the canvas instead of merging them first, offering a slightly different approach.
