## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves rotating each non-background object in the input grid by 90 degrees clockwise and then moving it downwards by its height.

**Input 0:**

1. The object consisting of digits '1' and '3' is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
2. This rotated object is then shifted downwards by 2 units, which is its height.
3. The same process is applied to the object consisting of digit '2'.
4. The background and the object consisting of digit '5' remain unchanged.

**Input 1:**

1. The object consisting of digit '6' is rotated and shifted down by 1 unit.
2. Similarly, objects formed by digits '1' and '2' are rotated and shifted down by their respective heights (2 and 3 units).
3. The background and the object consisting of digit '5' remain unchanged. 

**Input 2:**

1. The transformation is applied to the objects formed by digits '2' and '3'.
2. They are rotated 90 degrees clockwise and moved downwards by their respective heights.
3. The background and the object consisting of digit '5' remain unchanged.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
      merge(
          apply(
              lambda obj: shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (height(toindices(obj)), 0)),
              fgpartition(I)
          )
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  This partitions the input grid `I` into objects, excluding the background.
2. **`lambda obj: ...`:** This defines an anonymous function that takes an object `obj` and performs the following:
   - **`toindices(obj)`:** Extracts the indices of the object.
   - **`toobject(toindices(obj), I)`:** Creates an object from the extracted indices and the input grid.
   - **`rot90(...)`:** Rotates the object 90 degrees clockwise.
   - **`shift(..., (height(toindices(obj)), 0))`:** Shifts the rotated object downwards by its height.
3. **`apply(..., fgpartition(I))`:**  Applies the anonymous function to each object in the partitioned input.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the transformed objects.
5. **`paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), ...)`:** Creates a canvas filled with the background color and paints the merged transformed objects onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  transformed_objs = set()
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    transformed_obj = shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (height(toindices(obj)), 0))
    transformed_objs.add(transformed_obj)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(transformed_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a loop to iterate through each object and apply the transformation. It explicitly creates a set (`transformed_objs`) to store the transformed objects before merging and painting them onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
    merge(
      frozenset(
        shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (height(toindices(obj)), 0)) for obj in fgpartition(I)
      )
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a generator expression within the `frozenset` function to apply the transformation to each object in `fgpartition(I)`. It directly merges the resulting frozenset of transformed objects without using an intermediate variable.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def transform_object(obj):
    return shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (height(toindices(obj)), 0))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(transform_object, fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a separate function `transform_object` to encapsulate the transformation logic for each object. It then uses the `apply` function to apply this function to each object in `fgpartition(I)` and merges the resulting transformed objects.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    transformed_obj = shift(rot90(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (height(toindices(obj)), 0))
    O = paint(O, transformed_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iteratively paints each transformed object onto the canvas. It first creates a canvas filled with the background color and then iterates through each object in `fgpartition(I)`. For each object, it applies the transformation and directly paints the transformed object onto the existing canvas.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation using various DSL functions and programming constructs. They highlight the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL in solving this particular task.
