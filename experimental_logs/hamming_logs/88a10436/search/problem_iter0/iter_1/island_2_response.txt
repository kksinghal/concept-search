## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) and mirroring them across the diagonal that runs from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. Notably, the background color (0 in these examples) is not part of any object and remains unchanged.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- The object composed of '1's and '2's is mirrored.
- The object with a single '3' is mirrored.
- The '5' remains unchanged as it lies on the mirroring diagonal.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- The object composed of '1's and '2's is mirrored.
- The '6' is mirrored.
- The '5' remains unchanged.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

- The object composed of '1's, '2's and '3's is mirrored.
- The '5' remains unchanged.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions utilizing the provided DSL to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, False, True, True)
    mirrored_objs = frozenset({recolor(color(obj), dmirror(toindices(obj))) for obj in objs})
    O = I
    for obj in mirrored_objs:
        O = paint(O, toobject(obj, I))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, False, True, True)` identifies all objects (connected components) in the grid, excluding the background (0).
2. **Mirror Objects:**  For each object:
    - `dmirror(toindices(obj))` mirrors the object's indices across the main diagonal.
    - `recolor(color(obj), ...)` recolors the mirrored indices with the object's original color.
3. **Paint Mirrored Objects:** `paint(O, toobject(obj, I))` paints each mirrored object onto a copy of the input grid (`O`), effectively performing the transformation.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, False, True, True):
        mirrored_obj = recolor(color(obj), dmirror(toindices(obj)))
        O = underpaint(O, toobject(mirrored_obj, I))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates an empty grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Mirror and Paint Objects:** Iterates through each object in the input:
    - Mirrors the object's indices and recolors them as in Version 1.
    - `underpaint(O, toobject(mirrored_obj, I))` paints the mirrored object onto the canvas only where the canvas currently has the background color, ensuring objects are not drawn over each other.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    indices = asindices(I)
    mirrored_indices = dmirror(indices)
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            I[j][i] if (i, j) in mirrored_indices else I[i][j]
            for j in range(len(I[0]))
        )
        for i in range(len(I))
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get All Indices:** `asindices(I)` retrieves all cell indices in the grid.
2. **Mirror Indices:** `dmirror(indices)` mirrors all indices across the main diagonal.
3. **Construct Mirrored Grid:**  Iterates through the grid, placing the correct digit at each location:
    - If the current (column, row) is in `mirrored_indices`, it uses the digit from the corresponding mirrored location in the original grid.
    - Otherwise, it uses the digit from the current location in the original grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            I[j][i] if i > j else I[i][j]
            for j in range(w)
        )
        for i in range(h)
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Mirror:** This version directly constructs the mirrored grid while iterating:
    - `i > j` checks if the current cell is below the main diagonal. If so, it swaps the row and column indices to access the mirrored value from the original grid.
    - Otherwise, it takes the value from the current location in the original grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    return dmirror(dmirror(I))
```

**Explanation:**

This version exploits the fact that mirroring a grid twice across the main diagonal results in the original grid. Therefore, it simply applies `dmirror` twice to achieve the desired transformation.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to solving the problem using the provided DSL, showcasing the flexibility and power of this domain-specific language.
