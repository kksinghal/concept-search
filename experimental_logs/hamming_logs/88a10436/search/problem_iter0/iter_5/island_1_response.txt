## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking the non-background objects in the input grid and mirroring them to a specific location in the grid. The mirroring is done along the counter-diagonal of the object's bounding box, effectively swapping the object's rows and columns. The mirrored objects are then painted onto the original grid without overwriting existing non-background cells.

**Input 0:** The objects formed by digits 1, 2, and 3 are mirrored and painted below the original objects.

**Input 1:** Similar to Input 0, the objects formed by digits 1, 2, and 6 are mirrored and painted below the original objects.

**Input 2:**  Again, the transformation mirrors the objects (digits 1, 2, and 3) and paints them below their original positions.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  mirrored_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(cmirror(obj), (height(obj), 0)), objs)
  O = underpaint(I, mirrored_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:** Extracts non-background objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **`mirrored_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(cmirror(obj), (height(obj), 0)), objs)`:**  This line does the following for each object:
    - **`cmirror(obj)`:** Mirrors the object along its counter-diagonal.
    - **`shift(..., (height(obj), 0))`:** Shifts the mirrored object downwards by its height.
3. **`O = underpaint(I, mirrored_objs)`:** Paints the mirrored objects onto the original input grid `I` without overwriting existing non-background values.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    O = underpaint(O, shift(cmirror(obj), (height(obj), 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:**  Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in fgpartition(I):`**: Iterates through each non-background object in the input grid.
3. **`O = underpaint(O, shift(cmirror(obj), (height(obj), 0)))`:**  Mirrors each object, shifts it downwards, and paints it onto the output grid `O` without overwriting existing non-background cells.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  return underpaint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(cmirror(obj), (h - uppermost(obj), 0)), fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h = height(I)`:**  Stores the height of the input grid `I`.
2. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Extracts the non-background objects.
3. **`apply(lambda obj: shift(cmirror(obj), (h - uppermost(obj), 0)), ...)`:** For each object:
    - Mirrors it.
    - Calculates the downward shift distance as `h - uppermost(obj)` to position it correctly.
    - Shifts the mirrored object.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges all the shifted and mirrored objects.
5. **`underpaint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged objects onto the input grid `I` without overwriting.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h = height(I)
    w = width(I)
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), (h,w))
    for obj in fgpartition(I):
        for v, (i, j) in obj:
            O = paint(O, {(v, (h - 1 - j, w - 1 - i))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h = height(I)`:** Stores the height of the input grid.
2. **`w = width(I)`:**  Stores the width of the input grid.
3. **`O = canvas(mostcommon(I), (h,w))`:** Creates a blank canvas `O` of the same size as `I`, filled with the most common color in `I`.
4. **`for obj in fgpartition(I):`**: Iterates over each non-background object.
5. **`for v, (i, j) in obj:`**: Iterates over each cell in the object.
6. **`O = paint(O, {(v, (h - 1 - j, w - 1 - i))})`:**  Calculates the new position for each cell after the counter-diagonal mirroring and paints it onto the canvas `O`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: {(v, (height(I) - 1 - j, width(I) - 1 - i)) for v, (i, j) in obj}, fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Extracts non-background objects.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: {(v, (height(I) - 1 - j, width(I) - 1 - i)) for v, (i, j) in obj}, ...)`:** For each object:
    - Calculates the mirrored position of each cell directly without using `cmirror`.
3. **`merge(...)`:** Merges all transformed objects.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged objects onto the input grid.


These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the same counter-diagonal mirroring and painting transformation, demonstrating flexibility in using the DSL functions.
