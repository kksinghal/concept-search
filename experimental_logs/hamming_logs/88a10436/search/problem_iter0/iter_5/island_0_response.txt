## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking objects from the top of the grid and moving them to the bottom, shifting each object one position to the right for each row they descend. 

**Input_0:**
- The object consisting of digits '1', '2' and '3' is moved from the top to the bottom, shifted one position to the right for each row it descends. 

**Input_1:**
- The same logic applies here. The object made up of digits '1', '2' and '6' is relocated to the bottom, with a one-position rightward shift for every row it moves down.

**Input_2:**
- This example demonstrates the transformation with two distinct objects. Both objects ('2' and '3,1') are moved to the bottom with the same rightward shifting pattern. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions for the transformation:


### Program Version 1:

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  h = height(I)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    w = width(obj)
    O = cover(O, obj)
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (h - 1, w - 1)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We identify all objects in the input grid (excluding the background) using `objects(I, False, False, True)`. 
2. **Iterate through Objects:**  The program iterates over each identified object.
3. **Calculate Shift:** For each object, the shift amount is calculated.  The object needs to be moved down by the grid's height (`h`) minus 1 and right by the object's width (`w`) minus 1.
4. **Remove and Repaint:** The object is removed from its original location using `cover(O, obj)` and repainted at its new location using `paint(O, shift(obj, (h-1, w-1)))`.

### Program Version 2:

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != mostcolor(I):
        O[i + len(row) - 1][j + i] = val
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** A new grid (`O`) is created, filled with the background color and having the same dimensions as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate and Shift:** The program iterates over each cell in the input grid. If the cell is not part of the background, it's copied to the new grid with a calculated offset. The row offset is `i + len(row) - 1` (moving it to the bottom and adjusting for zero-based indexing) and the column offset is `j + i` (shifting right by the row number). 

### Program Version 3:

```python
def program_v3(I):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    O = canvas(ZERO, (h, w))
    for i in range(h):
      for j in range(w):
        if I[i][j] != ZERO:
          new_i = (i + j) % h
          new_j = (j + i) % w
          O[new_i][new_j] = I[i][j]
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:**  An empty grid is created with the same dimensions as the input, initialized with zeros.
2. **Iterate and Calculate New Indices:** The program iterates over the input grid. For each non-zero cell, new row and column indices are calculated using modulo operation (`%`) to handle wrapping around the grid's edges.
3. **Copy to New Location:** The value from the input cell is copied to the calculated new location in the output grid.

### Program Version 4:

```python
def program_v4(I):
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
      for i in range(height(I)):
        O = cover(O, obj)
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (i, i)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Objects are identified in the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate and Shift Incrementally:**  The program iterates over each object and then iterates over the grid's height. In each iteration, the object is moved one step down and one step right using `shift(obj, (i, i))`. The object is first removed from its previous location and then repainted at the new location.

### Program Version 5:

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I) - 1, 0, -1):
    row = I[height(I) - i - 1]
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != mostcolor(I):
        O = cover(O, {(val, (height(I) - i, j))})
        O = paint(O, {(val, (height(I) - 1, j + height(I) - i))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate from Bottom Row:** The program iterates through each row of the input grid starting from the second-to-last row and moving upwards.
2. **Iterate through Cells:** For each row, it iterates through its cells. 
3. **Remove and Repaint:** If a cell isn't part of the background, the corresponding object is removed from its current position and repainted at the bottom row, shifted to the right by an offset equal to the original row's distance from the bottom.


These are just five examples; many other valid program variations can achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL.
