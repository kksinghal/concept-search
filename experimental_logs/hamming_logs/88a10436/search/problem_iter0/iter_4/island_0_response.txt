## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves identifying objects (clusters of same-valued cells) and moving them downwards, aligning them against the right edge of the grid. Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The object consisting of digits '1' and '3' is moved down by 3 rows and right by 2 columns. 
- The single-cell object '2' is moved down by 1 row and right by 2 columns. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The object consisting of digit '6' is moved down by 4 rows.
- The object consisting of digit '1' is moved down by 5 rows.
- The object consisting of digit '2' is moved down by 6 rows.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- The object consisting of digits '3' and '1' is moved down by 1 row and right by 2 columns. 
- The single-cell object '2' is moved down by 1 row.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions that implement the described transformation, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  moved_objs = frozenset()
  h = height(I)
  for obj in objs:
    w = width(obj)
    offset = (h - lowermost(obj) - 1, len(I[0]) - w)
    moved_objs = moved_objs | {shift(obj, offset)}
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(moved_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objs = objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all objects in the input grid (`I`).
2. **Calculate Offset:** For each object, we calculate its downward and rightward offset to align it with the bottom right corner of the grid.
3. **Shift Objects:** `moved_objs = moved_objs | {shift(obj, offset)}` shifts each object by the calculated offset.
4. **Paint to Canvas:** A blank canvas (`canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`) is created and all moved objects are painted onto it using `paint`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != ZERO:
        O = paint(O, {(val, (len(I) - i - 1, len(row) - j - 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** A blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input is created.
2. **Iterate and Paint:** The code iterates through each cell of the input grid. If a cell is not background (`val != ZERO`), it paints the corresponding value to the canvas, mirrored along both the horizontal and vertical axes.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  moved_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj) - 1, len(I[0]) - width(obj))), objs)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(moved_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 1 but uses `apply` for more concise code. The offset calculation and shifting are combined into a lambda function applied to each object in `objs`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = rot180(I)
  objs = objects(O, T, F, F)
  moved_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    offset = (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj))
    moved_objs = moved_objs | {shift(obj, offset)}
  return rot180(paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(O)), merge(moved_objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Rotate Input:**  `O = rot180(I)` rotates the input grid by 180 degrees.
2. **Identify and Shift Objects:**  Similar to version 1, it identifies objects in the rotated grid and calculates the offset to align each object to the top left corner.
3. **Rotate Output:** After painting the shifted objects onto a canvas, the resulting grid is rotated back by 180 degrees to achieve the desired output. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(ZERO, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] != ZERO:
        O[h - i - 1][w - j - 1] = I[i][j]
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version takes a direct approach by iterating through the input grid and mirroring each non-background cell's value onto the output canvas. 

These are just a few examples, and many other variations are possible using the provided DSL functions. The key takeaway is the combination of object identification, offset calculation, and grid manipulation techniques to achieve the desired spatial transformation.
