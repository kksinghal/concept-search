## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to rotate specific objects within the grid based on their color. Let's break down each example:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The object formed by digit '1' remains unchanged.
* The object formed by digit '2' is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
* The object formed by digit '3' is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
* All other digits remain in their original positions.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The object formed by digit '1' is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
* The object formed by digit '2' is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
* The object formed by digit '6' remains unchanged.
* All other digits remain in their original positions.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The object formed by digit '1' remains unchanged.
* The object formed by digit '2' is moved two cells up.
* The object formed by digit '3' is moved two cells up.
* All other digits remain in their original positions.

**Overall Logic:**

It seems the transformation involves identifying objects based on their unique colors (digits), and then applying specific rotations or translations to those objects. The exact transformation applied (rotation direction, translation distance) might be dependent on the color itself. 

## Code Generation:

Since the exact logic for determining rotation/translation based on color isn't clear from these examples alone, the following programs will focus on object identification and applying a fixed rotation (90 degrees clockwise) for demonstration:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = partition(I)
    rotated_objs = frozenset(rot90(toobject(obj, I)) for obj in objs)
    O = paint(I, merge(rotated_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `partition(I)` divides the grid into individual objects based on color.
2. **Rotate Objects:**  For each object (`obj` in `objs`):
    * `toobject(obj, I)` converts the object indices back into an object with color values from the grid.
    * `rot90(...)` rotates the object 90 degrees clockwise.
3. **Merge and Paint:** `merge(rotated_objs)` combines the rotated objects. `paint(I, ...)` then draws these rotated objects back onto a copy of the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for value in palette(I):
      obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, value), I)
      O = paint(O, rot90(obj))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Colors:**  Iterate through each unique color (`value`) in the grid.
2. **Rotate Object by Color:** For each color:
    * `ofcolor(I, value)` gets the indices of cells with that color.
    * `toobject(..., I)` converts these indices into a colored object.
    * `rot90(...)` rotates the object.
    * `paint(O, ...)` paints the rotated object onto a copy of the grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    rotated_objs = mapply(lambda obj: rot90(toobject(obj, I)), partition(I))
    O = paint(I, merge(rotated_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Rotate:** `partition(I)` gets all objects.  `mapply(...)` applies a lambda function to each object, which:
    * `toobject(obj, I)` converts the object to a colored object.
    * `rot90(...)` rotates the object.
2. **Merge and Paint:**  The rotated objects are merged and painted back onto the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = partition(I)
  rotate_and_paint = lambda obj: paint(I, rot90(toobject(obj, I)))
  rotated_grid = apply(rotate_and_paint, objs)
  O = I
  for grid in rotated_grid:
    O = cellwise(O, grid, mostcommon(grid))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Prepare for Rotation:**  Objects are identified using `partition(I)`.
2. **Rotate and Paint:** `apply(...)` applies a function to each object to:
    * Convert to a colored object, rotate, and then paint onto a copy of the input grid.
3. **Combine Rotated Grids:** The rotated grids are combined cell-wise, using the most common color in case of overlaps.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def rotate_object_by_color(value):
    obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, value), I)
    return paint(I, rot90(obj))
  
  rotated_grids = rapply(rotate_object_by_color, palette(I))
  O = I
  for grid in rotated_grids:
    O = cellwise(O, grid, mostcommon(grid))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Rotation Function:**  A function `rotate_object_by_color` is defined to rotate objects based on a given color.
2. **Apply Rotation to Each Color:**  `rapply(...)` applies the rotation function to each unique color in the grid.
3. **Combine Rotated Grids:**  The resulting rotated grids are combined cell-wise, using the most common color to handle overlaps.

**Note:** These programs demonstrate the basic framework for object identification and rotation.  You can adapt and build upon these examples by incorporating the correct logic for determining the transformation based on object color (digit value).
