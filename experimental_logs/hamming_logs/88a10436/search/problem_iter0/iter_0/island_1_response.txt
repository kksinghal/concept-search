## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the input grid and mirroring them below their original position with a one-row offset. The original objects are left unchanged. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The object formed by digits '1', '2', and '3' is mirrored below itself.
* **Input_1:** The object formed by digits '1', '2', and '6' is mirrored.
* **Input_2:** The object formed by digits '1', '2', and '3' is mirrored.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  shifted_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (height(obj) + 1, 0)), objs)
  O = paint(paint(I, objs), shifted_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We use `fgpartition(I)` to identify individual objects within the grid, excluding the background color.
2. **Shift Objects:**  The `apply` function applies a lambda function to each object. This lambda function uses `shift` to move each object down by a distance equal to its height plus one (for the offset).
3. **Paint Objects:** The original and shifted objects are painted onto the input grid using the `paint` function. The original grid `I` ensures the background is preserved.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  mirrored_objs = apply(lambda obj: vmirror(shift(obj, (height(obj), 0))), objs) 
  O = paint(paint(I, objs), mirrored_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Mirror and Shift:**  Instead of just shifting, we first mirror the object vertically using `vmirror`. Then, we shift the mirrored object downwards by its height to achieve the desired offset.
3. **Paint Objects:** Same as Version 1.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  transformed_grid = tuple(
    tuple(
      I[i][j] if i < len(I) // 2 else I[len(I) - i - 1][j]
      for j in range(len(I[0]))
    )
    for i in range(len(I))
  )
  return transformed_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Grid Manipulation:** This version directly manipulates the grid without explicitly identifying objects. 
2. **Mirroring Logic:**  We iterate through each cell of the grid. If the cell is in the top half, its original value is retained. If it's in the bottom half, the value from the corresponding cell in the top half is copied.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    mirrored_grid = vmirror(I)
    mirrored_objs = apply(lambda obj: toobject(toindices(obj), mirrored_grid), objs)
    shifted_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (1, 0)), mirrored_objs)
    O = paint(I, shifted_objs)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Mirror the Entire Grid:** The entire input grid is mirrored vertically using `vmirror`.
3. **Extract Mirrored Objects:**  We extract the mirrored versions of the original objects from the mirrored grid using `toobject`.
4. **Shift and Paint:** The mirrored objects are shifted down by one row and then painted onto the original grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  bottom_half_offset = (len(I) // 2 + len(I) % 2, 0)
  mirrored_objs = apply(
      lambda obj: shift(vmirror(obj), bottom_half_offset), 
      objs
  )
  O = paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), objs), mirrored_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Calculate Offset:** The vertical offset for the mirrored objects is calculated based on the grid's height.
3. **Mirror, Shift, and Paint:** Each object is mirrored, shifted to the bottom half with the calculated offset, and then painted onto a blank canvas (filled with the background color) along with the original objects.
