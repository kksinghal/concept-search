## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving all objects (groups of connected, non-zero digits) to the bottom-center of the grid. Here's a breakdown:

**Input_0:** 
- The "221" object moves down and centers itself at the bottom.
- The "13" object moves down and centers itself below the "221" object. 
- The "5" object remains in the center of the bottom row.

**Input_1:**
- All objects move down, maintaining their horizontal position relative to each other.

**Input_2:**
-  The "22" and "31331" objects move up to the bottom rows, centering themselves.
-  The "5" object is already centered at the bottom and remains unchanged.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Create a blank canvas
  objs = sorted(partition(I), key=lambda obj: leftmost(obj)) # Sort objects by leftmost position
  h = height(I)
  w = width(I)
  for obj in objs:
    obj_w = width(obj) 
    offset = ((h - height(obj)), (w - obj_w) // 2) # Calculate bottom-center offset
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, offset)) # Move and paint object to the new location
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Blank Canvas:** Creates a blank canvas of the same shape as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Sort Objects:**  Sorts objects based on their leftmost column for consistent placement.
3. **Calculate Offset:**  For each object, calculates the offset to move it to the bottom-center.
4. **Move and Paint:** Shifts the object by the calculated offset and paints it onto the canvas.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = partition(I)
  h = height(I)
  moved_objs = [shift(obj, (h - height(obj), (width(I) - width(obj)) // 2)) for obj in objs]
  O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(moved_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extracts all objects from the input grid using `partition`.
2. **Calculate Offsets:** Determines the bottom-center offset for each object.
3. **Shift Objects:**  Moves each object using the calculated offset.
4. **Paint Objects:** Creates a blank canvas and paints all moved objects onto it.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in partition(I):
    O = cover(O, obj) # Remove object from its current location
    offset = (height(I) - height(obj), (width(I) - width(obj)) // 2)
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, offset)) # Paint to bottom-center
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Modify:**  Iterates through each object in the input grid.
2. **Remove and Shift:** Removes the object from its original location and calculates the offset to the bottom-center.
3. **Paint:**  Paints the object onto the grid at its new position.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = sorted(fgpartition(I), key=lambda obj: -height(obj)) # Sort by height
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  bottom = height(O) 
  for obj in objs:
    obj_w = width(obj)
    offset = (bottom - height(obj), (width(O) - obj_w) // 2)
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, offset))
    bottom -= height(obj) # Update bottom for next object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Sort:** Extracts non-background objects and sorts them by height in descending order.
2. **Bottom-Up Placement:**  Places objects onto a blank canvas starting from the bottom row. 
3. **Update Bottom:**  After placing each object, updates the "bottom" position to ensure the next object is placed correctly.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  w = width(I)
  return paint(
      paint(
          canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), 
          shift(extract(partition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == 5), ((h - height(extract(partition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == 5))) // 2, (w - width(extract(partition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == 5))) // 2))
      ),
      shift(extract(partition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) != 5), (h - height(extract(partition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) != 5)), (w - width(extract(partition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) != 5))) // 2))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** It first identifies two objects: one with color '5' and the other with any color other than '5'.
2.  **Calculate Offsets:**  It then calculates the offsets for both objects to move them to the bottom-center.
3.  **Paint Objects:**  Finally, it paints both objects onto a blank canvas using the calculated offsets.

Each version offers a different approach to achieve the same bottom-center object placement, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
