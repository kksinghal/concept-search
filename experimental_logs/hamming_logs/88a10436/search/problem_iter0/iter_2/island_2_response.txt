## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking all non-zero value objects and moving them to the bottom-left of the grid, maintaining their relative positions. 

**Detailed Breakdown:**

* **Input 0:** The object consisting of `1s`, `2s`, and `3` is moved to the bottom-left, leaving the `5` in its original position.
* **Input 1:** The objects formed by `1s`, `2s`, and `6` are shifted downwards and aligned to the left.
* **Input 2:**  The objects made up of `1s`, `2s`, and `3s` are moved downwards, preserving their original structure and relative positions.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True) 
  shifted_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (height(I) - height(obj), -leftmost(obj))) for obj in objs)
  painted = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(shifted_objs))
  return painted
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, False, False, True)` extracts all non-zero objects from the input grid `I`, treating diagonally connected cells as separate objects and ignoring the background (most frequent color).
2. **Shift Objects:**  For each object `obj` in `objs`, `shift(obj, (height(I) - height(obj), -leftmost(obj)))` moves it downwards by a distance equal to its height from the bottom edge of the grid and leftwards until it aligns with the left edge.
3. **Paint to Canvas:** A blank canvas of the same size as the input is created using `canvas(0, shape(I))`. Then, all shifted objects are merged using `merge(shifted_objs)` and painted onto the canvas using `paint`.
4. **Return Result:** The function returns the `painted` canvas, representing the transformed grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    bottom_left = (height(I), 0)
    moved = frozenset(shift(obj, subtract(bottom_left, lrcorner(obj))) for obj in objs)
    return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(moved))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Non-Zero Objects:** Similar to version 1, this line identifies all objects formed by non-zero values in the grid.
2. **Calculate Target Location:** `bottom_left = (height(I), 0)` defines the target location for moving the objects - the bottom-left corner of the grid.
3. **Shift Objects:** `subtract(bottom_left, lrcorner(obj))` calculates the offset required to move the lower-right corner of each object to the `bottom_left` position.  `shift(obj, ...)` then performs the move.
4. **Combine and Return:** This part mirrors Version 1, creating a blank canvas, merging the moved objects, painting them onto the canvas, and returning the final result.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
    return rot270(
        rot270(
            paint(
                canvas(0, shape(I)), 
                merge(
                    shift(obj, (height(I) - uppermost(obj) - height(obj), 0))
                    for obj in objects(I, False, False, True)
                )
            )
        )
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:** This version also begins by extracting non-zero objects from the grid.
2. **Vertical Shift:** Each object is shifted downwards to align its top with the bottom of the grid using `shift(obj, (height(I) - uppermost(obj) - height(obj), 0))`.
3. **Merging and Painting:** The shifted objects are combined and then painted onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input.
4. **Rotate for Alignment:** The canvas is rotated 270 degrees counter-clockwise twice (effectively a 180-degree rotation), aligning the objects to the bottom-left corner.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
    moved_objs = frozenset()
    for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
        new_obj = frozenset(
            (v, (i + height(I) - height(obj), j)) 
            for v, (i, j) in obj
        )
        moved_objs = moved_objs.union(frozenset({new_obj}))
    return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), moved_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize `moved_objs`:** A new `frozenset` is created to store the transformed objects.
2. **Iterate and Shift:** The program iterates through each non-zero object in the grid. For each cell within the object, it calculates the new row index by adding the difference between the grid's height and the object's height to the cell's original row index, effectively shifting the object downwards.
3. **Construct New Objects:** A new object with shifted cells is created and added to the `moved_objs` set.
4. **Paint and Return:** Similar to previous versions, the moved objects are painted onto a blank canvas and returned.


**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
  return paint(
        canvas(0, shape(I)),
        merge(
            shift(
                obj,
                (height(I) - 1 - (uppermost(obj) + height(obj) - 1), 0)
            )
            for obj in objects(I, False, False, True)
        )
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Non-Zero Objects:** Extracts all objects formed by non-zero values in the input grid.
2. **Calculate Vertical Offset:** For each object, this line calculates the vertical offset needed to move its bottom edge to align with the grid's bottom edge.
3. **Shift Objects:** `shift(obj, ...)` applies the calculated vertical offset to move each object downwards.
4. **Merge and Paint:**  Combines all the shifted objects and paints them onto a blank canvas of the same dimensions as the input grid.
5. **Return Transformed Grid:** The painted canvas, representing the transformed grid, is returned as the output.


These five program versions showcase diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformation, utilizing different combinations of DSL functions and logical constructs. Each version offers a unique solution while adhering to the constraints of the provided DSL.
