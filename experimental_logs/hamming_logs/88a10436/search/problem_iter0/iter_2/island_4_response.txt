## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving all non-background objects in the grid to be centered vertically, while maintaining their original horizontal positions. 

* **Input_0:** The objects (formed by digits 1, 2, and 3) are moved upwards so that their center aligns with the center row of the grid.
* **Input_1:** Similarly, the objects (formed by digits 1, 2, and 6) are moved downwards to align with the center row.
* **Input_2:** The object formed by digits 2 is moved upwards and the object formed by digits 3 and 1 is moved downwards to align with the center row.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  center_i =  shape(I)[0] // 2 
  moved_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    obj_center_i = center(obj)[0]
    vertical_shift = center_i - obj_center_i
    moved_obj = shift(obj, (vertical_shift, 0))
    moved_objs = moved_objs.union({moved_obj})
  O = paint(cover(I, objs), moved_objs)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `fgpartition(I)` identifies all non-background objects in the grid `I`.
2. **Find Center Row:**  `shape(I)[0] // 2` calculates the index of the center row.
3. **Iterate and Move:** The code iterates through each object:
    -  `center(obj)[0]` gets the row index of the object's center.
    -  `vertical_shift` calculates the required vertical shift to center the object.
    -  `shift(obj, (vertical_shift, 0))` moves the object.
    -  The moved object is added to the `moved_objs` set.
4. **Paint to Grid:** `cover(I, objs)` removes the original objects from the grid.
   - `paint(..., moved_objs)` paints the moved objects onto the grid.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      cover(I, fgpartition(I)), 
      mapply(
          lambda obj: shift(obj, (shape(I)[0] // 2 - center(obj)[0], 0)), 
          fgpartition(I)
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version achieves the same result as version 1 but in a more compact way using `mapply` for applying the shift operation to all objects at once.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def move_to_center(obj):
    return shift(obj, (shape(I)[0] // 2 - center(obj)[0], 0))
  
  return paint(cover(I, fgpartition(I)), apply(move_to_center, fgpartition(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a separate function `move_to_center` to encapsulate the logic of calculating the shift amount and moving the object. It then uses `apply` to apply this function to all objects.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    grid_center_i = shape(I)[0] // 2
    moved_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (grid_center_i - center(obj)[0], 0)) for obj in objs)
    return paint(cover(I, objs), moved_objs) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a more Pythonic set comprehension to calculate the `moved_objs` set, making the code more concise.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    grid_height = shape(I)[0]
    return paint(
        cover(I, fgpartition(I)),
        frozenset(
            shift(obj, (grid_height // 2 - center(obj)[0], 0)) for obj in fgpartition(I)
        )
    )
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to version 4 but directly uses the result of `fgpartition(I)` in the set comprehension for calculating `moved_objs`, further reducing code duplication.


These five versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the same transformation in the given DSL. They highlight the flexibility of the DSL and offer different levels of code conciseness and readability.
