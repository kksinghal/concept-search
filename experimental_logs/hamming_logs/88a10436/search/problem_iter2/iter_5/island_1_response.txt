## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying an object defined by the digit '5' and moving all other objects in the grid relative to it. 

**Input_0:** The '5' object acts as a pivot, and the rest of the grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise around it.

**Input_1:**  All objects except the '5' object are shifted up one unit. 

**Input_2:** All objects except the '5' object are shifted two units up. 

It appears the movement of other objects is dependent on the position of the '5' object.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" that achieve the described transformation. 

**Program Version 1:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), FIVE))
  fi, fj = ulcorner(five_obj)
  shifted_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (-fi, -fj)) for obj in remove(five_obj, objects(I, T, F, F)))
  rotated_objs = frozenset(rot270(obj) for obj in shifted_objs)
  positioned_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (fi, fj)) for obj in rotated_objs)
  return paint(paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), five_obj), merge(positioned_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify and Isolate '5' Object:**  Locate the object containing the digit '5' (`five_obj`) and its upper-left corner (`fi`, `fj`).
2.  **Shift and Rotate Other Objects:** Shift all other objects (`shifted_objs`) so that the '5' object's original position becomes the origin. Then, rotate these objects 90 degrees counter-clockwise (`rotated_objs`).
3.  **Position Rotated Objects:** Shift the rotated objects back to their positions relative to the '5' object (`positioned_objs`).
4.  **Construct Final Grid:** Create a blank canvas (`canvas`) and paint the '5' object and the repositioned objects onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), FIVE))
  fi, fj = ulcorner(five_obj)
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(
    shift(rot270(shift(obj, (-fi, -fj))), (fi, fj)) 
    for obj in remove(five_obj, objects(I, T, F, F))
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

This version condenses the logic of version 1 into a single line by using nested function calls. It identifies the '5' object and its position, then directly applies shifting, rotating, and repositioning to all other objects before painting them onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_loc = first(ofcolor(I, FIVE))
  fi, fj = five_loc
  output = [[ZERO for _ in range(len(I[0]))] for _ in range(len(I))]
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != FIVE:
        new_i, new_j = fi + (j - fj), fj - (i - fi)
        if 0 <= new_i < len(I) and 0 <= new_j < len(I[0]):
          output[new_i][new_j] = I[i][j]
      else:
        output[i][j] = FIVE
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in output)
```

**Explanation:**

This version takes a different approach by directly manipulating grid indices. It finds the location of the '5' digit and then iterates through all other cells, calculating their new positions based on the rotation logic.

**Program Version 4:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), FIVE))
  return paint(
    canvas(ZERO, shape(I)),
    merge(
        shift(obj, gravitate(obj, five_obj)) 
        for obj in objects(I, T, F, F)
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version attempts a more general approach. It calculates the gravitational pull of each object towards the '5' object and shifts them accordingly. While this might not be perfectly accurate for all cases, it aims to capture the relative movement pattern observed in the examples.

**Program Version 5:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    five_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), FIVE))
    fi, fj = ulcorner(five_obj)
    return paint(
        canvas(ZERO, shape(I)),
        merge(
            shift(obj, (-(i-fi) + (j-fj), -(j-fj) - (i-fi))) 
            for obj in objects(I, T, F, F)
            for i, j in toindices(obj)
        )
    )
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages the mathematical formula for rotating a point 90 degrees counter-clockwise around another point. It iterates through each cell of each object, calculates its new position based on the formula, and paints it on the canvas.

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieve the transformation using the DSL. Each version offers a distinct logic or combination of functions, highlighting the flexibility of the DSL and the potential for diverse solutions.
