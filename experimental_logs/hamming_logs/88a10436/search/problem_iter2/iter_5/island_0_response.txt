## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** The object with color '5' is duplicated and recolored to '2'. The duplicate is shifted diagonally down and right by the dimensions of the original object.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:** Similar to the previous transformation, the '5'-colored object is duplicated and recolored to '6'. The duplicate is shifted down by the height of the original object.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:** The '5'-colored object is recolored to '2'. It is then duplicated and recolored to '3', and the duplicate is shifted down by the height of the original object.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_obj = first(colorfilter(partition(I), FIVE))
  h, w = shape(five_obj)
  direction = (1, 1) if h > w else (1, -1)
  shifted_obj = shift(recolor(TWO, five_obj), multiply((h, w), direction))
  O = paint(replace(I, FIVE, TWO), shifted_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and store the '5' object:** `five_obj = first(colorfilter(partition(I), FIVE))`
2. **Calculate object dimensions and shift direction:** The direction is determined based on whether the object is taller or wider.
3. **Create a shifted and recolored duplicate:** The duplicate is shifted by the dimensions of the original object in the determined direction.
4. **Paint the transformed objects onto the replaced grid:** The original '5' object is replaced with color '2', and the shifted duplicate is painted.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_obj = first(colorfilter(partition(I), FIVE))
  h, w = shape(five_obj)
  offset = (h, w) if h > w else (h, -w)
  shifted_obj = shift(recolor(TWO, five_obj), offset)
  O = paint(replace(I, FIVE, TWO), combine(five_obj, shifted_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the '5' object:** `five_obj = first(colorfilter(partition(I), FIVE))`
2. **Determine the shift offset:** The offset is determined based on the object's dimensions and orientation.
3. **Create a shifted and recolored duplicate:** The '5' object is duplicated, recolored to '2', and shifted by the calculated offset.
4. **Combine the original and shifted objects:** Both the original and shifted objects are combined into a single set.
5. **Paint the combined objects onto the replaced grid:** The original grid is modified by replacing all '5's with '2's, and then the combined object set is painted onto it. 

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_obj = first(colorfilter(partition(I), FIVE))
  O = paint(replace(I, FIVE, TWO), shift(five_obj, (height(five_obj), width(five_obj) * sign(height(five_obj) - width(five_obj)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the '5' object:** `five_obj = first(colorfilter(partition(I), FIVE))`
2. **Calculate the shift amount:** The shift amount for the y-axis is determined by the difference between the height and width of the object. If the height is greater, it shifts downwards; otherwise, upwards.
3. **Shift and recolor the '5' object:** The '5' object is duplicated, recolored to '2', and shifted by the calculated amount.
4. **Paint the transformed object onto the replaced grid:** The original grid is modified by replacing all '5's with '2's, and then the shifted and recolored object is painted onto it.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_obj = first(colorfilter(partition(I), FIVE))
  h, w = shape(five_obj)
  shift_amount = (h, w if h > w else -w)
  O = paint(I, recolor(TWO, five_obj))
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(TWO, five_obj), shift_amount))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the '5' object:** `five_obj = first(colorfilter(partition(I), FIVE))`
2. **Calculate the shift amount:** This determines the direction and magnitude of the shift based on the object's dimensions.
3. **Recolor the original '5' object to '2' and paint:** The original '5' object is recolored to '2' and painted back onto the grid.
4. **Duplicate, recolor, shift, and paint:** A copy of the '5' object is made, recolored to '2', shifted by the calculated amount, and painted onto the grid.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_obj = first(colorfilter(partition(I), FIVE))
  h, w = shape(five_obj)
  shift_direction = 1 if h > w else -1
  O = replace(I, FIVE, TWO)
  for i in (1, 2):
    O = paint(O, shift(five_obj, (h * i, w * shift_direction * i)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the '5' object:** `five_obj = first(colorfilter(partition(I), FIVE))`
2. **Calculate object dimensions and shift direction:** Determines whether to shift left or right based on the object's height and width.
3. **Replace all '5's with '2's:** `O = replace(I, FIVE, TWO)`
4. **Iterate and paint shifted duplicates:** The loop creates and paints two duplicates of the '5' object, each shifted progressively further in the determined direction.
