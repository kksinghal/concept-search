## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking each non-background object in the input grid and rotating it 270 degrees counterclockwise. Then, the rotated object is shifted to a new position based on its original location:

* **If the object was originally in the top-left quadrant:** It is placed in the bottom-left quadrant.
* **If the object was originally in the top-right quadrant:** It is placed in the bottom-right quadrant.
* **If the object was originally in the bottom-left quadrant:** It is placed in the top-left quadrant.
* **If the object was originally in the bottom-right quadrant:** It is placed in the top-right quadrant.

The shifting ensures the objects stay within their original quadrant after rotation.


## Program Versions & Explanations:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = halve(shape(I))
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = paint(
      cover(O, obj), 
      shift(
        rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), I)),
        (
          (height(obj) - 1) * (lowermost(obj) // h), 
          (-width(obj) + 1) * (rightmost(obj) // w)
        )
      )
    )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Calculate quadrant boundaries:**  `h, w = halve(shape(I))`  determines the middle row and column indices.
2.  **Iterate over objects:**  `for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)`  loops through each non-background object.
3.  **Rotate object:** `rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), I))` rotates a copy of the object 270 degrees counterclockwise using  `toobject` to convert indices to an object that can be rotated by `rot270`.
4.  **Calculate shift:**  `( (height(obj) - 1) * (lowermost(obj) // h), (-width(obj) + 1) * (rightmost(obj) // w) )`  determines the shift based on the object's original quadrant.
5.  **Paint rotated and shifted object:**  `paint(cover(O, obj), ...)`  removes the original object and paints the rotated and shifted version.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = halve(shape(I))
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    shifted_obj = shift(
      rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), 
      (
        height(I) - height(obj) if uppermost(obj) < h else 0, 
        -width(obj) + 1 if rightmost(obj) >= w else 0
      )
    )
    O = paint(O, shifted_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Create empty canvas:**  `O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` initializes the output grid with the background color.
2.  **Iterate over objects:** Similar to Version 1.
3.  **Rotate and shift:** Rotates the object and calculates the shift based on the original quadrant.
4.  **Paint onto the canvas:**  `O = paint(O, shifted_obj)`  directly paints the shifted object onto the canvas without needing to erase the original.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = halve(shape(I))
  O = I
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if j < w and i < h:
        O = paint(O, shift(recolor(I[i][j], {(0, 0)}), (h + i, j)))
      if j < w and i >= h:
        O = paint(O, shift(recolor(I[i][j], {(0, 0)}), (i - h, j)))
      if j >= w and i < h:
        O = paint(O, shift(recolor(I[i][j], {(0, 0)}), (h + i, j - w)))
      if j >= w and i >= h:
        O = paint(O, shift(recolor(I[i][j], {(0, 0)}), (i - h, j - w)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Iterate through quadrants:** Loops through each cell in each quadrant.
2.  **Shift and paint:** Calculates the target position based on the current quadrant and paints the cell value at that position.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = halve(shape(I))
  quadrants = (
    crop(I, (0, 0), (h, w)),
    crop(I, (0, w), (h, w)),
    crop(I, (h, 0), (h, w)),
    crop(I, (h, w), (h, w)),
  )
  return vconcat(hconcat(quadrants[2], quadrants[3]), hconcat(quadrants[0], quadrants[1]))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Split into quadrants:**  `crop`  function is used to extract the four quadrants of the input grid.
2.  **Rearrange quadrants:**  The quadrants are then concatenated in the desired order to form the output grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = halve(shape(I))
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if uppermost(obj) < h:
      if leftmost(obj) < w:
        O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (h, 0)))
      else:
        O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (h, -width(obj) + 1)))
    else:
      if leftmost(obj) < w:
        O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (-h + height(obj), 0)))
      else:
        O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (-h + height(obj), -width(obj) + 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Iterate over objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2.  **Conditional shift:**  Based on the object's original quadrant, applies specific shifts to move the rotated object to the correct location.

These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation using the DSL functions. Each version leverages different combinations of functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL for tackling this problem.
