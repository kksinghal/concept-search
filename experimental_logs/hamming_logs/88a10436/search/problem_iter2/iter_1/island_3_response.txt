## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the input grid and moving them to the bottom-left corner while maintaining their relative positions. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 
* The object consisting of digits '1', '2', and '3' is moved to the bottom-left corner. 
* The relative positions of the digits within the object remain the same.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
*  Similar to the previous example, the object (digits '1', '2') is shifted to the bottom-left.
*  The '6' digit, being a separate object, is moved independently to the leftmost available space.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
*  Again, the object (digits '1', '2', and '3') is moved to the bottom-left. 
*  Notice that the background '0's remain unaffected.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, T, F, F)
  shifted_objs = [shift(obj, (height(grid)-lowermost(obj)-1, -leftmost(obj))) for obj in objs]
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), merge(shifted_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(grid, T, F, F)` identifies all distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Calculate Shift:** For each object, `(height(grid)-lowermost(obj)-1, -leftmost(obj))` calculates the shift required to move it to the bottom-left.
3. **Shift Objects:** `shift(obj, ...)` applies the calculated shift to each object.
4. **Create Canvas:** `canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))` generates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid, filled with the background color.
5. **Paint Objects:** `paint(..., ...)` paints the shifted objects onto the blank canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), 
      merge(
          apply(
              lambda obj: shift(obj, (height(grid)-lowermost(obj)-1, -leftmost(obj))), 
              objects(grid, T, F, F)
          )
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version achieves the same outcome as Version 1 but uses a more compact representation by leveraging `apply` for shifting objects.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = shape(grid)
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          next((v for v, (i_o, j_o) in obj if i == i_o + h - lowermost(obj) - 1 and j == j_o - leftmost(obj)), mostcolor(grid)) 
          for j in range(w)
      ) 
      for i in range(h)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each cell of the grid and determines the appropriate color by checking if it overlaps with any shifted object.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return rot180(
      tuple(
          tuple(
              v for j, v in enumerate(r) if (i, j) in merge({
                  shift(toindices(obj), (-uppermost(obj), width(grid)-rightmost(obj)-1)) for obj in objects(grid, T, F, F)
              })
          ) 
          for i, r in enumerate(rot180(grid))
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes rotation to simplify the shift logic. It rotates the grid by 180 degrees, applies a similar shift to the top-right, and rotates it back.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      next(
        (
          grid[i_o][j_o] for obj in objects(grid, T, F, F) 
          for v, (i_o, j_o) in obj 
          if i == i_o + height(grid) - lowermost(obj) - 1 and j == j_o - leftmost(obj)
        ),
        mostcolor(grid)
      )
      for j in range(width(grid))
    )
    for i in range(height(grid))
  )

```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates over each output grid cell and searches for a corresponding cell in the input grid after shifting objects. If a match is found, the color is copied; otherwise, the background color is used.


These five versions offer diverse implementations of the identified transformation logic using different combinations of DSL functions.
