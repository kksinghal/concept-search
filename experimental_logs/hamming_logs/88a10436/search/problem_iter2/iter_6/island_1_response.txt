## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation rotates all objects in the input grid except the object containing the color "5" by 270 degrees counterclockwise around the upper-left corner of the object containing "5".

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The object with color "2" is rotated 270 degrees counterclockwise around the upper-left corner of the object containing "5".

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The object with colors "1", "2" and "6" is rotated 270 degrees counterclockwise around the upper-left corner of the object containing "5".

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The object with colors "1", "2" and "3" is rotated 270 degrees counterclockwise around the upper-left corner of the object containing "5".


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  five_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), FIVE))
  fi, fj = ulcorner(five_obj)
  return paint(
      canvas(ZERO, shape(I)),
      merge(
          shift(rot270(shift(obj, (-fi, -fj))), (fi, fj)) if obj != five_obj 
          else obj 
          for obj in objects(I, T, F, F)
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the "5" object and its corner:**
   - `five_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), FIVE))`: Finds the object containing color "5".
   - `fi, fj = ulcorner(five_obj)`: Gets the coordinates of the upper-left corner of the "5" object.

2. **Process each object:**
   - `for obj in objects(I, T, F, F)`: Iterates through each object in the input grid.
   - `if obj != five_obj else obj`:  Conditionally applies the rotation only if the object is not the "5" object.

3. **Rotate and shift:**
   - `shift(obj, (-fi, -fj))`: Shifts the current object so that its upper-left corner aligns with the origin.
   - `rot270(...)`: Rotates the shifted object by 270 degrees counterclockwise.
   - `shift(..., (fi, fj))`: Shifts the rotated object back to its original position relative to the "5" object.

4. **Merge and paint:**
   - `merge(...)`: Combines all the processed objects into a single object.
   - `paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), ...)`: Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input and paints the merged objects onto it.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  five_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), FIVE))
  fi, fj = ulcorner(five_obj)
  return paint(
      paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), five_obj),
      merge(
          shift(rot270(shift(obj, (-fi, -fj))), (fi, fj)) 
          for obj in remove(five_obj, objects(I, T, F, F))
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version is very similar to Version 1. The main difference is that instead of conditionally applying rotation within the loop, it first paints the "5" object onto the canvas and then iterates through the remaining objects to rotate and paint them. This slightly improves readability.


**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  five_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), FIVE))
  fi, fj = ulcorner(five_obj)
  rotated_objs = (
      shift(rot270(shift(obj, (-fi, -fj))), (fi, fj)) 
      for obj in objects(I, T, F, F) if obj != five_obj
  )
  return paint(paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), five_obj), merge(rotated_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

This version separates the object rotation logic into a generator expression `rotated_objs`. This improves code structure and readability by separating the rotation logic from the painting logic.


**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  five_obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == FIVE)
  fi, fj = ulcorner(five_obj)
  return paint(
      canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), 
      merge(
          *([five_obj] + [
              shift(rot270(shift(obj, (-fi, -fj))), (fi, fj)) 
              for obj in objects(I, T, F, F) if obj != five_obj
          ])
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses the `extract` function to find the "5" object, making the code more concise. It also utilizes list comprehension and unpacking within `merge` to combine the "5" object and rotated objects.


**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  five_obj = next((obj for obj in objects(I, T, F, F) if FIVE in palette(obj)), None)
  fi, fj = ulcorner(five_obj) if five_obj else (0, 0)
  return paint(
      canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), 
      merge(
          shift(
              rot270(shift(obj, (-fi, -fj))), 
              (fi, fj)
          ) if obj != five_obj else obj
          for obj in objects(I, T, F, F)
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a generator expression with a conditional within `next` to find the "5" object, offering an alternative approach to using `colorfilter` and `first`. It also handles the case where no "5" object is found by setting default values for `fi` and `fj`.


These five versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the same transformation using various functions and programming constructs available in the DSL. They showcase code diversity while maintaining correctness and readability.
