## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all three examples involves identifying an object with a specific color (in this case, '5'), then moving and mirroring this object to a new location. Let's break down each example:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The object '5' is moved down and to the right, then mirrored vertically.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** The object '5' is moved down, then mirrored horizontally.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The object '5' is moved up and to the right, then mirrored vertically.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated", each with a unique approach:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = 5
  target_object = first(colorfilter(partition(I), target_color))
  h_shift = height(target_object)
  v_shift = width(target_object)
  O = paint(replace(I, target_color, TWO), vmirror(shift(target_object, (h_shift, v_shift))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify Target:** Find the object with color '5'.
2.  **Calculate Shift:** Determine the vertical and horizontal shift based on the object's dimensions.
3.  **Move and Mirror:** Shift the object, mirror it vertically, and paint it onto the grid (replacing '5' with '2').

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), FIVE))
  O = paint(replace(I, FIVE, TWO), hmirror(shift(five_obj, (height(five_obj), width(five_obj)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify Target:** Find the object with color '5' (considering only connected components).
2.  **Calculate Shift:** Determine the shift based on the object's dimensions.
3.  **Move and Mirror:** Shift the object, mirror it horizontally, and paint it onto the grid (replacing '5' with '2').

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_indices = ofcolor(I, FIVE)
  O = paint(replace(I, FIVE, TWO), frozenset((i + height(five_indices), j + width(five_indices)) for i, j in vmirror(five_indices)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify Target:** Find the indices of cells with color '5'.
2.  **Calculate Shift:** Determine the shift based on the dimensions of the target indices.
3.  **Move and Mirror:** Mirror the indices vertically, shift them, and paint the corresponding cells onto the grid (replacing '5' with '2').

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_obj = first(colorfilter(partition(I), FIVE))
  shift_amount = shape(five_obj)
  O = paint(replace(I, FIVE, TWO), shift(cmirror(five_obj), shift_amount))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify Target:** Find the object with color '5'.
2.  **Calculate Shift:** Determine the shift based on the object's dimensions.
3.  **Move and Mirror:** Mirror the object diagonally, shift it, and paint it onto the grid (replacing '5' with '2').

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_obj = first(colorfilter(partition(I), FIVE))
  h, w = shape(five_obj)
  new_obj = frozenset((TWO, (i + h, j + w)) for _, (i, j) in five_obj)
  O = paint(I, new_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify Target:** Find the object with color '5'.
2.  **Calculate Shift:** Determine the shift based on the object's dimensions.
3.  **Create New Object:** Create a new object with color '2' at the shifted and mirrored location based on the original object's shape.
4.  **Paint:** Paint the new object onto the original grid.

These five versions provide diverse solutions to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing various DSL functions and logic.
