## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all three examples can be described as follows:

1. **Identify a pivot object:** The object containing the digit '5' in the input grid acts as a pivot.
2. **Divide the grid:** The grid is conceptually divided into two halves based on the pivot object's position. 
3. **Shift halves:** The left half of the grid is shifted down and right, while the right half is shifted down and left. This creates a diagonal "split" effect centered around the pivot object. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The '5' object is in the 6th row. Everything to the left (including the '5' object) is shifted down and right, and everything to the right is shifted down and left. 
* **Input_1:** The '5' object is in the 6th row.  The split and shift behavior is the same as in Input_0.
* **Input_2:** The '5' object is in the 3rd row. The split and shift pattern remains consistent.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find the pivot object (containing 5)
  pivot_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), FIVE))
  
  # Determine pivot row 
  pivot_row = uppermost(pivot_obj)

  # Split grid horizontally based on pivot row
  top_half = I[:pivot_row]
  bottom_half = I[pivot_row:]

  # Shift left and right halves
  shifted_top = shift(toobject(asindices(top_half), I), (1, 1))
  shifted_bottom = shift(toobject(asindices(bottom_half), I), (1, -1))

  # Combine and paint onto a blank canvas
  O = paint(paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), shifted_top), shifted_bottom) 
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find pivot:** The code locates the object containing '5' and stores it in `pivot_obj`.
2. **Determine split:** The row index of the uppermost cell of the pivot object is used to split the grid horizontally.
3. **Shift and combine:** The top and bottom halves are converted to objects, shifted in their respective directions, and painted onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input. 

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    pivot_j = first(j for j in range(w) if I[h // 2][j] == FIVE)
    O = canvas(ZERO, (h + 1, w))
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if j <= pivot_j:
                O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i + 1, j + 1))})
            else:
                O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i + 1, j - 1))})
    return O[1:]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find pivot column:** The code finds the column index (`pivot_j`) of the '5' in the middle row.
2. **Iterate and shift:** It iterates through the input grid. For cells left of the pivot column, it paints the cell's value one row down and one column right. For cells right of the pivot, it paints them one row down and one column left.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  pivot_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), FIVE))
  pivot_center = centerofmass(pivot_obj)

  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if (i, j) == pivot_center:
        O = paint(O, {(val, (i + 1, j))}) # Pivot stays in its column
      elif j < pivot_center[1]:
        O = paint(O, {(val, (i + 1, j + 1))})
      else:
        O = paint(O, {(val, (i + 1, j - 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find pivot center:**  Locates the center of mass of the pivot object.
2. **Iterate and conditionally shift:** Iterates over each cell. The pivot object's center remains in the same column, while other cells shift based on their position relative to the pivot center. 

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
    pivot_obj = first(colorfilter(objs, FIVE))
    pivot_col = leftmost(pivot_obj)
    O = canvas(ZERO, (len(I) + 1, len(I[0])))
    for obj in objs:
        if leftmost(obj) <= pivot_col:
            O = paint(O, shift(obj, (1, 1)))
        else:
            O = paint(O, shift(obj, (1, -1)))
    return O[1:]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects and pivot:** Identifies all objects in the grid and finds the pivot object.
2. **Shift based on pivot column:** Shifts each object down.  Objects left of the pivot shift right, and those right of the pivot shift left.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  mid = w // 2
  left = crop(I, (0, 0), (h, mid + (w % 2)))  
  right = crop(I, (0, mid), (h, mid))  
  return vconcat((canvas(ZERO, (1, w)), hconcat(shift(left, (1, 1)), shift(right, (1, -1)))))[1:]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Split into halves:**  The grid is split into left and right halves. The left half includes the middle column if the width is odd.
2. **Shift and concatenate:** The left half is shifted down and right, the right half down and left, and then they are concatenated horizontally. A row of zeros is added at the top before removing the initial row. 

Each version provides a different approach to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL.
