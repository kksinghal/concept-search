## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by connected cells of the same color (excluding the background color) and moving them downwards until they hit another object or the bottom of the grid. The objects are moved one column at a time, starting from the rightmost column. 

**Example:**

In Input_0, the object consisting of digits '1' and '3' is moved one column to the right. Similarly, the object consisting of the digit '2' is also moved one column right.  

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(grid):
  objs = sorted(objects(grid, True, False, True), key=lambda obj: rightmost(obj), reverse=True)
  for obj in objs:
    offset = (0, 0)
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, offset)
    while lowermost(shifted_obj) < len(grid) - 1 and not any(vmatching(shifted_obj, other_obj) for other_obj in objs if other_obj != obj):
      offset = add(offset, DOWN)
      shifted_obj = shift(obj, offset)
    grid = move(grid, obj, offset)
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(grid, True, False, True)` identifies objects (connected cells with the same color) in the grid, excluding the background color. 
2. **Sort Objects:** `sorted(..., key=lambda obj: rightmost(obj), reverse=True)` sorts the objects from rightmost to leftmost based on their rightmost column.
3. **Iterate and Move:**  The code iterates through each object and moves it down (`DOWN`) one row at a time until:
   - It reaches the bottom of the grid (`lowermost(shifted_obj) < len(grid) - 1`).
   - It encounters a vertical overlap (`vmatching`) with another object (`any(vmatching(shifted_obj, other_obj) for other_obj in objs if other_obj != obj)`).
4. **Update Grid:** After finding the final position, the object is moved on the grid using `move(grid, obj, offset)`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(grid):
  for j in range(len(grid[0])-1, -1, -1):
    for i in range(len(grid)-1, -1, -1):
      if index(grid, (i,j)) != mostcolor(grid):
        offset = (0, 0)
        while index(grid, add((i, j), offset)) != mostcolor(grid) and add((i, j), offset)[0] < len(grid) - 1:
          offset = add(offset, DOWN)
        grid = move(grid, {(index(grid, (i, j)), (i, j))}, offset)
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Columns and Rows:** The code iterates through each column from right to left, and then each row from bottom to top.
2. **Check for Object:** If a cell doesn't contain the background color, it's part of an object.
3. **Find Landing Position:** The code calculates the offset to move the object down until it hits another object or the bottom of the grid.
4. **Move Object:** The object (single cell in this version) is moved to its final position using `move`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(grid):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj))), objects(grid, True, False, True)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions, `objects(grid, True, False, True)` identifies the objects in the grid.
2. **Calculate New Position:**  For each object, the code calculates a new position by shifting it down and right using `(lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj))`.
3. **Create Blank Canvas:** A blank canvas filled with the background color is created using `canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))`.
4. **Paint Objects:** Finally, all objects are painted onto the blank canvas at their new positions using `paint` and `merge`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(grid):
  for i in range(len(grid)-2, -1, -1):
    for j in range(len(grid[0])-1, -1, -1):
      if index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcolor(grid) and index(grid, (i + 1, j)) == mostcolor(grid):
        current_pos = (i, j)
        offset = (1, 0)
        while index(grid, add(current_pos, offset)) == mostcolor(grid) and add(current_pos, offset)[0] < len(grid) - 1:
          offset = add(offset, DOWN)
        grid = move(grid, {(index(grid, current_pos), current_pos)}, offset)
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Identify:** This version iterates through the grid and identifies cells belonging to objects that can potentially be moved down. 
2. **Find Empty Space Below:** It checks if there's an empty space below the current object cell.
3. **Calculate Offset:** Calculates the offset to move the object cell down until it hits another object or the grid's bottom.
4. **Move Object Cell:** Moves the single object cell down using `move`.

**Program Version 5:** 

```python
def program_v5(grid):
  def new_pos(obj):
    offset = (0, 0)
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, offset)
    while lowermost(shifted_obj) < len(grid) - 1 and index(grid, add(ulcorner(shifted_obj), DOWN)) == mostcolor(grid):
      offset = add(offset, DOWN)
      shifted_obj = shift(obj, offset)
    return offset
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, new_pos(obj)), objects(grid, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `new_pos` Function:** A helper function `new_pos` is defined to calculate the new position of an object after moving down.
2. **Identify Objects:**  Similar to other versions, `objects` identifies the objects within the grid.
3. **Calculate and Apply Offsets:**  The code iterates through each object and applies the `new_pos` function to calculate the offset required to move it down.
4. **Paint Objects:**  It then paints the objects onto a blank canvas at their calculated positions. 

These are five distinct ways to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL. Each version utilizes a different approach and logic, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL and the multiple ways to solve the problem.
