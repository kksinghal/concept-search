## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to rotate objects in the input grid by 90 degrees counterclockwise, placing them in a new location within the grid. The specific logic for object placement depends on the object's original location:

* **Top-left quadrant:** Objects in this quadrant remain in the top-left quadrant after rotation.
* **Top-right quadrant:** Objects in this quadrant move to the top-left quadrant after rotation.
* **Bottom-left quadrant:** Objects in this quadrant move to the bottom-left quadrant after rotation.
* **Bottom-right quadrant:** Objects in this quadrant move to the top-right quadrant after rotation.

The background color (0 in these examples) remains unchanged. 

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_22eb0ac0(I):
  h, w = halve(shape(I))
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if uppermost(obj) < h:
      if leftmost(obj) < w:
        O = paint(cover(O, obj), rot270(obj))
      else:
        O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(rot270(obj), (0, -width(obj) + 1)))
    else:
      if leftmost(obj) < w:
        O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(rot270(obj), (height(obj) - 1, 0)))
      else:
        O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(rot270(obj), (height(obj) - 1, -width(obj) + 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The code iterates through each object (excluding background) in the input grid.
2. **Determine Quadrant:** The `if` conditions determine the quadrant of the current object.
3. **Rotate and Shift:** The `rot270` function rotates the object counterclockwise. Based on the quadrant, an appropriate shift is applied to position the rotated object correctly.
4. **Paint Rotated Object:** The rotated and shifted object is painted onto a copy of the input grid (`O`), replacing its original position.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_22eb0ac0(I):
  h, w = halve(shape(I))
  quadrants = (
    crop(I, (0, 0), (h, w)), 
    crop(I, (0, w), (h, w)), 
    crop(I, (h, 0), (h, w)), 
    crop(I, (h, w), (h, w))
  )
  rotated_quadrants = (rot270(quadrants[0]), rot270(quadrants[1]), rot270(quadrants[2]), rot270(quadrants[3]))
  O = hconcat(rotated_quadrants[0], rotated_quadrants[3])
  O = vconcat(O, hconcat(rotated_quadrants[2], rotated_quadrants[1]))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Divide into Quadrants:** The input grid is divided into four quadrants.
2. **Rotate Quadrants:** Each quadrant is rotated counterclockwise using `rot270`.
3. **Reassemble Grid:** The rotated quadrants are reassembled according to the observed pattern, effectively achieving the object rotation and repositioning.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_22eb0ac0(I):
    h, w = halve(shape(I))
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            O = paint(O, shift(recolor(I[i][j], {(0, 0)}), (j, h + i - 1)))
            O = paint(O, shift(recolor(I[i][j + w], {(0, 0)}), (i, j)))
            O = paint(O, shift(recolor(I[i + h][j], {(0, 0)}), (h + i - 1, w + j - 1)))
            O = paint(O, shift(recolor(I[i + h][j + w], {(0, 0)}), (w + i - 1, h + j - 1)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** An empty canvas of the same size as the input grid is created.
2. **Iterate and Reposition:**  The code iterates through each cell of each quadrant. For each cell, it creates a single-cell object, recolors it with the original cell's color, and shifts it to the correct position based on the quadrant and rotation logic.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_22eb0ac0(I):
    h, w = halve(shape(I))
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
      O = paint(
        cover(O, obj), 
        shift(
          rot270(obj),
          (
            (height(obj) - 1) * (lowermost(obj) // h), 
            (-width(obj) + 1) * (rightmost(obj) // w)
          )
        )
      )
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** The code iterates through each object in the input grid.
2. **Calculate Shift:**  The shift values are calculated based on the object's location relative to the grid's center lines. This leverages the fact that objects originating from different quadrants have distinct combinations of 'uppermost/lowermost' and 'leftmost/rightmost' values relative to the center lines.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_22eb0ac0(I):
  h, w = halve(shape(I))
  O = I
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      O = move(O, toobject({(i, j)}, I), (j, h + i - 1))
      O = move(O, toobject({(i, j + w)}, I), (i, j))
      O = move(O, toobject({(i + h, j)}, I), (h + i - 1, w + j - 1))
      O = move(O, toobject({(i + h, j + w)}, I), (w + i - 1, h + j - 1))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:**  The code iterates through each cell of each quadrant. 
2. **Move Object:**  For each cell, it identifies the corresponding object in the original grid using `toobject` and moves it to the correct position based on the quadrant and rotation logic using the `move` function.

These are just a few examples; many other valid programs can be generated using the provided DSL functions to achieve the same transformation.
