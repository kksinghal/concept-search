## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the grid (where an object is defined as a group of connected, non-zero cells) and moving them downwards. The movement is determined by the object's original position relative to the center column of the grid:

* **Objects to the left of the center:** Shifted down and to the right.
* **Objects to the right of the center:** Shifted down and to the left.
* **Objects intersecting the center:** Remain unchanged.

**Example:**

In Input_0, the object `1 3` is on the right of the center, thus it moves down and left in the Output_0. The object `2 2 1` is on the left and shifts down and right.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  center_j = w // 2
  moved_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
    if leftmost_j < center_j:
      direction = (1, 1) 
    elif leftmost_j > center_j:
      direction = (1, -1)
    else:
      direction = (0, 0)
    moved_objs.add(shift(obj, direction))
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, (h, w)), merge(moved_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all objects in the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Move:** The code iterates through each object. It determines the movement direction based on the object's position relative to the center column.
3. **Shift Objects:** `shift(obj, direction)` moves each object in the determined direction.
4. **Construct Output:** A blank canvas is created, and the moved objects are painted onto it.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I) 
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  center_j = w // 2
  O = canvas(ZERO, (h, w))
  for obj in objs:
    j_offset =  1 if leftmost(obj) < center_j else (-1 if rightmost(obj) > center_j else 0)
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (1, j_offset)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition Grid:** `fgpartition(I)` divides the grid into objects, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate and Determine Offset:**  The code iterates over each object, calculating a horizontal offset based on its position relative to the center.
3. **Shift and Paint:** Each object is shifted down and horizontally by the calculated offset and painted onto a blank canvas.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  center_j = w // 2
  O = canvas(ZERO, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] != ZERO:
        j_offset = 1 if j < center_j else (-1 if j > center_j else 0)
        new_i, new_j = i + 1, j + j_offset
        if 0 <= new_i < h and 0 <= new_j < w:
          O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(new_i, new_j)}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Cells:** The code iterates over each cell in the input grid.
2. **Calculate Offset:** For each non-zero cell, it calculates a horizontal offset based on its position relative to the center column.
3. **Fill New Position:**  It fills the corresponding cell in the output grid with the value from the input, applying the calculated offset. 

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = vconcat((canvas(ZERO, (1, w)), I))
  for j in range(w):
    if j < w // 2:
      O = paint(O, shift(toobject({(0, j)}, O), (1, 1)))
    elif j > w // 2:
      O = paint(O, shift(toobject({(0, j)}, O), (1, -1)))
  return O[1:]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Add Empty Row:** An empty row is added to the top of the input grid.
2. **Iterate Top Row:**  The code iterates through cells in the newly added top row.
3. **Shift and Paint:** It shifts and paints the object connected to the current top row cell, down and left/right based on its position.
4. **Remove Top Row:** Finally, the temporary top row is removed.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  left = crop(I, (0,0), (h, w // 2))
  right = crop(I, (0, w // 2), (h, w // 2 + w % 2))
  O = hconcat(shift(left, (1, 1)), shift(right, (1, -1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Split Grid:** The input grid is split into left and right halves based on the center column.
2. **Shift Halves:** The left half is shifted down and right, and the right half is shifted down and left.
3. **Concatenate Halves:**  The shifted halves are concatenated horizontally to form the output grid.
