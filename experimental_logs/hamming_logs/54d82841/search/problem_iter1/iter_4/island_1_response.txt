## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the bottom row of each distinct object in the grid (excluding the background color, which is the most frequent color). It then identifies the leftmost and rightmost cells within that bottom row and changes their color to 4.

**Input 0:**

* Two objects are detected (color 6).
* The leftmost and rightmost bottom cells of each object are identified. 
* These cells are re-colored to 4.

**Input 1:**

* One object is detected (color 3).
* The leftmost and rightmost bottom cells are identified.
* These cells are re-colored to 4.

**Input 2:**

* Two objects are detected (color 8 and 6).
* The leftmost and rightmost bottom cells of each object are identified.
* These cells are re-colored to 4.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def bottom_extremes(obj):
    bottom_row = lowermost(obj)
    return {(bottom_row, j) for (i, j) in toindices(obj) if i == bottom_row}

  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  bottom_cells = mapply(bottom_extremes, objs)
  left_right = frozenset({(i, min(j for i, j in indices)) for indices in bottom_cells} | {(i, max(j for i, j in indices)) for indices in bottom_cells})
  return fill(I, 4, merge(left_right))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **bottom_extremes(obj):** This function takes an object and returns a set containing the indices of its leftmost and rightmost cells on its bottom row.
2. **objects(I, T, T, T):** This identifies all distinct objects in the grid.
3. **mapply(bottom_extremes, objs):** This applies the `bottom_extremes` function to each object and merges the results.
4. **left_right:** This part extracts the leftmost and rightmost indices from the set of bottom cells.
5. **fill(I, 4, merge(left_right)):** This fills the identified leftmost and rightmost bottom cells with the color 4.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def bottom_corners(obj):
    bottom_row = lowermost(toindices(obj))
    left_col = leftmost(obj)
    right_col = rightmost(obj)
    return {(bottom_row, left_col), (bottom_row, right_col)}

  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  corners = merge(apply(bottom_corners, objs))
  return fill(I, 4, corners)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **bottom_corners(obj):** Identifies and returns a set containing the indices of the bottom left and bottom right corner cells of a given object.
2. **objects(I, T, T, T):**  Identifies all the objects in the grid.
3. **apply(bottom_corners, objs):**  Applies the `bottom_corners` function to each object in the grid.
4. **merge(...):** Combines the results from `apply` into a single set of corner indices.
5. **fill(I, 4, corners):**  Fills the cells at the identified corner indices with the color 4.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def mark_extremes(obj):
    bottom_row = lowermost(toindices(obj))
    left_col = min(j for i, j in toindices(obj) if i == bottom_row)
    right_col = max(j for i, j in toindices(obj) if i == bottom_row)
    return {(bottom_row, left_col), (bottom_row, right_col)}
  
  objs = objects(I, True, True, True)
  extremes = frozenset({cell for obj in objs for cell in mark_extremes(obj)})
  return fill(I, 4, extremes)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **mark_extremes(obj):** Finds the leftmost and rightmost cell indices on the bottom row of a given object and returns them as a set.
2. **objects(I, True, True, True):**  This identifies all distinct objects in the input grid `I`, considering diagonally connected cells and excluding the background.
3. **extremes:**  This part iterates through each object, applies `mark_extremes` to get the extreme points, and then combines them into a single set.
4. **fill(I, 4, extremes):** This takes the input grid `I`, the color 4, and the set of extreme points `extremes`, and returns a new grid where the cells at the positions specified in `extremes` are colored with 4.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def get_bottom_edge(obj):
    bottom_row = lowermost(obj)
    return {(i, j) for v, (i, j) in obj if i == bottom_row}
  
  def get_extremes(indices):
    return {(min(indices, key=lambda x: x[1])), (max(indices, key=lambda x: x[1]))}

  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  bottom_edges = mapply(get_bottom_edge, objs)
  extremes = merge(apply(get_extremes, bottom_edges))
  return fill(I, 4, extremes)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **get_bottom_edge(obj):** Returns a set of indices representing the bottom edge of a given object.
2. **get_extremes(indices):** Takes a set of indices and returns a set containing the leftmost and rightmost indices based on their column values.
3. **objects(I, T, T, T):**  This function identifies all the objects within the input grid `I`.
4. **mapply(get_bottom_edge, objs):** Applies the `get_bottom_edge` function to each object and merges the results into a single set.
5. **apply(get_extremes, bottom_edges):** Applies the `get_extremes` function to the set of bottom edges and merges the results into a single set.
6. **fill(I, 4, extremes):**  This takes the original grid `I`, the color 4, and the set of extreme points `extremes` and returns a new grid where all cells at the indices specified by `extremes` are colored with the color 4.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def bottom_indices(obj):
        bottom_row = lowermost(obj)
        return {(bottom_row, j) for v, (i, j) in obj if i == bottom_row}

    def extremes(indices):
        sorted_indices = sorted(indices, key=lambda x: x[1])
        return {sorted_indices[0], sorted_indices[-1]}

    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
    bottom_cells = mapply(bottom_indices, objs)
    extreme_indices = frozenset({point for indices in bottom_cells for point in extremes(indices)})
    return fill(I, 4, merge(extreme_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **bottom_indices(obj):**  Identifies and returns a set of indices representing all cells on the bottom row of a given object.
2. **extremes(indices):** Takes a set of indices and returns a set containing the leftmost and rightmost indices based on their horizontal position (column index).
3. **objects(I, T, T, T):** Identifies all distinct objects within the grid.
4. **mapply(bottom_indices, objs):** This line applies the `bottom_indices` function to each detected object and merges the resulting sets of bottom row indices.
5. **extreme_indices:** Extracts the extreme (leftmost and rightmost) indices from each set of bottom row indices and combines them into a single set.
6. **fill(I, 4, merge(extreme_indices)):** This line fills the grid cells at the identified extreme indices with the color 4.
