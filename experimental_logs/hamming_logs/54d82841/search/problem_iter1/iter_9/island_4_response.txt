## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the bottom row of each non-background object in the grid. It identifies the leftmost and rightmost cells within the bottom row of each object and changes their color to 4.

**Input_0:**
- Two 6-objects are present. 
- For both objects, the leftmost and rightmost cells of their bottom rows are identified and changed to 4.

**Input_1:**
- One 3-object is present.
- The leftmost and rightmost cells of its bottom row are identified and changed to 4.

**Input_2:**
- Two objects are present: one 8-object and one 6-object.
- The transformation is applied independently to both objects, changing the leftmost and rightmost cells of their respective bottom rows to 4.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" in the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def bottom_corners(obj):
    return frozenset((lowermost(obj), min(j for v, (i, j) in obj if i == lowermost(obj))),
                    (lowermost(obj), max(j for v, (i, j) in obj if i == lowermost(obj))))
  
  return paint(I, recolor(4, merge(apply(bottom_corners, fgpartition(I)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Divides the input grid `I` into separate objects, excluding the background.
2. **`apply(bottom_corners, ...)`:**  Applies the `bottom_corners` function to each object.
3. **`bottom_corners(obj)`:**  For each object:
    - Finds the row index of the bottom row using `lowermost(obj)`.
    - Identifies the column indices of the leftmost and rightmost cells in the bottom row using `min` and `max` with a conditional generator.
    - Returns a frozenset containing the coordinates of these two corners.
4. **`merge(...)`:**  Combines the corner coordinates from all objects into a single frozenset.
5. **`recolor(4, ...)`:** Creates a new object with color 4 at the specified corner coordinates.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Applies the new object to the original grid `I`, effectively changing the color of the corner cells to 4. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modify_object(obj):
    bottom_row = tuple((i, j) for v, (i, j) in obj if i == lowermost(obj))
    leftmost = bottom_row[0][1]
    rightmost = bottom_row[-1][1]
    return frozenset({(lowermost(obj), leftmost), (lowermost(obj), rightmost)})

  return paint(I, recolor(4, merge(apply(modify_object, fgpartition(I)))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to version 1 but extracts the leftmost and rightmost column indices differently. It first creates a tuple of all cell coordinates in the bottom row and then directly accesses the first and last elements to get the leftmost and rightmost indices.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def corner_indices(obj):
    bottom_row = frozenset(j for v, (i, j) in obj if i == lowermost(obj))
    return frozenset((lowermost(obj), j) for j in {min(bottom_row), max(bottom_row)})

  return paint(I, recolor(4, merge(apply(corner_indices, fgpartition(I)))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on creating a set of column indices for the bottom row first and then uses set operations (`min`, `max`) to find the leftmost and rightmost indices. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modify_grid(grid, obj):
    bottom_row = frozenset((i, j) for v, (i, j) in obj if i == lowermost(obj))
    return fill(fill(grid, 4, {(lowermost(obj), min(j for i, j in bottom_row))}), 
                4, {(lowermost(obj), max(j for i, j in bottom_row))})
  
  return last(apply(lambda obj: modify_grid(I, obj), fgpartition(I))) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly modifies the grid iteratively for each object using the `fill` function. It finds the bottom row indices and then uses nested `fill` calls to paint the leftmost and rightmost cells with color 4.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def paint_corners(grid, obj):
    leftmost = min(obj, key=lambda x: x[1][1])[1][1]
    rightmost = max(obj, key=lambda x: x[1][1])[1][1]
    return paint(paint(grid, recolor(4, {(lowermost(obj), leftmost)})), 
                 recolor(4, {(lowermost(obj), rightmost)}))

  return last(apply(lambda obj: paint_corners(I, obj), fgpartition(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a combination of `paint` and `recolor` to directly modify the grid for each object. It identifies the leftmost and rightmost cells using `min` and `max` functions with a lambda function to access the column index within the object's cell coordinates.

These five versions showcase diverse ways to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL. Each version employs different logic and function combinations, highlighting the flexibility and expressive power of the DSL.
