## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the bottom-most row of each distinct object (excluding the background color) in the grid. For each object, the leftmost and rightmost cells in the bottom row are replaced with the digit '4'. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

* **Input_0:** Two objects are present (digit '6'). The bottom row of each object has its leftmost and rightmost '6' replaced with '4'.
* **Input_1:**  One object is present (digit '3'). The bottom row of the object has its leftmost and rightmost '3' replaced with '4'.
* **Input_2:** Two objects are present (digits '8' and '6'). The bottom row of each object has its leftmost and rightmost digit replaced with '4'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modify_object(obj):
    bottom_row = {(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if i == lowermost(obj)}
    leftmost_cell = argmin(bottom_row, lambda x: x[1][1])
    rightmost_cell = argmax(bottom_row, lambda x: x[1][1])
    return {leftmost_cell, rightmost_cell}

  modified_cells = mapply(modify_object, fgpartition(I))
  return paint(I, recolor(4, modified_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`modify_object(obj)`:** This function takes an object as input and returns a set containing its bottom-left and bottom-right cells.
    * It first extracts the bottom row of the object.
    * Then, it finds the leftmost and rightmost cells in this row using `argmin` and `argmax` with a lambda function comparing column indices.
2. **`mapply(modify_object, fgpartition(I))`:** This applies the `modify_object` function to all foreground objects in the input grid.
3. **`recolor(4, modified_cells)`:** This recolors all identified cells to '4'.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Finally, it paints the modified cells onto the original input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def bottom_edges(obj):
    bottom_i = lowermost(obj)
    return {(v, (i,j)) for v, (i,j) in obj if i == bottom_i and (j == leftmost(obj) or j == rightmost(obj))}
  
  modified_cells = mfilter(bottom_edges, fgpartition(I))
  return paint(I, recolor(4, modified_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bottom_edges(obj)`:** This function takes an object and returns its bottom-left and bottom-right cells.
    * It identifies the bottom row index (`bottom_i`).
    * It then filters the object's cells, keeping only those on the bottom row and at either the leftmost or rightmost column.
2. **`mfilter(bottom_edges, fgpartition(I))`:** This applies `bottom_edges` to all foreground objects and merges the results.
3. **`recolor(4, modified_cells)`:** This recolors the identified cells to '4'.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  It paints the changes onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modify_grid(grid, obj):
    bottom_i = lowermost(obj)
    left_j = leftmost(obj)
    right_j = rightmost(obj)
    grid = fill(grid, 4, {(bottom_i, left_j)})
    return fill(grid, 4, {(bottom_i, right_j)})

  return fold(modify_grid, I, fgpartition(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`modify_grid(grid, obj)`:** Takes the grid and an object as input. Replaces the leftmost and rightmost cells of the object's bottom row with '4'.
2. **`fold(modify_grid, I, fgpartition(I))`:**  Iterates over each foreground object in the grid, applying `modify_grid` consecutively, accumulating the changes in the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  modified_objects = set()
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    bottom_row = {(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if i == lowermost(obj)}
    leftmost_cell = min(bottom_row, key=lambda x: x[1][1])
    rightmost_cell = max(bottom_row, key=lambda x: x[1][1])
    modified_objects.update({(4, leftmost_cell[1]), (4, rightmost_cell[1])})
  return paint(I, frozenset(modified_objects))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** Loops through each foreground object in the input grid.
2. **Find bottom edges:** Identifies the leftmost and rightmost cells on the bottom row of the current object.
3. **Modify cells:** Replaces the values of the identified cells with '4' and adds them to the `modified_objects` set.
4. **Paint changes:** After processing all objects, paints the modifications onto the original grid. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def edge_indices(obj):
    bottom_i = lowermost(obj)
    left_j = leftmost(obj)
    right_j = rightmost(obj)
    return {(bottom_i, left_j), (bottom_i, right_j)}

  modified_indices = mfilter(edge_indices, fgpartition(I))
  return paint(I, recolor(4, toobject(modified_indices, I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`edge_indices(obj)`:**  Finds the indices of the bottom-left and bottom-right cells of a given object.
2. **`mfilter(edge_indices, fgpartition(I))`:** Applies `edge_indices` to every foreground object in the grid and merges the resulting indices.
3. **`toobject(modified_indices, I)`:**  Converts the identified indices back into object format using the values from the original grid.
4. **`recolor(4, ...)`:** Recolors the identified cells to '4'.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Finally, paints the modified cells onto the input grid. 

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation using the DSL, highlighting the flexibility and expressive power of the provided functions.
