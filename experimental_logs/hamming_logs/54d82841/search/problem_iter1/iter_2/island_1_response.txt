## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to identify the bottom-most row of each distinct object (excluding the background color 0) in the input grid. Then, it places the digit '4' on the first and last cell of that bottom-most row. 

Let's break it down for each example:

**Input_0:**

* Two objects are detected: one formed by '6's and another by '8's.
* For the object formed by '6's, the bottom row is the 4th row (index 3) and '4' is placed at (3,0) and (3,7).
* Similarly, for the object formed by '8's, the bottom row is the 2nd row (index 1) and '4' is placed at (1,1) and (1,3).

**Input_1 & Input_2:**

*  The logic remains consistent for these inputs as well, with '4' marking the first and last cells of the bottom-most row of each non-background object.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL functions:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def bottom_indices(obj):
    bottom_row = lowermost(obj)
    return {(bottom_row, j) for v, (i, j) in obj if i == bottom_row}

  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  bottom_cells = mapply(bottom_indices, objs)
  first_last = mapply(lambda x: {first(x), last(x)}, bottom_cells)
  return fill(I, 4, merge(first_last))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **bottom_indices(obj):** This function takes an object as input and returns the indices of cells present in the bottom-most row of that object.
2. **objects(I, T, T, T):** Identifies all distinct objects in the input grid `I`, considering diagonally connected cells and excluding the background.
3. **mapply(bottom_indices, objs):**  Applies the `bottom_indices` function to each object, returning a set of sets containing the indices of bottom-most cells for each object.
4. **first_last = mapply(lambda x: {first(x), last(x)}, bottom_cells):**  For each set of bottom-most cell indices, this extracts the first and last indices, representing the first and last cells in that row.
5. **fill(I, 4, merge(first_last)):**  Finally, the input grid `I` is filled with '4' at the identified first and last cell indices of each object's bottom row.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def mark_bottom(obj):
        bottom_row = lowermost(toindices(obj))
        leftmost_col = leftmost(toindices(obj))
        rightmost_col = rightmost(toindices(obj))
        return {(bottom_row, leftmost_col), (bottom_row, rightmost_col)}
        
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
    target_indices = merge(apply(mark_bottom, objs))
    return fill(I, 4, target_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **mark_bottom(obj):**  Takes an object and determines the bottom row and the columns of the leftmost and rightmost cells of that object. It returns a set containing these two indices.
2. **objects(I, T, T, T):**  Identifies all distinct objects (excluding background) in the input grid.
3. **merge(apply(mark_bottom, objs)):**  Applies the `mark_bottom` function to each object and merges the resulting index sets into one. 
4. **fill(I, 4, target_indices):** Fills the input grid `I` with '4' at the collected indices.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def bottom_edges(obj):
    bottom_row = lowermost(obj)
    left_edge = next((j, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if i == bottom_row)
    right_edge = last((j, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if i == bottom_row)
    return {left_edge[1], right_edge[1]}

  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  edges = mapply(bottom_edges, objs)
  return fill(I, 4, merge(edges))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **bottom_edges(obj):** Extracts the indices of the leftmost and rightmost cells on the bottom row of the object.
2. **objects(I, T, T, T):** Finds all objects in the grid.
3. **mapply(bottom_edges, objs):** Applies `bottom_edges` to each object to get the edges.
4. **fill(I, 4, merge(edges)):**  Fills the grid with '4' at the identified edges.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def get_bottom_corners(obj):
        bottom_row = lowermost(obj)
        return {(bottom_row, leftmost(obj)), (bottom_row, rightmost(obj))}

    objs = objects(I, True, True, True)  
    corners = mapply(get_bottom_corners, objs)
    return fill(I, 4, merge(corners))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **get_bottom_corners(obj):** Finds the leftmost and rightmost points on the bottom row of an object.
2. **objects(I, True, True, True):** Identifies all distinct objects in the grid.
3. **corners = mapply(get_bottom_corners, objs):**  Applies `get_bottom_corners` to each object to find their bottom corners.
4. **fill(I, 4, merge(corners)):** Fills the grid with '4' at the extracted corner locations.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def mark_extremes(obj):
        bottom_row = max(i for i, j in toindices(obj))
        left_col = min(j for i, j in toindices(obj) if i == bottom_row)
        right_col = max(j for i, j in toindices(obj) if i == bottom_row)
        return {(bottom_row, left_col), (bottom_row, right_col)}
    
    objs = objects(I, True, True, True)
    extremes = mapply(mark_extremes, objs)
    return fill(I, 4, merge(extremes))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **mark_extremes(obj):**  Identifies the leftmost and rightmost cells on the bottom row of the given object.
2. **objects(I, True, True, True):**  Finds all distinct objects within the grid.
3. **extremes = mapply(mark_extremes, objs):** Applies the `mark_extremes` function to each object to get the extreme points.
4. **fill(I, 4, merge(extremes)):** Fills the grid with the value '4' at the identified extreme points of each object.
