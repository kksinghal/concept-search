## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the bottom-most points of each object in the grid and coloring the leftmost and rightmost of these points with the value '4'.

**Input_0:**
* Two objects are present (value 6). 
* The bottom-most left and right points for both objects are identified.
* These points are colored with '4'.

**Input_1:**
* One object is present (value 3).
* The bottom-most left and right points are identified.
* These points are colored with '4'.

**Input_2:**
* Two objects are present (values 8 and 6).
* The bottom-most left and right points for both objects are identified.
* These points are colored with '4'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

### Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def bottom_extremes(obj):
    bottom_row = lowermost(toindices(obj))
    left_col = leftmost(obj)
    right_col = rightmost(obj)
    return frozenset({(bottom_row, left_col), (bottom_row, right_col)})

  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  extremes = mapply(bottom_extremes, objs)
  return fill(I, 4, merge(extremes))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **bottom_extremes(obj):** This function takes an object as input. It identifies the bottom row using `lowermost` and the leftmost and rightmost columns using `leftmost` and `rightmost` functions. It returns a frozenset containing the coordinates of the bottom-left and bottom-right points of the object.
2. **objects(I, T, T, T):** This identifies all objects in the input grid 'I'.
3. **mapply(bottom_extremes, objs):** This applies the `bottom_extremes` function to each object identified in the previous step and merges the results, giving a set of all bottom-left and bottom-right points.
4. **fill(I, 4, merge(extremes)):** This fills the input grid 'I' with the value '4' at the coordinates identified in the previous step.

### Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def bottom_indices(obj):
    bottom_row = lowermost(obj)
    return frozenset((bottom_row, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if i == bottom_row)

  def extremes(indices):
    return frozenset({(i, min(j for i, j in indices)), (i, max(j for i, j in indices))})

  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  bottom_rows = mapply(bottom_indices, objs)
  extreme_indices = mapply(extremes, bottom_rows)
  return fill(I, 4, merge(extreme_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **bottom_indices(obj):** This function takes an object and returns a frozenset of indices corresponding to the bottom row of the object.
2. **extremes(indices):** Given a set of indices, this function finds the minimum and maximum column indices and returns them as a frozenset.
3. **objects(I, T, T, T):**  Identifies all objects in the input grid 'I'.
4. **mapply(bottom_indices, objs):** Applies the `bottom_indices` function to each object, returning a set of sets containing bottom row indices for each object.
5. **mapply(extremes, bottom_rows):** Applies the `extremes` function to the set of bottom row indices, yielding a set of sets containing the extreme (leftmost and rightmost) indices for each object's bottom row.
6. **fill(I, 4, merge(extreme_indices)):** Fills the input grid 'I' with the value '4' at the identified extreme indices.

### Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def bottom_points(obj):
    bottom_row = lowermost(obj)
    return frozenset((i, j) for v, (i, j) in obj if i == bottom_row)

  def extreme_points(points):
    return frozenset({(i, min(j for i, j in points)), (i, max(j for i, j in points))})

  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  bottom_cell_sets = mapply(bottom_points, objs)
  extreme_points_set = mapply(extreme_points, bottom_cell_sets)
  return fill(I, 4, merge(extreme_points_set))
```

**Explanation:**

This version is very similar to Version 2, but instead of working with indices directly, it works with coordinate tuples (i, j) representing the cells. 

1. **bottom_points(obj):** Takes an object and returns a frozenset of coordinate tuples for cells on the object's bottom row.
2. **extreme_points(points):**  Finds the minimum and maximum column values among a set of coordinate tuples and returns a frozenset of tuples representing the leftmost and rightmost points.
3.  The rest of the code follows the same logic as Version 2, but using coordinate tuples instead of just indices.


### Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def bottom_extremes(obj):
    bottom_row = lowermost(toindices(obj))
    return frozenset((bottom_row, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if i == bottom_row)
  
  def get_extremes(indices):
    j_values = [j for i, j in indices]
    i = indices.pop()[0] # Assuming indices is not empty, otherwise handle the case
    return frozenset({(i, min(j_values)), (i, max(j_values))})

  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  bottom_edges = mapply(bottom_extremes, objs)
  extremes = mapply(get_extremes, bottom_edges)
  return fill(I, 4, merge(extremes))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **bottom_extremes(obj):** This function finds all indices of the bottom row of an object.
2. **get_extremes(indices):** This function extracts the minimum and maximum column values from a set of indices and constructs the leftmost and rightmost points.
3. **objects, mapply, and fill** are used similarly to previous versions to find objects, apply the helper functions, and modify the grid.

### Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def bottom_row_cells(obj):
    bottom_row = lowermost(obj)
    return frozenset(((bottom_row, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if i == bottom_row))

  def left_right_most(indices):
    j_values = [j for i, j in indices]
    i = indices.pop()[0] # Assuming indices is not empty, otherwise handle the case
    return frozenset({(i, min(j_values)), (i, max(j_values))})

  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  bottom_cells = mapply(bottom_row_cells, objs)
  extreme_cells = mapply(left_right_most, bottom_cells)
  return fill(I, 4, merge(extreme_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on getting cell coordinates directly instead of dealing with indices separately.

1. **bottom_row_cells(obj):** Extracts the coordinates of all cells on the bottom row of an object.
2. **left_right_most(indices):** Given a set of cell coordinates, it determines the leftmost and rightmost coordinates based on the column values.
3. The remaining functions are used for object identification, function application, and grid modification, similar to previous versions.


These are five distinct code versions that utilize different combinations of DSL functions to achieve the target transformation. They highlight various approaches to solve the problem while staying within the confines of the provided DSL.
