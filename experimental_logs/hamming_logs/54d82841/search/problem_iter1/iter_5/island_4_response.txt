## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the bottom row of each distinct object (excluding the background color which is the most frequent color in the grid) in the input grid. It then identifies the leftmost and rightmost cells within this bottom row and changes their color to 4.

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** 
- Two objects are identified: one formed by '6' and another by '0' (excluding the background of '0'). 
- For the object formed by '6', the bottom row's leftmost and rightmost '6' are replaced by '4'.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- Similar to Input_0, the bottom leftmost and rightmost '3' are replaced by '4'.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
- Two objects are identified: one formed by '8' and another by '6'. 
- The transformation is applied to both objects, replacing the corresponding bottom leftmost and rightmost cells with '4'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL provided in "dsl.py":

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modify_object(obj):
    bottom_row = sfilter(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][0] == lowermost(obj))
    leftmost_cell = argmin(bottom_row, lambda x: x[1][1])
    rightmost_cell = argmax(bottom_row, lambda x: x[1][1])
    return frozenset({leftmost_cell[1], rightmost_cell[1]})
  
  modified_indices = mapply(modify_object, fgpartition(I))
  return paint(I, recolor(4, merge(modified_indices))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`modify_object(obj)`:** This function takes an object as input. 
   - `bottom_row`: Filters the object's cells to keep only those in the bottom row.
   - `leftmost_cell`, `rightmost_cell`: Finds the leftmost and rightmost cells in the bottom row.
   - Returns a set containing the indices of the leftmost and rightmost cells.

2. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Partitions the input grid into objects, excluding the background.

3. **`mapply(modify_object, fgpartition(I))`:** Applies the `modify_object` function to each object in the partitioned grid.

4. **`merge(modified_indices)`:** Merges the sets of indices obtained from each object.

5. **`recolor(4, merge(modified_indices))`:** Creates a new object with color '4' at the collected indices.

6. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the new object onto the original input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def bottom_corners(obj):
    bottom_row = tuple((v,j) for v,(i,j) in obj if i == lowermost(obj))
    return frozenset({(4, (lowermost(obj), bottom_row[0][1])), (4, (lowermost(obj), bottom_row[-1][1]))})

  modified_cells = merge(apply(bottom_corners, fgpartition(I)))
  return paint(I, modified_cells)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bottom_corners(obj)`:**
    - Extracts the bottom row of an object as a tuple of (value, column_index) pairs.
    - Directly constructs a set containing the leftmost and rightmost cells with the target color (4).

2. **`apply(bottom_corners, fgpartition(I))`:**
    - Applies `bottom_corners` to each foreground object.

3. **`merge(...)`:** Combines the resulting cell sets.

4. **`paint(I, modified_cells)`:** 
    - Directly paints the modified cells onto the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modify_object(obj):
    bottom_i = lowermost(obj)
    left_j = minimum(frozenset(j for i, j in toindices(obj) if i == bottom_i))
    right_j = maximum(frozenset(j for i, j in toindices(obj) if i == bottom_i))
    return frozenset({(bottom_i, left_j), (bottom_i, right_j)})

  modified_indices = mapply(modify_object, fgpartition(I))
  return paint(I, recolor(4, merge(modified_indices)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`modify_object(obj)`:** 
   - `bottom_i`: Determines the row index of the bottom row.
   - `left_j`, `right_j`:  Finds the column indices of the leftmost and rightmost cells on the bottom row.
   - Returns a set with the indices of the corners.

2. The rest of the logic remains the same as in Version 1, applying the modification to each foreground object and painting the result.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def process_object(obj):
        bottom_row = sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda cell: cell[0] == lowermost(obj))
        return frozenset({(lowermost(obj), minimum(frozenset(j for i, j in bottom_row))), (lowermost(obj), maximum(frozenset(j for i, j in bottom_row)))})

    modified_indices = mapply(process_object, fgpartition(I))
    return paint(I, recolor(4, merge(modified_indices)))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`process_object(obj)`:** This function processes each object to get the desired indices.
    - It first gets the indices of the bottom row of the object.
    - It then finds the minimum and maximum column indices from the `bottom_row` and creates a frozenset of the desired indices.

2. Similar to previous versions, it applies the `process_object` function to each foreground object, merges the results, and paints them on the original grid.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modify_object(obj):
    bottom_cells = frozenset((lowermost(obj), j) for _, (i, j) in obj if i == lowermost(obj))
    left_j = minimum(frozenset(j for i, j in bottom_cells))
    right_j = maximum(frozenset(j for i, j in bottom_cells))
    return frozenset({(lowermost(obj), left_j), (lowermost(obj), right_j)})

  return paint(I, recolor(4, merge(mapply(modify_object, fgpartition(I)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`modify_object(obj)`:**
   - `bottom_cells`: Directly retrieves the indices of the bottom row cells.
   - `left_j`, `right_j`:  Finds the column indices of the leftmost and rightmost cells directly from `bottom_cells`.
   - Returns a set containing the desired corner indices.

2. The rest of the logic remains structurally similar to Version 3, with a slightly more compact form by nesting the `mapply` call.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same goal, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. Each version provides a unique perspective on solving the problem while adhering to the constraints of the DSL.
