## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the bottom-most row of each distinct object (considering diagonals for object formation) in the input grid. Then, the leftmost and rightmost cells of this bottom row are colored with value '4'. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** 
- Two objects are detected: one with value '6' and the other with value '0' (background). 
- For object '6', the bottom row has indices (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) and (3,7). The leftmost and rightmost cells are (3,4) and (3,7), which are changed to '4' in the output.

**Input_1:**
-  Similar to Input_0, we have one object with value '3'.
-  The bottom row's leftmost and rightmost cells are (1,0) and (1,4), modified to '4' in the output.

**Input_2:**
-  Two objects are present with values '8' and '6'.
-  For object '8', the bottom row's extremes are (2,0) and (2,3), which are changed to '4' in the output.
-  For object '6', the bottom row's extremes are (3,4) and (3,6), also modified to '4'.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def bottom_extremes(obj):
    bottom_row = lowermost(obj)
    return {(bottom_row, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if i == bottom_row}

  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  bottom_cells = mapply(bottom_extremes, objs)
  left_right = frozenset({(i, min(j for i, j in indices)) for indices in bottom_cells} | {(i, max(j for i, j in indices)) for indices in bottom_cells})
  return fill(I, 4, merge(left_right))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bottom_extremes(obj)`:** This function takes an object as input and returns a set containing the indices of the leftmost and rightmost cells on its bottom row.
2. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** This identifies all the objects in the grid.
3. **`mapply(bottom_extremes, objs)`:**  Applies `bottom_extremes` to each object and merges the results, providing a set of all bottom row extremes.
4. **`left_right = ...`:**  This line finds the leftmost and rightmost indices from the `bottom_cells` set for each row and merges them.
5. **`fill(I, 4, merge(left_right))`:** Finally, it fills the grid `I` with value '4' at the identified leftmost and rightmost indices.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def bottom_corners(obj):
    bottom_row = lowermost(toindices(obj))
    left_col = leftmost(obj)
    right_col = rightmost(obj)
    return {(bottom_row, left_col), (bottom_row, right_col)}

  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  corners = merge(apply(bottom_corners, objs))
  return fill(I, 4, corners)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bottom_corners(obj)`:** This function directly identifies the leftmost and rightmost bottom corner indices of a given object.
2. **`apply(bottom_corners, objs)`:** Applies `bottom_corners` to each object in the grid.
3. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the corner indices from all objects into a single set. 
4. **`fill(I, 4, corners)`:** Fills the grid with '4' at the identified corner indices.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def get_bottom_edge(obj):
    bottom_row = lowermost(obj)
    return {(i, j) for v, (i, j) in obj if i == bottom_row}
  
  def get_extremes(indices):
    return {(min(indices, key=lambda x: x[1])), (max(indices, key=lambda x: x[1]))}

  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  bottom_edges = mapply(get_bottom_edge, objs)
  extremes = merge(apply(get_extremes, bottom_edges))
  return fill(I, 4, extremes)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`get_bottom_edge(obj)`:** This function returns all indices on the bottom edge of the object.
2. **`get_extremes(indices)`:** This function takes a set of indices and returns the leftmost and rightmost ones.
3. The program applies these functions sequentially, first getting all bottom edges, then extracting the extremes, and finally filling those positions with '4'. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def bottom_indices(obj):
        bottom_row = lowermost(obj)
        return {(bottom_row, j) for v, (i, j) in obj if i == bottom_row}

    def extremes(indices):
        sorted_indices = sorted(indices, key=lambda x: x[1])
        return {sorted_indices[0], sorted_indices[-1]}

    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
    bottom_cells = mapply(bottom_indices, objs)
    extreme_indices = frozenset({point for indices in bottom_cells for point in extremes(indices)})
    return fill(I, 4, merge(extreme_indices))

```
**Explanation:**

1. **`bottom_indices(obj)`**:  Identifies and returns a set of indices for the bottom row of a given object.
2. **`extremes(indices)`**:  Sorts the indices of a set by their column value (x-coordinate) and returns a set containing the first and last indices, representing the leftmost and rightmost points.
3. This version uses nested loops within set comprehensions to apply `extremes` to the `bottom_cells` set, effectively finding the extreme left and right indices for each object's bottom row.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def bottom_edge(obj):
    bottom_row = lowermost(obj)
    return frozenset((i, j) for v, (i, j) in obj if i == bottom_row)

  def leftmost_rightmost(indices):
    return frozenset({min(indices, key=lambda x: x[1]), max(indices, key=lambda x: x[1])})

  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  extremes = frozenset({point for obj in objs for point in leftmost_rightmost(bottom_edge(obj))})
  return fill(I, 4, extremes)

```
**Explanation:**

1. **`bottom_edge(obj)`**:  Finds and returns a frozenset of indices that constitute the bottom edge of a given object. 
2. **`leftmost_rightmost(indices)`**: Determines and returns a frozenset containing the indices of the leftmost and rightmost points from a given set of indices.
3. It then uses nested set comprehensions to apply both functions (`bottom_edge` and `leftmost_rightmost`) to each object in the grid, generating a set (`extremes`) containing the leftmost and rightmost indices of each object's bottom row.
4.  Finally, it utilizes the `fill` function to modify the input grid (`I`) by placing the value `4` at each index present in the `extremes` set.

**Note:** All versions achieve the desired outcome by applying similar logic with different function combinations. Each version utilizes unique strategies and function calls within the DSL to achieve the specified transformation.
