## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the bottom-most row of each non-background object and placing the digit '4' at the leftmost and rightmost positions of that row. 

**Example:**

Input Grid:
```
0 8 8 8 0 0 0
0 8 0 8 6 6 6
0 0 0 0 6 0 6
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Output Grid:
```
0 8 8 8 0 0 0
0 8 0 8 6 6 6
0 0 0 0 6 0 6
0 0 4 0 0 4 0
```


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def place_fours(obj):
    bottom_i = lowermost(obj)
    left_j = min(j for i, j in toindices(obj) if i == bottom_i)
    right_j = max(j for i, j in toindices(obj) if i == bottom_i)
    return frozenset({(4, (bottom_i, left_j)), (4, (bottom_i, right_j))})
  
  new_objects = mapply(place_fours, fgpartition(I))
  return paint(I, new_objects)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** This function partitions the input grid (`I`) into distinct objects, excluding the background color.
2. **`mapply(place_fours, ...)`:** The `place_fours` function is applied to each object obtained from `fgpartition`.
3. **`place_fours(obj)`:**  This function takes an object as input and does the following:
    - **`lowermost(obj)`:** Finds the row index of the bottom-most row of the object.
    - **`left_j` and `right_j`:**  Finds the column indices of the leftmost and rightmost occupied cells in the bottom-most row.
    - **`return ...`:** Returns a new object containing two cells with the value '4' at the calculated leftmost and rightmost positions. 
4. **`paint(I, new_objects)`:** The '4' cells from all the modified objects are painted onto the original grid (`I`) to produce the final output.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def modify_row(obj):
    bottom_i = lowermost(obj)
    width = rightmost(obj) - leftmost(obj) + 1
    return fill(canvas(0, (1, width)), 4, {(0, 0), (0, width - 1)})

  def place_row(obj):
    bottom_i = lowermost(obj)
    left_j = leftmost(obj)
    return shift(modify_row(obj), (bottom_i, left_j))

  modified_objects = mapply(place_row, fgpartition(I))
  return paint(I, modified_objects)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Same as in Version 1.
2. **`mapply(place_row, ...)`:** Applies `place_row` to each object.
3. **`place_row(obj)`:**
    - Determines the bottom row index and leftmost column index of the object.
    - Calls `modify_row` to create a single-row grid with '4's at its edges.
    - Shifts this row to the correct position within the object's bounding box.
4. **`modify_row(obj)`:**
    - Creates a single-row grid of '0's with the same width as the input object.
    - Fills the leftmost and rightmost cells of this row with '4's.
5. **`paint(I, modified_objects)`:** Same as in Version 1.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def get_edges(obj):
    bottom_i = lowermost(obj)
    return {(i, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if i == bottom_i and (j == leftmost(obj) or j == rightmost(obj))}
  
  edges = mfilter(get_edges, fgpartition(I))
  return paint(I, recolor(4, edges)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Same as before.
2. **`mfilter(get_edges, ...)`:**  Applies `get_edges` to each object and merges the results.
3. **`get_edges(obj)`:** 
    - Finds the bottom row index of the object.
    - Returns a set containing the indices of the leftmost and rightmost cells in that row.
4. **`recolor(4, edges)`:** Creates a new object with the value '4' at all indices present in the `edges` set.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Same as before.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def place_fours(grid, obj):
    bottom_i = lowermost(obj)
    left_j = leftmost(obj)
    right_j = rightmost(obj)
    grid = fill(grid, 4, {(bottom_i, left_j)})
    return fill(grid, 4, {(bottom_i, right_j)})

  return fold(lambda g, o: place_fours(g, o), I, fgpartition(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Same as before.
2. **`fold(lambda g, o: place_fours(g, o), I, ...)`:** Iterates through each object from `fgpartition`, applying the `place_fours` function with the current grid and object as arguments. The grid is updated in each iteration.
3. **`place_fours(grid, obj)`:** 
    - Determines the indices for placing the '4's.
    - Fills those indices in the grid with the value '4' and returns the modified grid.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def get_bottom_row(obj):
    bottom_i = lowermost(obj)
    return frozenset((i, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if i == bottom_i)

  def mark_edges(row):
    return frozenset({(4, (0, 0)), (4, (0, len(row) - 1))})

  def place_edges(obj):
    bottom_row = get_bottom_row(obj)
    return shift(mark_edges(bottom_row), ulcorner(bottom_row))

  new_edges = mapply(place_edges, fgpartition(I))
  return paint(I, new_edges)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Same as before.
2. **`mapply(place_edges, ...)`:** Applies `place_edges` to each object.
3. **`place_edges(obj)`:**
    - Extracts the bottom row of the object.
    - Calls `mark_edges` to create an object representing the left and right edges of that row.
    - Shifts the marked edges to their correct position within the original grid.
4. **`get_bottom_row(obj)`:** Returns a set of indices representing the bottom row of the object.
5. **`mark_edges(row)`:** Returns an object with '4's at the leftmost and rightmost positions of a given row, assuming the row starts at index (0, 0).
6. **`paint(I, new_edges)`:** Same as before.

These are five diverse ways to solve the given transformation problem using the DSL. Each version employs different logic and function combinations, offering distinct approaches to achieving the same outcome.
