## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding two '4's at the bottom of the grid. The positions of these '4's are determined by the width of the grid. 

* **Position 1:** Second column from the left (index 1).
* **Position 2:** Second column from the right. 

Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:

* **Input_0:** The width is 8. Therefore, '4's are added at positions (7, 1) and (7, 6).
* **Input_1:** The width is 5. Therefore, '4's are added at positions (4, 1) and (4, 3).
* **Input_2:** The width is 7. Therefore, '4's are added at positions (4, 1) and (4, 5).


## Code Generation:

We can leverage functions from `Program_B`, specifically the logic of identifying the bottom row and modifying it. 

Here are five distinct versions of the `Program_to_be_generated`:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_3618c87e(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  bottom_row = I[h-1]
  modified_row = tuple(4 if (j == 1 or j == w-2) else v for j, v in enumerate(bottom_row))
  return I[:h-1] + (modified_row,) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h, w = shape(I)`:**  Gets the height and width of the input grid `I`.
2. **`bottom_row = I[h-1]`:** Extracts the bottom row.
3. **`modified_row = tuple(4 if (j == 1 or j == w-2) else v for j, v in enumerate(bottom_row))`:**  Iterates through the bottom row, placing a '4' at the second column from the left and right, otherwise keeping the original value.
4. **`return I[:h-1] + (modified_row,)`:**  Combines the original grid (excluding the last row) with the modified bottom row.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_3618c87e(I):
  h = height(I)
  w = width(I)
  return fill(fill(I, 4, {(h-1, 1)}), 4, {(h-1, w-2)})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h = height(I)` and `w = width(I)`:**  Gets the height and width of the input grid.
2. **`fill(I, 4, {(h-1, 1)})`:** Fills the cell at the second column from the left in the bottom row with '4'.
3. **`fill(..., 4, {(h-1, w-2)})`:** Fills the cell at the second column from the right in the bottom row with '4'.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_3618c87e(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  indices_to_modify = {(h-1, 1), (h-1, w-2)}
  return tuple(tuple(4 if (i, j) in indices_to_modify else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(I)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h, w = shape(I)`:** Gets the height and width.
2. **`indices_to_modify = {(h-1, 1), (h-1, w-2)}`:**  Defines the indices of the cells to modify.
3. **Nested loop with conditional fill:** Iterates through each cell, replacing the value with '4' if the cell's index is in `indices_to_modify`.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_3618c87e(I):
  w = width(I)
  new_row = tuple(4 if j in (1, w - 2) else 0 for j in range(w))
  return vconcat(I[:-1], (new_row,))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`w = width(I)`:** Extracts the grid's width.
2. **`new_row = ...`:** Creates a new row filled with '0's, except for '4's at the desired columns.
3. **`return vconcat(I[:-1], (new_row,))`:** Concatenates the original grid (without the last row) with the new row vertically.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_3618c87e(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  return paint(paint(I, {(4, (h-1, 1))}), {(4, (h-1, w-2))})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h, w = shape(I)`:**  Gets the height and width.
2. **`paint(I, {(4, (h-1, 1))})`:** Paints the cell at the second column from the left in the bottom row with '4'.
3. **`paint(..., {(4, (h-1, w-2))})`:**  Paints the cell at the second column from the right in the bottom row with '4'. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility of the provided DSL. Each version leverages different functions and strategies for modifying the grid.
