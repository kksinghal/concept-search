## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the leftmost and rightmost bottom corners of each non-background object in the input grid and coloring them with the value '4'.

**Input_0:**

* The bottom left and right corners of the '6' objects are identified.
* These corner positions are colored with '4'.

**Input_1:**

* Same logic applied as in Input_0, this time on the '3' objects.

**Input_2:**

* Same logic applied as in Input_0, this time on both '8' and '6' objects. 


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modify_object(obj):
    bottom_row_indices = sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda cell: cell[0] == lowermost(obj))
    left_j = minimum(frozenset(j for i, j in bottom_row_indices))
    right_j = maximum(frozenset(j for i, j in bottom_row_indices))
    return frozenset({(lowermost(obj), left_j), (lowermost(obj), right_j)})

  modified_indices = mapply(modify_object, fgpartition(I))
  return paint(I, recolor(4, merge(modified_indices)))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`modify_object(obj)` Function:**
    *   Takes an object as input.
    *   `bottom_row_indices`: Gets indices of the bottom row of the object.
    *   `left_j`, `right_j`: Extracts column indices of leftmost and rightmost cells in the bottom row.
    *   Returns a set containing the leftmost and rightmost bottom corner indices.
2.  **Main Program:**
    *   `fgpartition(I)`: Partitions the input grid into non-background objects.
    *   `mapply(modify_object, fgpartition(I))`:  Applies `modify_object` to each object, returning a set of modified indices for all objects.
    *   `merge(modified_indices)`: Merges the sets of indices into a single set.
    *   `recolor(4, ...)`: Recolors the cells at the modified indices to '4'.
    *   `paint(I, ...)`: Paints the recolored cells onto the original grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def corners(obj):
    bottom_row = sfilter(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][0] == lowermost(obj))
    return frozenset({
      bottom_row[0][1],
      bottom_row[-1][1]
    })
  return paint(I, recolor(4, merge(mapply(corners, fgpartition(I)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`corners(obj)` Function:**
    *   Takes an object as input.
    *   `bottom_row`: Gets the cells in the bottom row of the object.
    *   Returns a set containing the indices of the first and last cells of the bottom row.
2.  **Main Program:**
    *   `fgpartition(I)`: Partitions the input grid into non-background objects.
    *   `mapply(corners, ...)`: Applies `corners` to each object, getting corner indices.
    *   `merge(...)`: Combines the corner indices.
    *   `recolor(4, ...)`:  Colors these corner indices with '4'.
    *   `paint(I, ...)`: Overlays the colored corners onto the original grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def get_corners(obj):
    i = lowermost(obj)
    js = astuple(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj))
    return frozenset((i, j) for j in js)
  
  modified_indices = mapply(get_corners, fgpartition(I))
  return paint(I, recolor(4, merge(modified_indices)))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`get_corners(obj)` Function:**
    *   `lowermost(obj)`: Finds the row index of the bottom row.
    *   `leftmost(obj)`, `rightmost(obj)`:  Gets column indices of leftmost and rightmost cells of the object.
    *   Constructs a set containing the two corner indices using these values.
2.  **Main Program:**
    *   `fgpartition(I)`: Divides the grid into objects, excluding the background.
    *   `mapply(get_corners, ...)`:  Applies `get_corners` to each object to find its corners.
    *   `merge(...)`:  Combines all corner indices into a single set.
    *   `recolor(4, ...)`:  Colors the cells at those indices with the value '4'.
    *   `paint(I, ...)`: Draws the colored corners onto the input grid.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modify_object(obj):
    indices = toindices(obj)
    bottom_row = sfilter(indices, lambda cell: cell[0] == lowermost(indices))
    return frozenset({
      (lowermost(indices), minimum(frozenset(j for i, j in bottom_row))),
      (lowermost(indices), maximum(frozenset(j for i, j in bottom_row)))
    })

  modified_indices = merge(apply(modify_object, fgpartition(I)))
  return paint(I, recolor(4, modified_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`modify_object(obj)` Function:**
    *   `indices = toindices(obj)`: Gets the indices of cells within the object.
    *   `bottom_row`: Filters for indices belonging to the bottom row.
    *   Calculates and returns a set containing the indices of the leftmost and rightmost cells on the bottom row.
2.  **Main Program:**
    *   `fgpartition(I)`: Splits the input grid into distinct objects, excluding the background.
    *   `apply(modify_object, ...)`:  Applies `modify_object` to each object, creating a set of modified indices for each.
    *   `merge(...)`:  Combines these sets into one.
    *   `recolor(4, ...)`: Colors the cells at the specified indices with the value '4'.
    *   `paint(I, ...)`:  Applies these color changes to the original input grid.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def mark_corners(obj):
        bottom_i = lowermost(obj)
        left_j = leftmost(obj)
        right_j = rightmost(obj)
        return frozenset({(bottom_i, left_j), (bottom_i, right_j)})

    corner_indices = merge(apply(mark_corners, fgpartition(I)))
    return paint(I, recolor(4, corner_indices))

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`mark_corners(obj)` Function:**
    *   `bottom_i`, `left_j`, `right_j`:  Calculates row and column indices for the bottom left and bottom right corners of the object.
    *   Returns a set containing these two corner indices.
2.  **Main Program:**
    *   `fgpartition(I)`:  Separates the input grid into its constituent objects, excluding the background.
    *   `apply(mark_corners, ...)`:  Applies `mark_corners` to each object, generating a set of corner indices for each.
    *   `merge(...)`:  Merges these separate sets into a single set containing all corner indices.
    *   `recolor(4, ...)`:  Assigns the color '4' to the cells located at the identified corner indices.
    *   `paint(I, ...)`: Overlays the colored corners onto the original input grid.


These five programs demonstrate different approaches and DSL function combinations to achieve the same transformation, showcasing diversity in solution generation.
