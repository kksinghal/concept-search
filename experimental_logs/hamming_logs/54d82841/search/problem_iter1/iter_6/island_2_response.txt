## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation adds '4's to the bottom row of the grid, directly below the leftmost and rightmost points of each non-background object.

**Input 0:**

- Two objects: one formed by '6's and another (background) formed by '0's.
- '4's are added below the leftmost and rightmost '6's of each object formed by '6's. 

**Input 1:**

- Similar to Input 0, but with a smaller grid and an object formed by '3's.

**Input 2:**

- Two non-background objects: one formed by '8's and the other by '6's.
- '4's are added below the leftmost and rightmost points of each object independently.

## Code Generation:

### Program Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modify_obj(obj):
    bottom_left = (lowermost(obj) + 1, leftmost(obj))
    bottom_right = (lowermost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj))
    return recolor(4, frozenset((bottom_left, bottom_right)))
  
  new_objects = mapply(modify_obj, fgpartition(I))
  return paint(I, merge(new_objects))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Divides the input grid (`I`) into objects excluding the background.
2. **`modify_obj(obj)`:** For each object:
   - Determines the indices of the bottom-left and bottom-right points.
   - Creates a new object with '4's at those indices.
3. **`mapply(modify_obj, fgpartition(I))`:** Applies `modify_obj` to each object from `fgpartition(I)`.
4. **`merge(new_objects)`:** Combines the modified objects into a single object.
5. **`paint(I, merge(new_objects))`:** Paints the combined object onto the input grid, adding the '4's.

### Program Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def add_fours(grid, obj):
    row = lowermost(obj)
    left = leftmost(obj)
    right = rightmost(obj)
    return fill(grid, 4, frozenset(((row + 1, left), (row + 1, right))))
  return fold(add_fours, I, fgpartition(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Divides the input grid (`I`) into objects excluding the background.
2. **`add_fours(grid, obj)`:** For each object:
   - Finds the row below the object, and the leftmost and rightmost columns.
   - Uses `fill` to place '4's at the desired locations on the grid.
3. **`fold(add_fours, I, fgpartition(I))`:** Iterates through the objects from `fgpartition(I)` and applies `add_fours` cumulatively to the grid, starting with the original input grid.

**Note:** This version assumes the existence of a `fold` function in the DSL, which is not provided in your description. 

### Program Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modify_row(grid, obj):
    row_index = lowermost(obj) + 1
    new_row = tuple(4 if j in (leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj)) else grid[row_index][j] for j in range(width(grid)))
    return grid[:row_index] + (new_row,) + grid[row_index + 1:]
  
  return fold(modify_row, I, fgpartition(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Divides the input grid (`I`) into objects excluding the background.
2. **`modify_row(grid, obj)`:** For each object:
   - Determines the row index below the object.
   - Creates a new row with '4's at the leftmost and rightmost positions of the object, keeping other values from the original grid.
   - Replaces the original row with the modified row.
3. **`fold(modify_row, I, fgpartition(I))`:** Similar to version 2, applies `modify_row` iteratively to each object and updates the grid accordingly.

**Note:** This version also assumes the existence of a `fold` function.

### Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def get_border_indices(obj):
    return ((lowermost(obj) + 1, leftmost(obj)), (lowermost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj)))
  
  all_border_indices = merge(apply(get_border_indices, fgpartition(I)))
  return fill(I, 4, frozenset(all_border_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Divides the input grid (`I`) into objects excluding the background.
2. **`get_border_indices(obj)`:** Extracts the bottom-left and bottom-right indices for each object.
3. **`apply(get_border_indices, fgpartition(I))`:** Applies `get_border_indices` to each object, resulting in a collection of border indices.
4. **`merge( ... )`:** Combines all the border indices into a single set.
5. **`fill(I, 4, frozenset(all_border_indices))`:**  Fills the input grid with '4's at all the identified border indices.

### Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_grid = list(list(row) for row in I)
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    row = lowermost(obj) + 1
    left = leftmost(obj)
    right = rightmost(obj)
    if row < height(I):
      new_grid[row][left] = 4
      new_grid[row][right] = 4
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`new_grid = list(list(row) for row in I)`:** Creates a mutable copy of the input grid.
2. **`for obj in fgpartition(I)`:** Iterates through each non-background object.
3. For each object:
   - Calculates the row index and leftmost/rightmost column indices for the '4's.
   - Checks if the row index is within the grid's bounds.
   - Directly modifies the `new_grid` to place '4's at the calculated indices.
4. **`return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)`:** Returns the modified grid as an immutable tuple of tuples.


These are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation. Each utilizes different DSL functions and logic flow while accomplishing the same goal. You can choose the version that best suits your preference or explore further variations based on these examples.
