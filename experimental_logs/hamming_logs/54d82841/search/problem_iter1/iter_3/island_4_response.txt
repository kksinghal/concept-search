## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the bottom left and rightmost cells of each object (excluding the background) and changing their color to 4. 

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:**
* The input grid has two objects formed by the digit '6'. 
* The output grid keeps the original objects intact.
* The bottom left and rightmost cells of both objects now have the value '4'.

**Pair 1:**
* Similar to Pair 0, the input grid has one object formed by the digit '3'.
* The output grid retains the original object.
* The bottom left and rightmost cells of the object are now '4'.

**Pair 2:**
* The input has two objects, one formed by '8' and the other by '6'.
* The output maintains the original objects.
* The bottom left and rightmost cells of both objects are changed to '4'.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code in the given DSL:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modify_object(obj):
    bottom_row = frozenset({(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if i == lowermost(obj)})
    leftmost_cell = argmin(bottom_row, lambda x: x[1][1])
    rightmost_cell = argmax(bottom_row, lambda x: x[1][1])
    return frozenset({leftmost_cell, rightmost_cell})

  modified_cells = mapply(modify_object, fgpartition(I))
  return paint(I, recolor(4, merge(modified_cells))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`modify_object(obj)` Function:** This function takes an object as input and returns a set containing its bottom left and rightmost cells. It first finds the bottom row cells and then uses `argmin` and `argmax` to identify the leftmost and rightmost cells within that row.
2. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  This partitions the input grid into objects excluding the background.
3. **`mapply(modify_object, fgpartition(I))`:** This applies the `modify_object` function to each object in the partitioned grid.
4. **`merge(modified_cells)`:** Merges the sets of modified cells from each object into one set.
5. **`recolor(4, modified_cells)`:**  Recolors the cells in the merged set to '4'.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the recoloured cells onto the original input grid, generating the output.


**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def bottom_edges(obj):
    bottom_i = lowermost(obj)
    left_j = leftmost(obj)
    right_j = rightmost(obj)
    return frozenset({(I[bottom_i][left_j], (bottom_i, left_j)), (I[bottom_i][right_j], (bottom_i, right_j))})

  modified_cells = mfilter(bottom_edges, fgpartition(I))
  return paint(I, recolor(4, modified_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bottom_edges(obj)` Function:** This function identifies the bottom left and rightmost cells of an object and returns them as a set.
2. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Partitions the grid into foreground objects.
3. **`mfilter(bottom_edges, fgpartition(I))`:** Applies `bottom_edges` to each object and merges the resulting sets.
4. **`recolor(4, modified_cells)`:** Recolors the identified cells to '4'.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the recoloured cells back onto the original grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modify_grid(grid, obj):
    bottom_i = lowermost(obj)
    left_j = leftmost(obj)
    right_j = rightmost(obj)
    grid = fill(grid, 4, {(bottom_i, left_j)})
    return fill(grid, 4, {(bottom_i, right_j)})

  return last(apply(lambda obj: modify_grid(I, obj), fgpartition(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`modify_grid(grid, obj)` Function:** Takes the grid and an object as input. It fills the bottom left and rightmost cells of the object with the color '4' directly on the grid.
2. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Partitions the input grid into foreground objects.
3. **`apply(lambda obj: modify_grid(I, obj), fgpartition(I))`:** Applies the `modify_grid` function to the input grid and each object. Each application modifies the grid, and the result is a sequence of increasingly modified grids.
4. **`last(...)`:** Selects the last grid in the sequence, which has all modifications applied.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def edge_indices(obj):
    bottom_i = lowermost(obj)
    left_j = leftmost(obj)
    right_j = rightmost(obj)
    return frozenset({(bottom_i, left_j), (bottom_i, right_j)})

  modified_indices = merge(apply(edge_indices, fgpartition(I)))
  return paint(I, recolor(4, toobject(modified_indices, I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`edge_indices(obj)` Function:** Takes an object as input and returns a set containing the indices of its bottom left and rightmost cells. 
2. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Partitions the input grid into foreground objects.
3. **`apply(edge_indices, fgpartition(I))`:**  Applies the `edge_indices` function to each object in the partitioned grid, resulting in a set of index sets.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the sets of indices into a single set.
5. **`toobject(modified_indices, I)`:**  Converts the set of indices back into an object by retrieving color values from the original grid.
6. **`recolor(4, ...)`:**  Recolors the cells in the object to '4'.
7. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the recoloured object onto the original grid.

**Version 5:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modify_object(obj):
    bottom_row = sfilter(lambda cell: cell[1][0] == lowermost(obj), obj)
    return frozenset({argmin(bottom_row, lambda x: x[1][1]), argmax(bottom_row, lambda x: x[1][1])})

  modified_cells = merge(apply(modify_object, fgpartition(I)))
  return paint(I, recolor(4, modified_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`modify_object(obj)` Function:** Identifies the bottom left and rightmost cells within an object using a combination of `sfilter`, `argmin`, and `argmax`.
2. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Partitions the input grid into objects excluding the background.
3. **`apply(modify_object, fgpartition(I))`:**  Applies the `modify_object` function to each object, extracting the target cells.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Combines the extracted cells from all objects.
5. **`recolor(4, modified_cells)`:**  Assigns the color '4' to the combined set of cells.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Overlays the modified cells onto the original grid, producing the final output.

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version utilizes a different combination of functions and logic, showcasing distinct coding styles and strategies for solving the problem.
