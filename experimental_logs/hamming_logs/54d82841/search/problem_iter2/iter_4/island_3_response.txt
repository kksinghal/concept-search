## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently applies the following logic:

* **Identify the bottom row:** The transformation focuses on the last row of the input grid.
* **Target non-majority cells:**  It identifies cells in the bottom row that do NOT contain the most frequent value (the background color) in the entire grid.
* **Replace with a specific value:** These targeted cells are replaced with the value '4'.

**Input 0:**
* The most common value is '0'. 
* In the last row, the '0's at columns 3 and 7 are replaced by '4's.

**Input 1:**
* The most common value is '0'.
* In the last row, the '0' at column 3 is replaced by '4'.

**Input 2:**
* The most common value is '0'.
* In the last row, the '0's at columns 3 and 7 are replaced by '4's.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1:** (Using `mpapply`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(4, mpapply(lambda j: (len(I) - 1, j) if index(I, (len(I) - 1, j)) != mostcommon(I) else None, range(len(I[0])), range(len(I[0])))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mostcommon(I)`:**  Finds the most frequent value in the grid `I`.
2. **`range(len(I[0]))`:** Generates a sequence of column indices for the grid.
3. **`lambda j: (len(I) - 1, j)...`:**  For each column `j`, this lambda function checks if the value at the last row (`len(I) - 1`) and column `j` is NOT the most common value. If it's not, it returns the cell's index; otherwise, it returns `None`.
4. **`mpapply(...)`:** Applies the lambda function to each column index and merges the results, creating a set of indices for the cells to be changed. 
5. **`recolor(4, ...)`:**  Recolors the cells at the identified indices to the value '4'.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Applies the recoloring to the input grid `I`.

**Version 2:** (Using list comprehension and `enumerate`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    last_row = I[-1]
    new_row = [4 if (j != mostcommon(I) and c == mostcommon(I)) else c for j, c in enumerate(last_row)]
    return I[:-1] + (tuple(new_row),)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`last_row = I[-1]`:** Extracts the last row from the input grid.
2. **`new_row = [...]`:** Uses list comprehension to create a modified version of the last row.
   - `for j, c in enumerate(last_row)`: Iterates through each cell `c` and its index `j` in the last row.
   - `if (j != mostcommon(I) and c == mostcommon(I))`:  Checks if the cell's value is the most common in the grid and its index is not the most common.
   - `4 if ... else c`: If the condition is true, replace the cell with '4'; otherwise, keep the original value.
3. **`I[:-1] + (tuple(new_row),)`:**  Concatenates the original grid (excluding the last row) with the modified last row.

**Version 3:** (Using loop and conditional replacement)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = [list(row) for row in I]  
  mc = mostcommon(I) 
  for j in range(len(I[0])):
    if O[-1][j] == mc:
      O[-1][j] = 4 
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = [list(row) for row in I]`:** Creates a mutable copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **`mc = mostcommon(I)`:** Stores the most frequent value in the grid.
3. **`for j in range(len(I[0])): ...`:** Iterates through each column index `j` of the last row.
4. **`if O[-1][j] == mc: ...`:**  Checks if the cell in the last row and column `j` contains the most common value.
5. **`O[-1][j] = 4`:** If the condition is true, replaces the cell with '4'.
6. **`return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)`:**  Converts the modified grid back into a tuple of tuples.

**Version 4:** (Using `apply` and lambda function)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  last_row_indices = frozenset((len(I) - 1, j) for j in range(len(I[0])))
  modified_row = apply(lambda j: 4 if index(I, (len(I) - 1, j)) != mostcommon(I) else index(I, (len(I) - 1, j)), last_row_indices)
  return paint(I, recolor(4, modified_row))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`last_row_indices = ...`:** Creates a set of indices representing all cells in the last row.
2. **`modified_row = apply(...)`:**  Applies a lambda function to each index in `last_row_indices`.
   -  The lambda function checks if the value at the current index is different from the most common value in the grid. If it is, it replaces it with '4'; otherwise, it keeps the original value.
3. **`paint(I, recolor(4, modified_row))`:**  Paints the input grid `I` by recoloring the cells at the indices in `modified_row` to '4'.


**Version 5:** (Using `hsplit`, `vconcat`, and conditional list comprehension)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  top, bottom = hsplit(I, len(I) - 1)[0], hsplit(I, len(I) - 1)[1]
  return vconcat(top, tuple((tuple(4 if c != mostcommon(I) else c for c in bottom[0]),))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`top, bottom = hsplit(I, len(I) - 1)[0], hsplit(I, len(I) - 1)[1]`:** Splits the input grid `I` horizontally into two parts: `top` (all rows except the last) and `bottom` (only the last row).
2. **`tuple((tuple(4 if c != mostcommon(I) else c for c in bottom[0]),))`:**  Creates a new bottom row by iterating through the original bottom row and applying the transformation logic: If a cell's value is not the most common value in the grid, it's replaced with '4'; otherwise, it retains its original value.
3. **`vconcat(top, ...)`:**  Vertically concatenates the `top` portion of the grid with the newly created bottom row.
