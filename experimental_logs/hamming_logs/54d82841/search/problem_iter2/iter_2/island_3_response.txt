## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the bottom row of the input grid and places `4`s at specific locations in the output grid based on the values in the input's bottom row.

* **If a cell in the bottom row of the input grid does NOT contain the most frequent value in the entire input grid, a `4` is placed in the corresponding column of the output grid's bottom row.**

Let's illustrate this with Input_0:

**Input_0:**

```
0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0
0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6
0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
```

* Most frequent value in Input_0: `0`
* Bottom row of Input_0: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0` 
* Since all values in the bottom row are the most frequent value (`0`), no `4`s are placed.

**Output_0:**

```
0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0
0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6
0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0
```

This pattern holds for the other input-output pairs as well.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  return paint(I, frozenset((4, (len(I) - 1, j)) for j, v in enumerate(I[-1]) if v != mostcommon(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mostcommon(I)`:**  Identifies the most frequent value in the input grid `I`.
2. **`enumerate(I[-1])`:** Iterates through each cell value (`v`) and its index (`j`) in the last row (`I[-1]`) of the input grid.
3. **`if v != mostcommon(I)`:**  Checks if the current cell value is NOT the most frequent value.
4. **`(4, (len(I) - 1, j))`:** If the condition is met, creates a tuple representing a cell with value `4` at the corresponding column (`j`) in the last row (`len(I) - 1`) of the output grid.
5. **`frozenset(...)`:** Collects all the `4` cell tuples into a frozenset.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the `4`s onto the input grid `I` to generate the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  return fill(I, 4, frozenset((len(I) - 1, j) for j, v in enumerate(I[-1]) if v != mostcommon(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes `fill` instead of `paint`. It identifies the indices where `4`s should be placed and then directly fills those indices with `4` in the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bottom_row_indices = frozenset((len(I) - 1, j) for j in range(len(I[0])))
  filtered_indices = sfilter(bottom_row_indices, lambda x: I[x[0]][x[1]] != mostcommon(I))
  return paint(I, recolor(4, filtered_indices)) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version first constructs a set of all indices in the bottom row. It then filters this set, keeping only the indices where the corresponding value in the input grid is not the most frequent. Finally, it recolors these indices to `4` and paints them onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  indices_to_fill = mpapply(lambda j: (len(I) - 1, j) if I[-1][j] != mostcommon(I) else None, range(len(I[0])))
  return paint(I, recolor(4, indices_to_fill))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses `mpapply` to iterate through each column index (`j`) of the last row. For each index, it checks if the value at that index in the last row is different from the most frequent value. If it is, it returns the index; otherwise, it returns `None`. Finally, it recolors the collected indices to `4` and paints them onto the input grid. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  condition = lambda j: I[-1][j] != mostcommon(I)
  indices = frozenset((len(I) - 1, j) for j in range(len(I[0])) if condition(j))
  return fill(I, 4, indices)
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a separate `condition` function to check if the value in the last row is different from the most frequent value. It then constructs a set of indices based on this condition and uses `fill` to directly place `4`s at these indices in the input grid.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation using different DSL function combinations.
