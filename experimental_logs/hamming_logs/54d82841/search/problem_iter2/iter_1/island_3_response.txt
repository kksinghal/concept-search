## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to identify objects within the input grid and then adds squares of a specific color (4 in this case) at the bottom of the grid, directly beneath the leftmost and rightmost columns of each object. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The input has two '6' objects. The transformation adds '4' squares below the leftmost and rightmost columns of each '6' object. 
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, '4' squares are added below the '3' object.
* **Input_2:**  '4' squares are added below both the '8' object and the '6' object.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_00d62c1b(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
    new_cells = set()
    for obj in objs:
        leftmost_col = leftmost(obj)
        rightmost_col = rightmost(obj)
        new_cells.add((4, (len(I), leftmost_col)))
        new_cells.add((4, (len(I), rightmost_col)))
    return paint(I, frozenset(new_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, F)`:**  Identifies all objects in the grid `I`.
2. **`new_cells = set()`:**  Initializes an empty set to store the new cells (squares of value 4).
3. **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterates through each identified object.
4. **`leftmost_col = leftmost(obj)`/`rightmost_col = rightmost(obj)`:** Determines the leftmost and rightmost column indices of the current object.
5. **`new_cells.add(...)`:**  Adds new cells with value '4' at the bottom row (`len(I)`) and the calculated leftmost/rightmost column indices.
6. **`return paint(I, frozenset(new_cells))`:** Paints the new cells onto the original grid `I` and returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_00d62c1b(I):
    new_cells = set()
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
        for i in range(len(I)):
            if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I):
                new_cells.add((4, (len(I), j)))
                break 
    return paint(I, frozenset(new_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`new_cells = set()`:** Initializes an empty set to store new cells.
2. **`for j in range(len(I[0]))`:** Iterates through each column of the grid.
3. **`for i in range(len(I))`:** Iterates through each row within the current column.
4. **`if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I):`:** Checks if the cell value is different from the most common value (background).
5. **`new_cells.add((4, (len(I), j)))`:** If a non-background cell is found, add a new '4' cell at the bottom row of that column.
6. **`break`:**  Exits the inner loop (row iteration) after finding a non-background cell in the column.
7. **`return paint(I, frozenset(new_cells))`:**  Paints the new cells onto the original grid and returns the modified grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_00d62c1b(I):
    return paint(I, frozenset((4, (len(I), j)) for j in mpapply(lambda x, y: x if y != mostcommon(I) else None, pair(range(len(I[0])), I[-1])) if j is not None))
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version utilizes a more functional approach with list comprehensions and the `mpapply` function.
2. It iterates through the last row of the grid (`I[-1]`) to find the columns containing non-background values.
3. For each such column, it adds a '4' at the bottom row.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_00d62c1b(I):
    new_indices = set()
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
        for i, j in toindices(obj):
            new_indices.add((len(I), j))
    return paint(I, frozenset((4, (i, j)) for i, j in new_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`new_indices = set()`:**  Initializes an empty set to store the indices of new cells.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):`:** Iterates through each object in the input grid.
3. **`for i, j in toindices(obj):`:**  Iterates through the cell indices of the current object.
4. **`new_indices.add((len(I), j))`:**  Adds a new index at the bottom row (`len(I)`) and the current column (`j`) to the `new_indices` set.
5. **`return paint(I, frozenset((4, (i, j)) for i, j in new_indices))`:**  Paints the new cells with value '4' at the collected indices onto the original grid and returns the result.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_00d62c1b(I):
  return paint(I, frozenset((4, (len(I), j)) for obj in objects(I, T, F, F) for j in (leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  This version takes a more concise approach using nested loops within a list comprehension. 
2.  It iterates over each object and directly extracts the leftmost and rightmost column indices to paint the new '4' cells at the bottom row. 

**Note:** All versions assume the input grid `I` has at least one row.
