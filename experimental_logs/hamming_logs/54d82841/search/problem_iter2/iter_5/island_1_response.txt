## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the horizontal midpoint of the last row of the input grid and placing the digit '4' on either side of this midpoint. 

**Detailed Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The midpoint of the last row (8 columns) is column 4. The transformation places '4' in columns 3 and 5.
* **Input_1:** The midpoint of the last row (5 columns) is column 2 (rounding down). The transformation places '4' in columns 2 and 3.
* **Input_2:** The midpoint of the last row (7 columns) is column 3 (rounding down). The transformation places '4' in columns 2 and 5.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  mid = width(I) // 2 
  return paint(I, recolor(4, {(height(I) - 1, mid - 1), (height(I) - 1, mid + (width(I) % 2))}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mid = width(I) // 2`**: Calculates the horizontal midpoint of the grid.
2. **`(height(I) - 1, mid - 1)`**: Represents the index of the cell left of the midpoint on the last row.
3. **`(height(I) - 1, mid + (width(I) % 2))`**: Represents the index of the cell right of the midpoint on the last row. We add `(width(I) % 2)` to handle both odd and even width grids.
4. **`recolor(4, {(...), (...)})`**: Creates an object containing the two calculated indices with the color '4'.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`**:  Paints the newly created object onto the original grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  w = width(I)
  return paint(I, recolor(4, {(height(I)-1, w//2 - 1 + i * (1 + w % 2)) for i in range(2)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`w = width(I)`**: Stores the width of the grid for convenience.
2. **`(height(I)-1, w//2 - 1 + i * (1 + w % 2))`**: This expression calculates the indices of the two target cells.
   -  `w//2 - 1`: Represents the cell left of the midpoint.
   -  `i * (1 + w % 2)`:  Adds 1 for even widths and 2 for odd widths, ensuring correct placement on both. 
3. The rest is similar to Version 1, creating an object and painting it onto the grid.


**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices = {(height(I) - 1, width(I) // 2 + i - 1 + i * (width(I) % 2)) for i in range(2)}
  return paint(I, recolor(4, indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  This version directly calculates the indices within the `indices` set. 
2.  The logic for index calculation is similar to Version 2, utilizing `width(I) % 2` to adjust for odd/even widths.


**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  j = width(I) // 2 + (1 if even(width(I)) else 0)
  return paint(I, recolor(4, {(height(I)-1, j-1),(height(I)-1, j)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`j = width(I) // 2 + (1 if even(width(I)) else 0)`**:  Calculates the rightmost index of the two target cells.
2. **`(height(I)-1, j-1)`**: Represents the index left of the calculated rightmost index. 
3.  The rest is similar to previous versions.


**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  offset = 1 if even(width(I)) else 0 
  left_index = (height(I) - 1, width(I) // 2 - 1)
  right_index = (left_index[0], left_index[1] + 1 + offset) 
  return paint(I, recolor(4, {left_index, right_index})) 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`offset = 1 if even(width(I)) else 0`**:  Calculates an offset based on the grid's width.
2. **`left_index`, `right_index`**:  These variables store the calculated left and right indices for clarity.
3.  Similar to previous versions, it paints the '4's at the calculated indices.


Each version accomplishes the transformation differently, using various combinations of DSL functions and logical expressions.
