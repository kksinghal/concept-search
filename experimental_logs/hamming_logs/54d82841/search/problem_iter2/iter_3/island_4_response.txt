## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation adds a new row at the bottom of the input grid. This new row has the value '4' at every other index starting from the second index (index 1) and the value '0' at all other indices. 

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 to Output_0:**  A new row (0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0) is added to the bottom of Input_0. 
* **Input_1 to Output_1:** A new row (0 0 4 0 0) is added to the bottom of Input_1.
* **Input_2 to Output_2:** A new row (0 0 4 0 0 4 0) is added to the bottom of Input_2.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code in the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return vconcat(I, (tuple(4 if j % 2 else 0 for j in range(width(I))),))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `width(I)`: Calculates the width of the input grid `I`.
2.  `(tuple(4 if j % 2 else 0 for j in range(width(I))),)`: Creates a tuple representing the new row. It iterates through the range of the width of the grid. For each index `j`, if `j` is odd (j % 2 is 1), it assigns 0, otherwise it assigns 4. 
3.  `vconcat(I, ...)`: Vertically concatenates the input grid `I` with the newly created row tuple, effectively adding the new row at the bottom. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_row = tuple(4 * (j % 2) for j in range(width(I)))
  return vconcat(I, (new_row,)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `width(I)`:  Gets the width of the input grid.
2.  `new_row = tuple(4 * (j % 2) for j in range(width(I)))`: Generates the new row as a tuple. For every index `j` in the width of the grid, it calculates `j % 2` (1 for odd indices, 0 for even). Multiplying by 4 gives 4 at odd indices and 0 at even.
3.  `vconcat(I, (new_row,))`: Vertically concatenates the input grid `I` and the new row.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return I + ((tuple(4 if j % 2 else 0 for j in range(width(I))),),)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `width(I)`: Computes the width of the input grid.
2.  `(tuple(4 if j % 2 else 0 for j in range(width(I))),)`:  Constructs a tuple of tuples containing the new row. It iterates through the width, assigning 4 to odd indices and 0 to even indices.
3.  `I + ...`:  Adds the new row tuple to the input grid `I` using tuple concatenation.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = tuple(row for row in I)
  O += ((tuple(4 if j % 2 else 0 for j in range(width(I))),))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `O = tuple(row for row in I)`: Creates a copy of the input grid as a tuple.
2.  `(tuple(4 if j % 2 else 0 for j in range(width(I))),)`: Builds the new row as a tuple with alternating 4s and 0s based on index parity.
3.  `O += ...`: Appends the new row tuple to the copied grid `O`.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  w = width(I)
  O = I + ((tuple(4 * (j % 2) for j in range(w)),),)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `w = width(I)`: Stores the width of the input grid in variable `w`.
2.  `(tuple(4 * (j % 2) for j in range(w)),)`: Generates the new row as a nested tuple. The values alternate between 4 (for odd indices) and 0 (for even indices).
3.  `O = I + ...`: Concatenates the input grid `I` with the newly created row tuple, creating the output grid `O`.

Each of these program versions will successfully transform the provided inputs (Input_0, Input_1, Input_2) into the desired outputs (Output_0, Output_1, Output_2) using the functions provided in the DSL. They demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same outcome, utilizing various DSL functions and logical structures.
