## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid, excluding the background color (most frequent color). Then, it places markers (digit '4') below the leftmost and rightmost bottom points of each object, two rows below the object's bottom edge. 

**Example:**

Input:

```
0 8 8 8 0 0 0
0 8 0 8 6 6 6
0 0 0 0 6 0 6
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Output:

```
0 8 8 8 0 0 0
0 8 0 8 6 6 6
0 0 0 0 6 0 6
0 0 4 0 0 4 0
```

Here, two objects are identified: one with digit '8' and one with digit '6'. The markers are placed two rows below their respective bottom edges.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def marker_indices(obj):
    row = lowermost(obj) + 2
    return ((row, leftmost(obj)), (row, rightmost(obj)))

  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  indices = mapply(marker_indices, objs)
  return fill(I, 4, merge(indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`marker_indices(obj)` Function:** This function takes an object as input and calculates the indices where the markers should be placed. It finds the row two rows below the object's bottom edge (`lowermost(obj) + 2`) and creates a tuple of tuples, each containing the row and the column of the leftmost and rightmost points of the object on that row.

2. **`objects(I, False, False, True)`:**  This identifies all objects in the grid `I`, considering objects as connected regions of any digit except the background color.

3. **`mapply(marker_indices, objs)`:** This applies the `marker_indices` function to each object in `objs`, generating a set of marker indices for all objects.

4. **`merge(indices)`:** This combines all the marker indices into a single set.

5. **`fill(I, 4, merge(indices))`:** This takes the input grid `I` and fills the cells at the calculated marker indices with the digit '4', producing the output grid. 


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def mark_object(obj):
    row = lowermost(obj) + 2
    left_marker = (row, leftmost(obj))
    right_marker = (row, rightmost(obj))
    return (left_marker, right_marker)
  
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  markers = set()
  for obj in objs:
    markers.update(mark_object(obj))
  
  return fill(I, 4, frozenset(markers)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mark_object(obj)` Function:** Similar to Version 1, this function determines the marker positions for a given object. It calculates the row two rows below the object and identifies the leftmost and rightmost points on that row.

2. **`objects(I, False, False, True)`:**  This function remains the same as in Version 1, identifying objects in the grid.

3. **Iteration and Marker Placement:**  This version iterates through each identified object. For each object, it calls `mark_object` to get the marker locations and adds them to the `markers` set.

4. **`fill(I, 4, frozenset(markers))`:** This part mirrors Version 1, filling the grid with markers based on the collected indices. 


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def marker_row(obj):
    return lowermost(obj) + 2

  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  marked_grid = I
  for obj in objs:
    row = marker_row(obj)
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if index(I, (row - 2, j)) == color(obj):
        marked_grid = fill(marked_grid, 4, {(row, j)})
  return marked_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`marker_row(obj)` Function:**  This function determines the appropriate row for marker placement, which is two rows below the object's bottom edge.

2. **Object Identification and Iteration:**  Like previous versions, this version identifies objects and iterates through them.

3. **Marker Placement based on Object Color:** For each object, it iterates through the columns of the marker row. If a cell two rows above (in the original object's row) has the same color as the object, it places a marker at the current cell.

4. **`fill(marked_grid, 4, {(row, j)})`:**  The code places a marker ('4') at the calculated location on the `marked_grid`.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  markers = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
      if any(v == color(obj) for v in row):
        min_j = next(j for j, v in enumerate(row) if v == color(obj))
        max_j = len(row) - next(j for j, v in enumerate(row[::-1]) if v == color(obj)) - 1
        markers.update({(i + 2, min_j), (i + 2, max_j)})
        break
  return fill(I, 4, frozenset(markers))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterating through Objects and Rows:** This version iterates through each identified object and then iterates through each row of the grid.

2. **Finding Object Boundaries:**  For each row, it checks if the object's color exists in that row. If it does, it finds the leftmost (`min_j`) and rightmost (`max_j`) occurrences of the object's color in that row, marking the object's horizontal boundaries.

3. **Marker Placement:** It calculates the marker positions as two rows below the current row and adds them to the `markers` set. 

4. **`fill(I, 4, frozenset(markers))`:** This part is consistent with previous versions, filling in the markers on the grid.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def get_marker_locations(obj):
    bottom_row = lowermost(obj)
    leftmost_col = leftmost(obj)
    rightmost_col = rightmost(obj)
    marker_row = bottom_row + 2
    return ((marker_row, leftmost_col), (marker_row, rightmost_col))

  objects_list = objects(I, False, False, True)
  marker_locations = set()
  for obj in objects_list:
    marker_locations.update(get_marker_locations(obj))
  return fill(I, 4, frozenset(marker_locations))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`get_marker_locations(obj)` Function:**  This function calculates the positions for markers given an object. It determines the object's bottom row, leftmost column, and rightmost column. Using these, it calculates the marker positions two rows below the object.

2. **Object Identification and Marker Calculation:** The code identifies objects in the grid and iterates through them. For each object, it calls `get_marker_locations` to get the marker positions and adds them to the `marker_locations` set.

3. **`fill(I, 4, frozenset(marker_locations))`:** This final step fills the grid `I` with markers ('4') at the calculated marker locations, generating the output grid.


Each of these versions utilizes different logical approaches and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same transformation. They demonstrate the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL in solving the given task.
