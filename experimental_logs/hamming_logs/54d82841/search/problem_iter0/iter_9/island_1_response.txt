## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify the bottom-most left and right corner cells of each distinct object (excluding the background) and change their values to '4'. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** Two objects are detected (6, 6). The bottom-left and bottom-right corners of these objects are identified, and their values are changed to '4'.

**Input_1:** Two objects are detected (3, 3).  Similar to Input_0, the bottom corner cells of these objects are modified.

**Input_2:** Three objects are detected (8, 8, 6).  The transformation consistently modifies the bottom-left and bottom-right corners of each object.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the `Program_to_be_generated` along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I) # Partition the grid into foreground objects
  corner_cells = mapply(lambda obj: ({(4, (lowermost(obj), leftmost(obj))), (4, (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj)))}), objs)  # Find bottom-left and bottom-right corners and create cell tuples with color 4
  O = paint(I, merge(corner_cells)) # Paint the corner cells onto the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Divides the input grid (`I`) into distinct objects, excluding the background.
2. **`mapply(...)`:** Applies a lambda function to each object:
   -  `lambda obj: ({(4, (lowermost(obj), leftmost(obj))), (4, (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj)))})` For each object, this lambda function creates a set containing two cell tuples. Each tuple represents a corner cell with color '4', and the coordinates are determined by `lowermost`, `leftmost`, and `rightmost` functions. 
3. **`merge(corner_cells)`:** Merges the sets of corner cells from all objects into a single set.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Overlays the corner cells onto a copy of the input grid (`I`), effectively changing the values at those coordinates to '4'. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  bottom_corners = mfilter(lambda obj: {(4, (lowermost(obj), leftmost(obj))), (4, (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj)))}, objs) # Get corner cells for each object
  O = paint(I, merge(bottom_corners))  # Paint the corner cells onto the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Same as in Version 1.
2. **`mfilter(...)`:**  Applies a lambda function to each object and merges the results.
   -  The lambda function calculates the bottom-left and bottom-right corner cells for each object, creating cell tuples with color '4'.
3. **`merge(bottom_corners)`:** Merges the corner cell sets from all objects.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the corner cells onto the grid. 


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modify_object(obj):
    return {(4, (lowermost(obj), leftmost(obj))), (4, (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj)))}
  
  modified_objs = apply(modify_object, fgpartition(I))  # Apply the corner modification to each object
  O = paint(I, merge(modified_objs))  # Combine and paint the modified objects onto the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`modify_object(obj)`:** Defines a helper function to calculate and return corner cells with color '4' for a given object.
2. **`apply(modify_object, fgpartition(I))`:** Partitions the grid into objects and applies `modify_object` to each, creating modified objects.
3. **`merge(modified_objs)`:** Combines the modified objects.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the combined modified objects onto the grid. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  corner_indices = mapply(lambda obj: ({(lowermost(obj), leftmost(obj)), (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj))}), fgpartition(I))  # Get corner indices for each object
  O = fill(I, 4, merge(corner_indices))  # Fill the corner indices with 4
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mapply(...)`:** Applies a lambda function to each object after partitioning the grid.
   - The lambda function finds the bottom-left and bottom-right corner indices (without color) for each object. 
2. **`merge(corner_indices)`:**  Combines the corner indices from all objects.
3. **`fill(I, 4, ...)`:** Fills the grid cells at the collected corner indices with the value '4'.

**Program Version 5:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def get_corners(obj):
    return {(lowermost(obj), j) for j in (leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj))}  # Find bottom-left and bottom-right corners

  corner_cells =  mapply(get_corners, fgpartition(I))  # Get corner indices for each object
  O = fill(I, 4, merge(corner_cells))  # Fill corner cells with 4
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`get_corners(obj)`:** Defines a helper function to calculate the bottom-left and bottom-right corner indices of a given object.
2. **`mapply(get_corners, fgpartition(I))`:**  Partitions the grid, applies `get_corners` to each object, and collects the resulting corner indices.
3. **`merge(corner_cells)`:**  Merges all corner indices.
4. **`fill(I, 4, ...)`:** Fills the grid cells at the corner indices with the value '4'.
