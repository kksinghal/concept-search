## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the leftmost and rightmost bottom cells of each distinct object in the input grid and placing the digit '4' at those locations in the bottom row of the grid.

**Input_0:**

* **Objects:** Two distinct objects formed by the digits '6'.
* **Transformation:** The digit '4' is placed at the bottom left and bottom right corners of the bounding box containing both '6' objects.

**Input_1:**

* **Objects:** One distinct object formed by the digit '3'.
* **Transformation:** The digit '4' is placed at the bottom left and bottom right corners of the bounding box containing the '3' object.

**Input_2:**

* **Objects:** Two distinct objects formed by the digits '8' and '6' respectively.
* **Transformation:**  The digit '4' is placed at the bottom left and bottom right corners of the bounding boxes containing the '8' object and the '6' object respectively. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_object(obj):
    bottom_row = lowermost(obj)
    leftmost_col = leftmost(obj)
    rightmost_col = rightmost(obj)
    return {(4, (bottom_row, leftmost_col)), (4, (bottom_row, rightmost_col))}
  
  return paint(I, merge(apply(process_object, objects(I, T, T, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Identifies all distinct objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`apply(process_object, ...)`:** Applies the `process_object` function to each object.
3. **`process_object(obj)`:** For each object `obj`, it finds the row index of the bottom row, and the column indices of the leftmost and rightmost cells. It returns a set containing two tuples, representing the leftmost and rightmost bottom corners with value '4'. 
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the sets of corner cells from all objects into a single set.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the digit '4' onto the input grid `I` at the locations specified by the merged set of corner cells.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def bottom_corners(obj):
    return {(4, (lowermost(obj), j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if i == lowermost(obj)}

  return paint(I, merge(apply(bottom_corners, objects(I, T, T, T)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **`apply(bottom_corners, ...)`:** Applies the function `bottom_corners` to each object.
3. **`bottom_corners(obj)`:**  Returns a set of tuples, where each tuple represents a bottom corner cell of the object `obj` with the value '4'.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges all corner cell sets into one.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints '4' at the identified corner cells on the input grid `I`.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: {(4, (lowermost(obj), min(j for _, (i, j) in obj if i == lowermost(obj)))), (4, (lowermost(obj), max(j for _, (i, j) in obj if i == lowermost(obj))))}, objects(I, T, T, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Finds all objects in the grid.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: ..., ...)`:** Applies a lambda function to each object.
3. **`lambda obj: ...`:** This function takes an object `obj`, finds the bottom row index (`lowermost(obj)`), and iterates through its cells to find the minimum and maximum column indices of the bottom cells.  It constructs a set containing two tuples representing the bottom left and bottom right corners with the value '4'.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the corner sets from all objects.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints '4' at the identified corner positions on the input grid `I`.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_obj(obj):
    bottom_row = lowermost(obj)
    left_col = min(j for _, (i, j) in obj if i == bottom_row)
    right_col = max(j for _, (i, j) in obj if i == bottom_row)
    return {(4, (bottom_row, left_col)), (4, (bottom_row, right_col))}
  
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  corner_cells = merge(apply(process_obj, objs))
  return paint(I, corner_cells)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Identifies all objects.
2. **`apply(process_obj, objs)`:** Applies the `process_obj` function to each object.
3. **`process_obj(obj)`:**  Finds the bottom row index, and iterates through the object's cells to find the min/max column indices on the bottom row, returning them as corner cells with value '4'.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Combines the corner cell sets.
5. **`paint(I, corner_cells)`:**  Paints '4' at the determined corner locations.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
    corner_cells = set()
    for obj in objs:
        bottom_row = lowermost(obj)
        left_col = min([j for _, (i, j) in obj if i == bottom_row])
        right_col = max([j for _, (i, j) in obj if i == bottom_row])
        corner_cells.update({(4, (bottom_row, left_col)), (4, (bottom_row, right_col))})
    return paint(I, frozenset(corner_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **`corner_cells = set()`:**  Initializes an empty set to store the corner cell locations.
3. **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterates through each identified object.
4. **Inside the loop:**
    - It determines the bottom row index using `lowermost(obj)`.
    - It finds the minimum and maximum column indices (`left_col` and `right_col`) of cells on the bottom row.
    - It adds the identified left and right bottom corners (with value '4') to the `corner_cells` set.
5. **`paint(I, frozenset(corner_cells))`:**  Paints the digit '4' onto the input grid `I` at the identified corner cell locations.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same goal using the DSL. Each version utilizes a different combination of functions or logic while ensuring the same final transformation is applied to the input grid.
