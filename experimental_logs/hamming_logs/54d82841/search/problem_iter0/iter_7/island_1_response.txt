## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify the bottom-most rows of each distinct object (excluding the background) in the input grid. Then, it places markers (using the value '4') at the leftmost and rightmost positions of these bottom rows.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* Two objects are identified: one formed by '6's and another by '0's (considered as foreground because it's not the most frequent).
* The bottom row of the '6's object has markers placed at (3,0) and (3,7).
* The bottom row of the '0's object (which coincides with the grid's bottom) has markers placed at (7,0) and (7,7).

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* One object is identified, formed by '3's.
* The bottom row of this object has markers placed at (4,0) and (4,4).

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* Two objects are identified: one formed by '8's and another by '6's.
* The bottom row of the '8's object has markers placed at (2,0) and (2,7).
* The bottom row of the '6's object has markers placed at (3,0) and (3,7).


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL, each with an explanation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I) # Get objects, excluding background
  bottom_rows = mapply(lambda obj: lowermost(obj), objs) # Get bottom row indices of each object
  target_indices = mpapply(lambda row: {(row, 0), (row, len(I[0]) - 1)}, bottom_rows) # Get leftmost and rightmost indices for each bottom row
  O = fill(I, 4, target_indices) # Fill those indices with '4'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:**  Identifies all distinct objects in the grid except for the background.
2. **`bottom_rows = mapply(lambda obj: lowermost(obj), objs)`:**  Finds the bottom row index (y-coordinate) for each object.
3. **`target_indices = mpapply(lambda row: {(row, 0), (row, len(I[0]) - 1)}, bottom_rows)`:** For each bottom row, constructs a set containing the indices of the leftmost (row, 0) and rightmost (row, last_column) positions.
4. **`O = fill(I, 4, target_indices)`:** Fills the identified target indices in the input grid with the value '4' to mark them.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True) # Get objects, excluding background
  bottom_edges = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda ind: ind[0] == lowermost(obj)), objs) # Get bottom edge indices of each object
  target_cells = mapply(lambda edge: {extract(edge, lambda ind: ind[1] == leftmost(edge)), extract(edge, lambda ind: ind[1] == rightmost(edge))}, bottom_edges) # Find leftmost and rightmost indices of each edge
  O = fill(I, 4, target_cells) # Fill those indices with '4'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, False, False, True)`:**  Extracts all objects from the grid, excluding the background.
2. **`bottom_edges = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda ind: ind[0] == lowermost(obj)), objs)`:**  For each object, it identifies the indices of its bottom edge (cells with the lowest row index within the object).
3. **`target_cells = mapply(lambda edge: {extract(edge, lambda ind: ind[1] == leftmost(edge)), extract(edge, lambda ind: ind[1] == rightmost(edge))}, bottom_edges)`:**  From each bottom edge, it finds the leftmost and rightmost index based on their column positions.
4. **`O = fill(I, 4, target_cells)`:**  The identified leftmost and rightmost indices are filled with the marker value '4'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    target_cells = mpapply(lambda obj: {(lowermost(obj), leftmost(obj)), (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj))}, objs)
    O = fill(I, 4, target_cells)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:**  Extracts all objects from the grid, excluding the background.
2. **`target_cells = mpapply(lambda obj: {(lowermost(obj), leftmost(obj)), (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj))}, objs)`:**  Directly calculates the leftmost and rightmost indices of the bottom row for each object using `lowermost`, `leftmost`, and `rightmost` functions.
3. **`O = fill(I, 4, target_cells)`:**  Fills the identified indices with the marker value '4'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  modified_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(4, {(lowermost(obj), leftmost(obj)), (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj))}), objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(modified_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:** Extracts all objects from the grid, excluding the background.
2. **`modified_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(4, {(lowermost(obj), leftmost(obj)), (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj))}), objs)`:**  Creates new objects where only the leftmost and rightmost positions on the bottom row are colored with '4'.
3. **`O = paint(I, merge(modified_objs))`:**  Merges the modified objects and paints them onto a copy of the input grid, resulting in the desired output.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  edges = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda ind: ind[0] == lowermost(obj) or ind[1] == leftmost(obj) or ind[1] == rightmost(obj)), objs)
  corners = mapply(lambda edge: {extract(edge, lambda ind: ind[1] == leftmost(edge)), extract(edge, lambda ind: ind[1] == rightmost(edge))}, edges)
  O = fill(I, 4, corners)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:** Extracts all objects from the grid, excluding the background.
2. **`edges = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda ind: ind[0] == lowermost(obj) or ind[1] == leftmost(obj) or ind[1] == rightmost(obj)), objs)`:** Identifies all edge indices of each object, including the bottom, leftmost and rightmost edges.
3. **`corners = mapply(lambda edge: {extract(edge, lambda ind: ind[1] == leftmost(edge)), extract(edge, lambda ind: ind[1] == rightmost(edge))}, edges)`:** Extracts the leftmost and rightmost indices from the combined edges, which will be the corners of the bottom row.
4. **`O = fill(I, 4, corners)`:** Fills the identified corner indices with the marker value '4'.


These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation using various combinations of DSL functions. This demonstrates the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for solving spatial reasoning tasks.
