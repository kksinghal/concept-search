## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently applies a horizontal mirroring to the input grid, effectively reversing the order of elements within each row. 

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The digits in each row are reversed: 
    * `6 6 6 2` becomes `2 6 6 6`
    * `6 1 6 2` becomes `2 6 1 6` 
    * and so on.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

*  Same as above, each row is mirrored horizontally. For example, the first row `7 7 7 6 6 6 2` transforms to `2 6 6 6 7 7 7`.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

*  The horizontal mirroring pattern remains consistent. The row `1 2 7 1 1 1` transforms to `1 1 1 7 2 1`.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the horizontal mirroring transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_9f236235(I):
    O = hmirror(I)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version directly utilizes the `hmirror` function from the DSL, which performs the horizontal mirroring operation on the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_9f236235(I):
    O = tuple(tuple(row[::-1]) for row in I)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version iterates through each row (`row`) of the input grid `I`. 
* For each `row`, it uses Python's list slicing `[::-1]` to reverse the order of elements, effectively mirroring it.
* Finally, it constructs the output grid `O` using the mirrored rows.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_9f236235(I):
    O = rot180(vmirror(I))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version leverages the `vmirror` and `rot180` functions.
* First, it applies a vertical mirroring using `vmirror` on the input grid `I`.
* Then, it applies a 180-degree rotation using `rot180` to the vertically mirrored grid. The combined effect results in a horizontal mirroring.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_9f236235(I):
    O = tuple(tuple(row[j] for j in range(len(row)-1, -1, -1)) for row in I)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version iterates through each row of the input grid and reverses the elements of each row by iterating through the row indices in reverse order.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_9f236235(I):
    O = tuple(tuple(reversed(row)) for row in I)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version utilizes Python's built-in `reversed` function to reverse each row of the input grid, achieving horizontal mirroring.
