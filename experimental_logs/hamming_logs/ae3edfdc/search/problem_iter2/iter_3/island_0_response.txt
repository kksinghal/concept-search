## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to center specific color objects in the grid while preserving the relative positions of other objects. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
- The object with color '3' is centered horizontally at column 3.
- The object with color '7' is centered horizontally at column 11.
- All other objects remain in their original positions.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- The object with color '3' is centered horizontally at column 11.
- The object with color '7' is centered horizontally at column 3.
- All other objects remain in their original positions.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
- The object with color '3' is centered horizontally at column 7.
- The object with color '7' is centered horizontally at column 7.
- All other objects remain in their original positions.

**Overall Logic:**

The transformation identifies objects of specific colors (3 and 7) and centers them horizontally at designated columns (3, 7, or 11). The centering is done based on the object's center of mass.  

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program in the given DSL:

### Program Version 1:

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  moved_objs = frozenset(
      shift(obj, (0, 3 - centerofmass(obj)[1])) if color(obj) == 3 else
      shift(obj, (0, 11 - centerofmass(obj)[1])) if color(obj) == 7 else
      obj
      for obj in objs
  )
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(moved_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, False)` identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Center Objects:**  
   - `shift(obj, (0, 3 - centerofmass(obj)[1])) if color(obj) == 3` centers objects of color '3' at column 3.
   - `shift(obj, (0, 11 - centerofmass(obj)[1])) if color(obj) == 7` centers objects of color '7' at column 11.
   - Other objects are left unchanged (`else obj`).
3. **Paint Objects:** `paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(moved_objs))` creates a blank canvas of the input's shape and paints the moved objects onto it.

### Program Version 2:

```python
def program(I):
  return paint(
      paint(
          canvas(0, shape(I)),
          shift(extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3), (0, 3 - centerofmass(extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3))[1]))
      ),
      shift(extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 7), (0, 11 - centerofmass(extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 7))[1]))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** `canvas(0, shape(I))` generates a blank canvas of the input's size.
2. **Extract and Center Objects:**
   - `extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)` finds the object with color '3'. 
   - `shift(..., (0, 3 - centerofmass(...)[1]))` centers it at column 3.
   - Similar logic is applied to center the object with color '7' at column 11.
3. **Paint Objects:** The centered objects are painted onto the canvas sequentially. 

### Program Version 3:

```python
def program(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)), 
      merge((
          shift(obj, (0, 3 - centerofmass(obj)[1])) if color(obj) == 3 else 
          shift(obj, (0, 11 - centerofmass(obj)[1])) if color(obj) == 7 else 
          frozenset() for obj in objects(I, True, False, False)
      ))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a slightly different approach to combine centering logic:

1. **Canvas and Objects:** It creates a blank canvas and identifies objects as in previous versions.
2. **Conditional Shifting:** 
   - The `for` loop iterates through each object.
   - It applies conditional shifting based on color, similar to Version 2.
   - If the object's color is neither 3 nor 7, it returns an empty set (`frozenset()`) to avoid painting it.
3. **Merge and Paint:**  All shifted objects (and empty sets) are merged and painted onto the canvas.

### Program Version 4:

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  obj3 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
  obj7 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 7)
  return paint(
      paint(
          canvas(0, shape(I)),
          shift(obj3, (0, 3 - centerofmass(obj3)[1]))
      ),
      shift(obj7, (0, 11 - centerofmass(obj7)[1]))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version separates object extraction and centering for clarity:

1. **Object Extraction:**  It first extracts objects with color '3' and '7' and stores them in `obj3` and `obj7` respectively.
2. **Centering:** It centers each extracted object at its designated column (3 for color '3', 11 for color '7').
3. **Painting:** The centered objects are painted onto the blank canvas.

### Program Version 5:

```python
def program(I):
  def center_object(obj, target_column):
    return shift(obj, (0, target_column - centerofmass(obj)[1]))

  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      merge((
          center_object(obj, 3) if color(obj) == 3 else
          center_object(obj, 11) if color(obj) == 7 else 
          frozenset() for obj in objs
      ))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version introduces a helper function for code reusability:

1. **`center_object` Function:**  This function encapsulates the logic for centering an object at a specific column.
2. **Object Processing:** It identifies objects and then iterates through them.
3. **Conditional Centering:**  
   - It uses the `center_object` function to center objects of color '3' at column 3 and objects of color '7' at column 11. 
   - Other objects are ignored by returning an empty set.
4. **Paint Objects:**  The centered objects are merged and painted onto a blank canvas. 

These are five distinct code versions that achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL. They demonstrate different approaches to object identification, centering, and painting, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL and offering varied solutions to the problem.
