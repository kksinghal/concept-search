## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected areas) of specific colors and moving them to new locations. The target locations and movement patterns appear to be consistent across the examples.

**Input_0:**

* The object of color '7' at the center moves 2 cells up and expands to a '7 1 7' pattern horizontally.
* A new object '3 2 3' appears 4 cells above the initial '7' position.

**Input_1:**

* The object of color '7' at the center moves 2 cells up and expands to a '7 1 7' pattern horizontally.
* A new object '3 2' appears 4 cells down from the initial '7' position.

**Input_2:**

* The object of color '3' at the center moves 5 cells up and expands to a vertical '3 2 3' pattern.
* The object of color '7' moves 3 cells to the right and expands to a '7 1' pattern horizontally.


## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  for obj in objs:
    value = color(obj)
    if value == SEVEN:
      O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), shift(recolor(value, obj), (-2, 0)))
      O = paint(O, {(ONE, add(centerofmass(obj), (0, 1)))})
    elif value == THREE:
      if size(obj) == 1:
        O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), shift(recolor(value, obj), (4, 0)))
        O = paint(O, {(TWO, add(centerofmass(obj), (1, 1)))})
      else:
        O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), shift(recolor(value, obj), (5, 0)))
        O = paint(O, {(TWO, add(centerofmass(obj), (1, 0)))})
    else:
      O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), shift(recolor(value, obj), (0, 3)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identifies objects in the input grid.
2. Iterates through each object:
    * If the object's color is '7':
        * Moves the object 2 cells up.
        * Paints a '1' at the center-right of the moved object.
    * If the object's color is '3':
        * If the object is a single cell:
            * Moves the object 4 cells up.
            * Paints a '2' one cell down and one cell right from the moved object's center.
        * If the object is not a single cell:
            * Moves the object 5 cells up.
            * Paints a '2' one cell down from the moved object's center.
    * If the object's color is not '7' or '3':
        * Moves the object 3 cells to the right.
3. Returns the transformed grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  sevens = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), SEVEN)
  threes = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), THREE)
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for seven in sevens:
    O = paint(O, shift(seven, (-2, 0)))
    O = paint(O, {(ONE, add(centerofmass(seven), (0, 1)))})
  for three in threes:
    if size(three) == ONE:
      O = paint(O, shift(three, (4, 0)))
      O = paint(O, {(TWO, add(centerofmass(three), (1, 1)))})
    else:
      O = paint(O, shift(three, (5, 0)))
      O = paint(O, {(TWO, add(centerofmass(three), (1, 0)))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Filters objects by color '7' and '3'.
2. Initializes an empty canvas.
3. For each '7' object:
    * Moves the object 2 cells up.
    * Paints a '1' at the center-right of the moved object.
4. For each '3' object:
    * Applies the same logic as in version 1 based on object size.
5. Returns the transformed grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == SEVEN:
      O = move(O, obj, (-2, 0))
      O = paint(O, {(ONE, add(centerofmass(toindices(obj)), (0, 1)))})
    elif color(obj) == THREE:
      O = move(O, obj, (4, 0) if size(obj) == ONE else (5, 0))
      O = paint(O, {(TWO, add(centerofmass(toindices(obj)), (1, 1) if size(obj) == ONE else (1, 0)))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identifies objects in the input grid.
2. Iterates through each object:
    * If the object's color is '7':
        * Moves the object 2 cells up using the `move` function.
        * Paints a '1' at the center-right of the moved object.
    * If the object's color is '3':
        * Moves the object 4 cells up if it's a single cell, otherwise 5 cells up.
        * Paints a '2' based on the object size, similar to previous versions.
3. Returns the transformed grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    c = color(obj)
    center_obj = centerofmass(toindices(obj))
    if c == SEVEN:
      O = paint(O, shift(recolor(c, obj), (-2, 0)))
      O = paint(O, {(ONE, (center_obj[0], center_obj[1] + 1))})
    elif c == THREE:
      offset = (4, 0) if size(obj) == 1 else (5, 0)
      O = paint(O, shift(recolor(c, obj), offset))
      O = paint(O, {(TWO, (center_obj[0] + offset[0] - 4, center_obj[1] + offset[1] + 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identifies objects and initializes an empty canvas.
2. Iterates through each object, storing color and center.
3. For objects of color '7':
    * Paints the object 2 cells up.
    * Paints '1' one cell right of the object's center.
4. For objects of color '3':
    * Calculates the movement offset based on size.
    * Paints the object at the offset location.
    * Calculates the '2' position relative to the moved object's center.
5. Returns the transformed grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), shift(recolor(SEVEN, extract(objects(I, T, F, T), matcher(color, SEVEN))), (-2, 0)))
  O = paint(O, {(ONE, add(centerofmass(extract(objects(I, T, F, T), matcher(color, SEVEN))), (0, 1)))})
  three = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), matcher(color, THREE))
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(THREE, three), (4, 0) if size(three) == ONE else (5, 0)))
  O = paint(O, {(TWO, add(centerofmass(three), (1, 1) if size(three) == ONE else (1, 0)))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Extracts the objects of color '7' and '3' directly.
2. Paints the '7' object 2 cells up and adds a '1' to its right.
3. Paints the '3' object according to its size, similar to previous versions.
4. Returns the transformed grid.

This version directly manipulates the extracted objects instead of iterating, offering a different approach to the problem.
