## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of color '3' and '7', relocating them to specific positions, and augmenting them with a '2' colored cell. 

**Here's a breakdown:**

* **Object Identification:** The code first identifies all unique objects in the input grid. 
* **Color Filtering:** It then filters out objects with colors '3' and '7' for separate processing.
* **Target Positioning:**  The target position for each object is determined based on its color:
    * '3' objects are moved one row above the center of the grid.
    * '7' objects are moved to the center row of the grid. 
    Both are horizontally centered, with a one-cell shift to the right.
* **Augmentation:** Each object is augmented by placing a '2' colored cell immediately to the right of its center of mass.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  def transform(obj):
    v = color(obj)
    target_i = height(I) // 2 - (1 if v == 3 else 0)  # Determine target row based on color
    shifted = shift(obj, (target_i - uppermost(obj), width(I) // 2 - leftmost(obj)))  # Shift object
    return paint(shifted, {(2, (centerofmass(shifted)[0], centerofmass(shifted)[1] + 1))})  # Augment
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), mapply(transform, objs))  # Paint on canvas
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objs = objects(I, True, False, False)` extracts all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Define Transformation:** The `transform` function encapsulates the logic for shifting and augmenting an object. It determines the target row based on the object's color and shifts the object accordingly. It then adds a '2' colored cell to the right of the object's center of mass.
3. **Apply Transformation:**  `mapply(transform, objs)` applies the `transform` function to each object in `objs`.
4. **Paint on Canvas:**  The final output grid is created by painting the transformed objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for v in (3, 7):
    for obj in colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), v):
      target_i = height(I) // 2 - (1 if v == 3 else 0)
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (target_i - uppermost(obj), width(I) // 2 - leftmost(obj))))
      O = paint(O, {(2, (target_i, centerofmass(obj)[1] + 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates a blank canvas `O` with the same dimensions as input `I`.
2. **Iterate through Colors:** Loops through colors '3' and '7' for targeted processing.
3. **Process Objects by Color:** For each color, it extracts objects of that color, calculates the target row, shifts the object, and paints it onto the canvas.
4. **Augment with '2':** After placing the shifted object, it calculates the position for the augmenting '2' cell and paints it directly on the canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    v = color(obj)
    if v in (3, 7):
      center_j = centerofmass(obj)[1]
      target_i = height(I) // 2 - (1 if v == 3 else 0)
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (target_i - uppermost(obj), width(I) // 2 - 1 - leftmost(obj))))
      O = paint(O, {(2, (target_i, center_j + 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:**  A blank canvas `O` is created, matching the dimensions of the input grid.
2. **Iterate Through Objects:** Loops through all extracted objects from the input grid.
3. **Filter by Color:**  Checks if the object's color is either '3' or '7'. 
4. **Calculate & Paint:** For matching objects, it determines the target row and shifts the object to the center horizontally. Then, it paints the shifted object onto the canvas. 
5. **Augmentation:**  The position for the '2' cell is calculated based on the object's center of mass, and it is painted to the right of the object. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    canvas(0, shape(I)),
    mapply(
      lambda obj: paint(
        shift(obj, subtract((height(I) // 2 - (1 if color(obj) == 3 else 0), width(I) // 2 - 1), ulcorner(obj))),
        {(2, add(centerofmass(obj), (0, 1)))}
      ),
      objects(I, True, False, False)
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Functional Approach:** This version adopts a more functional approach using nested functions and `mapply` for concise code.
2. **Shift and Augment:**  The lambda function shifts the object to the target position and then adds the augmenting '2' cell in one step using `paint` and `add`.
3. **Paint on Canvas:** The `mapply` function applies this transformation to all objects extracted from the input grid.  Finally, everything is painted onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def process_object(obj):
        target_pos = (height(I) // 2 - 1, width(I) // 2 - 1) if color(obj) == 3 else (height(I) // 2, width(I) // 2 - 1)
        shifted_obj = shift(obj, subtract(target_pos, ulcorner(obj)))
        return paint(shifted_obj, {(2, (centerofmass(shifted_obj)[0], centerofmass(shifted_obj)[1] + 1))})
    
    return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), mapply(process_object, objects(I, True, False, False)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Processing:**  The `process_object` function handles the transformation logic for each individual object. 
2. **Target Calculation:**  It calculates the target position for the object based on its color ('3' or '7').
3. **Shifting:** It then shifts the object to its designated location.
4. **Augmentation:** After shifting, it adds the augmenting '2' cell to the right of the shifted object's center.
5. **Final Output:** Finally, it paints all the processed objects onto a blank canvas to generate the output.
