## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves centering non-background objects horizontally in the grid while maintaining their relative vertical positions. 

**Input_0:** The "3" objects are centered horizontally, and the "7" and "1" objects maintain their vertical positions but are also moved to the center horizontally.

**Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the "7" objects are centered, while the "1", "3", and "2" objects retain their vertical positions but are centered horizontally.

**Input_2:** The transformation centers the "7 1" pair and the "2 3 3" group horizontally while preserving their vertical arrangement.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    I,
    merge(
      shift(
        obj, 
        (0,  (width(I) // 2) - (leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2))
      ) 
      for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Extracts all non-background objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in ...`:** Iterates through each extracted object.
3. **`(width(I) // 2) - (leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2)`:** Calculates the horizontal shift required to center the object.
4. **`shift(obj, (0, ...))`:** Shifts the object horizontally by the calculated amount.
5. **`merge(...)`:** Combines all the shifted objects.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the merged, shifted objects back onto the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      I,
      merge(
          {(v, (i, (width(I) // 2) - (width(obj) // 2) + (j - leftmost(obj))))
            for v, (i, j) in obj}
          for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version achieves the same outcome as Version 1 but with a different approach. Instead of using `shift`, it directly calculates the new coordinates for each cell within the object to center it.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    cover(I, merge(objects(I, True, False, True))),
    merge(
        shift(obj, (0, (width(I) // 2) - centerofmass(obj)[1]))
        for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version first covers all non-background objects in the input grid and then paints the shifted objects back. It uses `centerofmass` to determine the horizontal center of each object for shifting.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  return paint(
    I,
    merge(
      shift(
        obj, 
        (0,  (width(I) // 2) - center(obj)[1])
      ) 
      for obj in objs
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version first extracts all non-background objects and stores them in the `objs` variable. Then, it uses `center` function to find the horizontal center of each object for shifting and finally paints them back onto the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    I,
    merge(
        {(v, (i, j + ((width(I) - width(obj)) // 2) - leftmost(obj)))
          for v, (i, j) in obj}
        for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)
    )
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

Similar to Version 2, this version calculates the new coordinates for each cell within the object directly. It leverages the relationship between the grid width, object width, and leftmost object position to achieve the centering.

**Note:** All five program versions are designed to achieve the desired transformation with distinct logic and DSL function combinations. They highlight the flexibility and power of the provided DSL in achieving the task.
