## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by connected digits of the same value (excluding the background color, which is 0) and then mirroring them horizontally if their height is greater than their width.

* **Input_0:** The objects with values 3 and 7 are mirrored horizontally since their heights are greater than their widths. 
* **Input_1:** Only the object with value 7 is mirrored.
* **Input_2:** The objects with values 3 and 7 are mirrored.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve_855e0971(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, branch(portrait(obj), hmirror, identity)(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, True, False, True)`:**  Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`, considering only directly adjacent cells and excluding the background color.
2. **`O = canvas(0, shape(I))`:**  Creates an empty output grid `O` of the same size as the input grid.
3. **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterates through each identified object.
4. **`O = paint(O, branch(portrait(obj), hmirror, identity)(obj))`:** 
    * **`portrait(obj)`:** Checks if the object's height is greater than its width.
    * **`branch(portrait(obj), hmirror, identity)(obj)`:** If the object is taller than wide, apply `hmirror` to mirror it horizontally; otherwise, keep the object as is using the `identity` function.
    * **`paint(O, ...)`:** Paints the transformed object onto the output grid `O`.
5. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed output grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve_855e0971(I):
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), 
               merge(apply(lambda obj: branch(portrait(obj), hmirror, identity)(obj), 
                           objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version compresses the logic into a single line using function composition:

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Identifies objects, excluding the background.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: branch(portrait(obj), hmirror, identity)(obj), ...)`:** Applies a lambda function to each object, mirroring it horizontally if it's taller than wide.
3. **`merge(...)`:** Combines all transformed objects into a single object set.
4. **`paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), ...)`:** Creates an empty canvas and paints the transformed objects onto it.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve_855e0971(I):
    O = I
    for v in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
        obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, v))
        O = paint(cover(O, obj), branch(portrait(obj), hmirror, identity)(obj))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through colors instead of objects:

1. **`for v in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:`:** Iterates over each color in the input grid, excluding the background color.
2. **`obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, v))`:** Extracts the object corresponding to the current color.
3. **`O = paint(cover(O, obj), branch(portrait(obj), hmirror, identity)(obj))`:** 
    * Removes the original object from the grid.
    * Mirrors the object horizontally if it's taller than wide.
    * Paints the transformed object back onto the grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve_855e0971(I):
    return branch(size(sfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), 
                          lambda obj: portrait(obj))) > 0, 
                   lambda x: paint(canvas(0, shape(x)), 
                                 merge(apply(lambda obj: branch(portrait(obj), hmirror, identity)(obj), 
                                             objects(x, True, False, True)))), 
                   identity)(I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses branching to check if any mirroring is needed before proceeding:

1. **`size(sfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: portrait(obj))) > 0`:** 
    * Checks if there are any objects taller than wide. 
2. **`branch(..., lambda x: ..., identity)(I)`:**
    * If there are objects to mirror, it applies the transformation logic (similar to version 2).
    * Otherwise, it returns the input grid as is using the `identity` function.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve_855e0971(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
        if portrait(obj):
            O = paint(cover(O, obj), hmirror(obj))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version simplifies the logic by directly mirroring objects without using the `branch` function:

1. **`for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):`:** Iterates over each object, excluding the background.
2. **`if portrait(obj):`:** Checks if the object is taller than wide.
3. **`O = paint(cover(O, obj), hmirror(obj))`:** 
    * Removes the original object.
    * Mirrors the object horizontally.
    * Paints the mirrored object back onto the grid.
