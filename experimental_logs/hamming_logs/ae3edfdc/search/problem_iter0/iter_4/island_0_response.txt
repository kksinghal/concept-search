## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying non-background objects in the input grid and moving them upwards until they "rest" on top of other objects or the top border of the grid. The background color (most common color) remains unchanged. 

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input 0:**
- The '3' objects move upwards until they hit the top border or the '2' object.
- The '7' objects move upwards until they hit the top border or the '1' object. 

**Input 1:**
- The '7' objects move upwards until they hit the top border.
- The '3' and '2' objects remain in their position as there is no object below them. 

**Input 2:**
- The '3' objects move upwards until they hit the top border.
- The '7' object moves upwards until it hits the '1' object. 
- The '2' object moves upwards until it hits the '3' objects. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:


**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)  # Identify non-background objects
  grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create empty canvas
  for obj in objs:
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, (-42, 0))  # Shift object far up
    while not any(index(grid, add(loc, DOWN)) != mostcolor(I) 
                  for v, loc in shifted_obj if 0 <= loc[0] + 1 < height(I)):
      shifted_obj = shift(shifted_obj, DOWN)  # Move down until collision
    grid = paint(grid, shifted_obj)  # Paint the object 
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Identify non-background objects using `fgpartition`.
2. **Create Canvas:** Generate an empty canvas filled with the background color.
3. **Iterate Objects:** Loop through each identified object.
4. **Shift Up:** Shift the object far upwards outside the grid.
5. **Move Down:**  Iteratively move the object down until it collides with another object or the grid's bottom.
6. **Paint Object:** Paint the object at its final position on the canvas.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = sorted(fgpartition(I), key=lambda obj: uppermost(obj))  # Sort by upper row index
  grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create empty canvas
  for obj in objs:
    upper_row = uppermost(obj)
    for i in range(upper_row, -1, -1):  # Iterate upwards from object's top row
      collision = any(index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) 
                      for k, j in toindices(obj) if 0 <= i < height(I) and 0 <= j < width(I))
      if collision:
        grid = paint(grid, shift(obj, (i + 1 - upper_row, 0)))  # Paint if collision
        break
    else:
      grid = paint(grid, shift(obj, (-upper_row, 0)))  # Paint at the top if no collision
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Sort Objects:** Sort objects based on their uppermost row index.
2. **Iterate and Check:** For each object, iterate upwards from its top row, checking for collisions with existing objects on the canvas.
3. **Paint on Collision:** If a collision occurs, paint the object one row below the collision point. 
4. **Paint at Top:** If no collision is detected, paint the object at the top of the canvas. 

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  grid = I  # Start with the input grid
  for i in range(height(I) - 1, 0, -1):  # Iterate through rows from bottom to top
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and index(grid, (i - 1, j)) == mostcolor(I):  # Check for movable object
        temp = index(grid, (i, j))  # Store object color
        grid = fill(grid, mostcolor(I), {(i, j)})  # Remove object from current position
        k = i - 1
        while k > 0 and index(grid, (k - 1, j)) == mostcolor(I):  # Find resting position
          k -= 1
        grid = fill(grid, temp, {(k, j)})  # Place object at resting position
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate from Bottom:**  Iterate through the grid's rows from bottom to top.
2. **Identify Movable Objects:** Identify objects that can move upwards (non-background color above background color).
3. **Find Resting Position:** For each movable object, find the highest empty row above it.
4. **Move Object:** Move the object to its determined resting position.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create empty canvas
  for j in range(width(I)):  # Iterate through columns
    column = [index(I, (i, j)) for i in range(height(I))]  # Extract column data
    non_zeros = [v for v in column if v != mostcolor(I)]  # Filter non-background colors
    offset = height(I) - len(non_zeros)  # Calculate vertical offset
    for i, v in enumerate(non_zeros):  # Place non-background colors
      grid = fill(grid, v, {(i + offset, j)})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate Columns:** Go through each column of the input grid.
2. **Extract and Filter:** Extract column data and filter out the background color.
3. **Calculate Offset:** Determine the vertical offset based on the number of non-background colors.
4. **Fill Canvas:** Place the non-background colors onto the canvas with the calculated offset, effectively moving them upwards.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  grid = list(list(row) for row in I) # Convert to mutable list
  for j in range(width(I)):  # For each column
    for i in range(1, height(I)):  # Iterate from the second row upwards
      if grid[i][j] != mostcolor(I):  # If current cell is not background
        k = i
        while k > 0 and grid[k-1][j] == mostcolor(I): # Find the highest empty row
          k -= 1
        grid[k][j], grid[i][j] = grid[i][j], grid[k][j]  # Swap current object with empty cell
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in grid) # Convert back to tuple
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Convert to List:** Convert the input grid to a mutable list for in-place modifications.
2. **Iterate and Swap:** Iterate through each column from the second row upwards. If a non-background cell is encountered, find the highest empty cell above it and swap their contents.
3. **Convert back to Tuple:** Convert the modified list back to the tuple format for the output grid.


These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing different DSL functions and logic. Each version effectively moves the non-background objects upwards until they encounter an obstacle or reach the top of the grid.
