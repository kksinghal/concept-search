## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves centering each connected object (without considering diagonal connections) horizontally within its row, while maintaining its original height and color.  The background remains unchanged.

**Let's break down the transformation for each example:**

* **Input_0:** The objects with values '3' and '7 1 7' are centered in their respective rows.
* **Input_1:**  The objects '7 1 7' and '3 2' are centered. Note that single-cell objects like the lone '7's remain unchanged.
* **Input_2:**  The object '7 1' is centered in its row, while the objects consisting of single '3's and the single '2' remain in their original positions.

## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    I,
    merge(
      shift(
        obj,
        (0, (width(I) // 2) - (leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2))
      )
      for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Identifies connected objects in the grid (without diagonals) excluding the background.
2. **`for obj in ...`:** Iterates through each identified object.
3. **`(width(I) // 2) - (leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2)`:** Calculates the horizontal shift needed to center the object. 
4. **`shift(obj, (0, ...))`:** Shifts each object horizontally by the calculated amount.
5. **`merge(...)`:** Combines all shifted objects.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the shifted objects onto the original grid, effectively centering them.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(
      I,
      merge(
        {(v, (i, (width(I) // 2) - (width(obj) // 2) + (j - leftmost(obj)))) 
         for v, (i, j) in obj} 
        for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)
      )
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:**  Identifies connected objects in the grid (without diagonals) excluding the background.
2. **`for obj in ...`:** Iterates through each identified object.
3. **`for v, (i, j) in obj`:** Iterates through each cell (value and location) of the object.
4. **`(width(I) // 2) - (width(obj) // 2) + (j - leftmost(obj))`:**  Calculates the new column index for the cell to center the object.
5. **`{(v, (i, ...)) ... }`:** Creates a new object representation with shifted cells.
6. **`merge(...)`:** Combines all shifted objects.
7. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the shifted objects onto the original grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(
      cover(I, merge(objects(I, True, False, True))),
      merge(
          shift(obj, (0, (width(I) // 2) - centerofmass(obj)[1]))
          for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)
      )
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Identifies connected objects in the grid (without diagonals) excluding the background.
2. **`cover(I, merge(...))`:** Removes all identified objects from the original grid.
3. **`for obj in ...`:** Iterates through each identified object.
4. **`(width(I) // 2) - centerofmass(obj)[1]`:** Calculates the horizontal shift needed to center the object based on its center of mass.
5. **`shift(obj, (0, ...))`:** Shifts each object horizontally.
6. **`merge(...)`:** Combines all shifted objects.
7. **`paint(..., ...)`:** Paints the shifted objects onto the cleared grid. 

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  return paint(
    I,
    merge(
      shift(
        obj, 
        (0,  (leftmost(bbox) + width(bbox) // 2) - center(obj)[1])
      ) 
      for obj in objs 
      for bbox in [backdrop(obj)]
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Stores identified objects (without diagonals, excluding background) for efficiency.
2. **`for obj in objs`:** Iterates through each object.
3. **`for bbox in [backdrop(obj)]`:**  Calculates the bounding box for each object on the fly.
4. **`(leftmost(bbox) + width(bbox) // 2) - center(obj)[1]`:** Computes the horizontal shift based on the bounding box's center and the object's center.
5. **`shift(obj, (0, ...))`:**  Shifts the object horizontally.
6. **`merge(...)`:** Combines all shifted objects.
7. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the shifted objects onto the original grid.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    I,
    merge(
        {(v, (i, j + ((width(I) - width(obj)) // 2) - leftmost(obj)))
          for v, (i, j) in obj}
        for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)
    )
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:**  Identifies connected objects (without diagonals) excluding the background.
2. **`for obj in ...`:** Iterates through each object.
3. **`for v, (i, j) in obj`:**  Iterates through each cell (value and location) in the object.
4. **`j + ((width(I) - width(obj)) // 2) - leftmost(obj)`:**  Calculates the new column index for the cell, effectively centering the object.
5. **`{(v, (i, ...)) ... }`:** Creates a new object representation with shifted cells.
6. **`merge(...)`:**  Combines all the shifted objects.
7. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the shifted objects onto the original grid.

These five versions offer diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing different DSL functions and logic, demonstrating the flexibility of the DSL and the potential for varied solutions.
