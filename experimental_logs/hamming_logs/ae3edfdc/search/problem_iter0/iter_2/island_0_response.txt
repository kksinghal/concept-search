## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying non-background objects in the grid and extending them vertically, both upwards and downwards, until they hit another non-background object or the edge of the grid.

**Input_0:**
- The '3' objects are extended downwards until they hit the '2' object.
- The '7' objects are extended upwards and downwards until they hit the edges of the grid.

**Input_1:**
- The '7' objects are extended upwards and downwards until they hit the edges of the grid.
- The '3' objects are extended downwards until they hit the edge of the grid.

**Input_2:**
- The '7' object is extended downwards until it hits the '2' object.
- The '3' objects are extended upwards and downwards until they hit the edges of the grid.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  new_grid = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    upper = uppermost(obj)
    lower = lowermost(obj)
    left = leftmost(obj)
    right = rightmost(obj)
    for i in range(upper, 0, -1):
      if index(I, (i-1, left)) == bg:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, color(obj), {(i-1, j) for j in range(left, right + 1)})
      else:
        break
    for i in range(lower, len(I)):
      if index(I, (i, left)) == bg:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, color(obj), {(i, j) for j in range(left, right + 1)})
      else:
        break
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, obj)
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialization:**
   - `bg`: Stores the background color of the input grid.
   - `objs`: Identifies all non-background objects in the input grid.
   - `new_grid`: Creates an empty grid with the same shape as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each identified object (`obj`) in `objs`.
3. **Vertical Extension:** 
   - For each object, it extends it upwards and downwards:
     - It checks if the cell directly above/below the current object boundary is the background color.
     - If it is, it fills that row with the object's color in `new_grid`.
     - If it encounters a non-background color, it stops extending in that direction.
4. **Object Painting:** Finally, the original object is painted onto the `new_grid`, ensuring the original object shape is preserved.
5. **Return:** The function returns the modified `new_grid`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  new_grid = I
  for obj in objs:
    for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1):
      for i in range(uppermost(obj)-1, -1, -1):
        if index(I, (i, j)) != bg:
          break
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, color(obj), {(i, j)})
      for i in range(lowermost(obj)+1, len(I)):
        if index(I, (i, j)) != bg:
          break
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, color(obj), {(i, j)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialization:**
   - `bg`: Identifies the background color of the grid.
   - `objs`: Identifies all non-background objects.
   - `new_grid`: Initializes the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each object in `objs`.
3. **Column-wise Extension:** For each object, it iterates through its columns.
4. **Vertical Extension:** For each column:
   - It extends upwards from the top of the column until it hits a non-background cell or the grid edge.
   - It extends downwards from the bottom of the column until it hits a non-background cell or the grid edge.
5. **Return:** Returns the modified `new_grid`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  new_grid = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for j in range(len(I[0])):
    for i in range(len(I)):
      if I[i][j] != bg:
        obj_color = I[i][j]
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, obj_color, {(k, j) for k in range(i)})
        break
    for i in range(len(I)-1, -1, -1):
      if I[i][j] != bg:
        obj_color = I[i][j]
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, obj_color, {(k, j) for k in range(i+1, len(I))})
        break
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialization:**
   - `bg`: Stores the background color.
   - `new_grid`: Creates an empty grid filled with the background color.
2. **Column Iteration:** Iterates through each column of the grid.
3. **Vertical Extension:** For each column:
   - It iterates downwards to find the first non-background cell and extends upwards from that point.
   - It iterates upwards to find the first non-background cell and extends downwards from that point.
4. **Return:** Returns the modified `new_grid`.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  new_grid = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), objs.pop())
  for obj in objs:
    obj_indices = toindices(obj)
    for i, j in obj_indices:
      if index(new_grid, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I):
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, color(obj), {(k, j) for k in range(i)})
      if index(new_grid, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I):
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, color(obj), {(k, j) for k in range(i + 1, len(I))})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialization:**
   - `objs`: Identifies all non-background objects.
   - `new_grid`: Initializes the output grid with the background color and paints one object directly to start.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through the remaining objects.
3. **Cell Iteration:** For each cell in the current object:
   - If the corresponding cell in `new_grid` is still the background color, it extends the object upwards and downwards from that cell. 
4. **Return:** Returns the modified `new_grid`.


**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  new_grid = I
  for i in range(len(I[0])):
    current_color = bg
    for j in range(len(I)):
      if I[j][i] != bg:
        current_color = I[j][i]
      if current_color != bg:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, current_color, {(j, i)})
    current_color = bg
    for j in range(len(I)-1, -1, -1):
      if I[j][i] != bg:
        current_color = I[j][i]
      if current_color != bg:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, current_color, {(j, i)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialization:**
   - `bg`: Stores the background color.
   - `new_grid`: Initializes the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. **Column Iteration:** Iterates through each column.
3. **Vertical Extension:** 
   - Iterates downwards, tracking the current non-background color, and filling the column with it. 
   - Iterates upwards, doing the same.
4. **Return:** Returns the modified `new_grid`.


These five program versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the desired grid transformation.  Each leverages different DSL functions and logic while aiming for efficiency and clarity.
