## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation connects specific objects in the input grid horizontally. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Object Selection:** The transformation focuses on objects (connected groups of the same digit) that are not the background color (most frequent color).
2. **Horizontal Connection:**  If an object has another object of the same color directly above or below it, the code draws a horizontal line of that color connecting them. This connection occurs from the leftmost edge of the top object to the rightmost edge of the bottom object.
3. **Background Preservation:** All other cells, including those belonging to unconnected objects, remain unchanged. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)  # Get non-background objects
  new_grid = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), objs.pop()) # Initialize with one object
  for obj1 in objs:
    for obj2 in objs:
      if obj1 != obj2 and color(obj1) == color(obj2) and vmatching(obj1, obj2):
        upper = obj1 if uppermost(obj1) < uppermost(obj2) else obj2
        lower = obj2 if uppermost(obj1) < uppermost(obj2) else obj1
        left_edge = leftmost(upper)
        right_edge = rightmost(lower)
        connection_line = {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(upper), lowermost(lower) + 1) 
                           for j in range(left_edge, right_edge + 1)}
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, recolor(color(obj1), connection_line))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** It identifies all non-background objects (`objs`) and initializes a new grid (`new_grid`) with the background color and one of the objects already painted. 
2. **Object Pair Iteration:** It iterates through each pair of distinct objects (`obj1`, `obj2`) in `objs`.
3. **Connection Check:** For each pair, it checks:
    - If they have the same color (`color(obj1) == color(obj2)`).
    - If they share a column (`vmatching(obj1, obj2)`).
4. **Connection Drawing:** If both conditions are met, it determines the upper and lower objects, calculates the leftmost and rightmost edges of the connection, generates the indices for the connecting line (`connection_line`), and paints this line on the `new_grid`. 
5. **Return:**  Finally, it returns the `new_grid` with the connected objects.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objs:
        for i, row in enumerate(I):
            for j, value in enumerate(row):
                if value == color(obj) and (
                    any(index(I, (k, j)) == color(obj) for k in range(i)) or  # Check above
                    any(index(I, (k, j)) == color(obj) for k in range(i + 1, len(I)))  # Check below
                ):
                    new_grid = fill(new_grid, value, {(l, j) for l in range(len(I))})
    return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1, it identifies non-background objects and creates an empty canvas.
2. **Cell-by-Cell Check:** It iterates through each cell in the input grid (`I`).
3. **Object and Connection Check:** For each cell, it checks:
    - If the cell belongs to an object (`value == color(obj)`).
    - If there is another cell of the same color in the same column above or below (`any(index(I, (k, j)) == color(obj) for k in range(i))` for above and a similar condition for below).
4. **Vertical Line Drawing:** If both conditions are true, it draws a vertical line of that color spanning the entire height of the grid, effectively connecting the objects.
5. **Return:** It returns the modified `new_grid`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    indices = toindices(obj)
    min_row = min(i for i, j in indices)
    max_row = max(i for i, j in indices)
    for i in range(min_row, max_row + 1):
      if any((i, j) in indices for j in range(len(I[0]))):
        grid = fill(grid, color(obj), {(k, j) for k in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0])) if (i, j) in indices})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates a canvas with the background color.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each non-background object.
3. **Bounding Box:** Finds the minimum and maximum row indices of the object.
4. **Row-wise Connection:** For each row within the object's bounding box:
   - Checks if the row intersects the object.
   - If it does, it paints a horizontal line across the entire grid at that row with the object's color.
5. **Return:** Returns the grid with connected objects.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    min_j = leftmost(obj)
    max_j = rightmost(obj)
    for j in range(min_j, max_j + 1):
      if any((i, j) in toindices(obj) for i in range(len(I))):
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, color(obj), {(i, j) for i in range(len(I))})
  return new_grid 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates a canvas filled with the background color.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each non-background object.
3. **Column-wise Connection:** For each column within the object's bounding box:
   - Checks if the column intersects the object.
   - If it does, it paints a vertical line across the entire grid at that column with the object's color.
4. **Return:** Returns the grid with connected objects.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  new_grid = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), objs.pop())
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(len(I)):
      if any((i, j) in toindices(obj) for j in range(len(I[0]))):
        leftmost_j = next((j for j in range(len(I[0])) if (i, j) in toindices(obj)), None)
        if leftmost_j is not None:
          new_grid = fill(new_grid, color(obj), {(i, j) for j in range(leftmost_j, len(I[0]))})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Initializes the grid by painting one object onto a blank canvas.
2. **Object and Row Iteration:** Iterates through each remaining object and each row of the grid.
3. **Leftmost Point and Filling:**  For each row intersecting an object:
    - It finds the leftmost point of the object on that row.
    - It fills the row from that leftmost point to the right edge of the grid with the object's color.
4. **Return:** Returns the modified grid.
