## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as **horizontally centering each connected component** while maintaining its original shape and color. 

Let's break it down:

* **Connected Components:** Each digit represents a different color. Cells with the same digit that are connected horizontally or vertically form a connected component (or "object").
* **Centering:**  Each connected component is moved horizontally so that its center aligns with the center of its row in the output grid. 
* **Preservation:** The shape, color, and relative vertical position of each connected component remain unchanged.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" in the provided DSL, each with an explanation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, width(O) // 2 - center(toindices(obj))[1])))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** `O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))` creates an empty canvas `O` with the same dimensions as the input grid `I`, filled with the most common color in `I` (presumably the background).
2. **Iterate through Objects:** `for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):` iterates over each connected component (object) in the input grid `I`. `objects(I, T, T, T)` extracts all connected components from `I`.
3. **Calculate Horizontal Shift:**  `width(O) // 2 - center(toindices(obj))[1]` calculates the horizontal shift required to center the object. `width(O) // 2` gives the center column of the grid, and `center(toindices(obj))[1]` gives the center column of the object.
4. **Shift and Paint:** `O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, shift_amount)))` shifts the object horizontally by `shift_amount` and paints it onto the canvas `O`. 
5. **Return Output:** Finally, the program returns the modified canvas `O` as the output.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)),
      merge({shift(obj, (0, width(I) // 2 - leftmost(obj) - width(obj) // 2)) for obj in objects(I, T, T, T)})
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Similar to Version 1, an empty canvas is created.
2. **Calculate Shifts and Shift Objects:** This version directly calculates the shifts for all objects within a set comprehension and applies the shifts using `shift(obj, (0, shift_amount))`.
3. **Merge Shifted Objects:** The `merge()` function combines all the shifted objects into a single set.
4. **Paint and Return:** Finally, all shifted objects are painted onto the canvas in one go, and the modified canvas is returned.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objs:
        center_obj = center(toindices(obj))
        center_grid_row = (center_obj[0], width(I) // 2)
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, subtract(center_grid_row, center_obj)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Iterate and Calculate Centers:** Iterates through objects and calculates the object's center and the center of its corresponding row in the output grid.
3. **Calculate Shift Vector:** `subtract(center_grid_row, center_obj)` directly calculates the shift vector required to align the two centers.
4. **Shift, Paint, and Return:** Similar to previous versions.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), 
    merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, width(I) // 2 - leftmost(obj) - width(obj) // 2)), objects(I, T, T, T)))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Calculate Shifts and Shift Objects:**  This version uses `apply()` to apply a lambda function to each object in the `objects` set. This lambda function calculates the horizontal shift and shifts the object accordingly.
3. **Merge and Paint:** The `merge()` function combines all the shifted objects, and `paint()` applies them to the canvas.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
    for j in range(width(I)):
        column = {(v, (i, k)) for v, (i, k) in asobject(I) if k == j}
        if column:
            center_col = width(I) // 2
            shift_amount = (0, center_col - j)
            O = paint(O, shift(column, shift_amount))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Iterate through Columns:**  This version iterates through each column `j` of the input grid.
3. **Extract Column and Calculate Shift:** It extracts all cells in the current column and calculates the horizontal shift needed to center that column.
4. **Shift and Paint:** It shifts the extracted column horizontally and paints it onto the canvas.


These five versions showcase distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
