## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific objects (groups of connected, non-background digits) and repositioning them within the grid. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The '3' objects are moved to form a horizontal line centered around the '2' object.
* The '7' objects are moved to form a horizontal line below the '3' objects, centered around the '1' object.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* The '7' objects are moved to form a horizontal line centered around the '1' object.
* The '3' objects remain in their relative positions.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* The '7' objects are moved to form a vertical line centered on the '1' object.
* The '3' objects remain in their relative positions.

## Code Generation:

The provided programs offer helpful building blocks for object manipulation, but they lack the logic to selectively move and align them as described. Below are five distinct program versions, each improving upon the concepts from the provided programs to achieve the desired transformation.

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  threes = colorfilter(objs, 3)
  sevens = colorfilter(objs, 7)
  other_objs = difference(objs, threes | sevens)
  target_three = extract(threes, lambda obj: size(obj) == 2)
  target_seven = extract(sevens, lambda obj: size(obj) == 1)
  shifted_threes = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, gravitate(obj, target_three)), threes)
  shifted_sevens = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, gravitate(obj, target_seven)), sevens)
  merged_objs = merge((shifted_threes, shifted_sevens, other_objs))
  O = paint(cover(I, objs), merged_objs)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Extract all objects from the input grid (`objs`).
2. **Filter Objects:** Separate '3' objects (`threes`), '7' objects (`sevens`), and others (`other_objs`).
3. **Find Target Objects:** Locate the '3' object with size 2 (`target_three`) and the '7' object with size 1 (`target_seven`).
4. **Gravitate and Shift:** Move each '3' and '7' object towards their respective target objects using `gravitate` and `shift`.
5. **Merge and Paint:** Combine all shifted objects, cover the original objects in the input grid, and paint the shifted objects onto the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  threes = colorfilter(objs, 3)
  sevens = colorfilter(objs, 7)
  other_objs = difference(objs, threes | sevens)
  center_three = centerofmass(merge(threes))
  center_seven = centerofmass(merge(sevens))
  shifted_threes = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, subtract(center_three, centerofmass(obj))), threes)
  shifted_sevens = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, subtract(center_seven, centerofmass(obj))), sevens)
  merged_objs = merge((shifted_threes, shifted_sevens, other_objs))
  O = paint(cover(I, objs), merged_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Filter:** Similar to Version 1, extract and categorize objects.
2. **Calculate Center of Mass:** Determine the center of mass for all '3' objects combined and all '7' objects combined.
3. **Align to Center:** Shift each '3' and '7' object so their center of mass aligns with the calculated centers.
4. **Merge and Paint:** Similar to Version 1, combine, cover, and paint the final objects.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  threes = colorfilter(objs, 3)
  sevens = colorfilter(objs, 7)
  target_three = extract(threes, lambda obj: size(obj) == 2)
  target_seven = extract(sevens, lambda obj: size(obj) == 1)
  move_to_three = lambda obj: shift(obj, subtract(ulcorner(target_three), ulcorner(obj)))
  move_to_seven = lambda obj: shift(obj, subtract(ulcorner(target_seven), ulcorner(obj)))
  shifted_threes = apply(move_to_three, threes)
  shifted_sevens = apply(move_to_seven, sevens)
  merged_objs = merge((shifted_threes, shifted_sevens, difference(objs, threes | sevens)))
  O = paint(cover(I, objs), merged_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Filter:**  Similar to previous versions.
2. **Align Upper Left Corners:** Calculate the offset needed to align the upper left corner of each '3' and '7' object with their respective target objects.
3. **Shift and Merge:** Shift objects based on calculated offsets, merge with other objects, and paint onto the covered grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  threes = colorfilter(objs, 3)
  sevens = colorfilter(objs, 7)
  target_three = extract(threes, lambda obj: size(obj) == 2)
  target_seven = extract(sevens, lambda obj: size(obj) == 1)
  threes_pos = position(target_three, target_seven)
  align_threes = lambda obj: shift(obj, multiply(threes_pos, manhattan(obj, target_three)))
  shifted_threes = apply(align_threes, threes)
  sevens_pos = invert(threes_pos)
  align_sevens = lambda obj: shift(obj, multiply(sevens_pos, manhattan(obj, target_seven)))
  shifted_sevens = apply(align_sevens, sevens)
  merged_objs = merge((shifted_threes, shifted_sevens, difference(objs, threes | sevens)))
  O = paint(cover(I, objs), merged_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify, Filter, Targets:** Same as before.
2. **Determine Relative Position:** Calculate the relative position (`position`) between the target '3' and '7' objects. 
3. **Directional Alignment:**  Shift '3' objects based on their Manhattan distance to the target '3', multiplied by the relative position vector. Do the same for '7' objects using the inverted relative position. 
4. **Merge and Paint:** Standard procedure.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  threes = colorfilter(objs, 3)
  sevens = colorfilter(objs, 7)
  target_three = extract(threes, lambda obj: size(obj) == 2)
  target_seven = extract(sevens, lambda obj: size(obj) == 1)
  shifted_threes = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, subtract(center(target_three), center(obj))), threes)
  shifted_sevens = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, subtract(center(target_seven), center(obj))), sevens)
  merged_objs = merge((shifted_threes, shifted_sevens, difference(objs, threes | sevens)))
  O = paint(cover(I, objs), merged_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify, Filter, Targets:** Standard procedure.
2. **Center Alignment:**  Calculate the offset needed to align the center of each '3' and '7' object with the center of their respective target objects.
3. **Shift and Merge:**  Shift objects based on calculated offsets, merge with other objects, and paint onto the covered grid. 


These five versions showcase diverse approaches to achieving the same transformation, leveraging different DSL functions and logic for object manipulation and alignment.
