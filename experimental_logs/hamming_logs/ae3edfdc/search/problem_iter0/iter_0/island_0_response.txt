## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to vertically align all non-zero digits in each column while maintaining their relative order. 

**Let's break down the transformation for each example:**

* **Input_0:** The '3' digits in the first column are moved down to be adjacent, filling the space previously occupied by '0's. Similarly, the '7' digits in the 12th column are shifted down. The '1' in the 12th column remains in its position as it's already at the bottom of the column.

* **Input_1:** The '7' digits in the 4th column are moved down. In the 9th column, the '7' is moved down, followed by the '1' maintaining their original order. The remaining digits are adjusted similarly.

* **Input_2:** In this case, the '3' digits in the 7th column are moved down, followed by the '2' digit.  Other columns are transformed using the same logic.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" to achieve the desired transformation.

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for j in range(w):
    column = [I[i][j] for i in range(h)]
    filtered_column = [v for v in column if v != 0]
    k = h - len(filtered_column)
    for l, v in enumerate(filtered_column):
      O = fill(O, v, {(k + l, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Gets the height (h) and width (w) of the input grid (I) and creates a blank canvas (O) of the same dimensions filled with zeros.
2. **Column-wise Iteration:** Iterates through each column (j) of the input grid.
3. **Column Extraction & Filtering:** Extracts all the values from the current column and filters out the zeros.
4. **Vertical Alignment:** Calculates the starting row (k) for placing the filtered digits by subtracting the number of non-zero digits from the grid height. It then places the filtered digits from the starting row downwards in the output grid.
5. **Output:** Returns the transformed grid (O).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    c = tuple(I[i][j] for i in range(height(I)))
    p = tuple(i for i, v in enumerate(c) if v != 0)
    k = height(I) - len(p)
    for l, i in enumerate(p):
      O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(k+l, j)})
      O = fill(O, 0, {(i, j)})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Initializes the output grid (O) as a copy of the input grid (I).
2. **Column Iteration:** Iterates through each column (j) of the input grid.
3. **Non-Zero Index Extraction:** Extracts the row indices (i) of all non-zero elements in the current column and stores them in the tuple (p).
4. **Digit Shifting:** Calculates the starting row (k) for shifting the digits, similar to Version 1. It then iterates through each non-zero digit's original index (i) in the tuple (p) and its corresponding position (l) in the filtered sequence. For each iteration:
    - It places the digit at its new location (k+l, j) in the output grid.
    - It replaces the digit at its original location (i, j) with a '0'.
5. **Output:** Returns the modified output grid (O).


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    column_objects = sfilter(objects(crop(I, (0, j), (height(I), 1))), lambda obj: color(obj) != 0)
    k = height(I) - len(column_objects)
    for l, obj in enumerate(column_objects):
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (k + l, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas (O) of the same size as the input grid (I), filled with zeros.
2. **Column Iteration:** Iterates through each column (j) of the input grid.
3. **Object Extraction:** Extracts all objects present in the current column using `objects` function and then filters out the objects formed by the background color (0) using `sfilter`.
4. **Object Placement:** Calculates the starting row (k) for placing the objects, similar to previous versions. It then iterates through each object (obj) in the filtered list and places them in the output grid (O) from the starting row (k) downwards, maintaining their order in the original column.
5. **Output:** Returns the final output grid (O).

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for x in range(width(I)):
      c = tuple(index(I, (y, x)) for y in range(height(I)))
      s = size(sfilter(c, matcher(identity, 0)))
      for i in range(height(I)):
          if index(I, (i, x)) != 0:
              O = fill(O, index(I, (i, x)), {(i + s, x)})
              O = fill(O, 0, {(i, x)})
              s -= 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Initializes the output grid (O) as a copy of the input grid (I). 
2. **Column Iteration:** Iterates through each column (x) of the input grid.
3. **Zero Count & Shifting:** For each column:
    - It counts the number of zeros (s) in that column.
    - It then iterates through the column, and for each non-zero digit encountered:
        -  It moves the digit down by 's' positions in the output grid. 
        -  It replaces the digit's original position with a '0'.
        -  It decrements 's' to ensure correct placement of subsequent non-zero digits in the column.
4. **Output:** Returns the modified output grid (O).

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    C = tuple(index(I, (i, j)) for i in range(height(I)))
    P = tuple(i for i, v in enumerate(C) if v != 0)
    for k, i in enumerate(P):
      O = fill(O, C[i], ((height(I) - len(P) + k, j),))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas (O) with the same dimensions as the input grid (I) and fills it with '0'.
2. **Column-wise Processing:** Iterates through each column (j) of the input grid.
3. **Non-zero Element Handling:** For each column:
   -  Extracts the values (C) of the column and stores them in a tuple.
   - Identifies the indices (P) of non-zero elements in the tuple.
   - Iterates through the indices (P) and for each index (i):
     -  Calculates the new row position (height(I) - len(P) + k) for the element, aligning it to the bottom.
     - Fills the corresponding position in the output grid (O) with the non-zero value. 
4. **Output:** Returns the transformed grid (O).



These five versions demonstrate diverse ways to achieve the desired transformation using different DSL function combinations and logic. Each version highlights a different approach to problem-solving within the constraints of the provided DSL.
