## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying connected components (objects) in the input grid and extending them downwards until they hit another object or the edge of the grid. This effectively "fills in" the space below each object with its color.

**Example:**

In Input_0, the '3' at the top center is extended downwards, filling the column until it reaches the '2'. Similarly, the '7's on the right are extended downwards until they hit the bottom edge of the grid.

## Program_to_be_generated:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I) # Partition the grid into objects
  grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create a blank canvas
  for obj in objs:
    for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1):
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), len(I)):  # Iterate downwards from each cell
        if (i, j) in toindices(obj): continue # Skip cells already part of the object
        if index(I, (i,j)) != mostcolor(I): break # Stop if another object is encountered
        grid = paint(grid, {(color(obj), (i, j))}) # Paint the current cell
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:** Partitions the input grid `I` into a set of objects (`objs`) based on their color, excluding the background color.
2. **`grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates an empty grid (`grid`) of the same size as the input grid, filled with the background color.
3. **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterates over each detected object in the input.
4. **`for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1):`:** Iterates over the columns spanned by the current object.
5. **`for i in range(uppermost(obj), len(I)):`:** Iterates downwards from the top of the object to the bottom of the grid.
6. **`if (i, j) in toindices(obj): continue`:** Skips cells that are already part of the current object.
7. **`if index(I, (i,j)) != mostcolor(I): break`:**  Stops extending downwards if it encounters a cell that is not the background color, indicating another object.
8. **`grid = paint(grid, {(color(obj), (i, j))})`:**  Paints the current cell on the `grid` with the color of the current object. 
9. **`return grid`:** Returns the transformed grid.

This program iterates through each object and extends it downwards by painting the blank canvas until it encounters another object or the edge of the grid, achieving the desired transformation.
