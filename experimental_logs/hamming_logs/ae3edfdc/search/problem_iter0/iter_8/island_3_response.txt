## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of specific colors (3 and 7) and moving them vertically to align with either the top or bottom edge of the grid. The remaining objects maintain their positions.

**Input 0:**

* Objects with color '3' are moved upwards to align their top edge with the top edge of the grid.
* Objects with color '7' are moved downwards to align their bottom edge with the bottom edge of the grid.
* Other objects remain in their original positions.

**Input 1:**

* Similar to Input 0, but the object with color '2' remains in its original position.

**Input 2:**

* Same logic as Input 0 and Input 1, with the objects rearranged.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def align(obj, target_row, edge_func):
    return shift(obj, (target_row - edge_func(obj), 0))

  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  threes = colorfilter(objs, 3)
  sevens = colorfilter(objs, 7)
  others = difference(objs, threes | sevens)
  aligned_threes = frozenset(align(obj, 0, uppermost) for obj in threes)
  aligned_sevens = frozenset(align(obj, height(I) - 1, lowermost) for obj in sevens)
  O = paint(cover(I, objs), aligned_threes | aligned_sevens | others)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `align` function:** Takes an object, target row, and edge function as input. It calculates the shift required to align the object's edge (defined by `edge_func`) to the `target_row` and returns the shifted object.
2. **Extract objects:** Get all objects from the input grid `I`.
3. **Filter objects:** Separate objects into three categories: `threes` (color 3), `sevens` (color 7), and `others`.
4. **Align objects:** Align `threes` to the top edge (row 0) and `sevens` to the bottom edge (row `height(I) - 1`) using the `align` function.
5. **Combine and paint:** Combine the aligned objects with the `others` and paint them onto a blank canvas created by covering all objects in the original grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def move_obj(obj):
    return branch(color(obj) == 3, 
                 shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), 0)),
                 branch(color(obj) == 7, 
                        shift(obj, (height(I) - 1 - lowermost(obj), 0)),
                        obj))

  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  moved_objs = frozenset(move_obj(obj) for obj in objs)
  O = paint(cover(I, objs), moved_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `move_obj` function:** Takes an object and applies a conditional shift based on its color. If the color is 3, it aligns the object to the top; if the color is 7, it aligns the object to the bottom; otherwise, it returns the object unchanged.
2. **Extract objects:** Get all objects from the input grid.
3. **Move objects:** Apply the `move_obj` function to each object.
4. **Combine and paint:** Paint the moved objects onto a blank canvas created by covering all objects in the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = paint(cover(I, objects(I, T, F, T)), 
            frozenset(shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), 0)) if color(obj) == 3 
                      else shift(obj, (height(I) - 1 - lowermost(obj), 0)) 
                      if color(obj) == 7 else obj 
                      for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version compresses the logic into a single line using nested conditional expressions within the `paint` function. It iterates through each object and applies the same conditional shifting logic based on color as in Version 2, directly painting them onto the blank canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def align_color(I, color_value, target_row, edge_func):
    return paint(I, 
                 frozenset(shift(obj, (target_row - edge_func(obj), 0)) 
                           for obj in colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), color_value)))

  O = align_color(align_color(I, 3, 0, uppermost), 7, height(I) - 1, lowermost)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `align_color` function:** Takes the grid, color value, target row, and edge function as input. It aligns all objects of the specified color to the target row using the specified edge.
2. **Align objects:** The program first aligns objects of color 3 to the top and then aligns objects of color 7 to the bottom, effectively achieving the desired transformation.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def align_to_edge(objs, target_row, edge_func):
    return frozenset(shift(obj, (target_row - edge_func(obj), 0)) for obj in objs)

  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  aligned_objs = align_to_edge(colorfilter(objs, 3), 0, uppermost) | \
                  align_to_edge(colorfilter(objs, 7), height(I) - 1, lowermost) | \
                  difference(objs, colorfilter(objs, 3) | colorfilter(objs, 7))
  O = paint(cover(I, objs), aligned_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `align_to_edge` function:**  Similar to previous versions, it aligns a set of objects to a specific edge and target row.
2. **Extract and align:** This version extracts objects, aligns objects with colors 3 and 7 separately using the `align_to_edge` function, keeps other objects unchanged, and combines them into `aligned_objs`.
3. **Paint:** Finally, it paints the `aligned_objs` onto a blank canvas.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. They provide diverse solutions using various combinations of DSL functions, loops, and conditional statements.
