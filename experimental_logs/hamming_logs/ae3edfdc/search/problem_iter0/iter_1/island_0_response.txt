## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying non-zero objects in the input grid and stacking them vertically at the bottom of the grid, preserving their relative horizontal positions. The background color (0) fills the remaining space.  Here's a breakdown by input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* **3s:** The two '3' objects are stacked vertically at the bottom, aligned with their original columns. 
* **2:** The '2' object is placed above the '3's, maintaining its horizontal position.
* **7s:** The three '7' objects are stacked similarly, aligned with their original columns.
* **1:**  The '1' object is placed at the top of the '7' stack.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* This input follows the same pattern as Input_0. The non-zero objects (7s, 1, 3s, 2) are stacked vertically at the bottom, preserving their relative horizontal positions.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

*  Again, the same stacking logic applies. Non-zero objects (3s, 7s, 1, 2) are stacked at the bottom, preserving their relative horizontal positions.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = sfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: size(obj) > 0)  # Get non-background objects
    w = width(I)
    O = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Initialize output grid with background color
    y_offset = height(I)  # Start placing from the bottom
    for x in range(w):
        column_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: leftmost(obj) == x) # Get objects in the current column
        for obj in column_objs:
            O = paint(O, shift(obj, (y_offset - height(obj), 0)))
            y_offset -= height(obj)
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Non-Background Objects:**  The code identifies and collects all non-background objects from the input grid.
2. **Initialize Output Grid:** It creates an empty output grid filled with the background color (0).
3. **Iterate Through Columns:**  The program iterates through each column of the input grid.
4. **Stack Objects Vertically:** For each column, it identifies objects belonging to that column and stacks them vertically from the bottom of the output grid, updating the vertical offset accordingly.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    for j in range(width(I)):
        column = crop(I, (0, j), (height(I), 1))
        non_zero_objs = sfilter(objects(column, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) != 0)
        offset = height(I) - sum(height(obj) for obj in non_zero_objs)
        for obj in non_zero_objs:
            O = paint(O, shift(obj, (offset, j)))
            offset += height(obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Create an output grid filled with the background color.
2. **Column-wise Processing:** Iterate through each column of the input.
3. **Identify Non-Zero Objects:** Extract objects from each column, excluding background objects.
4. **Calculate Vertical Offset:** Determine the starting vertical position for stacking by summing the heights of non-zero objects.
5. **Paint Objects:** Place each non-zero object in the output grid at the calculated position, updating the offset for the next object.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (height(I), width(I)))
  for x in range(width(I)):
    column = objects(crop(I, (0, x), (height(I), 1)), True, False, True)
    non_zero_objs = sorted(column, key=lambda obj: uppermost(obj))
    y = height(I) 
    for obj in non_zero_objs:
      y -= height(obj)
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj) + y, x - leftmost(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** Generate an empty output grid filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate Columns:** Process the input grid column by column.
3. **Extract and Sort Objects:** Extract objects from each column and sort them based on their uppermost row index.
4. **Determine Placement:** Calculate the vertical position for each object, starting from the bottom and adjusting based on the object's height.
5. **Paint Objects:**  Place each object in the output grid at the determined position.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    objects_list = sorted(objects(I, True, False, True), key=lambda obj: centerofmass(obj)[1])
    for obj in objects_list:
        if color(obj) != 0:
            target_y = height(I) - height(obj)
            target_x = centerofmass(obj)[1] - leftmost(obj)
            O = paint(O, shift(obj, (target_y - uppermost(obj), target_x)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Create an empty output grid filled with the background color.
2. **Sort Objects by Column:**  Extract all non-background objects from the input and sort them based on their horizontal center of mass (essentially by column).
3. **Iterate and Position:**  Iterate through the sorted objects, calculate their target positions based on their center of mass, and paint them onto the output grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = sfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) != 0)
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    y = height(I)
    for obj in sorted(objs, key=lambda obj: -uppermost(obj)):
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (y - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), 0)))
        y -= height(obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Non-Background Objects:**  Get all objects that aren't the background color.
2. **Create Output Grid:** Make a blank grid the same size as the input, filled with 0s.
3. **Start at the Bottom:** Set a `y` variable to the bottom row of the grid.
4. **Process Objects from Top Down:** 
    - Sort the objects by their top row, starting with the highest (closest to the top of the input).
    - For each object:
        - Calculate how far down to shift it so it's placed above any previously placed objects.
        - Paint the shifted object onto the output grid.
        - Update the `y` variable to keep track of the next free row.
5. **Return the Output:**  Return the filled-in output grid. 


These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to solving the transformation task. Each version leverages a different set of DSL functions and implements a distinct logic flow, illustrating the flexibility and expressive power of the provided DSL.
