## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation centers around vertically aligning non-background objects to the top of the grid. Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The '3' objects are moved upwards until they touch the top of the grid.
* The '2' object, being attached to a '3' object, is also moved upwards.
* The '7' objects remain in their original columns but are shifted upwards to fill the space left by the '3' objects.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The logic is the same as with the previous example. The '7' objects, '1' object, and '2' object are all shifted upwards within their respective columns to touch the top. 
* Note that the relative positioning within each column is maintained.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* This example reinforces the pattern. All non-background objects ('3', '7', '1', '2') are moved to the top of their respective columns, maintaining their relative order.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def program_v1(grid):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  for j in range(width(grid)):
    column_objs = [(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in asobject(grid) if v != mostcolor(grid) and j == j]
    offset = 0
    for v, (i, _) in column_objs:
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(v, (offset, j))})
      offset += 1
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create a new empty grid (`new_grid`) of the same dimensions as the input grid (`grid`) filled with the background color.
2. **Column-wise Iteration:** Loop through each column (`j`) of the input grid.
3. **Object Extraction:** Extract all non-background objects within the current column and store them in `column_objs`.
4. **Vertical Shift and Paint:** For each object in `column_objs`, paint it onto the new grid at the top of the current column, incrementing an offset (`offset`) to ensure objects are stacked without overlapping.
5. **Return:** Finally, return the transformed grid (`new_grid`).

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(grid):
  return rot270(
    compose(
      lambda g: rot90(g), 
      lambda g: compose(
        lambda g: rot90(g),
        lambda g: compose(
          lambda g: rot90(g),
          program_v1
        )(g)
      )(g)
    )(grid)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes function composition and rotations to reuse the logic from `program_v1`:

1. **Rotate:** Rotate the input grid 270 degrees counter-clockwise.
2. **Apply `program_v1`:** Apply the logic of `program_v1`, which now effectively shifts objects to the left.
3. **Rotate Back:** Rotate the resulting grid back to its original orientation by applying three 90-degree clockwise rotations. 

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(grid):
  return dmirror(
    compose(
      lambda g: dmirror(g),
      program_v1
    )(dmirror(grid))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

Similar to `program_v2`, this version reuses `program_v1` but with diagonal mirroring:

1. **Mirror:** Mirror the input grid diagonally.
2. **Apply `program_v1`:**  Apply the logic of `program_v1`.
3. **Mirror Back:** Mirror the resulting grid diagonally again to obtain the final output.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(grid):
  h = height(grid)
  return compose(
    lambda g: rot180(g), 
    lambda g: compose(
      lambda g: rot180(g),
      lambda g: fold(
        lambda acc, obj: paint(acc, shift(obj, (h - uppermost(obj) - height(obj), 0))),
        objects(g, T, F, T),
        canvas(mostcolor(g), shape(g))
      )
    )(g)
  )(grid) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Rotate:** Rotate the input grid 180 degrees.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterate through each non-background object in the rotated grid.
3. **Shift and Paint:** Calculate the vertical offset required to align the object to the bottom and paint it onto a new canvas.
4. **Rotate Back:** Rotate the resulting grid 180 degrees back to its original orientation.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(grid):
  return cmirror(
    compose(
      lambda g: cmirror(g),
      program_v4 
    )(cmirror(grid))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version mirrors the logic of `program_v4` using counter-diagonal mirroring:

1. **Mirror:**  Mirror the input grid along the counter-diagonal.
2. **Apply `program_v4`:** Apply the logic of `program_v4`.
3. **Mirror Back:**  Mirror the resulting grid back along the counter-diagonal to get the desired output.
