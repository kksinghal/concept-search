## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to move objects of specific colors to predetermined columns while maintaining their original row positions. The background color (most frequent) remains unchanged.

* **Objects with color 3:** Shifted horizontally so that their leftmost cell aligns with column 3.
* **Objects with color 7:** Shifted horizontally so that their leftmost cell aligns with column 11.
* **Other objects:** Remain in their original positions.

## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Version 1:** Using `objects`, `color`, `leftmost`, and `move` functions.

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I 
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if color(obj) == 3:
      O = move(O, obj, (0, 3 - leftmost(obj)))
    elif color(obj) == 7:
      O = move(O, obj, (0, 11 - leftmost(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:**  The code iterates through each object in the input grid using `objects(I, T, F, F)`.
2. **Identify object color:** For each object, it identifies its color using `color(obj)`.
3. **Calculate shift:** Based on the color, it calculates the horizontal shift required to align the object's leftmost cell (`leftmost(obj)`) with the target column (3 for color 3, 11 for color 7).
4. **Move the object:** It uses the `move` function to shift the object on the grid `O` by the calculated offset. 


**Version 2:**  Using `for` loop and conditional painting.

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) 
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 3:
        O = paint(O, {(val, (i, 3))})
      elif val == 7:
        O = paint(O, {(val, (i, 11))})
      else:
        O = paint(O, {(val, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create blank canvas:** Starts with a blank canvas (`O`) filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate and paint:** It iterates through each cell of the input grid. 
3. **Conditional painting:** Based on the cell value:
    * If the value is 3, it paints the cell at the same row but in column 3.
    * If the value is 7, it paints the cell at the same row but in column 11.
    * Otherwise, it paints the cell at the same location on the output grid.


**Version 3:**  Using list comprehension and conditional shift.

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          3 if cell == 3 else (7 if cell == 7 else cell) 
          for j, cell in enumerate(row)
      ) if i != 11 else
      tuple(
          (3 if j == 3 else (7 if j == 11 else cell)) 
          if cell == 0 else cell
          for j, cell in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Nested list comprehension:** Uses nested list comprehension to process the input grid row by row and cell by cell.
2. **Conditional shift:** For each cell:
    * If the cell value is 3, it places a 3 in that row's 3rd column.
    * If the cell value is 7, it places a 7 in that row's 11th column.
    * Otherwise, it keeps the cell value unchanged.
3. **Construct the output grid:**  The list comprehension constructs the entire output grid with the shifted objects.

**Version 4:** Using `apply` and a helper function.

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def shift_object(obj):
    v = color(obj)
    return shift(obj, (0, (3 if v == 3 else 11) - leftmost(obj))) if v in {3, 7} else obj
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(shift_object, objects(I, T, F, F))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `shift_object`:** A helper function `shift_object` is defined to handle the shifting logic for individual objects.
2. **Apply to all objects:** The `apply` function applies `shift_object` to each object in the input grid, obtained using `objects`.
3. **Merge and paint:** The shifted objects are merged using `merge`, and then painted onto a blank canvas. 

**Version 5:** Using `process_color` helper function.

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_color(grid, v, col):
    objs = mfilter(objects(grid, T, F, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == v)
    return paint(cover(grid, objs), shift(merge(objs), (0, col - leftmost(objs)))) if len(objs) > 0 else grid
  O = process_color(I, 3, 3)
  O = process_color(O, 7, 11)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `process_color`:** A helper function `process_color` is defined to handle the shifting of objects of a specific color.
2. **Process each color:** The code calls `process_color` twice - once for color 3 and once for color 7.
3. **Filter and shift:**  Within `process_color`, objects of the specified color are filtered and merged. The merged object is then shifted to align with the target column. 
4. **Paint on the grid:** The shifted object is painted onto the grid.
