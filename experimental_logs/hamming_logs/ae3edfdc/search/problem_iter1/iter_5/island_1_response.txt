## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to be:

1. **Identify non-background objects:** Find all connected components of cells with the same color that are not the background color (0).
2. **Draw vertical lines:** For each object larger than a single cell, draw a vertical line of the same color through its center, spanning from its topmost to its bottommost row. 

**Example:**

In Input_0, the objects are: 
* three '3's 
* one '2' 
* four '7's
* one '1'

We ignore the '2' and '1' as they are single cells. For each of the other objects, we draw a vertical line of that color through their center, resulting in the output grid.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    large_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)
    lines = mapply(
        lambda obj: frozenset(
            (color(obj), (i, leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2)) 
            for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)
        ),
        large_objs
    )
    return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(lines))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:** Partitions the input grid (`I`) into objects, excluding the background.
2. **`large_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)`:** Filters out objects that have only one cell.
3. **`lines = mapply(...)`:**  Generates the vertical lines. For each object in `large_objs`, it creates a set of cells representing the line. 
    - `(color(obj), (i, leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2))`: This creates a tuple representing a cell with the object's color, the row index (`i`), and the column index calculated as the leftmost column plus half the object's width.
4. **`return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(lines))`:** Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input, filled with 0s, and then paints the generated lines onto it.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      merge(
          branch(
              size(obj) > 1,
              frozenset(
                  (color(obj), (i, leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2))
                  for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)
              ),
              frozenset()
          )
          for obj in fgpartition(I)
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`for obj in fgpartition(I)`:** Iterates through each non-background object in the input grid.
2. **`branch(size(obj) > 1, ..., frozenset())`:** Checks if the object's size is greater than 1. If true, it proceeds to generate the line; otherwise, it returns an empty set.
3. **`frozenset((color(obj), (i, leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2)) ...)`:** Generates the line as a set of cells with the object's color and coordinates.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Combines the generated lines from all objects.
5. **`paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), ...)`:**  Paints the combined lines onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def make_line(obj):
    return frozenset((color(obj), (i, leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1))
  lines = mfilter(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: size(obj) > 1 and make_line(obj))
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), lines)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def make_line(obj): ...`:** Defines a helper function to generate a vertical line for a given object.
2. **`lines = mfilter(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: size(obj) > 1 and make_line(obj))`:**  Filters the objects to keep only those larger than one cell and then generates their corresponding lines using the `make_line` function.
3. **`return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), lines)`:** Paints the generated lines onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    lines = frozenset()
    for obj in objs:
        if size(obj) > 1:
            for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
                lines = insert((color(obj), (i, leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2)), lines)
    return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), lines)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:**  Gets the non-background objects from the input grid.
2. **`lines = frozenset()`:** Initializes an empty set to store the line segments. 
3. **`for obj in objs: ...`:** Iterates over each object.
4. **`if size(obj) > 1: ...`:** If the object has more than one cell, it's processed to create a line.
5. **`for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1): ...`:**  Iterates over the rows where the object is present.
6. **`lines = insert((color(obj), (i, leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2)), lines)`:**  Calculates the column for the line segment (middle of the object) and adds the (color, coordinate) tuple to the `lines` set.
7. **`return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), lines)`:**  Finally, it paints the collected line segments onto a blank canvas of the input grid's size.

**Program Version 5** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_object(obj):
    if size(obj) <= 1:
      return frozenset()
    center_col = leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2
    return frozenset(
        (color(obj), (i, center_col)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)
    )
  lines = mapply(process_object, fgpartition(I))
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), lines) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def process_object(obj): ...`:** This function takes an object as input and returns a set of tuples representing the vertical line. If the object has only one cell, it returns an empty set.
2. **`center_col = leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2`:** Calculates the column index of the object's center.
3. **`return frozenset(...)`:** Generates the line segment using a set comprehension.
4. **`lines = mapply(process_object, fgpartition(I))`:** Applies the `process_object` function to each non-background object in the input.
5. **`return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), lines)`:** Paints the collected line segments onto a blank canvas.
