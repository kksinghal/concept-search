## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving objects composed of digits within the grid. The target location of each object depends on its color (the digit it's made of):

* **Color 3:** Objects made of '3' are moved to the 4th column (index 3).
* **Color 7:** Objects made of '7' are moved to the 8th column (index 7).
* **Other Colors:** Objects made of other digits remain in their original columns. 

The objects are moved vertically so that their uppermost row aligns with the target row.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  def move_object(obj):
    v = color(obj)
    return shift(obj, (0, (3 if v == 3 else 7 if v == 7 else leftmost(obj)) - leftmost(obj)))
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(move_object, objects(I, T, F, F))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`move_object(obj)` Function:** 
    * Determines the object's color (`v`).
    * Calculates the target column based on the color (3 for '3', 7 for '7', otherwise the object's original column).
    * Uses `shift` to move the object horizontally to the target column.
2. **Main Program:**
    * Creates a blank canvas (`canvas`) of the same size and background color as the input.
    * Extracts all objects from the input using `objects`.
    * Applies the `move_object` function to each object using `apply`.
    * Merges the moved objects using `merge`.
    * Paints the merged objects onto the canvas using `paint`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for v in palette(I):
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(v, ofcolor(I, v)), (0, (3 if v == 3 else 7 if v == 7 else 0))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Colors:** Loops through each unique color (`v`) in the input grid using `palette`.
2. **Process Each Color:**
    * Finds all indices of the current color in the input grid using `ofcolor`.
    * Creates a new object with the current color at those indices using `recolor`.
    * Calculates the horizontal shift based on the color.
    * Shifts the object horizontally using `shift`.
    * Paints the shifted object onto the canvas (`O`).

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  def move_to_column(obj, column):
    return shift(obj, (0, column - leftmost(obj)))
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    target_column = 3 if color(obj) == 3 else 7 if color(obj) == 7 else leftmost(obj)
    O = paint(O, move_to_column(obj, target_column))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`move_to_column(obj, column)` Function:** Moves an object to the specified column.
2. **Main Program:**
    * Creates a blank canvas.
    * Iterates through each object in the input grid.
    * Determines the target column for the object based on its color.
    * Uses `move_to_column` to move the object to the target column.
    * Paints the moved object onto the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  def process_color(O, v):
    return paint(O, shift(recolor(v, ofcolor(I, v)), (0, 3 if v == 3 else 7 if v == 7 else 0)))
  return reduce(process_color, palette(I), canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`process_color(O, v)` Function:** Processes a single color, moving it to the target column and painting it onto the canvas.
2. **Main Program:**
    * Uses `reduce` to iterate through each color in the input grid's palette.
    * For each color, it applies the `process_color` function, updating the canvas with the moved object.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  return paint(
    paint(
      canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), 
      shift(recolor(3, ofcolor(I, 3)), (0, 3))
    ), 
    shift(recolor(7, ofcolor(I, 7)), (0, 7))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version explicitly handles colors '3' and '7':
    * Creates a blank canvas.
    * Finds indices of color '3' and creates a new object with '3' at those indices.
    * Shifts this new object to column 3 and paints it onto the canvas.
    * Repeats the process for color '7', shifting it to column 7. 
2. Other colors are implicitly handled by remaining in their original positions on the initially blank canvas.

These five programs demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
