## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving objects of specific colors (3 and 7) towards the center of the grid. The objects are moved until they are adjacent to either the central cell or another object that has already been moved.

**Input 0:**
- The 3s move diagonally towards the center until they are adjacent to the central '1'.
- The 7s move horizontally towards the center until they are adjacent to either a '3' or the central '1'.

**Input 1:**
- The 7s move diagonally towards the center until they are adjacent to the central '2'.
- The 3s move horizontally towards the center until they are adjacent to the central '2'.

**Input 2:**
- The top-most '3' moves down until it is adjacent to the '2'.
- The bottom-most '3' moves up until it is adjacent to the '2'.
- The '7' on the left moves right until it is adjacent to the '1'. 

## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  center_idx = frozenset({center(asindices(I))})
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      merge(
          {shift(obj, gravitate(obj, toobject(center_idx, I)))}
          if color(obj) in {3, 7}
          else {obj}
          for obj in objects(I, True, False, False)
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Center:** `center_idx` stores the index of the grid's center cell.
2. **Iterate Objects:** The code iterates through each object in the input grid (`objects(I, True, False, False)`).
3. **Conditional Movement:** 
    - If the object's color is 3 or 7 (`color(obj) in {3, 7}`), it's moved using `gravitate` towards the center object (`toobject(center_idx, I)`).
    - Otherwise, the object remains unchanged.
4. **Paint Objects:** The moved objects are painted onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid (`canvas(0, shape(I))`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  center_obj = toobject(frozenset({center(asindices(I))}), I)
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      {shift(obj, gravitate(obj, center_obj))
       if color(obj) in {3, 7}
       else obj
       for obj in objects(I, True, False, False)}
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Center Object:** `center_obj` represents the object at the center of the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Move:**  The code iterates over each object and conditionally applies `gravitate` to move objects with color 3 or 7 towards `center_obj`.
3. **Paint:** Finally, it paints the modified objects onto a blank canvas. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  center_loc = center(asindices(I))
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      {shift(obj, (sign(center_loc[0] - center(toindices(obj))[0]),
                   sign(center_loc[1] - center(toindices(obj))[1])))
       if color(obj) in {3, 7}
       else obj
       for obj in objects(I, True, False, False)}
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate Center:** `center_loc` gets the coordinates of the grid's center.
2. **Iterate and Move:** It iterates through each object, and if the color is 3 or 7, calculates the direction towards the center using `sign` and shifts the object by one unit in that direction.
3. **Paint:** It paints the moved objects onto a new canvas. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  c = center(asindices(I))
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      {shift(obj, gravitate(obj, toobject(frozenset({c}), I)))
       if color(obj) in {3, 7} and manhattan(obj, toobject(frozenset({c}), I)) > 1
       else obj
       for obj in objects(I, True, False, False)}
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Center:** `c` stores the center coordinates of the grid.
2. **Iterate and Move:** For each object with color 3 or 7 that is not already adjacent to the central object (checked using `manhattan`), it calculates the movement direction using `gravitate` and shifts the object.
3. **Paint to Canvas:**  It paints the modified objects to a new canvas. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  center_indices = frozenset({center(asindices(I))})
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      {shift(obj, gravitate(obj, argmin(objects(I, True, False, False) - {obj},
                                         lambda target: manhattan(obj, target))))
       if color(obj) in {3, 7}
       else obj
       for obj in objects(I, True, False, False)}
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Center and Objects:**  `center_indices` stores the center's index, and `objects(...)` gets all objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Find Closest:**  For each object with color 3 or 7, it finds the closest object (excluding itself) using `argmin` and `manhattan` distance. 
3. **Move Towards Closest:** It then uses `gravitate` to calculate the direction towards this closest object and moves the object. 
4. **Paint to Canvas:** Finally, it paints all objects (moved and unmoved) onto a new canvas.
