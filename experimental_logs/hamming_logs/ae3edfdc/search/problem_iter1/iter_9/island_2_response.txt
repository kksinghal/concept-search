## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying non-background objects in the input grid and centering them horizontally on each row. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** 
- The '3' objects are identified and centered horizontally on their respective rows.
- The '7' objects are identified and centered horizontally on their respective rows. 

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- The '7' objects are identified and centered horizontally on their respective rows.
- The '3' and '2' objects on the last two rows are combined and centered as one object.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
- The '3' objects are identified and centered horizontally on their respective rows. 
- The '7' and '1' objects are combined and centered on their respective rows.
- The '2' and '3' objects on the second-to-last row are combined and centered as one object. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          index(
              paint(
                  canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid[i:i+1])),
                  shift(
                      merge(objects(grid[i:i+1], univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)),
                      (0, width(grid) // 2 - (leftmost(merge(objects(grid[i:i+1], univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))) + rightmost(merge(objects(grid[i:i+1], univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)))) // 2)
                  )
              ),
              (0, j)
          )
          for j in range(width(grid))
      )
      for i in range(height(grid))
  )

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** The program iterates through each row (`i`) of the input grid.
2. **Identify non-background objects:** For each row, it identifies objects that are not the background color (`objects(grid[i:i+1], univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`). 
3. **Calculate center offset:** The offset required to center the combined object is calculated using `leftmost`, `rightmost`, and `width` functions. 
4. **Center the object:** The combined object is shifted to the center of the row using the calculated offset.
5. **Paint on a blank canvas:** The centered object is painted onto a blank canvas of the same size as the row, filled with the background color.
6. **Reconstruct the grid:** Finally, the program reconstructs the entire grid row by row.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    return tuple(
        paint(
            canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)),
            shift(
                merge(objects(grid[i:i+1], univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)),
                (0, width(grid) // 2 - (leftmost(merge(objects(grid[i:i+1], univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))) + rightmost(merge(objects(grid[i:i+1], univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)))) // 2)
            )
        )
        for i in range(height(grid))
    )

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** The program iterates through each row (`i`) of the input grid.
2. **Identify non-background objects:** For each row, it identifies objects that are not the background color (`objects(grid[i:i+1], univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`).
3. **Calculate center offset:** The offset required to center the combined object is calculated using `leftmost`, `rightmost`, and `width` functions.
4. **Center the object:** The combined object is shifted to the center of the row using the calculated offset.
5. **Paint on the grid:** The centered object is directly painted onto the output grid.
6. **Reconstruct the grid:** Finally, the program reconstructs the entire grid row by row.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      v if (i, j) in shift(
        toindices(merge(objects(grid[i:i+1], univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))),
        (0, width(grid) // 2 - (leftmost(merge(objects(grid[i:i+1], univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))) + rightmost(merge(objects(grid[i:i+1], univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)))) // 2)
      ) else mostcolor(grid)
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(grid)
  )

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** The program iterates through each cell (`i`, `j`) of the input grid.
2. **Identify object indices on each row:** For each row, it identifies the indices of cells belonging to non-background objects (`objects(grid[i:i+1], univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`).
3. **Calculate center offset:** The offset required to center these indices is calculated using `leftmost`, `rightmost`, and `width` functions.
4. **Shift indices:** The object indices are shifted horizontally to the center of the row using the calculated offset.
5. **Conditional cell filling:** The program checks if the current cell index (`i`, `j`) is present in the shifted indices. If yes, it retains the original cell value (`v`); otherwise, it fills the cell with the background color (`mostcolor(grid)`).

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    objs = [objects(grid[i:i+1], univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True) for i in range(height(grid))]
    return tuple(
        paint(
            canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)),
            shift(
                merge(objs[i]),
                (0, width(grid) // 2 - (leftmost(merge(objs[i])) + rightmost(merge(objs[i]))) // 2)
            )
        )
        for i in range(height(grid))
    )

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects for each row:** It first extracts the non-background objects from each row and stores them in the `objs` list.
2. **Iterate through rows and center objects:** Then, it iterates through each row, retrieves the corresponding objects from `objs`, calculates the center offset, and shifts them horizontally to the center of the row.
3. **Paint on the grid:**  The centered objects are painted onto the grid. 
4. **Reconstruct the grid:**  Finally, the program reconstructs the entire grid row by row.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(
    paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(grid), (1, width(grid))),
      shift(
        merge(sfilter(objects(grid[i:i+1], univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), lambda obj: True)),
        (0, width(grid) // 2 - (leftmost(merge(sfilter(objects(grid[i:i+1], univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), lambda obj: True))) + rightmost(merge(sfilter(objects(grid[i:i+1], univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), lambda obj: True)))) // 2)
      )
    )[0]
    for i in range(height(grid))
  )

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** The program iterates through each row (`i`) of the input grid.
2. **Identify non-background objects:** For each row, it identifies objects that are not the background color using `objects` function with appropriate parameters.
3. **Calculate center offset:** It calculates the horizontal offset required to center these objects based on their leftmost and rightmost positions. 
4. **Center the objects:** The objects are then shifted horizontally to the center of the row using the `shift` function and calculated offset.
5. **Paint on a canvas:** These centered objects are painted onto a blank canvas of the same width as the input grid, filled with the background color.
6. **Extract the row:**  The first (and only) row from this canvas, now containing the centered objects, is extracted.
7. **Reconstruct the grid:** Finally, the program reconstructs the entire grid row by row. 

All these code versions achieve the desired transformation by identifying non-background objects on each row and centering them horizontally. They demonstrate different approaches and function combinations, providing a variety of solutions within the DSL.
