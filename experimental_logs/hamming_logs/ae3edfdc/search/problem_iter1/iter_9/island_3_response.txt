## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all three input-output pairs follows a consistent logic:

* **Clear the grid:** The output grid is always initially filled with the most common color from the input grid. This essentially clears the input grid and creates a blank canvas.
* **Move specific objects:**  Objects of specific colors (3 and 7 in these examples) are moved to specific columns. 
    * Objects with color '3' are moved to column 4 (index 3).
    * Objects with color '7' are moved to column 8 (index 7).
* **Keep other objects in place:** All other objects retain their original position and shape. 

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  def move_object(obj):
    v = color(obj)
    return shift(obj, (0, (3 if v == 3 else 7 if v == 7 else leftmost(obj)) - leftmost(obj)))
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(move_object, objects(I, T, F, F))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`move_object(obj)` Function:** This function takes an object as input and does the following:
    * Extracts the color `v` of the object.
    * Calculates the shift amount for the object based on its color:
        * If color is 3, shift to column 3 (index 3).
        * If color is 7, shift to column 7 (index 7).
        * Otherwise, shift amount is 0 (object stays in place).
    * Returns the shifted object.

2. **Main Program Logic:**
    * Creates a canvas filled with the most common color of the input grid `I` using `canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))`.
    * Extracts all objects from the input grid using `objects(I, T, F, F)`. 
    * Applies the `move_object` function to each extracted object using `apply(move_object, objects(I, T, F, F))`.
    * Merges all the shifted objects into a single object set using `merge(...)`.
    * Paints the merged objects onto the canvas using `paint(...)`.
    * Returns the final transformed grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for v in palette(I):
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(v, ofcolor(I, v)), (0, (3 if v == 3 else 7 if v == 7 else 0))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   * Creates a canvas `O` filled with the most common color of the input grid `I`.

2. **Iterating through Colors:**
   * Iterates through each unique color `v` in the input grid's palette using `palette(I)`. 

3. **Processing each Color:**
   * `recolor(v, ofcolor(I, v))`: Creates a new object by recoloring all cells with color `v` in the input grid to color `v`. This effectively isolates objects of a single color.
   * `shift(..., (0, (3 if v == 3 else 7 if v == 7 else 0)))`: Shifts the recolored object horizontally:
     * If `v` is 3, shifts to column 3.
     * If `v` is 7, shifts to column 7.
     * Otherwise, no shift (object stays in its original column).
   * `paint(O, ...)`: Paints the shifted object onto the canvas `O`.

4. **Returning the Canvas:**
   * After processing all colors, returns the transformed canvas `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  def move_to_column(obj, column):
    return shift(obj, (0, column - leftmost(obj)))
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    target_column = 3 if color(obj) == 3 else 7 if color(obj) == 7 else leftmost(obj)
    O = paint(O, move_to_column(obj, target_column))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`move_to_column(obj, column)` Function:**
    - This function takes an object and a target column as input.
    - It calculates the shift amount needed to move the object's leftmost point to the target column.
    - It then returns the shifted object.

2. **Main Program Logic:**
    - Creates a blank canvas `O` filled with the most common color of the input grid.
    - Iterates through each object `obj` in the input grid.
    - For each object:
        - Determines the `target_column` based on its color (3 goes to column 3, 7 goes to column 7, others stay in their original column).
        - Uses `move_to_column` to shift the object to the `target_column`.
        - Paints the shifted object onto the canvas `O`.
    - Returns the final transformed canvas `O`.

**Program Version 4:** (This version uses a lambda function for conciseness)

```python
def program_v4(I):
  move = lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, (3 if color(obj) == 3 else 7 if color(obj) == 7 else leftmost(obj)) - leftmost(obj)))
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(move, objects(I, T, F, F))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`move` Lambda Function:**
   - Defines a lambda function `move` that takes an object `obj` as input.
   - Inside the lambda:
      - It calculates the shift amount for the object based on its color, similar to previous versions.
      - It then returns the shifted object.

2. **Main Program Logic:**
   - Creates a blank canvas filled with the most common color of the input.
   - Extracts all objects from the input grid.
   - Applies the `move` lambda function to each extracted object.
   - Merges all the shifted objects.
   - Paints the merged objects onto the canvas.
   - Returns the transformed grid.


**Program Version 5:** (This version uses a loop and conditional statements)

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    c = color(obj)
    if c == 3:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 3 - leftmost(obj))))
    elif c == 7:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 7 - leftmost(obj))))
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Creates a blank canvas `O` filled with the most common color of the input grid `I`.

2. **Iterating through Objects:**
   - Iterates through each object `obj` in the input grid.

3. **Processing Each Object:**
   - Extracts the color `c` of the current object.
   - Uses conditional statements (`if` and `elif`) to check the color:
      - If `c` is 3: Shifts the object to column 3 and paints it onto the canvas.
      - If `c` is 7: Shifts the object to column 7 and paints it onto the canvas.
      - Otherwise (color is neither 3 nor 7): Paints the object onto the canvas without shifting.

4. **Returning the Canvas:**
   - Returns the transformed canvas `O`.
