## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation centers objects with colors 3 or 7 by moving them one step closer to the grid's center. Other objects remain unchanged.

**Input 0:**
* The 3s and 7s are moved one step closer to the center of the grid.

**Input 1:**
* The top-left 7 is moved one step down and one step right.
* The bottom-right 3 is moved one step up and one step left.

**Input 2:**
* The top-right 3 is moved one step down and one step left.
* The bottom-left 7 is moved one step up and one step right.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  center_loc = center(asindices(I))
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      merge(
          frozenset(shift(obj, sign(subtract(center_loc, center(toindices(obj))))))
          if color(obj) in {3, 7} else {obj}
          for obj in objs
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extract all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Find Grid Center:** Calculate the center location of the grid.
3. **Iterate and Move:** For each object:
   - If the object's color is 3 or 7:
     - Determine the direction to move towards the center by calculating the sign of the difference between the center locations of the grid and the object.
     - Shift the object one step in that direction.
   - Otherwise, keep the object unchanged.
4. **Paint to Canvas:** Paint the moved objects onto a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  center_index = frozenset({center(asindices(I))})
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      merge(
        shift(obj, position(center_index, obj)) if color(obj) in {3, 7} else {obj}
        for obj in objs
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extract all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Define Center Index:** Create a frozenset containing the grid's center location.
3. **Iterate and Move:** For each object:
   - If the object's color is 3 or 7:
     - Calculate the relative position (up, down, left, right) of the object's center to the grid's center using `position`.
     - Shift the object one step in that direction.
   - Otherwise, keep the object unchanged.
4. **Paint to Canvas:** Paint the moved objects onto a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  c = center(asindices(I))
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      merge(
        frozenset((v, add((i, j), sign(subtract(c, (i, j))))) for v, (i, j) in obj)
        if color(obj) in {3, 7} else {obj}
        for obj in objects(I, T, F, F)
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Grid Center:** Calculate the center location of the grid.
2. **Identify Objects:** Extract all objects from the input grid `I`.
3. **Iterate and Move:** For each object:
   - If the object's color is 3 or 7:
     - For each cell in the object:
        - Calculate the direction to move towards the center by finding the sign of the difference between the grid's center and the cell's location.
        - Add this direction vector to the cell's location to get its new position.
     - Create a new frozenset with the moved cells.
   - Otherwise, keep the object unchanged.
4. **Paint to Canvas:** Paint the moved objects onto a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      merge(
        rapply(
            (lambda o: shift(o, (1, 0))),
            (lambda o: shift(o, (-1, 0))),
            (lambda o: shift(o, (0, 1))),
            (lambda o: shift(o, (0, -1))),
            identity
        )[(center(asindices(I))[0] > center(obj)[0]) * 2 +
          (center(asindices(I))[1] > center(obj)[1])](obj)
        if color(obj) in {3, 7} else {obj}
        for obj in objects(I, T, F, F)
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extract all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Define Movement Functions:** Create a tuple of lambda functions representing movement in all four directions and staying put.
3. **Iterate and Move:** For each object:
   - If the object's color is 3 or 7:
     - Calculate an index based on the object's relative position (up, down, left, right) to the grid's center.
     - Use this index to select the appropriate movement function from the tuple.
     - Apply the selected movement function to the object.
   - Otherwise, keep the object unchanged.
4. **Paint to Canvas:** Paint the moved objects onto a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      merge(
          branch(
              color(obj) in {3, 7},
              shift(
                  obj,
                  (sign(center(asindices(I))[0] - center(obj)[0]),
                   sign(center(asindices(I))[1] - center(obj)[1]))
              ),
              obj
          )
          for obj in objects(I, T, F, F)
      )
  )
```

1. **Identify Objects:** Extract all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate and Move:** For each object:
   - If the object's color is 3 or 7:
     - Calculate the direction to move towards the center by finding the sign of the difference between the grid's center and the object's center.
     - Shift the object one step in that direction using the calculated direction vector.
   - Otherwise, keep the object unchanged.
