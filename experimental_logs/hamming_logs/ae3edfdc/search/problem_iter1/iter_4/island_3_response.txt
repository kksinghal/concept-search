## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids seems to involve the following steps:

1. **Identify Target Objects:** Select all objects composed of specific digit values (e.g., 3 and 7).
2. **Shift Target Objects:** Move each target object horizontally based on its digit value. For instance:
    * Objects with digit '3' are shifted to align with the column index '3'.
    * Objects with digit '7' are shifted to align with the column index '11'.
3. **Preserve Background:** The background digit (most frequent digit) remains unchanged throughout the transformation.

## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct program versions implementing the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  targets_3 = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
  targets_7 = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == 7)
  O = I
  for target in targets_3:
    O = move(O, target, (0, 3-leftmost(target)))
  for target in targets_7:
    O = move(O, target, (0, 11-leftmost(target)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Targets:** Separately identify objects made of '3' and '7' using `mfilter` and `color`.
2. **Iterative Movement:**  Iterate through each target object and use the `move` function to shift them horizontally to the desired column based on their color. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for v in {3, 7}:
    targets = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == v)
    for obj in targets:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, (3 if v == 3 else 11) - leftmost(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Blank Canvas:** Generate an empty canvas of the same size as the input (`canvas`) filled with the background color (`mostcommon`).
2. **Iterate and Paint:**  Loop through each target digit value (3 and 7). For each value, find corresponding objects, shift them to the desired column, and paint them onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    v = color(obj)
    if v == 3:
      O = move(O, obj, (0, 3 - leftmost(obj)))
    elif v == 7:
      O = move(O, obj, (0, 11 - leftmost(obj)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate All Objects:** Loop through every object in the input grid.
2. **Conditional Shifting:** If the object's color is '3', shift it to column index 3. If the color is '7', shift it to column index 11. Otherwise, keep the object in its original position.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def shift_object(obj):
    v = color(obj)
    return shift(obj, (0, (3 if v == 3 else 11) - leftmost(obj))) if v in {3,7} else obj
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(shift_object, objects(I, T, F, F))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `shift_object` Function:** Create a nested function `shift_object` that takes an object, checks its color, and conditionally shifts it to the appropriate column.
2. **Apply and Paint:** Apply `shift_object` to all objects in the input, merge the shifted objects, and paint them onto a blank canvas filled with the background color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_color(grid, v, col):
    return paint(cover(grid, objs), shift(merge(objs), (0, col - leftmost(objs)))) if len(objs := mfilter(objects(grid, T, F, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == v)) > 0 else grid
  O = process_color(I, 3, 3)
  O = process_color(O, 7, 11)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `process_color` Function:** Create a nested function `process_color` to handle shifting and painting for a specific color and target column. 
2. **Sequential Processing:**  Process each target digit (3 and 7) sequentially by applying `process_color`.

These five program versions offer different approaches to solving the transformation task, using a variety of DSL functions and control flow mechanisms. Each version highlights the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
