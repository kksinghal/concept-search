## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects composed of digits '3' and '7', moving them to specific columns while preserving their vertical structure. Let's break it down per input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* Objects with digit '3' are moved to column 3.
* Objects with digit '7' are moved to column 11.
* Other digits remain unchanged.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* Same as above.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* Same as above.

Essentially, the transformation identifies '3' and '7' objects and repositions them horizontally to columns 3 and 11, respectively.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  threes = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
  sevens = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == 7)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shift(merge(threes), (-uppermost(threes), 3 - leftmost(threes))))
  O = paint(O, shift(merge(sevens), (-uppermost(sevens), 11 - leftmost(sevens))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify target objects:** `threes` and `sevens` store objects containing only '3' and '7' respectively.
2. **Create blank canvas:** `O` is initialized as a grid of zeroes with the same shape as the input.
3. **Move '3' objects:** The merged '3' objects are shifted to column 3 by calculating the offset from their original position.
4. **Move '7' objects:** Similarly, the merged '7' objects are shifted to column 11.
5. **Return transformed grid:**  `O`, containing the repositioned objects, is returned.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    v = color(obj)
    new_j = 3 if v == 3 else 11 if v == 7 else leftmost(obj)
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, new_j - leftmost(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize blank canvas:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Iterate through objects:** Loop through each object in the input.
3. **Determine target column:** Calculate `new_j` based on object's color ('3' goes to column 3, '7' goes to column 11, others stay in their column).
4. **Shift and paint:** Shift the object horizontally and paint it onto the canvas.
5. **Return transformed grid:** Return the modified canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for v in [3, 7]:
    target_column = 3 if v == 3 else 11
    objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == v)
    O = cover(O, objs)
    O = paint(O, shift(objs, (0, target_column - leftmost(objs))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize output as input:**  `O` initially is the same as the input grid.
2. **Iterate through target values:** Loop through the target digits '3' and '7'.
3. **Find and remove target objects:** Identify and remove objects of the current target value from `O`.
4. **Calculate shift and paint:** Calculate the horizontal shift needed to move the objects to their target column and paint them onto `O`.
5. **Return transformed grid:** Return the modified grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v in [3, 7]:
        new_j = 3 if v == 3 else 11
        O = paint(O, {(v, (i, new_j))})
      else:
        O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize blank canvas:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Iterate through cells:** Loop through each cell in the input grid.
3. **Handle target digits:** If the cell contains '3' or '7', paint it at the corresponding target column on the new canvas.
4. **Handle other digits:** If the cell doesn't contain a target digit, paint it at the same location on the new canvas.
5. **Return transformed grid:** Return the modified canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  targets = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: color(obj) in {3, 7})
  O = cover(I, targets)
  for obj in targets:
    v = color(obj)
    O = paint(O, recolor(v, shift(obj, (0, (3 if v == 3 else 11) - leftmost(obj)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify target objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Remove target objects from the input:** `O` becomes the input with target objects removed.
3. **Iterate and reposition:** Loop through each target object, recolor it while shifting to its target column. 
4. **Return transformed grid:** Return the modified grid.

These are just a few examples, and you can come up with even more diverse solutions by combining different DSL functions and approaches! Remember to test your code thoroughly with various input grids to ensure its correctness.
