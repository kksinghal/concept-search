## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves the following steps:

1. **Identify Objects:** The input grid is analyzed to identify distinct objects. An object is defined as a group of connected cells with the same value, considering only horizontal and vertical adjacency (not diagonal).
2. **Filter Objects:** Only objects with color values 3 or 7 are selected for transformation.
3. **Move Objects:** The selected objects are moved one step closer to the center of the input grid. The movement is either horizontal or vertical, depending on the object's relative position to the center. If an object is already aligned with either the horizontal or vertical center, it doesn't move. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_version_1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  center_loc = center(asindices(I))
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      merge(
          frozenset(
              shift(obj, sign(subtract(center_loc, center(toindices(obj)))))
          ) if color(obj) in {3, 7} else {obj}
          for obj in objs
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Center:** Similar to previous programs, this version identifies objects using `objects(I, T, F, F)` and calculates the grid's center using `center(asindices(I))`.
2. **Calculate Move Direction:** For each object, `sign(subtract(center_loc, center(toindices(obj))))` determines the direction to move towards the center. This returns a tuple like (1, 0) for right, (-1, 0) for left, (0, 1) for down, and (0, -1) for up.
3. **Conditional Shifting:** Objects with color 3 or 7 are shifted by the calculated direction using `shift(obj, direction)`. Other objects are returned unchanged as a set `{obj}` to be compatible with the `merge` function.
4. **Painting:** Finally, the shifted objects are merged and painted onto a blank canvas using `paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(...))`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_version_2(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      merge(
          shift(obj, position(frozenset({center(asindices(I))}), obj)) 
          if color(obj) in {3, 7} else {obj}
          for obj in objects(I, T, F, F)
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification and Center:** Similar to version 1, this version identifies objects and finds the grid's center.
2. **Calculate Relative Position:**  The function `position(frozenset({center(asindices(I))}), obj)` is used to directly calculate the relative position between the grid's center and each object. This eliminates the need for separate sign calculations.
3. **Shifting and Painting:** The rest of the logic is identical to version 1, shifting only objects with colors 3 or 7 by the calculated relative position.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_version_3(I):
  c = center(asindices(I))
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      merge(
          frozenset(
              (v, add((i, j), sign(subtract(c, (i, j)))))
              for v, (i, j) in obj
          ) if color(obj) in {3, 7} else {obj}
          for obj in objects(I, T, F, F)
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Pre-calculate Center:** The grid's center is calculated only once at the beginning and stored in the variable `c`.
2. **Iterate Through Cells:** Instead of shifting the entire object, this version iterates through each cell `(v, (i, j))` of an object.
3. **Cell-wise Shift Calculation:** The `sign(subtract(c, (i, j)))` function calculates the shift direction for each cell towards the center.
4. **Add Shift to Cell Index:** The `add((i, j), sign(...))` function adds the calculated shift to the cell's original index, effectively moving it.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_version_4(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      merge(
          rapply(
              (lambda o: shift(o, (1, 0))), 
              (lambda o: shift(o, (-1, 0))), 
              (lambda o: shift(o, (0, 1))), 
              (lambda o: shift(o, (0, -1))), 
              identity
          )[
              (center(asindices(I))[0] > center(obj)[0]) * 2 + 
              (center(asindices(I))[1] > center(obj)[1])
          ](obj) if color(obj) in {3, 7} else {obj}
          for obj in objects(I, T, F, F)
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Shift Functions:** This version defines four lambda functions, each shifting an object in a specific direction (up, down, left, right). The `identity` function is used for no movement.
2. **Index Calculation:**  A single index is calculated based on the relative horizontal and vertical position of the object's center to the grid's center. 
3. **Apply Shift Function:** The calculated index is used to select and apply the corresponding shift function from the `rapply` list.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_version_5(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      merge(
          branch(
              color(obj) in {3, 7},
              shift(
                  obj,
                  (sign(center(asindices(I))[0] - center(obj)[0]),
                   sign(center(asindices(I))[1] - center(obj)[1]))
              ),
              obj
          )
          for obj in objects(I, T, F, F)
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Branching:** This version directly uses the `branch` function for conditional execution. 
2. **Calculate Shift within Branch:** The shift calculation and application happen only if the object's color is 3 or 7. Otherwise, the original object is returned.

Each of these program versions effectively achieves the same transformation, albeit with different approaches and function combinations.
