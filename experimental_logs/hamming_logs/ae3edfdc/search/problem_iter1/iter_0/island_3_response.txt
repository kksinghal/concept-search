## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on horizontally aligning elements with specific values (3, 7) to the center column while maintaining their relative vertical positions. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 
* All occurrences of '3' are shifted horizontally to column index 7.
* All occurrences of '7' are shifted horizontally to column index 11.
* The remaining values are unchanged.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** 
* All occurrences of '7' are shifted horizontally to column index 3. 
* The '3' values in the bottom two rows remain in their original columns.
* The remaining values are unchanged.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
* All occurrences of '7' are shifted horizontally to column index 9.
* The '3' values in the bottom three rows remain in their original columns. 
* The remaining values are unchanged.


## Code Generation:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def solve_25d8a9c8(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  threes = colorfilter(objs, 3)
  sevens = colorfilter(objs, 7)
  shifted_threes = mapply(lambda o: shift(o,(0,7-centerofmass(o)[1])), threes)
  shifted_sevens = mapply(lambda o: shift(o,(0,11-centerofmass(o)[1])), sevens)
  covered = cover(I, merge((threes, sevens)))
  O = paint(paint(covered, shifted_threes), shifted_sevens)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. Identify individual objects in the grid using `objects`.
2. Filter objects to get sets of '3's and '7's using `colorfilter`.
3. For each object, calculate the horizontal shift required to center it and apply it using `shift` and `centerofmass`.
4. Cover the original positions of '3's and '7's on the grid using `cover`.
5. Paint the shifted objects onto the covered grid using `paint`.


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def solve_d23f8c26(I):
    O = I
    for v in [3, 7]:
        obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, v), I)
        O = move(O, obj, (0, 7 - centerofmass(obj)[1] + 4*(v==7)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. Iterate over the values to be centered (3 and 7).
2. For each value, get its indices and convert it to an object using `ofcolor` and `toobject`.
3. Calculate the horizontal shift required to center the object and additionally shift '7's four units to the right.
4. Move the object on the grid using `move`. 


### Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def solve_25d8a9c8(I):
  target_column_3 = 7
  target_column_7 = 11
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 3:
        O = paint(O, {(val, (i, target_column_3))})
      elif val == 7:
        O = paint(O, {(val, (i, target_column_7))})
      else:
        O = paint(O, {(val, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. Define the target columns for '3' and '7'.
2. Create an empty canvas of the same size as the input using `canvas`.
3. Iterate over each cell in the input grid.
4. If the cell value is '3' or '7', paint it to the corresponding target column on the new grid.
5. Otherwise, paint the cell value to its original location on the new grid.


### Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def solve_d23f8c26(I):
  c3 = 7
  c7 = 11
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  moved = mapply(lambda o: branch(color(o) == 3, shift(o, (0, c3 - centerofmass(o)[1])), branch(color(o) == 7, shift(o, (0, c7 - centerofmass(o)[1])), o)), objs)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(moved))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. Define target column indices for values 3 and 7.
2. Extract objects from the input grid using `objects`.
3. Use `mapply` to iterate over objects and apply a lambda function:
    - If the object's color is 3, shift it to column `c3`.
    - If the object's color is 7, shift it to column `c7`.
    - Otherwise, keep the object unchanged.
4. Paint the moved objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input using `canvas` and `paint`.


### Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def solve_25d8a9c8(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for j in range(w):
    col = tuple(I[i][j] for i in range(h))
    if 3 in col:
      O = paint(O, {(3, (col.index(3), 7))})
    if 7 in col:
      O = paint(O, {(7, (col.index(7), 11))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. Get the height and width of the input grid.
2. Create a blank canvas of the same size as the input using `canvas`.
3. Iterate through each column of the input grid.
4. For each column, check if it contains '3' or '7'. 
5. If found, paint that value at the corresponding target column and the row index where it was first encountered in the original column. 

These are just a few examples, and many other valid programs could be written to achieve the same transformations. Each program uses different logic or combinations of DSL functions, highlighting the flexibility of the DSL in solving this task.
