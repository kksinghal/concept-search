## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) and moving them to specific locations based on their color (the digit value).

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 
- The '3' objects are moved to form a vertical line at column index 3. 
- The '7' objects are moved to form a vertical line at column index 11.
- The '2' object remains at its original position.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The '7' objects are moved to form a vertical line at column index 3.
- The '3' and '2' objects are moved to column index 11, maintaining their relative vertical positions.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- The '7' objects are moved to form a vertical line at column index 10.
- The '3' objects are moved to column index 6, maintaining their relative vertical positions.
- The '2' object remains at its original position.

## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    val = color(obj)
    if val == 3:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 3 - leftmost(obj))))
    elif val == 7:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 11 - leftmost(obj))))
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:**  Create an empty canvas (`O`) with the same dimensions as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterate through each object (`obj`) found in the input grid using `objects(I, T, F, F)`. `T, F, F` ensures only connected regions of the same digit are considered as objects.
3. **Color-Based Movement:**
    - If the object's color (`val`) is 3, shift the object horizontally to column index 3.
    - If the object's color is 7, shift the object horizontally to column index 11.
    - Otherwise, keep the object at its original position.
4. **Painting:** Paint the shifted object onto the canvas.
5. **Return:** Return the modified canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  threes = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
  sevens = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == 7)
  O = cover(I, merge((threes, sevens)))
  O = paint(O, shift(merge(threes), (0, 3 - leftmost(merge(threes)))))
  O = paint(O, shift(merge(sevens), (0, 11 - leftmost(merge(sevens)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** 
    - Extract all '3' objects into `threes`.
    - Extract all '7' objects into `sevens`.
2. **Background Creation:** Create the background by covering the original grid with a blank canvas, removing the '3' and '7' objects.
3. **Object Placement:**
    - Shift the combined '3' object horizontally to column index 3 and paint it on the canvas.
    - Shift the combined '7' object horizontally to column index 11 and paint it on the canvas.
4. **Return:** Return the modified canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 3:
        O = paint(O, {(val, (i, 3))})
      elif val == 7:
        O = paint(O, {(val, (i, 11))})
      else:
        O = paint(O, {(val, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:**  Create an empty canvas (`O`) with the same dimensions as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Cell Iteration:** Iterate through each cell in the input grid.
3. **Color-Based Placement:**
    - If the cell value is 3, paint it at the same row but in column index 3 on the canvas.
    - If the cell value is 7, paint it at the same row but in column index 11 on the canvas.
    - Otherwise, paint the cell at its original position on the canvas. 
4. **Return:** Return the modified canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = replace(I, 3, 0)
  O = replace(O, 7, 0)
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 3:
        O = paint(O, {(3, (i, 3))})
      elif val == 7:
        O = paint(O, {(7, (i, 11))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Remove Target Digits:** Replace all occurrences of '3' and '7' in the input grid with '0'.
2. **Iterate and Paint:** 
   - Iterate through the original grid to find the positions of '3' and '7'.
   - Paint '3's at column index 3 and '7's at column index 11 on the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  targets = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: color(obj) in {3, 7})
  O = cover(I, targets)
  for obj in targets:
    val = color(obj)
    new_j = 3 if val == 3 else 11
    O = paint(O, {(val, (i, new_j)) for v, (i, j) in obj})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Remove Target Objects:** Find all '3' and '7' objects, store them in `targets`, and create a new grid `O` with these objects removed.
2. **Iterate and Paint:** 
   - Iterate through each object in `targets`.
   - Determine the target column index (3 for '3' and 11 for '7').
   - Paint the object on the new grid `O` at the target column, maintaining its row positions.
