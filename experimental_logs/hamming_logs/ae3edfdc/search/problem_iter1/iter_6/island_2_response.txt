## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects based on connected pixels of the same color (excluding the background color 0), then centering each object horizontally on its lowest row.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- The "3" objects are centered on their respective lowest rows.
- The "2" object remains unchanged as it is already centered.
- The "7" objects are centered on their respective lowest rows.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- The "7" objects are centered on their respective lowest rows.
- The "1" object remains unchanged as it is already centered.
- The "3" and "2" objects are treated as a single object and centered on their shared lowest row.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

- The "3" objects are centered on their respective lowest rows.
- The "2" object remains unchanged as it is already centered.
- The "7" objects and the "1" object are treated as a single object and centered on their shared lowest row.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = fgpartition(grid)
  out = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  for obj in objs:
    lowest_row = lowermost(obj)
    center_col = (leftmost(obj) + rightmost(obj)) // 2
    shift_amount = (0, width(grid) // 2 - center_col)
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, shift_amount)
    out = paint(out, shifted_obj)
  return out
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** The `fgpartition` function identifies objects based on connected pixels of the same color, excluding the background.
2. **Initialize output grid:** An empty canvas with the same dimensions and background color as the input is created.
3. **Iterate through objects:** For each identified object:
    - **Find the lowest row:** The `lowermost` function finds the row index of the lowest pixel in the object.
    - **Find the horizontal center:** The average of the leftmost and rightmost column indices is calculated.
    - **Calculate shift amount:** The difference between the center column of the grid and the center column of the object is calculated. 
    - **Shift the object:** The object is horizontally shifted using the `shift` function.
    - **Paint the shifted object:** The shifted object is painted onto the output grid.
4. **Return output grid:** The modified grid with centered objects is returned.


**Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def center_on_lowest_row(obj):
    lowest_row_indices = frozenset((i, j) for v, (i, j) in obj if i == lowermost(obj))
    center_col = (leftmost(lowest_row_indices) + rightmost(lowest_row_indices)) // 2
    shift_amount = (0, width(grid) // 2 - center_col)
    return shift(obj, shift_amount)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), merge(apply(center_on_lowest_row, fgpartition(grid))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a functional approach to achieve the same result.

1. **Define helper function:** A function `center_on_lowest_row` is defined to center an object on its lowest row.
2. **Apply and paint:** The code then uses a chain of functions:
    - `fgpartition`: Identifies objects in the grid.
    - `apply`: Applies the `center_on_lowest_row` function to each object.
    - `merge`: Combines the centered objects.
    - `paint`: Paints the merged objects onto a blank canvas. 
3. **Return output grid:** The modified grid with centered objects is returned.


**Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return fold(
    lambda acc, obj: paint(acc, shift(obj, (0, width(grid) // 2 - (leftmost(obj) + rightmost(obj)) // 2))),
    fgpartition(grid),
    canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses the `fold` function for a more concise implementation.

1. **Initialize output grid:**  An empty canvas is created.
2. **Fold over objects:** The `fold` function iterates over objects identified by `fgpartition`, accumulating the result in the canvas.
3. **Center and paint:** For each object, it calculates the shift amount to center it horizontally and paints the shifted object onto the canvas. 


**Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def process_row(row_index):
    row_objs = frozenset(sfilter(fgpartition(grid), lambda obj: lowermost(obj) == row_index))
    if len(row_objs) == 0:
      return tuple((mostcolor(grid), (row_index, j)) for j in range(width(grid)))
    merged_obj = merge(row_objs)
    center_col = (leftmost(merged_obj) + rightmost(merged_obj)) // 2
    return paint(
        canvas(mostcolor(grid), (1, width(grid))), 
        shift(merged_obj, (0, width(grid) // 2 - center_col))
    )[0]
  return tuple(process_row(i) for i in range(height(grid)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version processes the grid row by row.

1. **Define helper function:** A function `process_row` handles each row individually.
2. **Iterate through rows:** The code iterates through each row index of the grid.
3. **Process each row:**  For each row:
    - **Find objects on the row:** Objects whose lowest point is on the current row are identified.
    - **Handle empty rows:** If no objects are found, a blank row is returned.
    - **Center merged object:**  The objects on the row are merged, their center is calculated, and they are shifted to be horizontally centered.
    - **Paint and return row:** The centered object is painted onto a blank row and returned. 
4. **Assemble rows:** The processed rows are combined into a grid and returned.


**Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def process_object(obj):
    row_index = lowermost(obj)
    center_col = (leftmost(obj) + rightmost(obj)) // 2
    shift_amount = (0, width(grid) // 2 - center_col)
    return shift(obj, shift_amount)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), merge(apply(process_object, fgpartition(grid))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a helper function to process individual objects.

1. **Define helper function:** A function `process_object` is defined to center an object horizontally on its lowest row.
2. **Apply and paint:** 
    - `fgpartition`: Identifies objects in the grid.
    - `apply`: Applies the `process_object` function to each object.
    - `merge`: Combines the centered objects.
    - `paint`: Paints the merged objects onto a blank canvas.
3. **Return output grid:** The modified grid with centered objects is returned.
