## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all three input-output pairs follows the same logic:

1. **Identify connected components:** The input grid is analyzed to identify distinct objects formed by adjacent cells with the same value.
2. **Horizontal Alignment:** Each object is then reduced to a horizontal line centered at the object's average column position, spanning the object's vertical extent.
3. **Painting:**  A new canvas filled with zeros is created, and the generated horizontal lines are painted onto it. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  lines = mapply(
      lambda obj: frozenset(
          (color(obj), (i, leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2)) 
          for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)
      ),
      objs
  )
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(lines))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`objs = fgpartition(I)`**:  Identifies the objects (connected components) in the input grid `I` excluding the background color.
2.  **`lines = mapply(...)`**: For each object `obj` in `objs`, it calculates the horizontal line representation:
    *   `color(obj)`: Extracts the color of the object.
    *   `(i, leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2)`:  Calculates the center column index for the line.
    *   `for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)`: Iterates through all the rows the object spans.
3.  **`return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(lines))`**: Creates a canvas of zeros with the same dimensions as the input, merges all the generated lines, and paints them onto the canvas.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(
        canvas(0, shape(I)),
        merge(
            frozenset(
                (color(obj), (i, leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2))
                for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)
            )
            for obj in fgpartition(I)
        )
    )
```

**Explanation:**

This version combines the line generation and merging steps within the paint function for a more compact representation. It directly iterates over the objects from `fgpartition(I)` and generates the horizontal line representation on-the-fly without using `mapply`.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def make_hline(obj):
    return frozenset(
        (color(obj), (i, leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2))
        for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)
    )
  lines = apply(make_hline, fgpartition(I))
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(lines))
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a helper function `make_hline` for better code readability. The `make_hline` function takes an object as input and returns its horizontal line representation. The `apply` function then applies this function to each object obtained from `fgpartition(I)`.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    lines = set()
    for obj in fgpartition(I):
        c = color(obj)
        center_j = leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2
        for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
            lines.add((c, (i, center_j)))
    return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), frozenset(lines))
```

**Explanation:**

This version explicitly iterates over the objects and their rows using nested loops, constructing the line representation step-by-step. It then paints the resulting lines on a new canvas.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h, w = shape(I)
    output = canvas(0, (h, w))
    for obj in fgpartition(I):
        val = color(obj)
        center_col = leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2
        for row in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
            output = fill(output, val, {(row, center_col)})
    return output
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly modifies a canvas initialized with zeros instead of explicitly creating line representations. It iterates through the objects and fills the corresponding canvas cells with the object's color at the calculated center column index and object's row range.

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation, each highlighting different DSL functions and logic.
