## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves identifying objects made of the digit '5' and moving them towards the center of the grid.  The movement prioritizes vertical movement if the object is farther vertically from the center and horizontal movement if it's farther horizontally. If an object cannot move to its intended position due to another object already occupying that cell, it remains in its original position.

**Program_to_be_generated:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  fives = toindices(colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), FIVE))
  ci, cj = center(asindices(I))
  h, w = shape(I)
  shifted = set()
  occupied = set()
  for i, j in fives:
    vertical_move = abs(i - ci) >= abs(j - cj)
    new_i = i + sign(ci - i) if vertical_move else i
    new_j = j + sign(cj - j) if not vertical_move else j
    if 0 <= new_i < h and 0 <= new_j < w and (new_i, new_j) not in occupied:
      shifted.add((new_i, new_j))
      occupied.add((new_i, new_j))
    else:
      shifted.add((i, j))
      occupied.add((i, j))
  O = fill(cover(I, fives), FIVE, frozenset(shifted))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '5' objects and grid properties:**
   - `fives = toindices(colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), FIVE))`:  This line identifies all objects made of the digit '5' and stores their indices in the `fives` set. 
   - `ci, cj = center(asindices(I))`: This calculates the center coordinates (ci, cj) of the input grid `I`.
   - `h, w = shape(I)`: This retrieves the height (h) and width (w) of the input grid.

2. **Determine movement for each '5' cell:**
   - The code iterates through each cell (i, j) in the `fives` set.
   - `vertical_move = abs(i - ci) >= abs(j - cj)`: This checks if the vertical distance to the center is greater than or equal to the horizontal distance.
   - Based on `vertical_move`, `new_i` and `new_j` are calculated, representing the intended new position of the cell after the potential move.

3. **Handle collisions and update shifted set:**
   - The code checks if the new position is within the grid bounds (`0 <= new_i < h and 0 <= new_j < w`) and not already occupied (`(new_i, new_j) not in occupied`).
   - If both conditions are true, the new position is added to the `shifted` set, and the new position is marked as occupied.
   - If not, the original cell position is added to the `shifted` set, and the original position is marked as occupied to prevent other cells from moving there.

4. **Create output grid:**
   - `O = fill(cover(I, fives), FIVE, frozenset(shifted))`: This creates the output grid `O`. 
     - `cover(I, fives)` removes the original '5' objects from the input grid.
     - `fill(..., FIVE, frozenset(shifted))` fills the '5' value at the new positions stored in the `shifted` set, effectively moving the '5' objects.

5. **Return the transformed grid:**
   - `return O`: The function returns the transformed grid `O`.

This code effectively implements the transformation rule by identifying '5' objects, determining their movement based on their distance to the center, handling potential collisions, and finally creating the output grid by moving the objects to their new positions.
