## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving the objects formed by the digit '5' to the center of the grid while maintaining their original shape. 

**Input_0:** The '5' objects are moved downwards to align vertically with the center of the '2' object.

**Input_1:**  The '5' objects are moved both horizontally and vertically towards the center of the grid. 

**Input_2:** The '5' objects are moved horizontally towards the center of the grid.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:


### Program Version 1: 
```python
def solve(I):
    target = color(objects(I, T, F, F) - {objects(replace(I, FIVE, ZERO), T, F, F)})
    obj = objects(I, T, F, F) - objects(replace(I, target, ZERO), T, F, F)
    c = centerofmass(objects(replace(I, FIVE, ZERO), T, F, F))
    offset = subtract((len(I) // 2, len(I[0]) // 2), c)
    O = paint(cover(I, obj), shift(obj, offset))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the target object:** The program first identifies the object formed by digits other than '5' by replacing all '5's with '0's and finding the remaining object.
2. **Isolate the '5' object:** It then isolates the object formed by '5's.
3. **Calculate the offset:** It determines the offset required to move the '5' object to the center of the target object.
4. **Move and paint:** Finally, it covers the original '5' object, shifts it by the calculated offset, and paints it back onto the grid.


### Program Version 2:
```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  target_obj = objects(replace(I, FIVE, bg), T, F, F)
  five_obj = objects(replace(I, mostcolor(target_obj), bg), T, F, F)
  target_center = centerofmass(target_obj)
  five_center = centerofmass(five_obj)
  offset = subtract(target_center, five_center)
  O = paint(cover(I, five_obj), shift(five_obj, offset))
  return O
```
**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background:** Find the background color (most common).
2. **Isolate Target Object:** Replace '5' with the background color, leaving only the target object.
3. **Isolate '5' Object:** Replace the target object's color with the background color, isolating the '5' object.
4. **Calculate Centers:** Find the center of mass for both target and '5' objects.
5. **Calculate Offset:** Calculate the difference between centers to get the required shift.
6. **Move and Paint:** Cover the original '5' object, shift it by the offset, and paint it onto the grid.


### Program Version 3:
```python
def solve(I):
    f = lambda x: color(x) != FIVE
    target = first(sfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), f))
    five_obj = first(sfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), compose(flip, f)))
    tc = center(toindices(target))
    fc = center(toindices(five_obj))
    offset = (tc[0] - fc[0], tc[1] - fc[1])
    O = paint(cover(I, five_obj), shift(five_obj, offset))
    return O
```
**Explanation:**

1. **Filter Objects:**  Create a filter function to separate objects based on whether they contain '5'.
2. **Get Target and '5' Objects:**  Extract both the target object and '5' object.
3. **Calculate Centers:** Find the center coordinates of both objects.
4. **Determine Offset:**  Calculate the difference between centers to get the move direction.
5. **Move and Paint:** Cover the original '5' object, move it, and paint it back on the grid.


### Program Version 4:
```python
def solve(I):
    t = mostcolor(objects(replace(I, FIVE, ZERO), T, F, F))
    f = lambda x: color(x) == t
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
        if not f(obj):
            tc = center(toindices(first(sfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), f))))
            fc = center(toindices(obj))
            O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, subtract(tc, fc)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Target Color:** Identify the color of the target object.
2. **Filter Function:** Create a function to identify objects of the target color.
3. **Iterate Through Objects:** Loop through each object in the grid.
4. **Check for '5' Object:** If the object is not the target color, it's the '5' object.
5. **Calculate Centers and Move:** Calculate the center coordinates of the target and '5' objects and move the '5' object to the target's center.


### Program Version 5:
```python
def solve(I):
    target = mostcolor(objects(replace(I, FIVE, ZERO), T, F, F))
    five_obj = objects(I, T, F, F) - objects(replace(I, target, ZERO), T, F, F)
    t_center = centerofmass(objects(replace(I, FIVE, ZERO), T, F, F))
    f_center = centerofmass(five_obj)
    move_v = subtract(t_center, f_center)
    moved_five = shift(five_obj, move_v)
    O = paint(cover(I, five_obj), moved_five)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Target Color:** Determine the color of the target object.
2. **Isolate '5' Object:** Isolate the object formed by '5's.
3. **Calculate Center of Masses:**  Find the center of mass for both target and '5' objects.
4. **Calculate Movement Vector:** Calculate the vector to move the '5' object to the target's center.
5. **Move and Paint:** Cover the original '5' object, shift it using the calculated vector, and paint it back onto the grid.
