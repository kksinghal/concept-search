## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all three examples involves moving the object composed of the digit '5' to a new location while leaving all other objects in their original positions. Here's a breakdown:

* **Output_0:** The '5' object moves from the top and bottom edges to the center of the grid, aligning horizontally with the '2' object.
* **Output_1:** The '5' object, originally scattered, consolidates into a single, horizontally flipped 'L' shape object located centrally within the grid.
* **Output_2:** Similar to Output_1, the scattered '5's form a single object, but this time it's a vertically oriented 'I' shape centered within the grid.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the described transformation, utilizing the provided DSL functions. Each version takes a slightly different approach:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve_3bdb4ada(I):
    fives = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), matcher(color, 5))
    grid_center = divide(shape(I), 2)
    O = paint(cover(I, fives), shift(fives, subtract(grid_center, centerofmass(fives))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fives = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), matcher(color, 5))`**:  This line identifies the object composed of the digit '5'.
2. **`grid_center = divide(shape(I), 2)`**: Calculates the center coordinates of the grid.
3. **`O = paint(cover(I, fives), shift(fives, subtract(grid_center, centerofmass(fives))))`**: This is the core transformation. It first erases the '5' object from its original position (`cover(I, fives)`), then calculates the offset required to move its center of mass to the grid's center (`subtract(grid_center, centerofmass(fives))`), shifts the object by that offset (`shift(fives, ...)`), and finally paints the shifted object back onto the grid (`paint(..., ...)`).

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve_3bdb4ada(I):
    five_indices = ofcolor(I, 5)
    grid_center = center(asindices(I))
    centered_indices = shift(five_indices, subtract(grid_center, centerofmass(five_indices)))
    O = fill(I, 5, centered_indices)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`five_indices = ofcolor(I, 5)`**:  Identifies the indices of all cells containing '5'.
2. **`grid_center = center(asindices(I))`**:  Calculates the center coordinates of the grid.
3. **`centered_indices = shift(five_indices, subtract(grid_center, centerofmass(five_indices)))`**: Computes the new indices for the '5' cells by shifting them to center around the grid's center.
4. **`O = fill(I, 5, centered_indices)`**:  Fills the grid with '5' at the newly calculated centered indices.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve_3bdb4ada(I):
    obj_five = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 5)
    target_pos = divide(shape(I), 2)
    offset = subtract(target_pos, centerofmass(obj_five))
    moved_obj = shift(obj_five, offset)
    O = paint(cover(I, obj_five), moved_obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj_five = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 5)`**: Extracts the object composed of '5's.
2. **`target_pos = divide(shape(I), 2)`**:  Calculates the target position, which is the center of the grid.
3. **`offset = subtract(target_pos, centerofmass(obj_five))`**:  Determines the offset required to move the '5' object's center of mass to the grid's center.
4. **`moved_obj = shift(obj_five, offset)`**: Shifts the '5' object by the calculated offset.
5. **`O = paint(cover(I, obj_five), moved_obj)`**:  Covers the original '5' object and paints the moved object onto the grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve_3bdb4ada(I):
  five_obj = next((obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) == 5), None)
  grid_center_i, grid_center_j = divide(shape(I), 2)
  five_center_i, five_center_j = centerofmass(five_obj)
  shift_i = grid_center_i - five_center_i
  shift_j = grid_center_j - five_center_j
  shifted_obj = shift(five_obj, (shift_i, shift_j))
  O = paint(cover(I, five_obj), shifted_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`five_obj = next((obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) == 5), None)`**: Finds the object made of '5's.
2. **`grid_center_i, grid_center_j = divide(shape(I), 2)`**:  Determines the grid's center coordinates.
3. **`five_center_i, five_center_j = centerofmass(five_obj)`**:  Determines the center of mass of the '5' object.
4. **`shift_i = grid_center_i - five_center_i`**: Calculates the vertical shift required.
5. **`shift_j = grid_center_j - five_center_j`**: Calculates the horizontal shift required.
6. **`shifted_obj = shift(five_obj, (shift_i, shift_j))`**:  Shifts the '5' object.
7. **`O = paint(cover(I, five_obj), shifted_obj)`**:  Covers the original object and paints the shifted one.


**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve_3bdb4ada(I):
    five_obj = next((obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) == 5), None)
    grid_mid = tuple(x // 2 for x in shape(I))
    obj_mid = centerofmass(five_obj)
    shift_amount = subtract(grid_mid, obj_mid)
    new_five_obj = shift(five_obj, shift_amount)
    I = cover(I, five_obj)
    O = paint(I, new_five_obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`five_obj = next((obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) == 5), None)`**:  Finds the '5' object.
2. **`grid_mid = tuple(x // 2 for x in shape(I))`**: Computes the grid's midpoint.
3. **`obj_mid = centerofmass(five_obj)`**: Computes the center of mass of the '5' object.
4. **`shift_amount = subtract(grid_mid, obj_mid)`**:  Calculates the shift needed to center the object.
5. **`new_five_obj = shift(five_obj, shift_amount)`**:  Shifts the object to its new position.
6. **`I = cover(I, five_obj)`**: Clears the original position of the '5' object.
7. **`O = paint(I, new_five_obj)`**:  Draws the shifted object onto the grid. 


These five program versions offer diverse ways to accomplish the object-moving transformation using the provided DSL, each demonstrating a different approach to problem-solving within the given constraints.
