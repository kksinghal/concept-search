## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving the '5' objects in the grid to specific positions relative to the '2' objects. 

* **Input_0:** The single '5' object is moved to the center of the '2' object's bounding box.
* **Input_1:** The '5' object is moved horizontally to align its left edge with the '2' object's vertical midline.
* **Input_2:** The '5' object is moved to the center of the '2' object's bounding box. 

Essentially, the '5' objects are gravitating towards the '2' objects in a specific manner. 

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  obj5 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 5), I)
  return paint(cover(I, obj5), shift(obj5, gravitate(obj5, obj2)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  The program identifies the '2' and '5' objects in the grid.
2. **Calculate gravitation:**  It calculates the direction and magnitude to move the '5' object to be adjacent to the '2' object using the `gravitate` function.
3. **Move object:** It then moves the '5' object to that new location. 

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  obj5 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 5), I)
  center_2 = center(obj2)
  offset = subtract(center_2, center(obj5))
  return paint(cover(I, obj5), shift(obj5, offset))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** The program identifies the '2' and '5' objects in the grid.
2. **Calculate offset:** It calculates the difference between the center of the '2' object and the center of the '5' object. 
3. **Move object:** It then moves the '5' object by the calculated offset, effectively placing its center on the center of the '2' object.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  obj5 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 5), I)
  target_j = center(obj2)[1]
  current_j = center(obj5)[1]
  offset = (0, target_j - current_j)
  return paint(cover(I, obj5), shift(obj5, offset)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** The program identifies the '2' and '5' objects in the grid.
2. **Find target column:** It determines the column index (`j`) of the vertical midline of the '2' object.
3. **Calculate offset:** It calculates the horizontal difference between the target column and the current column of the '5' object's center.
4. **Move object:** It moves the '5' object horizontally by the calculated offset, aligning its left edge with the '2' object's midline. 

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  obj5 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 5), I)
  return paint(
      cover(I, obj5), 
      shift(obj5, subtract(ulcorner(obj2), ulcorner(obj5)))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** The program identifies the '2' and '5' objects in the grid.
2. **Calculate offset:** It directly calculates the offset between the upper-left corner of the '2' object and the upper-left corner of the '5' object.
3. **Move object:** It moves the '5' object by the calculated offset, aligning its upper-left corner with that of the '2' object. 

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  obj5 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 5), I)
  target = centerofmass(obj2)
  return paint(cover(I, obj5), shift(obj5, subtract(target, centerofmass(obj5))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** The program identifies the '2' and '5' objects in the grid.
2. **Calculate target & offset:**  It determines the center of mass of the '2' object as the target location. It then calculates the offset needed to move the '5' object's center of mass to this target location.
3. **Move object:** It moves the '5' object by the calculated offset, effectively aligning its center of mass with that of the '2' object.
