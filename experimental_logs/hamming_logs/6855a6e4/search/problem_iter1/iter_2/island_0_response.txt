## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation centers all objects made of the digit '5' horizontally within their respective rows, while leaving all other objects untouched.

**Input_0:**  Two '5' objects exist. The top one is a single '5' and is moved to the center column. The bottom '5' object has a width of 3 and is also centered.

**Input_1:** This input features two '5' objects with a width of 2. Both are centered in their respective rows.

**Input_2:** Here, three '5' objects, each with a width of 2, are present. Again, each is centered within its row.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    fives = [(v, (i, j)) for j, v in enumerate(row) if v == FIVE]
    if fives:
      leftmost_j = min(j for _, (_, j) in enumerate(fives))
      rightmost_j = max(j for _, (_, j) in enumerate(fives))
      shift_amount = (len(row) // 2) - ((rightmost_j - leftmost_j) // 2) - leftmost_j
      shifted_fives = [(v, (i, j + shift_amount)) for v, (_, j) in enumerate(fives)]
      for v, (_, j) in shifted_fives:
        O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j))})
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v != FIVE:
        O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This program iterates through each row, identifying '5' objects and calculating their leftmost and rightmost column indices. It determines the necessary shift amount to center the object and applies it to each cell of the object. Finally, it paints both the shifted '5' objects and the remaining digits onto a blank canvas. 

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fives = objects(fill(I, ZERO, ofcolor(I, ZERO)), True, False, True)
  shifted_fives = frozenset(shift(five, (0, (len(I[0]) // 2) - (width(five) // 2) - leftmost(five))) for five in fives)
  O = paint(I, shifted_fives)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version first identifies all '5' objects in the input. Then, for each object, it calculates the shift amount required to center it horizontally based on the grid's width and the object's width and leftmost position. Finally, it shifts the objects and paints them onto the input grid, effectively centering them.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  shifted_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == FIVE:
      shift_amount = (len(I[0]) // 2) - (width(obj) // 2) - leftmost(obj)
      shifted_objs = shifted_objs.union(frozenset({shift(obj, (0, shift_amount))}))
    else:
      shifted_objs = shifted_objs.union(frozenset({obj}))
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), shifted_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This program iterates over each object in the input grid. If the object's color is '5', it calculates the shift amount and shifts the object horizontally to the center of the grid. If the object is not '5', it is added to the `shifted_objs` set without any modification. Finally, all shifted objects are painted onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    row = I[i]
    fives = ofcolor(crop(I, (i, 0), (1, len(I[0]))), FIVE)
    if fives:
      shift_amount = (len(row) // 2) - (width(fives) // 2) - leftmost(fives)
      O = paint(cover(O, toobject(fives, O)), shift(toobject(fives, O), (0, shift_amount)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each row of the input grid and extracts the indices of '5' digits within that row. If '5's are found, it calculates the necessary horizontal shift to center them based on the row's width and the object's dimensions. It then covers the original '5' object and paints a shifted version, effectively centering it within its row.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  shifted_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == FIVE:
      center_col = len(I[0]) // 2 
      obj_center_col = leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2
      shift_amount = center_col - obj_center_col
      shifted_obj = shift(obj, (0, shift_amount))
      shifted_objs = shifted_objs.union(frozenset({shifted_obj}))
    else:
      shifted_objs = shifted_objs.union(frozenset({obj}))
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), shifted_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

This version iterates through all objects identified in the input. For each object, it checks if it's a '5' object. If so, it calculates the object's center column and the grid's center column. The difference between these two values gives us the required shift amount to center the object. The object is then shifted, and the process repeats for all '5' objects. Finally, all the shifted objects are painted on a new canvas of the same size as the input, resulting in a grid with horizontally centered '5' objects.
