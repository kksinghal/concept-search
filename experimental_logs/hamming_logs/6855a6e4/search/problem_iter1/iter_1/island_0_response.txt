## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on '5' objects within the grid, aiming to horizontally center them within their respective rows while maintaining their original vertical position.

**Example:**

In Input_0, the '5' object at the top is moved to the center of the first row. Similarly, the three '5's in the last three rows are also centered. The same pattern applies to Input_1 and Input_2, where '5' objects are horizontally centered in their respective rows. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fives = colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), FIVE)
  moved_fives = frozenset()
  for five in fives:
    row_start = leftmost(five)  
    row_end = rightmost(five) 
    center_column = (len(I[0]) // 2)  
    shift_amount = center_column - ((row_end - row_start) // 2) - row_start
    moved_fives = moved_fives.union(frozenset({shift(five, (0, shift_amount))}))
  O = paint(cover(I, merge(fives)), merge(moved_fives))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '5' Objects:**  The code first identifies all objects composed of the digit '5' within the input grid (`I`).
2. **Calculate Horizontal Shift:** For each '5' object:
   - It determines the leftmost (`row_start`) and rightmost (`row_end`) column indices of the object.
   - It calculates the middle column index (`center_column`) of the grid.
   - It calculates the required horizontal shift amount (`shift_amount`) to center the object.
3. **Shift Objects:**  The `shift` function then moves each '5' object horizontally by the calculated `shift_amount`.
4. **Paint to Output:** Finally, the code paints the shifted '5' objects onto a copy of the input grid where the original '5' objects have been erased, resulting in the output grid (`O`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fives = objects(fill(I, ZERO, ofcolor(I, ZERO)), True, False, True)  
  centered_fives = frozenset(shift(five, (0, (len(I[0]) // 2) - (width(five) // 2) - leftmost(five))) for five in fives)
  O = paint(I, centered_fives) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Isolate '5's:** This version first fills all '0' cells with the background color, effectively isolating '5' objects. 
2. **Centering Logic:** It then iterates through each '5' object (`fives`) and calculates the shift amount needed for horizontal centering.
3. **Shift and Paint:** The `shift` function moves each '5' object, and `paint` places them onto the original input grid (`I`), resulting in the output grid (`O`). 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  
  for i in range(len(I)): 
    row = I[i] 
    fives = asindices(crop(I, (i, 0), (1, len(I[0])))) & ofcolor(I, FIVE)
    if fives:
      O = paint(cover(O, toobject(fives, I)), shift(toobject(fives, I), (0, (len(I[0]) // 2) - (width(fives) // 2) - leftmost(fives))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Rows:** This version iterates through each row (`i`) of the grid.
2. **Find '5's in Row:** For each row, it identifies indices of '5's.
3. **Center and Paint:** If '5's exist in the row, it calculates the horizontal shift to center them, covers the original '5's, and paints the shifted objects onto the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) 
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    fives = [(v, (i, j)) for j, v in enumerate(row) if v == FIVE]
    if fives:
      leftmost_j = min(j for _, (r, j) in enumerate(fives))
      rightmost_j = max(j for _, (r, j) in enumerate(fives))
      shift_amount = (len(row) // 2) - ((rightmost_j - leftmost_j) // 2) - leftmost_j
      shifted_fives = [(v, (i, j + shift_amount)) for v, (r, j) in enumerate(fives)]
      for v, (r, j) in shifted_fives:
        O = paint(O, {(v, (r, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** It initializes an empty canvas (`O`) of the same size as the input.
2. **Process Row-wise:** The code iterates through each row and identifies the '5' cells within that row.
3. **Centering and Painting:** For rows containing '5's, it calculates the necessary shift to center them. Then, it shifts the '5' cells and paints them onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) 
  shifted_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == FIVE:
      row = uppermost(obj)
      obj_width = width(obj)
      shift_amount = (len(I[0]) // 2) - (obj_width // 2) - leftmost(obj)
      shifted_objs = shifted_objs.union(frozenset({shift(obj, (0, shift_amount))}))
    else:
      shifted_objs = shifted_objs.union(frozenset({obj}))
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), shifted_objs) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** This version first identifies all objects in the input grid.
2. **Selective Shifting:** It iterates through each object and applies a horizontal shift only to objects with color '5'. Other objects remain unchanged.
3. **Paint to Canvas:** Finally, it paints all objects, including the shifted '5' objects, onto a blank canvas, producing the output.

Each version accomplishes the same goal of centering '5' objects horizontally in their respective rows. However, they utilize different strategies and combinations of DSL functions, demonstrating diverse approaches to problem-solving.
