## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

The transformation involves rotating the input grid 90 degrees counterclockwise. 

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

The transformation involves rotating the input grid 180 degrees.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using functions from the provided DSL:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = rot270(I) if len(palette(I)) > 3 else rot180(I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly uses the `rot270` and `rot180` functions for rotation. It uses the number of unique colors in the input grid to decide which rotation to apply. If there are more than 3 colors, it applies a 270-degree counterclockwise rotation (as in Input 0 to Output 0), otherwise, it applies a 180-degree rotation (as in Input 1 to Output 1).


**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = branch(len(palette(I)) > 3, rot270(I), rot180(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the `branch` function to choose the appropriate rotation based on the number of colors in the input grid. It offers a more structured way to express the conditional logic compared to Version 1.


**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  rotation = lambda x: rot270(x) if len(palette(x)) > 3 else rot180(x)
  O = rotation(I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a separate function `rotation` that encapsulates the logic for choosing and applying the correct rotation based on the number of colors. This improves code readability by separating the rotation logic from the main function.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  rotations = (rot270, rot180)
  condition = len(palette(I)) > 3
  rotation = rotations[0] if condition else rotations[1]
  O = rotation(I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version introduces a tuple `rotations` containing both rotation functions. It then uses the condition (number of colors) to select the appropriate rotation function from the tuple. This approach allows for easy modification if additional rotations or conditions need to be added in the future.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  if len(palette(I)) > 3:
    O = rot90(I)
    O = rot90(O)
    O = rot90(O)
  else:
    O = rot90(I)
    O = rot90(O)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version implements the rotations by repeatedly applying `rot90` (90-degree rotation) function. While less efficient than directly using `rot270` and `rot180`, this version demonstrates a different approach to achieving the same result.

These five versions offer distinct approaches to transforming the input grids into the desired outputs by combining and utilizing the functions provided in the DSL. They showcase the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for solving spatial reasoning tasks.
