## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently applies the following rule:

* **For each '1' in the input grid, place a '2' to its right, unless the '1' is at the rightmost edge of the grid.**

Let's break down this transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
* The '1's at (0,0) and (3,3) get a '2' placed to their right.
* The '1's at (0,2) and (3,1) are at the edge, so no '2' is placed.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
*  The same rule is applied to all '1's. Notice how the rightmost '1's in each row do not get a '2' placed.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
* Again, the transformation is consistent.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Extract objects, no diagonals, without background
  new_cells = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if v == 1 and j < width(I) - 1:  # Check for '1' and not on right edge
        new_cells.add((2, (i, j + 1)))  # Add '2' to the right
  return paint(I, frozenset(new_cells))  # Paint onto the grid
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Extract objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` gets objects from the grid, considering only directly adjacent cells (`False` for diagonal), treating all non-background values as part of the object (`True` for univalued), and excluding the background (`True` for without_bg).
2. **Iterate and add '2':**  The code iterates through each object and its cells. If the cell value is '1' and it's not on the right edge of the grid (`j < width(I) - 1`), a new cell with value '2' is added to its right.
3.  **Paint:** `paint(I, frozenset(new_cells))` paints the new '2' cells onto a copy of the input grid, leaving the original grid unchanged.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return fill(I, 2, mfilter(lambda c: index(I,c) == 1 and c[1] < width(I)-1, asindices(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asindices(I)`:** Generates all indices of the input grid `I`.
2. **`mfilter(...)`:** Filters the indices. It keeps only those indices `c` where:
    - `index(I, c) == 1`: The value at index `c` in grid `I` is 1.
    - `c[1] < width(I) - 1`: The column index `c[1]` is less than the width of the grid minus 1 (meaning it's not on the rightmost edge).
3. **`fill(I, 2, ...)`:** Fills the input grid `I` with the value `2` at the indices selected by the filter.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, frozenset((2, (i, j+1)) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(row) if v == 1 and j < len(row) - 1))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **List Comprehension:** This code uses a list comprehension to generate the new cells with value '2'.
2. **Iterate and Check:** It iterates through each cell in the grid. If a cell's value is '1' and it's not in the last column (`j < len(row) - 1`), a tuple `(2, (i, j+1))` is generated, representing a cell with value '2' to the right of the current cell.
3. **Paint:**  Finally, `paint` is used to apply these new cells to the input grid, creating the output.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_indices = mfilter(lambda c: index(I, c) == 1, asindices(I))
  return paint(I, frozenset((2, (i, j+1)) for i, j in shifted_indices if j < width(I) - 1)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Indices of '1's:** `mfilter(lambda c: index(I, c) == 1, asindices(I))` finds the indices of all cells with value '1' in the grid.
2. **Shift and Filter:** The code iterates over these indices and shifts each one to the right. It filters out any shifted indices that fall outside the grid's bounds. 
3. **Paint:** It paints the value '2' at the remaining shifted indices onto the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          2 if j + 1 < len(row) and row[j + 1] == 1 else v 
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Nested Loop:** This version uses a nested loop to iterate over each cell in the grid.
2. **Conditional Replacement:** For each cell, it checks if the cell to its right exists (`j + 1 < len(row)`) and contains the value '1' (`row[j + 1] == 1`). If both conditions are true, the current cell is replaced with the value '2'; otherwise, the original value is kept.
3. **Tuple Construction:** The loop constructs a new grid with the replaced values, effectively achieving the desired transformation. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, leveraging various DSL functions and programming constructs. Each version provides a unique solution while adhering to the DSL's capabilities.
