## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects formed by the digit '1' on a background of '0'.  For each '1' object, a single '2' is placed to the right of the rightmost '1' in the object, effectively extending the object to the right by one cell. 

**Let's break down each example:**

* **Input_0:** The top-right '1' object gets extended rightwards, resulting in '1 2'. The bottom '1' object also extends to become '0 1 2 1'.
* **Input_1:**  All '1' objects are extended to the right by a single '2'.
* **Input_2:** Similar to the previous examples, each '1' object is extended to the right by one '2'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Get objects of '1's
  for obj in objs:
    rightmost_j = max(j for _, (i, j) in obj) # Find the rightmost '1'
    for _, (i, j) in obj:
      if j == rightmost_j: # Place '2' to the right of the rightmost '1'
        h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
        if j + 1 < w:
          I = fill(I, 2, {(i, j + 1)}) 
  return I 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' Objects:** Uses `objects(I, True, False, True)` to identify objects formed by the digit '1'.
2. **Locate Rightmost '1':**  Within each object, it finds the column index (`j`) of the rightmost '1'.
3. **Extend with '2':** It places a '2' to the right of the located rightmost '1' if it's within the grid boundaries.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          2 if j + 1 < len(row) and row[j] == 1 and row[j + 1] == 0 else v
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:**  This version iterates directly through each cell of the grid.
2. **Check for Right Extension:** For each cell, it checks if the cell contains a '1', if the cell to its right is within the grid bounds, and if the cell to the right contains a '0'.
3. **Conditional Replacement:** If the conditions are met, the cell's value is replaced with '2'. Otherwise, the original value is kept.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          2 if any(I[i][k] == 1 for k in range(j, -1, -1)) and I[i][j] == 0 and j + 1 < w else I[i][j]
          for j in range(w)
      )
      for i in range(h)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** It iterates through each cell in the grid and checks if there is a '1' anywhere to the left of the current cell within the same row.
2. **Extend Rightward:** If a '1' is found to the left and the current cell is '0' and within the grid's boundary, it places a '2'.
3. **Preserve Others:** Otherwise, the original cell value is retained. 

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          2 if any((I[i][k] == 1 and k < j) for k in range(len(row))) and v == bg else v
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background:**  It determines the background color using `mostcolor(I)`.
2. **Check for '1' and Background:** For each cell, it checks if there's a '1' to its left and if the current cell is the background color.
3. **Extend Object:** If the conditions are met, it replaces the background cell with '2', effectively extending the object.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  I = hconcat(I, ((0,) * len(I[0]),)) # Add a column of zeros
  I = tuple(tuple(2 if j > 0 and row[j] == 0 and row[j - 1] == 1 else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for row in I)
  return tuple(row[:-1] for row in I) # Remove the extra column

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Add Temporary Column:**  It first adds a temporary column of '0's to the right of the grid to simplify boundary checks.
2. **Extend into the New Column:** It then iterates through the grid and places a '2' if the current cell is '0', the cell to its left is '1', and it's not in the first column.
3. **Remove Temporary Column:** Finally, it removes the added column, returning the transformed grid.

Each of these programs provides a different approach to achieving the same transformation. Choose the one that best suits your needs or preferences.
