## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all input-output pairs follows a specific pattern:

* **Identify consecutive digits:** The program searches for occurrences of the digit '0' followed by the digit '1' within each row.
* **Insert a '2':** Upon finding such a '01' sequence, the program inserts the digit '2' between them.

This transformation applies consistently across all provided examples.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if j > 0 and row[j - 1] == 0 and v == 1 else v
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:**  The code iterates through each row of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through elements:** For each row, it iterates through its elements with their indices `(j, v)`.
3. **Check for the pattern:** It checks if the current element `v` is 1 and the previous element `row[j-1]` is 0.
4. **Insert '2':** If the condition is true, it inserts '2' at the current position. Otherwise, the original value `v` is kept.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    papply(
      lambda x, y: 2 if x == 0 and y == 1 else y,
      (0,) + row[:-1],
      row
    ) 
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** The code iterates through each row of the input grid `I`.
2. **Prepare shifted row:** For each row, it creates a tuple representing the previous elements by prepending '0' and removing the last element `(0,) + row[:-1]`. 
3. **Apply pairwise function:** It uses `papply` to apply a lambda function pairwise to the original row and the shifted row.
4. **Insert '2':** The lambda function checks if the current element in the shifted row is '0' and the current element in the original row is '1'. If true, it inserts '2'; otherwise, it keeps the original value. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(v if v != 0 or j == len(row) - 1 or row[j + 1] != 1 else 2 for j, v in enumerate(row))
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:**  The code iterates through each row of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through elements:** For each row, it iterates through its elements with their indices `(j, v)`.
3. **Check for the pattern:** It checks if the current element `v` is '0', not the last element in the row (`j != len(row) - 1`), and the next element `row[j + 1]` is '1'.
4. **Insert '2':** If the condition is true, it replaces '0' with '2'. Otherwise, the original value `v` is kept.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    apply(
      lambda row: tuple(
        branch(j > 0 and row[j - 1] == 0 and row[j] == 1, 2, row[j])
        for j in range(len(row))
      ),
      I
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Apply to each row:** The code uses `apply` to apply a lambda function to each row of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through elements:** The lambda function iterates through the elements of each row using their indices.
3. **Check for the pattern:** It checks if the current element is '1' and the previous element is '0'.
4. **Insert '2':** If the condition is met, it inserts '2' at the current position. Otherwise, it retains the original element.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      branch(
        contained((0, 1), pair(row[max(0, j - 1):], row[j:min(len(row), j + 2)])), 
        2 if v == 1 else v, 
        v
      ) 
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows and elements:** Similar to previous versions, the code iterates through rows and elements.
2. **Create pairs:** For each element, it creates pairs from a sliced portion of the row encompassing the previous, current, and next elements.
3. **Check for (0, 1) pair:** It uses `contained` to check if the pair (0, 1) exists within the generated pairs.
4. **Insert '2':** If the pair is found and the current element is '1', it replaces it with '2'. Otherwise, the original element is maintained.

These five programs demonstrate diverse approaches to solving the given transformation task using the DSL. Each version leverages different DSL functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the language.
