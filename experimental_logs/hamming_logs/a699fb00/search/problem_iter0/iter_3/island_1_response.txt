## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grid involves identifying cells with a value of '1' and adding a '2' to their right. The added '2' essentially extends the object formed by the '1's to the right by one cell.

**Example:**

```
Input:        Output:
1 0 1 0 0     1 2 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0     0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0     0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0     0 1 2 1 0
0 0 0 0 0     0 0 0 0 0 
```

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code in the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, shift(recolor(2, ofcolor(I, 1)), RIGHT))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`:** This identifies the indices of all cells with the value '1' in the input grid `I`.
2. **`recolor(2, ...)`:** This replaces the value of the cells identified in step 1 with '2'.
3. **`shift(..., RIGHT)`:** This shifts the newly recolored indices one cell to the right.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:** This paints the shifted '2's onto the original input grid `I`, resulting in the desired output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  shifted_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), filtered_objs)
  return paint(I, merge(shifted_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, False)`:** This identifies all objects in the grid `I` (considering objects as connected components of the same color).
2. **`sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)`:** This filters out objects that don't have the color '1'.
3. **`apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), filtered_objs)`:** This shifts all the filtered objects one cell to the right.
4. **`merge(shifted_objs)`:** This merges all the shifted objects into a single object.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** This paints the merged, shifted object onto the original input grid `I`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  shifted_indices = shift(indices, RIGHT)
  return fill(I, 2, shifted_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`:**  Finds all indices in the grid `I` where the value is '1'.
2. **`shift(indices, RIGHT)`:** Shifts the collected indices one cell to the right.
3. **`fill(I, 2, shifted_indices)`:** Fills the grid `I` with the value '2' at the shifted indices.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, shift(I, RIGHT), lambda x, y: 2 if x == 1 else y)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shift(I, RIGHT)`:** Shifts the entire input grid `I` one cell to the right.
2. **`cellwise(I, ..., lambda x, y: 2 if x == 1 else y)`:** Iterates through the original grid `I` and the shifted grid. If a cell in the original grid has the value '1', it replaces that cell with '2'. Otherwise, it keeps the value from the shifted grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          2 if j > 0 and row[j-1] == 1 else v 
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      ) 
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. This program directly iterates through each row and cell of the input grid `I`.
2. **`2 if j > 0 and row[j-1] == 1 else v`**:  For each cell, it checks if the cell to its left (j-1) exists (j > 0) and if its value is '1'. If both conditions are true, it replaces the current cell with '2', effectively extending the '1' to the right. Otherwise, it keeps the original cell value (`v`).


These five versions offer diverse approaches to solving the given transformation using the DSL, showcasing flexibility and understanding of different functionalities within the language.
