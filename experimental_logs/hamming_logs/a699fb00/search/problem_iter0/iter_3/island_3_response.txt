## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding a '2' to the right of each '1' in the input grid, except for '1's that already have a '2' to their right. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects excluding background
  new_cells = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if v == 1 and (i, j + 1) not in toindices(obj): # Check for '1' without '2' on the right within the same object
        new_cells.add((2, (i, j + 1)))  # Add '2' to the right
  O = paint(I, frozenset(new_cells))  # Paint the new cells onto the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify individual objects within the grid, excluding the background, using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Iterate and Check:** Loop through each cell within each object. If a cell contains a '1' and its right neighbor (within the same object) is not a '2', proceed.
3. **Add '2':**  Add a new cell with value '2' to the right of the identified '1' cell.
4. **Paint:** Paint the new cells containing '2' onto the original grid, preserving the existing structure.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  indices_one = ofcolor(I, 1)  # Get indices of all '1's
  new_cells = set()
  for i, j in indices_one:
    if I[i][j+1] != 2:  # Check if the right neighbor is not '2'
      new_cells.add((i, j + 1))  # Add the index to the set
  O = fill(I, 2, frozenset(new_cells))  # Fill the identified indices with '2'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1's:** Find the indices of all cells containing '1' using `ofcolor(I, 1)`.
2. **Check Right Neighbors:** For each '1' index, check if the cell to its right contains a '2'. 
3. **Mark for Filling:** If the right neighbor isn't '2', add the index of the right neighbor to a set.
4. **Fill with '2':**  Use `fill(I, 2, frozenset(new_cells))` to replace the values at the marked indices with '2'.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  shifted_right = rot90(tophalf(rot270(I)))  # Shift the grid one cell to the right
  O = cellwise(I, shifted_right, 0)  # Compare with original, fill mismatches with '0'
  return replace(O, 1, 2)  # Replace all remaining '1's with '2's
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Right:** Create a copy of the grid shifted one cell to the right using `rot90(tophalf(rot270(I)))`.
2. **Cellwise Comparison:**  Compare the original grid with the shifted grid using `cellwise(I, shifted_right, 0)`. Mismatching cells are filled with '0', effectively removing the original '2's.
3. **Replace '1's:** Replace all remaining '1's in the resulting grid with '2's using `replace(O, 1, 2)`.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  ones = objects(I, T, F, T)
  twos = set()
  for obj in ones:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if v == 1:
        neighbor = (i, j + 1)
        if neighbor not in toindices(obj):
          twos.add((2, neighbor))
  return paint(I, frozenset(twos)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' Objects:** Extract objects containing '1's, excluding the background.
2. **Find Potential '2's:** Iterate through each '1' cell and check if its right neighbor is within the same object. If not, mark the neighbor's position for a potential '2'.
3. **Paint '2's:** Paint the marked positions with '2's on the original grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  return paint(I, frozenset((2, (i, j+1)) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0])-1) if I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j+1] != 2))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **One-liner Approach:** Directly paint '2's onto the grid using a set comprehension.
2. **Iterate and Check:** Loop through all cells except the rightmost column. If a cell contains '1' and its right neighbor isn't '2', include a '2' at the neighbor's position in the set.
3. **Paint:** Paint the '2's onto the original grid based on the generated set.


These five versions offer different approaches to achieve the same transformation. They demonstrate the flexibility and variety of solutions possible within the provided DSL.
