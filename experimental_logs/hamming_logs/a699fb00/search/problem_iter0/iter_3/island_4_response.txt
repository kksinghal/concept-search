## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently applies the following logic:

**For each object (connected component of the same digit, excluding the background):**

1. **Identify** all cells directly to the right of the object's cells.
2. **Conditionally fill:** If the identified cell is part of the background (most common color), fill it with the digit '2'.

**Let's break down this transformation for each input-output pair:**

**Pair 0:** The '1' objects are extended to the right by one cell wherever possible.

**Pair 1:**  Similar to Pair 0, the '1' objects are extended rightwards. Notice that the extension only happens if the cell to the right is background (0).

**Pair 2:** Again, '1' objects are extended to the right. This example emphasizes that the extension is object-wise, not a global rightward shift.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions, leveraging DSL functions, to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:** (Inspired by `gegafbdfhfdheddjihgfccibicjjabce` and `ibdedfebdffbefejiafjcgdajdebedce`, but avoids iterating over individual object cells for efficiency)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_right(obj):
    return fill(I, 2, {(i, j + 1) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I)})
  return paint(I, merge(apply(extend_right, objects(I, True, False, True)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:**  Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`. We use `True, False, True` to specify objects should be univalued, not diagonally connected, and exclude the background.
2. **`apply(extend_right, ...)`:**  Applies the `extend_right` function to each identified object.
3. **`extend_right(obj)`:**  For each object `obj`, it creates a set of indices representing cells to the right of the object's cells, only if those cells are within the grid bounds and have the background color. Then, it uses `fill` to create a new grid where those indices are filled with '2'.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the resulting filled indices from all objects into a single set.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged indices onto the original input grid `I` with the value '2', effectively extending the objects.

**Program Version 2:** (Uses a different approach with `sfilter` and `toindices`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_obj(obj):
    return toobject(frozenset((i, j + 1) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j < width(I) - 1), I)
  filtered_objs = sfilter(apply(extend_obj, objects(I, True, False, True)), lambda obj: color(obj) == mostcolor(I))
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(2, toindices(obj)), filtered_objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:**  Identifies objects like in Version 1.
2. **`apply(extend_obj, ...)`:** Applies `extend_obj` to each object.
3. **`extend_obj(obj)`:** Computes the indices of cells to the right of each object's cells and uses `toobject` to get the corresponding object from the grid.
4. **`sfilter(...)`:**  Filters the extended objects, keeping only those where the color is the background color.
5. **`apply(lambda obj: recolor(2, toindices(obj)), ...)`:** Applies `recolor` to each filtered object, changing the color of its cells to '2'.
6. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the recolored objects' indices.
7. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged indices onto the input grid `I` with '2'.

**Program Version 3:** (Emphasizes a functional approach with `compose` and `rbind`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  right_fill = compose(
      rbind(fill, I), 
      rbind(lambda indices: frozenset((i, j + 1) for i, j in indices if j < width(I) - 1), toindices)
  )
  return paint(I, merge(apply(right_fill, objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`right_fill`:** Defines a composed function using `compose`.
    - It takes an object, extracts its indices (`toindices`), 
    - Computes the indices to the right (`lambda` function),
    - Fills those indices on the input grid with '2' using `fill`.
2. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:**  Identifies objects.
3. **`apply(right_fill, ...)`:** Applies `right_fill` to each object.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the filled indices from each object.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged indices onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4:** (Utilizes `product` and a more direct filtering approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  fillable = frozenset((i, j + 1) for i, j in product(range(height(I)), range(width(I) - 1)) if I[i][j + 1] == bg)
  return paint(I, recolor(2, fillable & merge(apply(toindices, objects(I, True, False, True)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:**  Gets the background color.
2. **`fillable`:**  Computes a set of all indices that are to the right of a background cell.
3. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Identifies objects.
4. **`merge(apply(toindices, ...))`:**  Gets all indices of all objects.
5. **`fillable & ...`:**  Keeps only the fillable indices that are also part of an object.
6. **`recolor(2, ...)`:**  Recolors the resulting indices to '2'.
7. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the recolored indices onto the input grid.

**Program Version 5:** (Leverages `dneighbors` for a neighbor-based check)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_right(obj):
    return frozenset((i, j + 1) for v, (i, j) in obj if (i, j + 1) in dneighbors((i, j)) and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I))
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(2, extend_right(obj)), objects(I, True, False, True)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Identifies objects.
2. **`apply(...)`:**  Applies a lambda function to each object.
3. **`lambda obj: recolor(2, extend_right(obj))`:**  Recolors the output of `extend_right` to '2'.
4. **`extend_right(obj)`:**  Finds indices to the right of an object's cells, only if they are direct neighbors and have the background color.
5. **`merge(...)`:**  Merges the recolor indices.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged indices onto the input grid. 

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the same data transformation within the constraints of the provided DSL. Each leverages different functions and logic flow, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
