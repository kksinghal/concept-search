## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied in all examples is to **extend each non-background object by one cell to the right**, effectively adding a "shadow" or "outline" to their right side. The extension only occurs if the cell to the right is within the grid boundaries and doesn't already belong to another object.

Here's a breakdown for each example:

* **Input 0:** The "1" objects at the top and bottom are extended to the right.
* **Input 1:** All the "1" objects are extended to the right.
* **Input 2:** Similar to the other examples, all non-background objects gain a one-cell extension on their right side.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions that achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = fgpartition(I)  # Get non-background objects
    x2 = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), x1)  # Shift all objects one cell to the right
    x3 = apply(lambda obj: {(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if 0 <= j < len(I[0])}, x2)  # Remove cells outside the grid boundaries
    O = underpaint(I, merge(x3))  # Paint onto background cells only
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Identifies all non-background objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), x1)`:**  Applies the `shift` function to each object, moving it one cell to the right.
3. **`apply(lambda obj: {(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if 0 <= j < len(I[0])}, x2)`:** Filters each shifted object, keeping only the cells within the grid's horizontal boundaries.
4. **`underpaint(I, merge(x3))`:**  Merges all the filtered objects and paints them onto the input grid `I`, but only on cells currently occupied by the background color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = fgpartition(I)
    x2 = apply(lambda obj: {(v, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if (i, j + 1) in asindices(I)}, x1) # Extend right if the new cell is within the grid
    O = underpaint(I, merge(x2))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Identifies non-background objects in the grid.
2. **`apply(...)`:** Iterates through each object and creates a new set of cells that represents the object extended one cell to the right, but only if that new cell is within the grid's boundaries (checked using `asindices(I)`). 
3. **`underpaint(I, merge(x2))`:** Merges the extended objects and paints them onto the input grid, respecting existing object boundaries.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = fgpartition(I)
    x2 = apply(lambda obj:  obj | {(v, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0]) and (v, (i, j + 1)) not in obj}, x1)  # Add the right cell to the object if it's in bounds and not already part of the object
    O = underpaint(I, merge(x2))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Gets all the non-background objects.
2. **`apply(...)`:** For each object, it adds a cell to its right if and only if:
    -  The new cell's column index (`j + 1`) is within the grid's bounds.
    -  The new cell is not already part of the object itself.
3. **`underpaint(I, merge(x2))`:** Merges all modified objects and paints them onto the original grid, ensuring that only background cells are affected.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = fgpartition(I)
    x2 = apply(lambda obj: {(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj} | {(v, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I,(i, j + 1)) == 0}, x1)
    O = paint(I, merge(x2))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Extracts non-background objects from the input grid.
2. **`apply(...)`:** This lambda function iterates over each object's cells:
    - It keeps the original cells.
    - It adds a cell to the right (`j + 1`) if the new cell is within the grid's boundaries (`0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0])`) and the new cell's value in the input grid is 0 (`index(I,(i, j + 1)) == 0`).
3. **`paint(I, merge(x2))`:** Merges all modified objects and paints them onto the original grid, potentially overwriting existing object pixels. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = objects(I, univalued = True, diagonal = False, without_bg = True)
    x2 = apply(lambda obj: {(v, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0]) and (v, (i, j + 1)) not in obj}, x1)
    O = underpaint(I, merge(x2))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`:** This line identifies connected components (objects) in the input grid `I`. The parameters specify that objects must have the same value for all cells (`univalued=True`), connections are only considered horizontally and vertically (`diagonal=False`), and the background color is excluded from object formation (`without_bg=True`).
2. **`apply(...)`:** Similar to previous versions, it iterates through each object and adds a rightward extension if the new cell is in bounds and not already part of the object.
3. **`underpaint(I, merge(x2))`:** This merges the extended objects and paints them onto the input grid, only affecting cells that were originally background.

These five programs provide distinct approaches to achieving the same image transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
