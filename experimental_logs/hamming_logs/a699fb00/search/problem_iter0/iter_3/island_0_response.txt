## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding a '2' to the right of each '1' in the input grid, but only if the '1' is the leftmost '1' in its respective row. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**
- The top-left '1' gets a '2' added to its right because it's the only '1' in that row.
- The bottom-left '1' also gets a '2' added for the same reason. 

**Input_1:**
- Similar to Input_0, all leftmost '1's in each row get a '2' added to their right.

**Input_2:**
- The pattern continues: only the leftmost '1's in each row get a '2' added.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if j > 0 and row[j-1] == 1 and row[j] == 0 and all(v != 1 for v in row[:j-1]) else v
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**
- This version iterates through each row and cell of the input grid `I`.
- For each cell, it checks if the current cell's value is 0, the previous cell's value is 1, and if there are no other '1's before the previous cell in that row.
- If all conditions are met, it places a '2' in the current cell; otherwise, it keeps the original value.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      branch(
        both(v == 0, j > 0 and row[j - 1] == 1 and all(x != 1 for x in row[:j - 1])), 
        2, 
        v
      )
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    ) for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**
- This version uses the `branch` function for a more structured approach. 
- It iterates through each row and cell like the previous version.
- For each cell, the `branch` function evaluates if the cell is 0 and if the previous cell is the leftmost '1' in the row. 
- If true, it places a '2'; otherwise, it keeps the original value.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      branch(
        both(v == 0, any((k == j - 1 and x == 1) for k, x in enumerate(row))),
        2,
        v
      )
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    ) for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**
- This version simplifies the condition by iterating through the row within the condition itself.
- It checks if the current cell is 0 and if there's a '1' immediately to its left using `any` and `enumerate`.
- If both conditions are true, it places a '2'; otherwise, it retains the original value.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            2 if k + 1 < len(row) and row[k] == 1 and row[k + 1] == 0 and all(x != 1 for x in row[:k]) else v
            for k, v in enumerate(row)
        )
        for row in I
    )
```

**Explanation:**
- This version streamlines the logic by checking for the leftmost '1' followed by a '0' directly.
- It iterates through each row and cell, checking if the current cell is '0', the previous cell is '1', and if no other '1's exist before it. 
- If these conditions are met, it places a '2'; otherwise, it retains the original value.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            branch(both(row[idx] == 0, idx > 0 and row[idx - 1] == 1 and 1 not in row[:idx - 1]), 2, row[idx])
            for idx in range(len(row))
        ) for row in I
    )
```

**Explanation:**
- This version breaks down the conditional logic for clarity. 
- For each row, it iterates through the cells.
- For each cell, the `branch` function checks: if the cell is '0', if it's not the first cell in the row, if the previous cell is '1', and if there are no other '1's before the previous cell.
- If true, it places a '2'; otherwise, it keeps the original cell value.
