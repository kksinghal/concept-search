## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding a '2' to the right of any '1' in the input grid, provided the cell to the right is the background color (most common color).

**Example:**

Input:

```
1 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

Output:

```
1 2 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 2 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: frozenset({(2, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I)}), objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:**  Identifies all distinct objects (connected components) of the same color in the input grid `I`, excluding the background.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: ... , objects(I, True, False, True))`:** Iterates through each object identified in the previous step. For each object, it creates a new set of cells by shifting each cell of the object one position to the right and setting the value to '2'. This shift and recoloring only occur if the right cell is within the grid bounds and currently has the background color.
3. **`merge(...)`:** Combines all the shifted and recolored cells from each object into a single set.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the newly generated cells (with value '2') onto the original input grid `I`, effectively implementing the transformation.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def shift_right(obj):
    return frozenset((2, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I))
  return paint(I, mfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), shift_right))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:**  Identifies distinct objects in the grid, excluding the background, similar to Version 1.
2. **`shift_right(obj)`:** This function takes an object as input and generates a new object where each cell is shifted one position to the right and assigned the value '2'. This shift only occurs if the right cell is within grid bounds and contains the background color.
3. **`mfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), shift_right)`:**  Applies the `shift_right` function to each object and merges the results.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged set of shifted and recolored cells onto the input grid `I`, achieving the desired transformation.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_object(obj):
    return frozenset((2, (i, j + 1)) if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I) else (v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(process_object, objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Extracts distinct objects from the input grid `I`, excluding the background.
2. **`process_object(obj)`:** This function processes each object by iterating through its cells. If a cell has a right neighbor within the grid bounds and the neighbor's value is the background color, it adds a new cell with value '2' to the right of the current cell. Otherwise, it keeps the original cell unchanged.
3. **`apply(process_object, objects(I, True, False, True))`:** Applies the `process_object` function to each object identified in the grid.
4. **`merge(...)`:**  Merges the processed objects into a single set.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the merged set of cells onto the original input grid, effectively implementing the desired transformation.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def extend_obj(obj):
        return frozenset({(2, (row, col + 1)) for val, (row, col) in obj if col < width(I) - 1 and I[row][col + 1] == mostcolor(I)})
    return paint(I, merge(apply(extend_obj, objects(I, True, False, True)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:**  Extracts distinct objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **`extend_obj(obj)`:** Takes an object as input and generates a new set of cells, where each cell is conditionally created by shifting the cells of the input object one position to the right and assigning them the value '2'. This shift and recoloring only occur if the right cell is within the grid bounds and currently contains the background color.
3. **`apply(extend_obj, objects(I, True, False, True))`:** Applies the `extend_obj` function to each object identified in the input grid.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the extended objects into a single set.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged set of cells onto the original input grid `I`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_fill(obj):
    return frozenset((2, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I))
  modified_objs = apply(right_fill, objects(I, True, False, True))
  return paint(I, merge(modified_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Identifies distinct objects in the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **`right_fill(obj)`:** Takes an object as input and generates a new set of cells by conditionally shifting each cell of the input object one position to the right and assigning them the value '2'. This shift and recoloring only occur if the right cell is within the grid bounds and contains the background color.
3. **`apply(right_fill, objects(I, True, False, True))`:** Applies the `right_fill` function to each identified object in the grid.
4. **`merge(modified_objs)`:** Merges all the modified objects into a single set.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the merged set of cells onto the input grid `I`.
