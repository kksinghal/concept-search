## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify objects (connected regions of the same digit) and add a '2' to the right of each '1' within these objects. The background color (most frequent digit) remains unchanged.

**Example:**

Input:

```
1 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

Output:

```
1 2 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 2 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects, excluding background
  shifted_cells = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if v == 1 and j < len(I[0]) - 1:  # Check for right edge
        shifted_cells.add((2, (i, j + 1)))
  return paint(I, frozenset(shifted_cells))  # Paint new cells onto grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Identifies objects in the grid using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Iterate and Shift:**  Iterates through each object's cells. If a cell contains '1' and is not on the right edge of the grid, it adds a '2' to its right by creating a new cell with value '2' at the shifted location.
3. **Paint:**  Paints the newly generated cells onto the original grid using `paint(I, frozenset(shifted_cells))`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, frozenset((2, (i, j + 1)) 
                            for i, row in enumerate(I) 
                            for j, v in enumerate(row) 
                            if v == 1 and j < len(row) - 1))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Combined Iteration and Painting:** This version combines iteration and painting into a single step using a generator expression within the `paint` function.
2. **Direct Modification:** It iterates directly over the grid's rows and cells, adding a '2' to the right of each '1' that is not on the grid's right edge.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grid = hconcat(crop(I, (0, 1), (len(I), len(I[0]) - 1)), ((0,) * len(I[0]),))
  return cellwise(I, shifted_grid, lambda a, b: 2 if a == 1 and b == 0 else a)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Grid:** Creates a shifted version of the grid where all elements are moved one position to the right using `hconcat` and `crop`.
2. **Cellwise Comparison:** Compares the original grid with the shifted grid cell by cell using `cellwise`.
3. **Conditional Replacement:** If a cell in the original grid contains '1' and the corresponding cell in the shifted grid is '0' (meaning a '1' was present to its left), it replaces the cell in the original grid with '2'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return paint(I, frozenset((2, add((i, j), RIGHT)) for obj in objs for v, (i, j) in obj if v == 1 and j < len(I[0]) - 1))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction and Shifting:**  Similar to version 1, this version extracts objects. It then uses the `add` function with `RIGHT` to calculate the shifted position for placing the '2'. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def shift_right(obj):
    return frozenset((v, add(loc, RIGHT)) for v, loc in obj if loc[1] < len(I[0]) - 1)

  return paint(I, merge(apply(shift_right, colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 1)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Functional Approach:** This version adopts a more functional approach by defining a separate function `shift_right` to handle the shifting of '1' cells within an object. 
2. **Filter and Apply:** It first filters the objects to get only those containing '1' using `colorfilter`. Then, it applies the `shift_right` function to each of these objects. Finally, it merges the results and paints them onto the original grid.
