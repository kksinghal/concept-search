## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending the non-background objects in the input grid one cell to the right, but only if that cell is currently the background color. 

Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**
* The '1' objects are extended rightward, filling in the '0's.

**Input_1:**
* The same logic applies; '1' objects extend rightward to fill adjacent background '0's.

**Input_2:**
*  Again, the non-background '1's expand rightward into the background '0' cells.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions for "Program_to_be_generated":

**Version 1:** (Using `fgpartition`, `apply`, and `underpaint`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)  # Determine the background color
  x1 = fgpartition(I)  # Separate non-background objects
  x2 = apply(lambda obj: {(v, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j + 1] == bg}, x1)  # Extend right if the next cell is background
  x3 = merge(x2) # Merge extensions
  O = underpaint(I, x3)  # Paint extensions onto the original grid
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:**  Finds the most frequent color in the grid, which is assumed to be the background.
2. **`x1 = fgpartition(I)`:**  Divides the grid into separate objects based on their color, excluding the background.
3. **`x2 = apply(...)`:**  For each object, it generates a new set of cells representing the rightward extension. It checks if an extension is possible (within grid bounds and into a background cell).
4. **`x3 = merge(x2)`:**  Combines the extended cells from all objects into a single set.
5. **`O = underpaint(I, x3)`:**  Paints the extended cells onto the original grid, effectively extending the objects.

**Version 2:** (Using `objects` and list comprehension)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = tuple(
      tuple(
          2 if (i, j + 1) in {(x, y + 1) for v, (x, y) in merge(objs) if 0 <= y + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[x][y + 1] == bg} else v 
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:** Determines the background color.
2. **`objs = objects(...)`:**  Extracts non-background objects from the grid.
3. **`O = ...`:**  Iterates through each cell in the grid. If a cell's right neighbor is part of an object's rightward extension (calculated using set comprehension), it changes the cell's value to 2 (or any other chosen indicator). Otherwise, it retains the original cell value.

**Version 3:** (Using nested loops)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  output = [[v for v in row] for row in I] # Create a mutable copy of the grid
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w - 1): 
      if I[i][j] != bg and I[i][j+1] == bg:
        output[i][j + 1] = 2
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in output)  
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:**  Identifies the background color.
2. **`h, w = len(I), len(I[0])`:**  Gets the height and width of the input grid.
3. **`output = ...`:**  Creates a mutable copy of the input grid for modification.
4. **Nested loops:** Iterates through each cell (except the last column). If a cell is not background and its right neighbor is background, it sets the right neighbor in the `output` grid to 2.
5. **`return ...`:**  Returns the modified grid.

**Version 4:** (Using `hconcat` and `crop`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = vconcat(
      tuple(
        hconcat(
          crop(I, (i, 0), (1, j)), 
          hconcat(((2,) if I[i][j] != bg and j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == bg else (I[i][j],), ), crop(I, (i, j + 1), (1, len(I[0]) - j - 1)))
        )
        for j in range(len(I[0]))
      )
    for i in range(len(I))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:**  Gets the background color.
2. **Nested loops (within `vconcat` and `hconcat`):** Iterates through each cell, dividing the grid into sections. It uses `crop` to extract subgrids and concatenates them with `hconcat`.  If a cell should be extended, it inserts a (2,) subgrid; otherwise, it uses the original cell.

**Version 5:** (Using `zip` and list comprehension)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = tuple(
      tuple(
        2 if j < len(row) - 1 and prev_v != bg and v == bg else v
        for j, (prev_v, v) in enumerate(zip(row, row[1:] + (bg,)))
      )
      for row in I
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1.  **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:**  Determines the background color.
2. **`O = ...`:**  Uses list comprehension and `zip` to iterate through each row and create a new row. For each cell, it checks if it needs to be extended by looking at the previous cell and the current cell. If the previous cell is not background and the current cell is background, it sets the current cell to 2.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to solve the same transformation problem, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL.
