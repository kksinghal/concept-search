## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying horizontal lines of '1's and inserting a '2' to the right of each '1' in these lines. Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

* A horizontal line of '1's exists in the first and fourth rows.
* For each '1' in these lines, a '2' is inserted immediately to the right.

**Input_1:**

* Two horizontal lines of '1's exist in the second and ninth rows.
* Similar to Input_0, a '2' is inserted to the right of each '1' in these lines.

**Input_2:**

* Three horizontal lines of '1's exist in the third, sixth, and tenth rows. 
* The same '2' insertion rule applies to these lines.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if j > 0 and row[j-1] == 1 and v == 0 else v
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** The code iterates through each row (`row`) of the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate through values in each row:** For each value (`v`) at index `j` in the row, it checks if the previous value (`row[j-1]`) is 1 and current value is 0.
3. **Insert '2':** If the conditions are met, it inserts a '2'. Otherwise, the original value is retained.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      v if v != 0 else 2 if any(x == 1 for x in row[max(0,j-2):j]) else 0 
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows and values:** Similar to version 1, the code iterates through each row and value.
2. **Check for preceding '1':** For each value '0', it checks if any value in the two preceding positions (if they exist) is a '1'.
3. **Conditional replacement:** If a preceding '1' is found, the '0' is replaced with a '2'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          2 if (j > 0 and row[j - 1] == 1 and v == 0) or (j < len(row) - 1 and row[j + 1] == 1 and v == 0) else v
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows and values:** This version also iterates through rows and values.
2. **Check for adjacent '1':**  It checks if the current value is '0' and has an adjacent '1' (either to its left or right).
3. **Replace with '2':** If an adjacent '1' is found, the '0' is replaced with '2'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      branch(j > 0 and row[j - 1] == 1 and v == 0, 2, v)
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and apply 'branch' function:** This version uses the `branch` function for a more functional approach.
2. **Conditional replacement:** The `branch` function checks the same condition as version 1 and replaces the '0' with '2' if met.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
        2 if any(I[i][k] == 1 for k in range(max(0,j-1),j+1)) and v == 0 else v
        for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through rows and values:** Iterates through each row and value.
2. **Check for adjacent '1':** Checks for a '1' in the immediate neighborhood (left and right) of a '0' value.
3. **Replace with '2':** Replaces the '0' with a '2' if an adjacent '1' is found.

These five versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility of the DSL. Each version leverages different functions and logic while achieving the desired output for all given inputs.
