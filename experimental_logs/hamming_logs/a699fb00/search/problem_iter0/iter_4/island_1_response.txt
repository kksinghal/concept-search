## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves changing the color of the digit '1' to '2' if it is to the left of another '1' digit.

**Input_0:**

- The '1' at (0, 1) changes to '2' because it is to the left of the '1' at (0, 2).
- The same logic applies to the '1' at (3, 1) changing to '2' due to the '1' at (3, 3).

**Input_1:**

-  This input follows the same pattern as Input_0, with multiple instances of '1's turning into '2's when they are to the left of another '1'. 

**Input_2:**

- Similar to the previous inputs, the transformation consistently applies to all '1's to the left of other '1's.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, shift(I, RIGHT), lambda x, y: 2 if x == 1 and y == 1 else x)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shift(I, RIGHT)`:** This shifts the entire grid one position to the right.
2. **`cellwise(I, shifted_grid, lambda x, y: 2 if x == 1 and y == 1 else x)`:** 
    - This function iterates through each cell of the original grid (`I`) and the shifted grid simultaneously.
    -  `x` represents the value in the original grid, and `y` represents the value in the shifted grid.
    - If `x` is '1' and `y` is '1' (meaning the original cell contains '1' and the cell to its right also contains '1'), it changes the value of the original cell to '2'. 
    - Otherwise, the original value (`x`) is retained.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  right_ones = shift(ones, RIGHT)
  overlap = intersection(ones, right_ones)
  return fill(I, 2, overlap)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = ofcolor(I, 1)`:** Finds the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **`right_ones = shift(ones, RIGHT)`:** Shifts the indices of the '1's one position to the right.
3. **`overlap = intersection(ones, right_ones)`:** Finds the indices that are common to both the original '1' indices and the right-shifted indices. These common indices represent the '1's that have another '1' to their right.
4. **`fill(I, 2, overlap)`:** Fills the grid `I` with the value '2' at the indices present in the `overlap` set.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, {(2 if index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == 1 else v, loc) for v, loc in asobject(I) if v == 1})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asobject(I)`:** Converts the grid `I` into an object representation, where each element is a tuple containing the value and its index.
2. **`(2 if index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == 1 else v, loc) for v, loc in asobject(I) if v == 1`:** Iterates through the object representation, filtering for elements with value '1'. For each such element:
   - It checks if the cell to the right (`index(I, add(loc, RIGHT))`) contains '1'. If it does, it changes the value to '2', otherwise, it keeps the original value ('1').
3. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the modified object representation back onto the original grid `I`. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  return tuple(tuple(2 if j < w - 1 and I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j+1] == 1 else I[i][j] for j in range(w)) for i in range(h))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested loops to iterate through the grid and directly modifies the cells.

1.  **`h, w = len(I), len(I[0])`:** Get the height and width of the grid.
2. **`tuple(tuple(...) for j in range(w)) for i in range(h)`:** Iterate through each cell using nested loops.
3. **`2 if j < w - 1 and I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j+1] == 1 else I[i][j]`**:
    - `j < w - 1` ensures we don't check beyond the right edge of the grid.
    - If the current cell and the cell to its right both contain '1', it changes the current cell's value to '2'.
    - Otherwise, it retains the original value.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted = shift(I, RIGHT)
  return tuple(tuple(branch(both(equality(I[i][j], 1), equality(shifted[i][j], 1)), 2, I[i][j]) for j in range(len(I[0]))) for i in range(len(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted = shift(I, RIGHT)`:**  Shifts the grid one position to the right.
2. **`tuple(tuple(...) for j in range(len(I[0]))) for i in range(len(I)))`:** Iterates through each cell using nested loops.
3. **`branch(both(equality(I[i][j], 1), equality(shifted[i][j], 1)), 2, I[i][j])`:**
    - It checks if both the current cell and the corresponding shifted cell contain '1' using `both` and `equality` functions.
    - If both are '1', it uses the `branch` function to return '2'; otherwise, it returns the original value from the current cell (`I[i][j]`).
