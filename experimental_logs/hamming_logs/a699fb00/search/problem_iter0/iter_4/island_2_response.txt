## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending each non-background object by one cell to the right, but only if that cell is empty (background color). 

**Input 0:**
- The top-right "1" object extends right to become "1 2". 
- The bottom-left "1" object extends right to become "1 2".

**Input 1 & 2:** 
- The same logic applies. Each isolated "1" becomes "1 2" by extending rightward into the adjacent empty space.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = fgpartition(I)  # Identify non-background objects
    x2 = apply(lambda obj: {(v, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I)}, x1)  # Extend right if within bounds and target is background
    O = underpaint(I, merge(x2))  # Paint extensions onto the original grid
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Isolates each non-background object from the input grid.
2. **`apply(...)`:**  Applies a lambda function to each object.
   -  **`{(v, (i, j + 1))...}`:** Creates a new set of cells, shifting each cell one position to the right.
   -  **`if 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0])...`:** Ensures the new cell is within the grid's horizontal boundaries.
   -  **`and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I)`:** Checks if the target cell is the background color.
3. **`merge(x2)`:** Combines all the extended objects.
4. **`underpaint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the combined extended objects onto the original grid, but only on background cells.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = fgpartition(I)
    x2 = apply(lambda obj: obj | {(v, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I)}, x1)
    O = paint(I, merge(x2))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version is similar to Version 1, but it uses set union (`|`) to directly add the extended cells to the original object within the `apply` function. 

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)  # Extract objects
  x2 = apply(lambda obj: {(v, (i + di, j + dj)) for v, (i, j) in obj for di, dj in {(0, 1)} if 0 <= j + dj < len(I[0]) and index(I, (i + di, j + dj)) == mostcolor(I)}, x1)  # Generate potential right extensions
  O = underpaint(I, merge(x2))  # Paint extensions onto the original grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses the more general `objects` function to extract objects and then iterates over a set of potential extension directions (`{(0, 1)}` for rightward extension).

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = fgpartition(I)
    x2 = mapply(lambda obj: {(v, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I)}, x1) # Directly merge extensions
    O = underpaint(I, x2) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses `mapply` to combine the `apply` and `merge` steps into one, directly merging the extensions from all objects.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    extended_objs = set()
    for obj in objs:
        for v, (i, j) in obj:
            if 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I):
                extended_objs.add((v, (i, j + 1)))
    O = underpaint(I, frozenset(extended_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses explicit loops instead of functional programming constructs to iterate over objects and cells, adding extensions to a new set.
