## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (groups of connected '1's) within the input grid and then replacing the digit '1' immediately to the right of each '1' in an object with a '2'. This replacement occurs only once per '1' and only if it's within the grid's boundaries.

**Example Breakdown:**

Consider Input_0:

```
1 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

Here are the transformations:

* **(0,0):**  The '1' at (0,0) is replaced with '1 2'.
* **(0,2):** The '1' at (0,2) is replaced with '1 2'.
* **(3,1):** The '1' at (3,1) is replaced with '1 2'.
* **(3,3):** The '1' at (3,3) remains as '1' because it's on the grid's right edge.


## Program Versions:

### Program Version 1: 

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if v == 1 and j + 1 < len(I[0]):
        I = fill(I, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies connected groups of '1's (objects) within the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate and Replace:** The code iterates through each object and its cells. 
   * For each cell with value '1', it checks if a cell exists to its right (`j + 1 < len(I[0])`). 
   * If so, it uses `fill(I, 2, {(i, j + 1)})` to replace the content of that cell with a '2'.
3. **Return Modified Grid:** Finally, the modified grid `I` is returned.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted = rot90(tophalf(rot270(I))) + rot90(bottomhalf(rot270(I)))
  return cellwise(I, shifted, lambda x, y: 2 if x == 1 and y == 1 else x)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Grid:**  The code first shifts the input grid one position to the right using a combination of rotations and splits:
   * `rot270(I)` rotates the grid 270 degrees counter-clockwise.
   * `tophalf` and `bottomhalf` split the rotated grid horizontally.
   * `rot90` rotates the halves 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
   * The `+` operator concatenates the rotated halves, effectively shifting the original grid one position to the right.
2. **Cellwise Comparison:** The `cellwise` function compares the original grid `I` and the shifted grid. 
   * A lambda function is used to determine the output for each cell: If both the original and shifted grids have a '1' in that position, the output is '2'; otherwise, the output is the original cell's value.
3. **Return Modified Grid:** The modified grid from `cellwise` is returned.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, {(2, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in asobject(I) if v == 1 and j + 1 < len(I[0])})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Cells to Replace:** The code uses a set comprehension to find the coordinates of all cells that need to be replaced with '2'.
   * It iterates over each cell in the input grid (converted to an object using `asobject(I)`).
   * For each cell with value '1' (`if v == 1`), it checks if the cell to its right is within the grid bounds (`j + 1 < len(I[0])`). 
   * If both conditions are met, the coordinates of the cell to the right are included in the set with the value '2'.
2. **Paint the Grid:** The `paint(I, ...)` function is used to apply these replacements onto the original grid `I`.
3. **Return Modified Grid:** The modified grid is returned. 

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    to_fill = set()
    for obj in objs:
      for v, (i, j) in obj:
        if v == 1:
          right_indices = {(i, x) for x in range(j+1, len(I[0]))}
          to_fill |= right_indices & toindices(obj)
    return fill(I, 2, to_fill)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies connected components (objects) of '1's in the input grid.
2. **Identify Right Neighbors:** For each object, the code iterates over its cells.
   * For cells containing '1', it creates a set `right_indices` of all indices to the right of the current cell within the same row.
   * The intersection (`&`) of `right_indices` with the indices of the current object (`toindices(obj)`) identifies the cells to be replaced with '2'.
3. **Fill Cells:** Finally, `fill(I, 2, to_fill)` fills all the identified cells in the input grid with '2'. 
4. **Return Modified Grid:** The function returns the modified grid.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])-1):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j+1] == 1:
        I = fill(I, 2, {(i, j+1)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through the Grid:** The code uses nested loops to iterate over each cell in the input grid `I`, except for the last column.
2. **Check for Adjacent '1's:**  For each cell, it checks if the current cell and the cell to its right both contain '1'. 
3. **Replace with '2':** If the condition is met, `fill(I, 2, {(i, j+1)})` replaces the cell to the right with '2'.
4. **Return Modified Grid:** After processing all cells, the modified grid `I` is returned.
