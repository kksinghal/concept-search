## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (groups of connected pixels with the same value) within the input grid and then filling the cell to the right of each object pixel with the value '2', provided that cell was originally the background color. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:**

- **Input:** Two objects formed by the digit '1' on a background of '0'.
- **Output:** The cell to the right of each '1' is filled with '2', but only if it was originally a '0'.

**Pair 1:**

- **Input:**  Several '1' objects scattered on a '0' background.
- **Output:**  Similar to Pair 0, '2' is filled to the right of each '1' within the object, but only if the original value was '0'.

**Pair 2:**

- **Input:** Similar to previous pairs, but with some objects located near the grid edges.
- **Output:** Transformation behaves consistently; '2' fills the rightward cell of each object pixel if it was initially background.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Extract objects
    bg = mostcolor(I)                   # Identify background color
    O = fill(I, bg, asindices(I))        # Initialize output with background
    for obj in objs:
        for v, (i, j) in obj:
            O = fill(O, v, {(i, j)})     # Place original object pixels 
            if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == bg:
                O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})  # Fill right with '2' if applicable
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Identifies objects in the input grid.
2. **Initialize Output:** Creates an output grid filled with the background color.
3. **Iterate and Fill:** Iterates over each object and its pixels. 
    - Places the original object pixel onto the output grid.
    - Checks if a rightward cell exists and was initially background. If so, fills it with '2'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(2 if j + 1 < len(row) and row[j + 1] == mostcolor(I) and v != mostcolor(I) else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

This program directly iterates through the input grid and applies the transformation to each cell based on its value and its right neighbor. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    def fill_right(obj):
        return fill(I, 2, {(i, j + 1) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == bg})
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        O = fill_right(obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects and Background:**  Identifies objects and background color.
2. **Define `fill_right`:**  Creates a function to fill cells to the right of object pixels with '2' if conditions are met.
3. **Apply `fill_right`:** Iterates through objects, applying the `fill_right` function to each.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    shifted = tuple(tuple(I[i][j+1] if j+1 < len(I[0]) else mostcolor(I) for j in range(len(I[0]))) for i in range(len(I)))
    return tuple(tuple(2 if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and shifted[i][j] == mostcolor(I) else I[i][j] for j in range(len(I[0]))) for i in range(len(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Shifted Grid:**  Creates a shifted version of the input grid, where each row is shifted one position to the left.
2. **Conditional Filling:**  Compares the original grid with the shifted grid. If a cell in the original grid is not the background color and its corresponding cell in the shifted grid is the background color, it fills that cell in the output grid with a '2'. Otherwise, it retains the original cell value. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(tuple(branch(j < len(row) - 1 and row[j + 1] == mostcolor(I) and v != mostcolor(I), 2, v) for j, v in enumerate(row)) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**
This program iterates over the input grid and applies the `branch` function to each cell.  The `branch` function checks if the cell's right neighbour exists, is the background color, and the current cell is not the background. If these conditions are true, it fills the cell with '2'; otherwise, it retains the original cell value.
