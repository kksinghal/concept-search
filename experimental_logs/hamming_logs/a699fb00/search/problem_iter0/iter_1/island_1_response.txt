## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions) of the digit '1' and adding the digit '2' to the right of each '1' within these objects, effectively extending them to the right.

**Example:**

Input:

```
1 0 1
0 1 0
```

Output:

```
1 2 1
0 1 2 
```


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  ones = mfilter(objs, lambda o: color(o) == 1)
  shifted = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), ones)
  O = paint(I, recolor(2, toindices(shifted)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' objects:** Find all connected regions of '1's using `objects` and filter for those with color '1' using `mfilter` and `color`.
2. **Shift right:** Shift each '1' object one position to the right using `mapply` and `shift`.
3. **Paint '2's:**  Convert the shifted indices back to an object representation using `toindices`, recolor it to '2' with `recolor`, and paint it onto the original grid using `paint`.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  shifted = shift(ones, RIGHT)
  valid_shifted = intersection(shifted, asindices(I))
  O = fill(I, 2, valid_shifted)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' indices:** Get the indices of all '1' cells in the grid using `ofcolor`.
2. **Shift indices:** Shift the indices one position to the right using `shift`.
3. **Validate indices:**  Keep only the shifted indices that are within the grid bounds using `intersection` and `asindices`.
4. **Fill with '2's:** Fill the validated indices with the digit '2' using `fill`.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 1 and j < len(row) - 1:
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and fill:** This version iterates through each cell in the grid. If a cell contains a '1' and is not on the rightmost edge, it fills the cell to its right with a '2'.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_rows = tuple(r[1:] + (0,) for r in I)
  O = tuple(
      tuple(2 if v == 1 and sr == 0 else v for v, sr in zip(r, sr)) 
      for r, sr in zip(I, shifted_rows)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift rows:** Create a new grid (`shifted_rows`) where each row is shifted one position to the right, padding with a '0' at the end.
2. **Compare and fill:**  Iterate through both the original grid and `shifted_rows` simultaneously. If a cell in the original grid contains a '1' and the corresponding cell in `shifted_rows` is '0' (meaning the original cell was followed by a '0'), fill the original cell with a '2'.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  ones_extended = frozenset(
      obj | recolor(2, shift(toindices(obj), RIGHT))
      for obj in objs if color(obj) == 1
  )
  O = paint(I, merge(ones_extended))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and extend '1' objects:**  Similar to Version 1, find connected regions of '1's. For each object of '1's, create a new object that includes the original object plus a shifted copy recoloured to '2'.
2. **Paint extended objects:** Merge all the extended objects using `merge` and paint them onto the original grid using `paint`.
