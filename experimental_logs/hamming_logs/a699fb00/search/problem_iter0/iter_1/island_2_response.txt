## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected components) of non-background color and expanding them horizontally by adding a cell of the same color to their right. This expansion should only occur within the grid boundaries.

**Examples:**

- **Input_0:** The two '1' objects are expanded to the right, resulting in '1 2' sequences.
- **Input_1 & Input_2:** Similar horizontal expansion is applied to all '1' objects within the grid.

## Program Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = fgpartition(I)  # Get objects of non-background color
  x2 = apply(lambda x: {(v, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in x if (i, j + 1) in asindices(I)}, x1)  # Expand each object to the right
  O = paint(I, merge(x2))  # Paint the expanded objects onto the original grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Identifies objects formed by non-background colors in the input grid.
2. **`apply(...)`:** Iterates over each object and creates a new set of cells representing the rightward expansion. It checks for grid boundaries before adding a cell.
3. **`merge(x2)`:** Combines the expanded cells from all objects.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the expanded cells onto the original grid, effectively expanding the objects.


## Program Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = fgpartition(I)  # Get objects of non-background color
  x2 = mapply(lambda x: {(color(x), (i, j + 1)) for i, j in toindices(x) if 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0])}, x1)  # Expand objects right, check boundaries
  O = paint(I, x2)  # Paint expanded cells onto the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Identifies objects formed by non-background colors in the input grid.
2. **`mapply(...)`:** Applies a function to each object and merges the results. The function identifies the object's color and expands it rightward, checking for grid boundaries using `0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0])`.
3. **`paint(I, x2)`:** Paints the expanded cells onto the original grid.

## Program Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Get univalued objects without background
  x2 = apply(lambda x: toobject(shift(x, (0, 1)), I), x1)  # Shift each object right and clip to grid
  O = paint(I, merge(x2))  # Paint shifted objects onto original grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Extracts univalued objects from the grid, excluding the background.
2. **`apply(...)`:** Applies a function to each object that shifts it one cell to the right. The `toobject` function ensures the shifted object stays within the grid boundaries.
3. **`merge(x2)`:** Combines all shifted objects.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the shifted objects onto the original grid.

## Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = fgpartition(I)  # Get non-background objects
  x2 = apply(lambda x: recolor(color(x), toindices(shift(x, (0, 1)))), x1)  # Shift and recolor
  x3 = mfilter(x2, lambda x: all((i, j) in asindices(I) for _, (i, j) in x))  # Filter out-of-bounds cells
  O = paint(I, x3)  # Paint the expanded objects
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Identifies objects formed by non-background colors.
2. **`apply(...)`:**  For each object: 
    - `shift(x, (0, 1))`: Shifts the object one cell to the right.
    - `toindices(...)`: Gets the indices of the shifted object.
    - `recolor(...)`: Recolors the indices with the original object's color.
3. **`mfilter(...)`:** Filters out cells that are outside the grid boundaries after shifting.
4. **`paint(I, x3)`:** Paints the remaining, valid expanded cells onto the original grid.

## Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = fgpartition(I)  # Identify non-background objects
  x2 = mapply(lambda x: {(v, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in x for di, dj in {(0, 1)} if (i + di, j + dj) in asindices(I)}, x1)  # Expand right if within bounds
  O = paint(I, x2)  # Paint the expanded objects onto the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Identifies objects formed by non-background colors.
2. **`mapply(...)`:** Applies a function to each object and merges the results. The function:
    - Iterates over each cell in the object.
    - Adds a cell to the right if it's within the grid boundaries (`(i + di, j + dj) in asindices(I)`).
3. **`paint(I, x2)`:** Paints the expanded cells onto the original grid.


These five versions offer diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation, each with its own logic and function combinations.
