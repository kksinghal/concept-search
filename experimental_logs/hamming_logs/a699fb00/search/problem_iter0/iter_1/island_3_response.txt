## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (groups of connected '1's) and adding a '2' to the right of each '1' within these objects, but only for the rightmost '1' in each row of the object. 

**Example:**

In Input_0:

```
1 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

The top-left '1' gets a '2' added to its right because it's the rightmost '1' in its row within that object. The other two '1's in that object don't get a '2' because they are not the rightmost '1' in their respective rows within the object.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def add_two_conditional(v, loc):
    i, j = loc
    # Check if the cell to the right is within the grid bounds
    if j + 1 < width(I) and I[i][j+1] == 0:
      return {(2, (i, j + 1))} if v == 1 else set()
    else:
      return set()
  new_cells = mpapply(add_two_conditional, asobject(I), asindices(I)) 
  O = paint(I, new_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`add_two_conditional(v, loc)`:** This function is similar to `add_two` from the erroneous program, but it includes a check to see if adding a '2' to the right is possible within the grid's boundaries and if the right cell is empty (0). 
2. **`mpapply(add_two_conditional, asobject(I), asindices(I))`:**  We apply this conditional function to every cell in the grid using `asobject(I)` and `asindices(I)` to get the cell value and location.
3. **`paint(I, new_cells)`:** Finally, we paint the new '2' cells onto the original grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  new_cells = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(height(obj)):
      # Get the rightmost cell for each row in the object
      rightmost_cell = max(sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda x: x[0] == i + uppermost(obj)), key=lambda x: x[1], default=None)
      if rightmost_cell:
        new_cells.add((2, (rightmost_cell[0], rightmost_cell[1] + 1)))
  O = paint(I, frozenset(new_cells))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identify the objects within the grid.
2. **Iterate through objects and rows:** Loop through each object and then each row of the object.
3. **`rightmost_cell`:** For every row in an object, find the rightmost cell using `max` and `sfilter`.
4. **Add '2' to the right:** Add a '2' to the right of the `rightmost_cell` if it exists.
5. **`paint(I, frozenset(new_cells))`:**  Paint the new '2' cells onto the original grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def shift_right_conditional(obj):
    new_obj = set()
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if (v, (i, j+1)) not in obj and j + 1 < width(I):
        new_obj.add((2, (i, j + 1)))
    return frozenset(new_obj)
  
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  new_cells = mapply(shift_right_conditional, objs)
  O = paint(I, new_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shift_right_conditional(obj)`:** This function takes an object and conditionally adds a '2' to the right of each cell, but only if a cell of the same object doesn't already exist to its right and it's within the grid's bounds.
2. **`mapply(shift_right_conditional, objs)`:** We apply this function to each object using `mapply`. 
3. **`paint(I, new_cells)`:** Finally, we paint the new '2' cells onto the original grid. 

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_row(row, i):
    new_row = list(row)
    last_one_index = None
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v == 1:
        last_one_index = j
    if last_one_index is not None and last_one_index + 1 < len(row):
      new_row[last_one_index + 1] = 2
    return tuple(new_row)
  
  O = tuple(process_row(row, i) for i, row in enumerate(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`process_row(row, i)`:** This function takes a row and its index as input. It finds the last occurrence of '1' in the row. If the last occurrence is not the last element of the row, it replaces the next element with '2'.
2. **Apply to each row:** The code then iterates through each row of the input grid and applies the `process_row` function to it.
3. **Return modified grid:** Finally, it returns the modified grid as a tuple of tuples. 

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def add_two_to_right(obj):
    return frozenset((2, (i, j+1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j + 1 < width(I) and (v, (i, j+1)) not in obj)
  
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  new_objs = apply(add_two_to_right, objs)
  new_cells = merge(new_objs)
  O = paint(I, new_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`add_two_to_right(obj)`:** This function takes an object and returns a new set of cells with '2' added to the right of each cell in the object, but only if it's within the grid's bounds and a cell of the same object doesn't already exist to its right.
2. **`apply(add_two_to_right, objs)`:** It applies this function to each object in the input grid using `apply`.
3. **`merge(new_objs)`:** It then merges the resulting sets of new cells into a single set.
4. **`paint(I, new_cells)`:** Finally, it uses `paint` to apply these new cells to the input grid, effectively adding the '2's to the right of the rightmost '1's in each object.
