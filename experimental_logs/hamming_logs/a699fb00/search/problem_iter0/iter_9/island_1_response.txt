## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of value '1' and placing a '2' to the right of each cell within those objects. The transformation only occurs if the cell to the right is empty (value '0').

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The top-right '1' doesn't change because there's no space to its right. The other two '1's get a '2' placed to their right.
* **Input_1 & Input_2:**  The same logic applies.  Notice how '1's on the far-right edge don't get a '2' placed.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Finds objects of value 1, shifts them right,
  and fills the overlapping cells with 2 if originally empty. 
  """
  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, 1) 
  shifted_right = shift(ones_indices, RIGHT)
  overlap = intersection(ones_indices, shifted_right)
  O = fill(I, 2, overlap)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)`:**  Finds the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **`shifted_right = shift(ones_indices, RIGHT)`:**  Shifts those indices one position to the right.
3. **`overlap = intersection(ones_indices, shifted_right)`:** Calculates the indices where the original and shifted objects overlap. This represents the cells to the right of each '1'.
4. **`O = fill(I, 2, overlap)`:** Fills the overlapping indices with the value '2'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Iterates through each cell,
  placing a 2 to the right if conditions are met.
  """
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and j < w-1 and I[i][j+1] == 0:
        O[i][j+1] = 2 
      else:
        O[i][j] = I[i][j] 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h, w = len(I), len(I[0])`:**  Gets the height and width of the input grid.
2. **`O = canvas(0, (h, w))`:** Creates an empty output grid of the same size.
3. **Iterate through cells:** Loops through each cell in the input grid.
4. **`if I[i][j] == 1 and j < w-1 and I[i][j+1] == 0`:**  Checks if the current cell is '1', not on the right edge, and the cell to its right is '0'.
5. **`O[i][j+1] = 2`:** If conditions are met, place a '2' in the output grid to the right of the current cell.
6. **`else: O[i][j] = I[i][j]`:**  Otherwise, copy the input cell directly to the output.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Uses object detection and manipulation
  to achieve the transformation.
  """
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  modified_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), filtered_objs)
  O = I
  for obj in modified_objs:
    O = underpaint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(...)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid.
2. **`filtered_objs = sfilter(...)`:** Keeps only the objects with color '1'.
3. **`modified_objs = mapply(...)`:**  Shifts each filtered object one position to the right.
4. **Iterate and underpaint:**  Loops through the modified objects and paints them onto the input grid, only filling cells that were originally the background color (likely '0').

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Combines horizontal splitting and concatenation
  for a unique approach.
  """
  left, right = hsplit(I, 2)
  modified_right = replace(right, 1, 2)
  O = hconcat(left, modified_right) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`left, right = hsplit(I, 2)`:** Splits the input grid into two halves vertically.
2. **`modified_right = replace(right, 1, 2)`:**  Replaces all occurrences of '1' in the right half with '2'. 
3. **`O = hconcat(left, modified_right)`:** Concatenates the left half and the modified right half horizontally.

**Program Version 5:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Applies a custom function to each cell 
  based on its neighbor's value.
  """
  def modify_cell(i, j):
    if j > 0 and I[i][j-1] == 1 and I[i][j] == 0:
      return 2
    else:
      return I[i][j]
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = tuple(tuple(modify_cell(i, j) for j in range(w)) for i in range(h)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`modify_cell(i, j)`:** Defines a custom function that takes cell indices and returns:
   - '2' if the cell is '0' and the cell to its left is '1'.
   - The original cell value otherwise.
2. **Nested loops and function application:**  Iterates through the grid and applies the `modify_cell` function to each cell, creating a new output grid.
