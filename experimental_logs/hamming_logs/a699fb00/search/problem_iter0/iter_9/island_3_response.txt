## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) consisting of the digit '1', and then changing the color of the cell to the right of each '1' to '2', but only if that cell is within the bounds of the grid and its original value is '0'.

**Input_0:**

- Two objects are detected, one in the top row and one in the bottom row.
- For each '1' in both objects, the cell to its right is changed to '2', as long as it was initially '0'.

**Input_1:**

-  This input features more objects, with '1's scattered throughout the grid.
-  Similar to Input_0, the transformation is applied to each '1', changing the cell to its right to '2' if applicable.

**Input_2:**

-  Like the previous inputs, the same logic is applied here.
-  Notice that the transformation respects the grid boundaries; if a '1' is on the rightmost edge, no changes occur.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, frozenset((2, (i, j + 1)) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) for v, (i, j) in obj if v == 1 and j + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j + 1] == 0))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Extracts objects from the grid `I`, considering only directly connected cells (`F`) and excluding the background (`T`).
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):`**: Iterates through each identified object.
3. **`for v, (i, j) in obj:`**:  For each cell `(i, j)` with value `v` within the current object.
4. **`if v == 1 and j + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j + 1] == 0:`**: Checks if the cell value is '1', if the cell to the right is within the grid bounds, and if the cell to the right is '0'.
5. **`(2, (i, j + 1))`**: If the conditions hold, prepares a new cell with value '2' at the position to the right of the current cell.
6. **`frozenset(...)`**: Collects all the new cells into a frozenset.
7. **`paint(I, ...)`**:  Paints the new cells onto the original grid `I`, resulting in the transformed grid.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, frozenset((2, astuple(i, j + 1)) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) for v, (i, j) in obj if v == 1 and j + 1 < width(I) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version is similar to Version 1 but uses `astuple(i, j + 1)` to construct the tuple for the new cell's location and `width(I)` to check the grid's width instead of `len(I[0])`.
- It also uses `index(I, (i, j + 1))` to access the value of the cell to the right.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grid = hconcat(crop(I, (0, 1), (height(I), width(I) - 1)), ((0,) * width(I),))
  return cellwise(I, shifted_grid, lambda a, b: 2 if a == 1 and b == 0 else a)
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses a different approach by creating a shifted copy of the grid (`shifted_grid`) where all the columns are shifted one position to the left, padding the rightmost column with zeros.
- It then uses `cellwise` to compare each cell in the original grid with the corresponding cell in the shifted grid.
- If a cell in the original grid is '1' and the corresponding cell in the shifted grid is '0', it changes the cell value to '2'. Otherwise, it keeps the original value.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, mapply(lambda c: (2, (c[0], c[1] + 1)) if c[1] + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[c[0]][c[1] + 1] == 0 else None, sfilter(asobject(I), lambda x: x[0] == 1)))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version first converts the input grid `I` into an object representation using `asobject`.
- It then uses `sfilter` to filter out all cells whose value is not '1'.
- For the remaining cells, it applies a lambda function using `mapply` that checks if the cell to the right is within the grid bounds and has a value of '0'.
- If the conditions are met, the lambda function returns a new cell with value '2' at the position to the right of the current cell. Otherwise, it returns `None`.
- Finally, it uses `paint` to paint the new cells onto the original grid `I`.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, frozenset((2, (i, j + 1)) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(row) if v == 1 and j + 1 < len(row) and row[j + 1] == 0))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates through each cell of the grid `I` using nested loops.
- For each cell with value '1', it checks if the cell to its right is within the row bounds and has a value of '0'.
- If the conditions are met, it adds a new cell with value '2' at the position to the right of the current cell to a frozenset.
- Finally, it paints the new cells onto the original grid `I` using `paint`.
