## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves inserting the digit '2' to the right of every '1' in the input grid, but only if this '1' is the last one in its row.

**Example:**

Input Row: `0 1 0 1 0` 
Output Row: `0 1 2 1 0` 

Let's analyze this transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**
-  The '1' at (0, 1) is followed by a '1' in the same row, so no '2' is inserted.
-  The '1' at (3, 1) is the last '1' in its row, so a '2' is inserted after it.

**Input_1 & Input_2:**
- The same logic applies to these examples. Each '1' that is the last one in its row gets a '2' inserted after it.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:** (Inspired by Program_B's conditional logic and row iteration)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          2 if j == len(row) - 1 and v == 1 else v
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**
- Iterates through each row of the input grid `I`.
- For each cell (value `v` at index `j`):
  - If it's the last cell (`j == len(row) - 1`) and the value is '1' (`v == 1`), replace it with '2'.
  - Otherwise, keep the original value (`v`).

**Program Version 2:** (Using functional programming with `apply` and `rapply`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return apply(
    lambda row: tuple(rapply(
      lambda j, v: 2 if j == len(row) - 1 and v == 1 else v,
      enumerate(row)
    )),
    I
  )
```

**Explanation:**
- Applies a function to each row of the grid `I` using `apply`.
- Within each row, it uses `rapply` to iterate through the cell indices and values.
- The lambda function checks for the last cell with value '1' and replaces it with '2', similar to Version 1.

**Program Version 3:** (Using `hsplit`, `hconcat`, and focusing on modifying the last cell)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  split_grid = hsplit(I, width(I)) 
  return hconcat(
      tuple(row[:-1] + (2,) if row[-1] == 1 else row for row in split_grid),
      ()  # Empty tuple for hconcat
  )
```

**Explanation:**
- Splits the grid into individual columns using `hsplit`.
- Iterates through each column (which is now a row).
- If the last element of the column is '1', it replaces it with '2'.
- Concatenates the modified columns back into a grid using `hconcat`.

**Program Version 4:** (Leveraging object representation and `objects`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 1 and rightmost(obj) == width(I) - 1:
      I = paint(I, recolor(2, shift(obj, (0, 1))))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**
- Identifies objects (connected areas of the same color) in the grid using `objects`.
- Iterates through each object:
  - If the object's color is '1' and its rightmost cell is on the grid's right edge:
    - It repaints the object, shifted one position to the right, with color '2'.
- Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 5:** (Direct manipulation using nested loops and conditional replacement)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  result = list(list(row) for row in I)
  for i in range(h):
      for j in range(w):
          if I[i][j] == 1 and j == w - 1:
              result[i][j] = 2
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in result)
```

**Explanation:**
- Iterates directly through the grid's cells using nested loops.
- Replaces the last cell of a row with '2' if it contains a '1'.
- Returns the modified grid.

These are just five examples. You can combine the functions from the DSL in various ways to achieve the same transformation. The key is to analyze the logic behind the transformation and express it using the available functions.
