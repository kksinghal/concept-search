## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects formed by the digit '1' to the right by one cell, but only if that cell is currently the background color (most common color). 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

* **Input_0:** The '1's in the top-right and bottom-left corners extend rightward, filling in the '0's. The '1's on the right edge don't extend because they are already at the border.
* **Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0, the '1' objects extend to the right only if the adjacent cell is a '0'. This creates a pattern where '1's are followed by a single '2'.
* **Input_2:** Same logic applies; only '1' objects with an adjacent '0' on their right get extended.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Find all objects formed by '1'
    extensions = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((2, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < width(I) - 1 and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I)), objs)
    return paint(I, merge(extensions))  # Paint the extensions onto the original grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Identifies connected components of '1's in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **`mapply(...)`:** Iterates through each object and applies a lambda function:
   -  For each cell `(i, j)` in the object, it checks if the cell to the right `(i, j+1)` is within the grid bounds and if it contains the background color. If both conditions are true, it creates a new cell `(2, (i, j+1))` representing the extension.
3. **`merge(extensions)`:** Combines all the extensions into a single set.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Overlays the extensions onto the original grid `I`, resulting in the desired output.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
  return paint(I, merge(prapply(lambda i, j: {(2, (i, j + 1))} if j < width(I) - 1 and index(I, (i, j)) == 1 and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I) else {}, range(height(I)), range(width(I)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`prapply(...)`:**  Applies a lambda function to each cell `(i, j)` in the grid using Cartesian product:
   - Checks if the cell contains '1', if the right neighbor is within bounds, and if the right neighbor is the background color.
   - If true, creates an extension cell `(2, (i, j + 1))`; otherwise, an empty set.
2. **`merge(...)`:** Merges all extension cells into a single set.
3. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged extensions onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
  return tuple(tuple(2 if j < width(I) - 1 and v == 1 and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I) else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Nested loops:** Iterates through each cell `(i, j)` and its value `v` in the grid.
2. **Conditional replacement:**
   - Checks if the cell is '1', if the right neighbor is within bounds, and if the right neighbor is the background color.
   - If true, replaces the cell value with '2'; otherwise, keeps the original value.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
  shifted = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)  # Shift grid right
  overlay = cellwise(I, shifted, mostcolor(I))  # Overlay shifted grid
  return replace(overlay, 1, 2)  # Replace overlapping '1's with '2's
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)`:**  Shifts the entire grid one cell to the right.
2. **`cellwise(I, shifted, mostcolor(I))`:**  Overlays the original and shifted grids, keeping '1's only where they overlap with the background color in the original grid.
3. **`replace(overlay, 1, 2)`:** Replaces all remaining '1's in the overlay with '2's, achieving the desired extension.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I) - 1):
            if I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I):
                O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through the grid:** Loops over each cell in the grid.
2. **Check for conditions:**  If a cell contains '1' and its right neighbor is the background color, proceed.
3. **Fill with '2':**  Fills the right neighbor cell with '2' in the output grid `O`.
4. **Return modified grid:**  Returns the modified grid `O` with the extensions.
