## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit excluding the background color) and extending them one cell to the right, but only within the grid boundaries and only filling in cells that were originally background.

**Input 0:**

- The '1' objects are extended to the right by one cell. 
- The top right corner '1' does not extend as it is at the grid boundary.

**Input 1:**

- All '1' objects are extended to the right by one cell.
- Similar to Input 0, objects at the right boundary are not extended.

**Input 2:**

- This input further demonstrates the boundary condition, with several objects touching the right edge and not being extended.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions that achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = fgpartition(I)  # Get non-background objects
  x2 = apply(lambda obj: {(v, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0]) and (i, j + 1) not in toindices(merge(x1))}, x1)  # Extend right if in bounds and not overlapping another object
  O = underpaint(I, merge(x2))  # Paint onto background cells only
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `fgpartition(I)` gets all objects except the background.
2. **Extend right:** For each object, add a cell to the right if:
    - It's within grid bounds (`0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0])`).
    - It doesn't overlap with any other object (`(i, j + 1) not in toindices(merge(x1))`).
3. **Paint:** Use `underpaint` to only paint onto cells that were initially background.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = fgpartition(I) # Identify objects
  x2 = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj,(0,1)), x1) # Shift all objects one cell right
  x3 = apply(lambda obj: {(v, (i,j)) for v, (i,j) in obj if 0 <= j < len(I[0])}, x2) # Remove cells outside boundaries
  O = underpaint(I, merge(x3)) # Underpaint onto original grid
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `fgpartition(I)` gets all objects except the background.
2. **Shift right:** `shift(obj,(0,1))` moves each object one cell to the right.
3. **Boundary check:**  Removes cells shifted outside the right boundary.
4. **Paint:** `underpaint` applies the shifted objects to the original grid, only filling background cells.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = fgpartition(I)  # Identify non-background objects
  x2 = apply(lambda x: toobject(shift(toindices(x), (0, 1)), I), x1)  # Shift indices right, filter by grid, convert to object
  O = underpaint(I, merge(x2))  # Paint the shifted objects onto the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `fgpartition(I)` identifies all objects except the background.
2. **Shift and filter:** 
    - `toindices(x)` extracts the indices of each object.
    - `shift(..., (0, 1))` shifts these indices one position to the right.
    - `toobject(..., I)` filters the shifted indices, keeping only those within the grid bounds and assigning corresponding values from the grid.
3. **Paint:** `underpaint` merges the shifted objects and paints them onto the original grid, filling only background cells.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = fgpartition(I)  # Get non-background objects
  x2 = apply(lambda x: {(v, (i, min(j + 1, len(I[0]) - 1))) for v, (i, j) in x}, x1)  # Shift right, clamp to boundary
  O = underpaint(I, merge(x2))  # Paint onto background cells only
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `fgpartition(I)` extracts non-background objects.
2. **Shift and clamp:** For each object:
   -  Shifts its cells to the right.
   -  `min(j + 1, len(I[0]) - 1)` ensures the column index doesn't exceed the grid boundary.
3. **Paint:** `underpaint` paints the shifted objects onto the original grid, affecting only background cells.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)  # Get objects
  shifted_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if j + 1 < len(I[0]) and (i, j + 1) not in toindices(merge(objs)): # Check right boundary and overlap
        shifted_objs.add((v, (i, j + 1)))  # Add shifted cell to new object
  O = underpaint(I, frozenset(shifted_objs))  # Paint new objects onto the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `fgpartition(I)` gets all objects except the background.
2. **Iterate and Shift:**  Iterates through each object and its cells.  For each cell, checks if a right shift is possible (within bounds and no overlap). If possible, the shifted cell is added to `shifted_objs`.
3. **Paint:** `underpaint` paints the `shifted_objs` onto the original grid, only filling background cells. 

These are just five examples; many other valid DSL programs can achieve the same transformation. The key is to understand the spatial reasoning involved and leverage the provided DSL functions effectively.
