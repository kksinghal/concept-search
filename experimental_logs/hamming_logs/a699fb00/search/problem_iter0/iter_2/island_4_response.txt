## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit excluding the background color) and extending them to the right by one cell, but only if the target cell is currently the background color.

**Input_0:**

* The '1' objects are extended to the right.

**Input_1:**

* Similar to Input_0, '1' objects are extended rightward into background cells.

**Input_2:**

*  Again, '1' objects extend rightward into background cells.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL from `dsl.py`:

**Version 1 (Inspired by Program_A's structure, Program_B's cell-iteration):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        for v, (i, j) in obj:
            if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I):
                O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` finds connected regions of the same digit, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** The code iterates over each object and its cells. If a cell has the background color to its right, it's filled with '2'.

**Version 2 (Using `apply` for functional style):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_right(obj):
    return fill(I, 2, {(i, j + 1) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I)})
  return apply(extend_right, objects(I, True, False, True)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_right` Function:** Defines a function to extend an object rightward if possible.
2. **`apply` for Transformation:**  Applies `extend_right` to each object found in the input grid.

**Version 3 (Leveraging `sfilter` and set operations):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    def right_fillable(obj):
        return {(i, j + 1) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == bg}
    fillable_indices = merge(apply(right_fillable, objs))
    return fill(I, 2, fillable_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Fillable Indices:**  Identifies indices of cells right of objects that are background color.
2. **Fill in One Go:**  Uses `fill` to color all identified indices at once.

**Version 4 (Using `papply` for paired iteration):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        indices = toindices(obj)
        right_indices = {(i, j + 1) for i, j in indices}
        def fill_condition(a, b):
            return b == mostcolor(I)
        fillable = mpapply(fill_condition, indices, right_indices)
        O = fill(O, 2, fillable)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Paired Indices:**  Gets indices of object cells and their right neighbors.
2. **`papply` for Condition:** Applies `fill_condition` to pairs of indices to check for background color.
3. **Fill Based on Condition:** Fills cells where the condition holds true.

**Version 5 (Concise `for` loop with conditional fill):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Combines object finding and conditional filling within a single loop for conciseness.

These diverse solutions showcase various ways to achieve the desired grid transformation using the provided DSL. Each version employs a different combination of functions and logic, offering flexibility and potentially improved efficiency depending on the specific input data.
