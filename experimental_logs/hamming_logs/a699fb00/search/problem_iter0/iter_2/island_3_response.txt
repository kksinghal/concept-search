## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently adds a '2' to the right of each '1' in the input grid, but only for the rightmost '1' in a horizontal sequence of '1's. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

* The top-right '1' gets a '2' added to its right.
* The bottom-left '1' gets a '2' added to its right. 

**Input_1:**

* Every rightmost '1' in each horizontal sequence of '1's gets a '2' added to its right.

**Input_2:**

* Similar to Input_1, only the rightmost '1' in each horizontal sequence gets a '2' added.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  new_cells = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if v == 1 and (i, j+1) not in toindices(obj):
        new_cells.add((2, (i, j + 1)))
  O = paint(I, frozenset(new_cells))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  We use `objects(I, T, F, T)` to get a set of objects, excluding the background (0).
2. **Iterate and check:** We iterate through each object and each cell within. If a cell's value is '1' and the cell to its right is not part of the same object (meaning it's not a '1'), we add a new cell with value '2' to the right.
3. **Paint the changes:**  We paint the new cells onto the original grid using `paint`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1) 
  right_ones = sfilter(ones, lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1]+1) not in ones)
  new_cells = apply(lambda loc: (2, (loc[0], loc[1]+1)), right_ones)
  O = paint(I, frozenset(new_cells))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find all '1's:** We use `ofcolor(I, 1)` to get the indices of all cells with value '1'.
2. **Filter for rightmost '1's:**  We use `sfilter` to keep only the '1' indices where the cell to the right is not also a '1'.
3. **Create new cells:** We apply a lambda function to transform each rightmost '1' index into a new cell index with value '2' to its right.
4. **Paint:** Finally, we paint these new cells onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  new_grid = tuple(tuple(1 if v == 1 and j == len(row)-1 else 2 if v == 1 and row[j+1] == 0 else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for row in I)
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested list comprehensions for a more direct approach:

1. **Iterate through rows and cells:**  We iterate over each row and each cell within the row.
2. **Conditional replacement:**  We use a conditional expression to check:
    * If a cell is '1' and it's the last cell in the row, keep it as '1'.
    * If a cell is '1' and the next cell is '0', replace it with '2'.
    * Otherwise, keep the original cell value.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  shifted = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)
  filtered = sfilter(shifted, lambda cell: cell[1] in asindices(I) and I[cell[1][0]][cell[1][1]] == 0 and index(I, subtract(cell[1], RIGHT)) == 1)
  new_cells = apply(lambda cell: (2, cell[1]), filtered)
  O = paint(I, frozenset(new_cells))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift the grid:** We shift the entire grid one position to the right using `shift` and `asobject`.
2. **Filter for valid '2' positions:** We keep only the shifted cells that meet the following conditions:
    * The shifted cell's index is still within the grid boundaries.
    * The original cell at the shifted position is '0' (background).
    * The original cell to the left of the shifted cell was a '1'.
3. **Extract new cell data:** We extract the indices and set the value to '2' for the filtered cells.
4. **Paint:** We paint these new cells onto the original grid. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def process_row(row):
    new_row = []
    for j in range(len(row)):
      if row[j] == 1:
        if j == len(row) - 1 or row[j + 1] == 0:
          new_row.append(2)
        else:
          new_row.append(1)
      else:
        new_row.append(row[j])
    return tuple(new_row)

  return tuple(process_row(row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Helper Function:** Define a helper function `process_row` to handle individual rows.
2. **Iterate and Modify:** The function iterates through each cell in a row and applies the transformation logic:
   - If a '1' is found and it's the last element or the next element is '0', replace it with a '2'.
   - Otherwise, preserve the existing cell value.
3. **Apply to Each Row:** Apply the `process_row` function to each row in the input grid `I`.

These are five distinct ways to achieve the desired transformation. Each version utilizes different DSL functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
