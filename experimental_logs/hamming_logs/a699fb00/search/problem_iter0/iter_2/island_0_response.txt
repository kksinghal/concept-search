## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0:** Each '1' value in the input grid retains its position and also adds a '2' to its immediate right if that position is within the grid bounds.

**Input 1:** Similar to Input 0, each '1' retains its position and adds a '2' to its right, but only for the rightmost '1' in each horizontal sequence of '1's.

**Input 2:** This input follows the same pattern as Input 1, extending it to handle various object configurations and placements.

## Code Generation:

**Program_to_be_generated:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  for obj in objs:
    rightmost_one = argmax(toindices(obj), lambda x: x[1])
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if (i, j) == rightmost_one:
        h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
        if j + 1 < w:
          I = fill(I, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies connected components of '1's in the input grid 'I', excluding the background.
2. **Find Rightmost '1':**  For each object, `argmax(toindices(obj), lambda x: x[1])` finds the rightmost '1' within the object by maximizing the column index (`x[1]`).
3. **Conditional Fill:** Only if the current cell `(i, j)` is the rightmost '1' in its object, it checks for grid boundaries and fills a '2' to its right using `fill(I, 2, {(i, j + 1)})`.
4. **Return Modified Grid:** Finally, the function returns the modified grid 'I'.

## Program Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated_v1(I):
  return paint(I, merge({recolor(2, {(i, j + 1)}) if j + 1 < len(I[0]) else frozenset() for row in objects(I, True, False, True) for v, (i, j) in row if (i,j) == argmax(toindices(row), lambda x: x[1])}))
```

**Explanation:**  This version compresses the logic into a single line using nested comprehensions and set operations. It identifies objects, finds the rightmost '1' in each object, conditionally creates a set with the '2' fill location, merges these sets, and paints the final result onto the input grid.

## Program Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated_v2(I):
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v == 1 and j + 1 < len(row) and row[j+1] == 0 and (j == 0 or row[j-1] != 1):
        I = fill(I, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:** This version iterates over each cell in the grid. It identifies the rightmost '1' in a horizontal sequence by checking for a '1' with a '0' to its right and no '1' to its left. If these conditions are met, it fills a '2' to the right.

## Program Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated_v3(I):
  return tuple(tuple(2 if j + 1 < len(row) and row[j+1] == 0 and (j == 0 or row[j-1] != 1) else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for row in I) 
```

**Explanation:** This version uses nested comprehensions to directly manipulate the grid values. It applies the same rightmost '1' identification logic as Version 2 within the comprehension to conditionally replace '0's with '2's.

## Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated_v4(I):
  return hconcat(
    *((fill(g, 2, {(i, 1)}) if g[0][1] == 0 and g[0][0] == 1 else g) 
      for i, g in enumerate(hsplit(I, 1)))
  )
```

**Explanation:** This version splits the grid into individual columns, then checks each column for a '1' followed by a '0'. If found, it fills a '2' in the second position and then horizontally concatenates the modified columns back together.

## Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated_v5(I):
  shifted = rot90(tophalf(rot270(I))) + rot90(bottomhalf(rot270(I)))
  return cellwise(I, shifted, lambda x, y: 2 if x == 1 and y == 0 else x)
```

**Explanation:** This version leverages grid manipulations. It shifts the grid one position to the right, then compares the original and shifted grids cell-wise. If a cell in the original grid is '1' and the corresponding cell in the shifted grid is '0', it replaces the original cell with '2'. This effectively identifies the rightmost '1' in horizontal sequences.
