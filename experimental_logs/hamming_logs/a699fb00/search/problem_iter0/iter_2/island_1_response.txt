## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects with the value "1" and extending them to the right by one cell, filling the new cell with the value "2". 

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0:** The two "1" objects are extended to the right. The top right corner of the grid remains unchanged as there is no space for extension.
* **Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0, all "1" objects are extended rightward. Again, the objects at the edge of the grid are not extended beyond the grid boundary.
* **Input_2:** The pattern remains consistent. All "1" objects are extended to the right with a "2", respecting the grid boundaries.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Identify connected components of 1s
  ones = colorfilter(objs, 1)  # Filter for objects with color 1
  shifted = mapply(lambda obj: shift(toindices(obj), RIGHT), ones) # Shift indices right
  O = paint(I, recolor(2, shifted))  # Paint shifted indices with color 2
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** We use `objects(I, True, False, True)` to find connected components of "1"s, excluding the background.
2. **Filter by color:**  `colorfilter(objs, 1)` isolates objects with the color "1".
3. **Shift right:** `mapply` applies `shift(toindices(obj), RIGHT)` to each object's indices, moving them one cell to the right.
4. **Paint with new color:**  `paint(I, recolor(2, shifted))` fills the shifted indices with "2" on the original grid.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, recolor(2, mfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda o: color(o) == 1 and rightmost(o) < len(I[0]) - 1))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` finds connected components of "1"s, excluding the background.
2. **Filter and shift:** `mfilter` filters objects for color "1" and being within the grid boundary for rightward shift, then directly shifts the indices using `rbind` with `RIGHT`.
3. **Paint:**  `paint` fills the shifted indices with "2" on the original grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_indices = set()
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        shifted_indices.add((i, j+1))
  return paint(I, recolor(2, frozenset(shifted_indices)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Shift:** This version iterates through the grid and directly identifies cells with "1", adding their right neighbor's index to `shifted_indices`.
2. **Paint:** `paint` then fills these `shifted_indices` with "2".


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return cellwise(I, shift(I, RIGHT), 0)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift the entire grid:** `shift(I, RIGHT)` shifts the entire grid one cell to the right.
2. **Cellwise comparison:** `cellwise` compares the original and shifted grids. Where values match (original "1" overlapping shifted "1"), it retains "1". Otherwise, it fills with "0". 


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and j < len(I[0]) - 1:  # Check for "1" and right boundary
        O = paint(O, {(1, (i, j)), (2, (i, j + 1))})  # Paint both "1" and "2"
      else:
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))})  # Paint the original value
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** A blank canvas of the same size as the input is created.
2. **Iterate and Paint:** The code iterates through the input grid. If a "1" is found and is not on the rightmost edge, it paints both the "1" and a "2" to its right on the canvas. Otherwise, it paints the original value.
