## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding a '2' to the right of each '1' in the input grid, but only if there isn't already a '2' there. Essentially, it's a conditional rightward shift of '1's, filling the space with a '2'.

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 to Output_0:**  Each '1' gets a '2' added to its immediate right, except for the '1' at the edge of the grid.
* **Input_1 to Output_1:**  Similar to the previous case, each '1' gets a rightward '2', respecting the grid boundaries. 
* **Input_2 to Output_2:**  The pattern holds true â€“ a '2' is placed to the right of every '1',  staying within the grid limits.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, each achieving the transformation using different DSL functions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, frozenset((2, (i, j + 1)) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(row) if v == 1 and j < len(row) - 1)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Filter:**  The code directly iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`. It checks if a cell contains '1' and if it's not on the rightmost edge (`j < len(row) - 1`).
2. **Conditional Painting:** If both conditions are met, it paints a '2' onto a new grid at the position one step to the right `(i, j + 1)`. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grid = hconcat(crop(I, (0, 1), (len(I), len(I[0]) - 1)), ((0,) * len(I[0]),))
  return cellwise(I, shifted_grid, lambda a, b: 2 if a == 1 and b == 0 else a)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift and Compare:** It creates `shifted_grid` by shifting the original grid one position to the right and padding with zeros. It then compares each cell of the original grid with the corresponding cell in `shifted_grid`.
2. **Conditional Replacement:** If a cell in the original grid is '1' and the corresponding cell in `shifted_grid` is '0' (meaning it was empty before the shift), it replaces the cell with a '2'. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = asindices(I) - ofcolor(I, 0)  # Get indices of all '1's
  return paint(I, frozenset((2, (i, j + 1)) for i, j in ones if j < len(I[0]) - 1)) # Paint '2's to the right
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1's:** The code first identifies the indices of all cells containing '1' in the input grid and stores them in the `ones` set. 
2. **Rightward Painting:** It then iterates through the `ones` set and paints a '2' to the right of each '1' if the '1' is not on the rightmost edge of the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(v, (i, j))})  # Copy existing values
      if v == 1 and j < len(row) - 1:
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(2, (i, j + 1))})  # Add the '2'
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and Copy:** This version first creates an empty canvas `new_grid` of the same size as the input grid. It then copies all the values from the input grid to the canvas.
2. **Conditional Addition:** During the copying process, if it encounters a '1' and the '1' is not on the right edge, it also paints a '2' to the right of it.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, frozenset((2, add((i, j), RIGHT)) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(row) if v == 1 and j < len(I[0]) - 1)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Functional Approach:** This version utilizes the `add` function from the DSL to calculate the position to the right of each '1'. 
2. **Direct Painting:** It directly paints a '2' onto the input grid at the calculated position if the '1' is not on the right edge.
