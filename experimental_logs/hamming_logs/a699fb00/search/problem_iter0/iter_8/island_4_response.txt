## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (groups of connected '1's) on the grid and extending them to the right by one cell, but only if that cell is currently the background color (most common color). 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- Two objects are identified: one at the top and one at the bottom.
- In both objects, the rightmost '1's have a '0' to their right.
- These '0's are replaced with '2's, effectively extending the objects.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
-  Similar to Input_0, multiple objects are identified.
-  Rightmost '1's adjacent to '0's are extended by replacing the '0' with a '2'.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- The pattern remains the same: rightmost '1's of each object are extended if they are next to a '0'. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Extract objects
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        for v, (i, j) in obj:
            right = (i, j + 1)  # Check the cell to the right
            if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and index(I, right) == mostcolor(I):
                O = fill(O, 2, {right})  # Fill with '2' if it's background
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies connected '1's as objects.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** The program iterates through each object and its cells. For each cell, it checks if the cell to its right is within the grid bounds and contains the background color. If both conditions are true, it fills that cell with '2'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val == 1 and j < len(row) - 1 and row[j+1] == mostcolor(I):
                O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j+1)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Cells:**  This version directly iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check and Fill:** For every '1', it checks if it's not on the right edge and if the cell to its right is the background. If true, it fills the cell to the right with '2'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, merge({frozenset({(2, (i, j + 1))}) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, val in enumerate(row) if val == 1 and j < len(row) - 1 and row[j + 1] == mostcolor(I)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **One-liner:** This version compresses the logic into a single line using set comprehension.
2. **Identify and Paint:** It identifies cells to the right of '1's that meet the criteria and directly paints them with '2' on the original grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  extensions = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((2, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I)), objs)
  return paint(I, merge(extensions))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Extend:** It extracts objects and then uses `mapply` to apply a lambda function that generates the extension cells for each object.
2. **Paint Extensions:** Finally, it paints all the generated extension cells onto the original grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    shifted_grid = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT) # Shift the entire grid to the right
    overlay = cellwise(I, shifted_grid, mostcolor(I)) # Overlay shifted and original grids
    return replace(overlay, 1, 2) # Replace all '1's in the overlay with '2's
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift and Overlay:** This version shifts the entire grid to the right and then overlays it onto the original grid. When cells overlap, the shifted cell's value is used unless it's a background cell.
2. **Replace:**  Finally, all remaining '1's in the overlay (which are the extensions) are replaced with '2's. 


These five versions demonstrate different approaches and function combinations to achieve the same transformation. Each version leverages the provided DSL functions in unique ways to solve the task.
