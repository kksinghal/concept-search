## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on pairs of '1' digits within each row of the grid.  Let's analyze each input-output example:

**Example 0:**

* **Input:** Two pairs of '1's exist.
* **Output:** A '2' is inserted between each pair of '1's.

**Example 1:**

* **Input:** Multiple pairs of '1's, some with intervening digits.
* **Output:**  A '2' is inserted between each pair of '1's, regardless of intervening digits within the row.

**Example 2:**

* **Input:**  Pairs of '1's scattered across different rows.
* **Output:**  A '2' is inserted between each pair of '1's, demonstrating the row-wise application of the rule.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL to achieve the desired transformation:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          2 if j > 0 and row[j-1] == 1 and v == 1 else v
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:**  The code iterates through each row (`row`) of the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate through cells within each row:** For every cell (`v`) at index `j` in the current row, it checks if the preceding cell (`row[j-1]`) is '1' and the current cell is also '1'.
3. **Conditional replacement:** If the condition is met, the current cell is replaced with '2'. Otherwise, the original cell value is retained.


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          branch(j < len(row) - 1 and row[j] == 1 and row[j + 1] == 1, 2, v)
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and lookahead:** This version iterates similarly to Version 1 but uses the `branch` function and looks ahead to the next element. 
2. **Branching logic:**  It checks if the current cell is '1' and the next cell (`row[j+1]`) is also '1'. If true, it replaces the current cell with '2'; otherwise, it retains the original value.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            2 if any(row[k:j:1] == (1,1) for k in range(j)) else v
            for j, v in enumerate(row)
        )
        for row in I
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Slice and compare:**  This version iterates through the input grid and, for each cell, checks all preceding cell pairs in the row using slicing (`row[k:j:1]`) to find a (1,1) pattern.
2. **Replace upon match:** If a (1, 1) pattern is found, indicating consecutive '1's, the current cell is replaced with '2'. Otherwise, the original value is kept.


### Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          v if (j == 0 or row[j - 1] != 1) else (2 if v == 1 else v)
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Check preceding cell:**  This version directly checks if the previous cell (`row[j-1]`) is '1'.
2. **Conditional replacement:** If the previous cell is '1', it replaces the current cell ('1') with '2'. Otherwise, it retains the original value. 


### Program Version 5: 

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      branch(j > 0 and v == 1 and row[j-1] == 1, 2, v)
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iteration and conditional check:** This version iterates through each row and cell, similar to other versions.
2. **Branch for replacement:**  It uses the `branch` function to conditionally replace the current cell with '2' only if it is '1' and the preceding cell is also '1'. Otherwise, the original value is preserved.
