## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves replacing the digit '0' that is directly adjacent to the digit '1' with the digit '2'. 

**Let's analyze this with the provided examples:**

* **Input_0:** The '0's to the right of each '1' are replaced with '2's. 
* **Input_1:**  Same pattern as Input_0. Notice how only '0's directly next to '1's are changed, not diagonally adjacent ones.
* **Input_2:** Similar pattern, reinforcing the rule applies regardless of the position of the '1's in the grid.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions using the provided DSL to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
    filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
    shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), filtered_objs)
    indices_to_change = mfilter(shifted_objs, lambda ind: index(I, ind) == 0)
    O = fill(I, 2, indices_to_change)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' objects:**  `objects` finds all connected groups of '1's. 
2. **Shift right:** `shift` moves each object one position to the right.
3. **Find '0's to replace:** `index` checks if the shifted position contains a '0'.
4. **Fill with '2's:** `fill` replaces the identified '0's with '2's.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
    right_neighbors = mfilter(ones, lambda loc: astuple(loc[0], loc[1] + 1), I)
    O = fill(I, 2, sfilter(right_neighbors, lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find all '1's:**  `ofcolor` gets the indices of all '1' cells.
2. **Get right neighbors:** For each '1', calculate the index of its right neighbor.
3. **Filter for '0's:** Keep only the neighbor indices that hold a '0' value.
4. **Fill with '2's:** Replace the filtered '0' cells with '2's.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  return tuple(tuple(2 if j < len(row)-1 and row[j] == 1 and row[j + 1] == 0 else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows and cells:** This version iterates directly through the grid.
2. **Check for the pattern:** For each cell, it checks if the cell contains a '1' and if its right neighbor exists and contains a '0'.
3. **Replace with '2':** If the pattern is found, the current cell's value is replaced with '2'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    shifted_right = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)
    overlapped = cellwise(asobject(I), shifted_right, 0)
    filtered = sfilter(overlapped, lambda cell: cell[0] == 1 and index(I, cell[1]) == 0)
    O = fill(I, 2, mapply(lambda cell: cell[1], filtered))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift grid right:** The entire grid is treated as an object and shifted right.
2. **Overlap and compare:** The original and shifted grids are compared cell-wise.
3. **Identify replacement locations:** Cells where the original has '1' and the shifted one has '0' are marked for replacement.
4. **Fill with '2's:** The marked cells are filled with '2's in the original grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = tuple(tuple(2 if 0 <= j+1 < w and I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j+1] == 0 else I[i][j] for j in range(w)) for i in range(h))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and check:** Similar to version 3, it iterates through the grid but uses explicit boundary checks.
2. **Replace '0's:** If the current cell is '1' and the right neighbor is '0', the '0' is replaced with '2'.


These are just five examples, and many other variations are possible using the DSL.
