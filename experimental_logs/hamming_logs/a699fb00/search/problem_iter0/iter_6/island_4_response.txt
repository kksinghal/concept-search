## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected components of the same digit) on the input grid and extending them to the right by one cell with the value "2", but only if the right neighbor cell is the background color (most common color).

**Input_0:**
- Two "1" objects are present.
- The rightmost "1" in each object is extended to the right by a "2".

**Input_1:**
- Multiple "1" objects are present.
- Similar to Input_0, the rightmost "1" in each object is extended to the right by a "2", if possible.

**Input_2:**
- Similar to previous inputs, the transformation consistently extends the rightmost "1" of each object with a "2" if there's an empty space on the right. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions for the required transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    rightmost_cell = argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1])
    i, j = rightmost_cell[1]
    if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I):
      O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies connected components of the same value ("1" in this case) as individual objects, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate and Find Rightmost Cell:** For each object, `argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1])` finds the cell with the highest column index (rightmost).
3. **Extend if Possible:** If the right neighbor cell is within grid bounds and contains the background color, `fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})` places a "2" in that cell.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 1 and j < len(row) - 1 and row[j + 1] == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:** This version iterates directly through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check Conditions:** For each cell containing "1", it checks if it's not the last cell in the row and if its right neighbor is the background.
3. **Fill if True:** If the conditions are met, it fills the right neighbor cell with "2".

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if j < len(row) - 1 and row[j + 1] == mostcolor(I) and value == 1 else value
      for j, value in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **List Comprehension:** This version uses nested list comprehension for a concise solution.
2. **Inline Conditions:** It directly checks the conditions for each cell and its right neighbor within the list comprehension.
3. **Conditional Value:** Based on the conditions, it either keeps the original value or replaces it with "2".

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        for v, (i, j) in obj:
            if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j+1] == mostcolor(I):
                O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j+1))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification and Initialization:** Similar to version 1, it identifies objects and initializes the output grid.
2. **Rightward Extension with paint:** Instead of `fill`, this version utilizes the `paint` function to place "2" in the appropriate cell if the conditions are met. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      branch(j < len(row) - 1 and row[j + 1] == mostcolor(I) and value == 1, 2, value)
      for j, value in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iteration and Branching:** Similar to version 3, it iterates through each cell.
2. **Explicit Branching:** It uses the `branch` function for explicit conditional evaluation, enhancing code readability.
