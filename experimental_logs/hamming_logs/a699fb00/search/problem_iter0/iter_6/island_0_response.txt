## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify pairs of '1' values in each row of the input grid and change the second '1' in the pair to a '2'. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Pairs Only:** The transformation only affects '1' values that appear consecutively (horizontally adjacent) within a row. Isolated '1' values remain unchanged.
* **Second '1' Changes:**  Within a pair of '1's, only the second '1' is modified to a '2'. 
* **Row-Wise Operation:** The transformation is applied independently to each row in the input grid.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if v == 1 and row[max(0, j-1):j].count(1) > 0 and row[max(0, j-1)] == 1 else v
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Rows:** `for row in I` iterates over each row of the input grid.
2. **Iterate within Rows:** `for j, v in enumerate(row)` iterates over each element (value `v` at index `j`) within the current row.
3. **Identify Second '1' in a Pair:**  
   -  `row[max(0, j-1):j].count(1) > 0` checks if there's at least one '1' in the slice from the previous element to the current element.
   - `row[max(0, j-1)] == 1` ensures that the immediately preceding element is a '1'.
4. **Conditional Replacement:** `2 if ... else v` changes the current value `v` to '2' only if both conditions in step 3 are true, indicating it's the second '1' in a pair. Otherwise, it retains its original value.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      branch(v == 1 and k > 0 and row[k - 1] == 1, 2, v) 
      for k, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Row and Element Iteration:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Check for Preceding '1':** `v == 1 and k > 0 and row[k - 1] == 1` checks if the current element is a '1', it's not the first element (`k > 0`), and the element before it is also a '1'.
3. **Branching:** `branch(..., 2, v)` uses the `branch` function to conditionally change the value. If the condition in step 2 is true (second '1' in a pair), it returns '2'; otherwise, it returns the original value `v`.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          branch((j > 0 and v == 1 and row[j-1] == 1), 2, v)
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in I
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

- This version follows the same principle as version 2 but structures the conditional check within the `branch` function for better readability.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def program_v4(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            2 if j > 0 and all([v == 1, row[j-1] == 1]) else v
            for j, v in enumerate(row)
        )
        for row in I
    )
```

**Explanation:**

- Similar to version 1 but uses `all([v == 1, row[j-1] == 1])` to check if both the current element and the one before it are '1's, making the condition more concise.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def program_v5(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            branch(j > 0 and equality(v, 1) and equality(row[j - 1], 1), 2, v)
            for j, v in enumerate(row)
        )
        for row in I
    )
```

**Explanation:**

- This version explicitly uses the `equality` function for checking if the current element and the previous one are equal to '1'. It enhances code clarity by explicitly stating the comparison. 

These five versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL, emphasizing code readability, conciseness, and the flexible use of DSL functions.
