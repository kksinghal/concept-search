## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify '1' digits in the input grid that are part of a horizontal line of '1's. For each such '1', if a '0' exists immediately to its right, it is replaced with a '2'. 

Here's a breakdown per input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** 
- The top-right '1' in the top-left object has a '0' to its right, hence the '0' becomes '2'.
- Similar transformation for the top-left '1' in the bottom-left object.

**Pair 1:**
- The transformation is applied to all horizontal '1' pairs with a '0' on the right in both objects.

**Pair 2:**
-  Same logic applied as in the previous pairs.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve_b91ae062(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1) 
  right_neighbors = shift(ones, RIGHT)
  valid_neighbors = intersection(right_neighbors, asindices(I))
  zeros_to_replace = sfilter(valid_neighbors, lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0) 
  O = fill(I, 2, zeros_to_replace)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1's and their right neighbors:**
   - `ones = ofcolor(I, 1)` gets the indices of all '1's in the grid.
   - `right_neighbors = shift(ones, RIGHT)` shifts these indices one position to the right.
   - `valid_neighbors = intersection(right_neighbors, asindices(I))` keeps only valid indices within the grid bounds. 
2. **Filter for '0' neighbors:**
   - `zeros_to_replace = sfilter(valid_neighbors, lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0)` filters the valid neighbors to only include indices where the grid value is '0'.
3. **Replace with '2':**
   - `O = fill(I, 2, zeros_to_replace)` fills the identified '0' indices with the value '2'.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve_b91ae062(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = [[I[i][j] for j in range(w)] for i in range(h)]
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w-1):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j+1] == 0:
        O[i][j+1] = 2 
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a mutable copy of the grid:**
   - This version iterates directly through the grid elements. 
2. **Iterate and replace:**
   - The nested loop iterates through each cell, checking if it's a '1' followed by a '0' to its right.
   - If the condition is met, the '0' in the mutable copy (`O`) is replaced with a '2'.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve_b91ae062(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if j < len(row) - 1 and row[j] == 1 and row[j+1] == 0 else v 
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    ) for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Concise list comprehension:**
   - This version employs nested list comprehensions for a more compact solution.
   - It iterates through each row and each value within the row.
2. **Conditional replacement:**
    - The condition `j < len(row) - 1 and row[j] == 1 and row[j+1] == 0` checks for the '1' followed by '0' pattern within each row, replacing the '0' with '2' if found.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve_b91ae062(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          branch(
              j < len(row) - 1 and row[j] == 1 and row[j+1] == 0,
              2,
              row[j],
          )
          for j in range(len(row))
      )
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Using `branch` for conditional logic:**
   - Similar to Version 3, this uses nested loops but introduces the `branch` function for clarity in conditional replacement. 
   - The `branch` function checks the '1' followed by '0' condition. If true, it returns '2'; otherwise, it returns the original value.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve_b91ae062(I):
  shifted = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)
  overlapped = {(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in shifted if (i, j) in asindices(I)}
  filtered = {(v, pos) for (v, pos), (v2, pos2) in zip(asobject(I), overlapped) if v==1 and v2==0}
  return  astuple(*shape(I)) if len(filtered) == 0 else paint(I, recolor(2, filtered))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift and find overlaps:**
    - Converts the grid to an object and shifts it to the right.
    - Finds the overlapping cells between the original and shifted object.
2. **Filter for '1' followed by '0':**
    - Filters the overlapped cells to only include cells where the original value is '1' and the shifted value is '0'.
3. **Paint or return original:**
    - If no such pair is found, it returns the original grid.
    - Otherwise, it repaints the grid, replacing the '0' in the identified '1'-'0' pairs with a '2'.
