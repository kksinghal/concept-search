## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending non-background objects to the right by one cell if the neighboring cell is the background color. 

**Input 0:**

* The '1' objects are extended rightward.

**Input 1:**

* All occurrences of the '1' object are extended rightward.

**Input 2:**

* Similar to the previous inputs, '1' objects are extended rightward.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = fgpartition(I)  # Extract non-background objects
    x2 = apply(lambda obj: {(v, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I)}, x1)  # Extend objects rightward
    x3 = merge(x2)  # Merge the extended objects into a single set
    O = underpaint(I, x3)  # Paint extensions onto the original grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `fgpartition(I)`: Identifies and separates all non-background objects from the input grid `I`.
2. `apply(...)`: Iterates through each object and applies a lambda function: 
   - For each cell `(v, (i, j))` in the object, it checks if a rightward extension is possible:
     - `0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0])`: Ensures the extension stays within grid boundaries.
     - `I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I)`: Checks if the rightward cell is the background color.
   - If both conditions are met, a new cell `(v, (i, j + 1))` with the same color `v` is added to the extended object.
3. `merge(x2)`: Combines all extended objects back into a single set.
4. `underpaint(I, x3)`: Overlays the extensions onto the original grid `I`, only painting on cells containing the background color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I):
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j + 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Initializes the output `O` with the input grid `I`.
2. Iterates through each cell of the grid (except the last column).
3. If a cell is not the background color and its right neighbor is the background color, it paints the right neighbor with the current cell's color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)  # Extract non-background objects
    x2 = mapply(lambda obj: {(v, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I)}, x1) # Directly merge extensions
    O = underpaint(I, frozenset(x2))  # Paint extensions onto the original grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`: Extracts non-background objects from the grid, treating diagonally connected cells as separate objects.
2. `mapply(...)`: Applies the extension logic to each object and merges the results directly:
   - It iterates through each cell of the object and checks if a rightward extension is possible (similar to Version 1).
   - If possible, a new cell with the same color is added directly to the merged set of extensions.
3. `underpaint(I, frozenset(x2))`: Overlays the merged extensions onto the original grid `I`, only affecting background cells.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    O = tuple(tuple(v if j == len(row) or row[j+1] != bg else (v if v == bg else 2)  for j, v in enumerate(row)) for row in I)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Determines the background color `bg` of the input grid.
2. Uses a nested list comprehension to process the grid:
   - For each row in the grid:
     - For each cell `v` at index `j` in the row:
       - If it's the last cell (`j == len(row)`) or its right neighbor is not the background color (`row[j+1] != bg`), the cell remains unchanged.
       - Otherwise, if the cell is the background color, it's changed to '2'; if it's not the background color, it remains unchanged.
3. Returns the modified grid as a tuple of tuples.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I):
        O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j + 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Initializes the output `O` with the input grid `I`.
2. Iterates through each non-background object obtained using `fgpartition(I)`.
3. For each cell `(v, (i, j))` in the object:
   - Checks if a rightward extension within grid boundaries is possible (`0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0])`) and if the target cell is the background color (`I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I)`).
   - If both conditions hold, it paints the target cell on the output grid `O` with the object's color `v`.
4. Returns the modified grid `O`.

These five programs offer distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation using different combinations of DSL functions. They provide a diverse set of solutions for extending non-background objects rightward while maintaining code clarity and efficiency.
