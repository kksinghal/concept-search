## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying horizontal lines of '1's and replacing the '0' to the right of each '1' with a '2'.

**Input 0:**

- There are two horizontal lines of '1's. 
- In each line, the '0' immediately to the right of the '1' is replaced by a '2'.

**Input 1:**

- Similar to Input 0, the transformation targets horizontal lines of '1's.
- Notice the longer lines in this input; the transformation affects all '0's directly to the right of each '1' within a continuous line.

**Input 2:**

- This input reinforces the pattern observed in Input 1. 
- The '2' placement depends on the length and position of the horizontal '1' lines.


## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if j > 0 and row[j-1] == 1 and row[j] == 0 and all(v == 0 for v in row[j+1:]) else v
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates through each row and checks for a '1' followed by a '0' and then all zeroes till the end of the row. If this condition is met, the '0' is replaced by a '2'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          2 if any(row[k] == 1 and j == k+1 for k in range(len(row)-1)) else v
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates through each row and checks if there is a '1' at any position 'k' where the current position 'j' is k+1. If this condition is met, it replaces the value at 'j' with a '2'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          branch(j < len(row) - 1 and row[j] == 0 and row[j+1] == 1, 2, v)
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

- This program iterates through each row of the input grid.
- For each cell, it checks if the current cell is '0',  if the next cell is '1' and if it is not the last cell of the row. If all conditions are true, it replaces the current cell with a '2'. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          branch(contained(ONE, {index(I, (i, k)) for k in range(j-1, j+2)}) and v == 0, 2, v) 
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

- This program iterates through each cell of the input grid and checks its two neighboring cells (left and right) for the presence of '1'.
- If a '1' is found in any of the neighboring cells and the current cell is '0', it replaces the current cell with a '2'.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          branch(j > 0 and index(I, (i, j-1)) == 1 and v == 0, 2, v)
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

- This program iterates through each cell in the input grid.
- It checks if the cell to the left of the current cell is '1' and if the current cell is '0'. If both conditions are met, it replaces the current cell value with a '2'.
