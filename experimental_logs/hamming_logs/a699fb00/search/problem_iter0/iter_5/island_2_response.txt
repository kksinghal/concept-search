## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves extending objects to the right by one cell if that cell is the background color. Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The '1' objects at positions (0,0) and (3,1) are extended rightward to create '2's at (0,1) and (3,2).

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* All '1' objects are extended to the right, creating '2's in their respective rows.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* Similar to the previous cases, all '1' objects are extended rightward, filling in background cells with '2's.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = fgpartition(I)  # Extract non-background objects
  x2 = apply(lambda obj: {(v, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I)}, x1)  # Extend objects rightward
  x3 = merge(x2) # Merge the extended objects into a single set
  O = underpaint(I, x3)  # Paint extensions onto the original grid
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Identifies and separates objects from the background.
2. **`apply(...)`:**  Iterates over each object and applies a lambda function:
   *  The lambda function creates new cells to the right of existing object cells if:
      * The rightward cell is within the grid boundaries.
      * The rightward cell is the background color.
3. **`merge(x2)`:** Merges the set of extended cells from all objects.
4. **`underpaint(I, x3)`:**  Paints the merged extensions onto the original grid, ensuring only background cells are modified.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Initialize output as input
  for i, row in enumerate(I):  # Iterate over rows
    for j, val in enumerate(row[:-1]):  # Iterate over cells in each row (except the last)
      if val != mostcolor(I) and row[j+1] == mostcolor(I): # Check if current cell is object and next cell is background
        O = paint(O, {(val, (i, j+1))}) # Paint the next cell with the object color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. **`for i, row in enumerate(I):`:** Iterates through each row of the input grid.
3. **`for j, val in enumerate(row[:-1]):`:** Iterates through each cell in the row except the last one.
4. **`if val != mostcolor(I) and row[j+1] == mostcolor(I):`:** Checks if the current cell belongs to an object (not the background color) and if the cell to its right is the background color.
5. **`O = paint(O, {(val, (i, j+1))})`:** If the conditions are met, this line paints the cell to the right of the current cell with the object's color, effectively extending the object.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
    x2 = mapply(lambda obj: {(v, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I)}, x1) # Directly merge extensions
    O = underpaint(I, frozenset(x2))  # Paint extensions onto the original grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`:**  Extracts objects from the input grid.
2. **`mapply(...)`:**  Applies a lambda function to each object and merges the results:
   *  The lambda function checks for each cell in the object if it can be extended to the right (within bounds and background cell). If so, it adds the extended cell to the output.
3. **`frozenset(x2)`:** Converts the merged extensions into a frozenset.
4. **`underpaint(I, x2)`:** Overlays the extensions onto the input grid, only modifying background cells. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = fgpartition(I) # Extract non-background objects
  x2 = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, 1)) if all(index(I, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I) for v, (i, j) in obj if 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0])) else obj, x1)  # Shift the entire object right if possible
  O = paint(I, merge(x2))  # Paint shifted objects onto the original grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Extracts foreground objects from the grid.
2. **`apply(...)`:** Applies a lambda function to each extracted object:
   * This lambda function attempts to shift the entire object one cell to the right. 
   * It checks if all the potential right neighbors of the object's cells are the background color.
   * If the condition holds, it shifts the object; otherwise, it returns the original object.
3. **`merge(x2)`:** Merges the potentially shifted objects into a single set of cells.
4. **`paint(I, merge(x2))`:** Paints the merged objects onto the input grid, creating the output grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create a blank canvas
  for obj in fgpartition(I): # Iterate over foreground objects
    new_obj = set()
    for v, (i, j) in obj: # Iterate over cells in the object
      new_obj.add((v, (i, j))) # Add current cell to the new object
      if j + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (i, j+1)) == mostcolor(I): # If right cell is in bounds and is background
        new_obj.add((v, (i, j + 1))) # Extend object to the right
    O = paint(O, frozenset(new_obj)) # Paint the extended object onto the canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:**  Creates an empty grid (canvas) of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **`for obj in fgpartition(I):`:**  Iterates over each object in the input grid.
3. **`new_obj = set()`:** Initializes an empty set to store the extended object.
4. **`for v, (i, j) in obj:`:** Iterates through each cell of the object.
   * Adds the current cell to `new_obj`.
   * Checks if the rightward cell is within bounds and is a background color.
   * If so, it adds the rightward cell with the object's color to `new_obj`, effectively extending the object.
5. **`O = paint(O, frozenset(new_obj))`:** Paints the extended object onto the initially empty canvas.
6. **`return O`:** Returns the final canvas as the output grid.

These five program versions provide diverse solutions to the given transformation problem within the constraints of the DSL.
