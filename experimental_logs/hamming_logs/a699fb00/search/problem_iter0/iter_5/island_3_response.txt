## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected groups of the same digit) within the grid and then extending them to the right by one cell with the digit '2', but only if the original object consists of the digit '1'.

**Input 0:**
- Two '1' objects are present.
- Both objects are extended to the right by one cell with a '2'.

**Input 1:**
- Seven '1' objects are present.
- Each object is extended to the right by one cell with a '2'.

**Input 2:**
- Six '1' objects are present.
- Each object is extended to the right by one cell with a '2'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1: Using `objects` and direct manipulation**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Get objects, excluding background
  new_cells = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if v == 1 and j + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j + 1] == 0:  # Check for '1', right boundary, and empty cell
        new_cells.add((2, (i, j + 1)))  # Add a '2' to its right
  O = paint(I, frozenset(new_cells))  # Paint the new cells onto the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies connected components of non-background digits in the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** The code iterates through each object and cell within the object. If the cell value is '1' and its right neighbor is within the grid bounds and is empty (0), a new cell with value '2' is added to the `new_cells` set.
3. **Paint New Cells:** Finally, `paint(I, frozenset(new_cells))` paints the new cells onto the original grid, resulting in the desired output.

**Version 2: Using `ofcolor` and conditional list comprehension**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)  # Get indices of '1's
  new_cells = {(2, (i, j+1)) for i, j in ones if j + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j + 1] == 0} # Add '2' to right if possible
  return paint(I, frozenset(new_cells))  # Paint the new cells onto the grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1's:** `ofcolor(I, 1)` directly identifies the indices of all cells containing the digit '1'.
2. **Conditional Extension:** A set comprehension is used to generate new cells. For each '1' location, if the right neighbor is within bounds and empty, a new cell with value '2' is added to the set.
3. **Paint:**  `paint(I, frozenset(new_cells))` paints the new cells onto the original grid.

**Version 3: Leveraging `shift` and set operations**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1) # Get indices of '1's
  shifted_right = shift(ones, RIGHT)  # Shift '1' indices to the right
  valid_shifts = shifted_right & asindices(I) - ofcolor(I, 1)  # Keep shifts within bounds and not on existing '1's
  new_cells = recolor(2, valid_shifts)  # Recolor valid shifted indices to '2'
  return paint(I, new_cells)  # Paint the new cells onto the grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find and Shift:** Find the indices of '1's and shift them one position to the right using `shift(ones, RIGHT)`.
2. **Validate Shifts:**  `valid_shifts` filters out shifts that go out of bounds or land on an existing '1' cell.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** Recolor the `valid_shifts` to '2' using `recolor` and then paint them onto the original grid.

**Version 4: Combining `hconcat`, `crop`, and `replace`**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    shifted_right = hconcat(crop(I, (0, 1), shape(I)-(0, 1)), ((0,) * len(I[0]),))  # Shift grid right, filling with zeros
    combined = cellwise(I, shifted_right, 0)  # Mark matching '1's
    return replace(combined, 1, 2)  # Replace marked cells with '2'
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Grid:** `hconcat` and `crop` are combined to effectively shift the grid one cell to the right, padding the leftmost column with zeros.
2. **Identify Matches:** `cellwise` compares the original and shifted grids, marking cells that have a '1' in the original grid and a corresponding '1' in the shifted grid.
3. **Replace and Return:** Finally, `replace` replaces all marked '1's with '2's.

**Version 5: Using `rot90`, `tophalf`, and cell manipulation**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_right = rot90(tophalf(rot270(I)))  # Shift the grid one cell to the right
  O = cellwise(I, shifted_right, 0)  # Compare with original, fill mismatches with '0'
  for i in range(len(O)):
      for j in range(len(O[0])):
          if O[i][j] == 1 and j + 1 < len(O[0]) and O[i][j+1] == 0:
              O[i][j + 1] = 2
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Grid:** Rotations and taking the top half are strategically used to shift the grid one cell to the right.
2. **Compare and Fill:** `cellwise` compares the original and shifted grids, filling mismatches with '0'.
3. **Iterate and Replace:** Iterates over the combined grid and replaces '0's with '2's where appropriate based on adjacent '1's.

Each of these versions provides a unique approach to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and diversity of the provided DSL.
