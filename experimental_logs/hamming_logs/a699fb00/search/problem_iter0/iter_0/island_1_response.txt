## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by connected digits of value '1' and inserting the digit '2' to the right of each '1' within these objects. 

**Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0:** A single object is formed by the '1' digits. The output inserts a '2' to the right of each '1'.
* **Input_1:**  This input has three separate objects formed by '1' digits.  The output correctly inserts '2's within each object.
* **Input_2:** Similar to Input_1, we have multiple objects, and '2's are inserted accordingly.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
    for obj in objs:
        for v, (i, j) in obj:
            if v == 1:
                if (i, j + 1) in toindices(obj):
                    I = fill(I, 2, ((i, j + 1),))
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` finds all connected objects formed by the digit '1'.
2. **Iterate and Modify:**  The code iterates through each object and its cells.
3. **Insert '2':** If a cell contains '1' and the cell to its right is part of the same object, it fills the cell to the right with '2'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 1:
        O = fill(O, 2, ((i, j + 1),))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** This version directly iterates over the input grid.
2. **Check for Adjacent '1's:** It checks if a cell and the cell to its right both contain '1'.
3. **Fill with '2':** If the condition is met, it fills the right cell with '2' in the output grid. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    obj = objects(I, True, False, True)
    indices = mfilter(obj, lambda o: 1 in (v for v, _ in o))
    shifted = mapply(lambda ind: shift(ind, RIGHT), indices)
    O = fill(I, 2, merge(intersection(toindices(shifted), asindices(I))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Similar to version 1, it identifies objects formed by '1'.
2. **Filter Objects:**  It filters the objects to keep only those containing the digit '1'.
3. **Shift and Fill:** It shifts the indices of each filtered object to the right and fills the resulting indices with '2' if they are within the grid boundaries. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    shifted = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)
    filtered = frozenset((v, i) for v, i in shifted if index(I, i) == 1 and v == 1)
    O = paint(I, filtered)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Grid:**  It shifts the entire grid representation as an object to the right.
2. **Filter Cells:** It keeps only the cells where both the original and shifted cell contain '1'.
3. **Paint '2's:** It paints the '2's onto the original grid at the positions of the filtered cells.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
      if color(obj) == 1:
        for i, j in toindices(obj):
          if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and (i, j + 1) in toindices(obj):
            O = fill(O, 2, ((i, j + 1),))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** It iterates through objects formed by connected '1's.
2. **Check Right Neighbor:** For each cell within an object, it checks if the right neighbor is also part of the object.
3. **Fill with '2':** If the condition is met, it fills the right neighbor cell with '2'.

These are five different ways to implement the described transformation in the given DSL. Each version utilizes different functions and logic, offering diverse solutions to the problem.
