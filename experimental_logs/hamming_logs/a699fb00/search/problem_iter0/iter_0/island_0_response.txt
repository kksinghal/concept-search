## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected components of the same digit) within the input grid and inserting the digit '2' to the right of each '1' within these objects.

**Input 0:**
- Two objects are present, each formed by two '1' digits.
- For each object, a '2' is inserted to the right of each '1'.

**Input 1:**
- Four objects are present, two with two '1' digits and two with four '1' digits.
- '2' digits are inserted as described above.

**Input 2:**
- Five objects, similar to Input 1. 
- '2' insertions follow the same pattern.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, each using a different approach:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_d511f180(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if v == 1:
        h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
        if j + 1 < w:
          I = fill(I, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies connected components ('1' digits) as objects, excluding the background (most frequent digit).
2. **Iterate Objects:** The code iterates through each object and its cells.
3. **Insert '2':** If a cell contains '1', it checks if there's space to the right. If so, it fills the right cell with '2'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_d511f180(I):
  indices_one = ofcolor(I, 1)
  right_indices = apply(lambda ij: (ij[0], ij[1] + 1), indices_one)
  valid_indices = intersection(right_indices, asindices(I))
  return fill(I, 2, valid_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1's:** `ofcolor(I, 1)` finds all indices of '1' digits.
2. **Calculate Right Indices:** `apply` calculates the indices to the right of each '1'.
3. **Validate Indices:** `intersection` ensures only valid indices within the grid are kept.
4. **Fill with '2':** `fill` inserts '2' at the validated indices.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_d511f180(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 0:
        O = fill(O, 2, ((i, j + 1),))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Grid:** The code iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check and Fill:** If a cell contains '1' and the cell to its right is '0', it fills the right cell with '2'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_d511f180(I):
  shifted_right = rot90(tophalf(rot270(I))) + rot90(bottomhalf(rot270(I)))
  merged = cellwise(I, shifted_right, 0)
  return replace(merged, 1, 2)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Right:**  The grid is rotated and split to shift the right half by one position.
2. **Merge Grids:** The original and shifted grids are merged, with '0' as the fallback value.
3. **Replace '1's:** All '1's in the merged grid are replaced with '2's.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_d511f180(I):
  return tuple(tuple(2 if j < len(row) - 1 and row[j] == 1 and row[j + 1] == 0 else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Modify:** This version directly modifies the grid using nested list comprehensions. It iterates through each row and cell, inserting a '2' to the right of each '1' if the conditions are met.

Each of these programs achieves the desired transformation by approaching the problem from a different angle, showcasing the flexibility and diversity of the DSL.
