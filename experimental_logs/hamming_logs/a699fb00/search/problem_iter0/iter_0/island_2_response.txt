## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected groups of the same digit) in the input grid and adding a "border" around each object using the digit '2'. This border extends horizontally to the right and left of each object pixel, creating a horizontal line segment.

**Example Breakdown:**

In Input_0:
- There are two objects formed by the digit '1'.
- The output adds a '2' to the right of each '1', effectively creating a horizontal line segment.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_22eb0ac0(I):
    x1 = fgpartition(I)
    x2 = apply(lambda x: {(v, (i, j+1)) for v, (i, j) in x}, x1)
    x3 = apply(lambda x: {(v, (i, j-1)) for v, (i, j) in x}, x1)
    x4 = mfilter(x2, lambda x: toindices(x).issubset(asindices(I)))
    x5 = mfilter(x3, lambda x: toindices(x).issubset(asindices(I)))
    O = paint(paint(I, x4), x5)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`x1 = fgpartition(I)`:** Partitions the input grid (`I`) into objects, excluding the background.
2. **`x2 = apply(lambda x: {(v, (i, j+1)) for v, (i, j) in x}, x1)`:** Shifts each object one position to the right.
3. **`x3 = apply(lambda x: {(v, (i, j-1)) for v, (i, j) in x}, x1)`:** Shifts each object one position to the left.
4. **`x4 = mfilter(x2, lambda x: toindices(x).issubset(asindices(I)))`:** Filters out shifted objects that fall outside the grid boundaries.
5. **`x5 = mfilter(x3, lambda x: toindices(x).issubset(asindices(I)))`:** Same as above but for left-shifted objects.
6. **`O = paint(paint(I, x4), x5)`:** Paints the right and left shifted objects onto the original grid using the color '2'. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_22eb0ac0(I):
    x1 = fgpartition(I)
    x2 = apply(lambda x: {(color(x), (i, j+1)) for i, j in toindices(x) if (i, j+1) in asindices(I)}, x1)
    x3 = apply(lambda x: {(color(x), (i, j-1)) for i, j in toindices(x) if (i, j-1) in asindices(I)}, x1)
    O = paint(paint(I, merge(x2)), merge(x3))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`x1 = fgpartition(I)`:** Same as in version 1.
2. **`x2/x3`:**  Iterates through object indices and adds a right/left neighbor with the object's color if it falls within the grid boundaries.
3. **`O = ...`:**  Merges and paints the shifted indices onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_22eb0ac0(I):
    x1 = fgpartition(I)
    x2 = mapply(lambda x:  {(color(x), (i + di, j + dj)) for i, j in toindices(x) for di, dj in ((0, 1), (0, -1)) if (i + di, j + dj) in asindices(I)}, x1)
    O = paint(I, x2)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`x1 = fgpartition(I)`:** Same as in previous versions.
2. **`x2 = ...`:**  Uses `mapply` to apply a lambda function that generates both right and left neighbors for each object index, filtering for valid grid indices.
3. **`O = paint(I, x2)`:**  Paints the generated neighboring indices onto the original grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_22eb0ac0(I):
  x1 = fgpartition(I)
  x2 = mapply(lambda o: recolor(color(o), mfilter(lambda d: (i + d[0], j + d[1]) in asindices(I), (((0, 1), (0, -1)) for i, j in toindices(o)))), x1)
  O = paint(I, x2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`x1 = fgpartition(I)`:**  Same as in previous versions.
2. **`x2 = ...`:**  Uses `recolor` to directly paint the neighboring indices with the object's color, leveraging nested lambda functions for concise code.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_22eb0ac0(I):
    O = I
    for obj in fgpartition(I):
        for i, j in toindices(obj):
            if (i, j + 1) in asindices(I):
                O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, j + 1))})
            if (i, j - 1) in asindices(I):
                O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, j - 1))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid as a copy of the input.
2. **Iterative approach:**  Uses nested loops to iterate through each object and its indices, painting the neighboring cells directly onto the output grid if they are within grid boundaries. 

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieving the desired transformation, ranging from functional styles with `apply` and `mapply` to a more imperative style with explicit loops. Each version leverages different combinations of DSL functions, highlighting the flexibility of the language.
