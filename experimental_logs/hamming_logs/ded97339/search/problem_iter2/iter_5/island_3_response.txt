## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the largest object in the grid and extends it horizontally to the left, filling the space until it reaches the grid's left boundary or another object. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** The largest object (digit 8) is extended leftwards from its leftmost points on each row.

**Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0, the largest object (digit 8) is extended leftward. Note how the extension stops at the pre-existing '8' in the top right corner.

**Input_2:** Again, the largest object (digit 8) is extended leftwards, showcasing that the extension halts at existing objects.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, along with explanations for each:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the largest object
  obj = argmax(objects(I, T, T, T), size)

  # Get the object's color
  color = color(obj)

  # Determine the leftmost column occupied by the object in each row
  leftmost_columns = [min([j for v, (i, j) in obj if i == row] or [0]) for row in range(height(I))]

  # Create a set of indices to fill
  fill_indices = {(i, j) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(leftmost_columns[i]) if any(v == color and a == i for v, (a, _) in obj)}

  # Fill the grid
  O = paint(I, recolor(color, fill_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the largest object:**  Identifies the largest object in the grid.
2. **Get the object's color:** Retrieves the color of the largest object.
3. **Determine the leftmost column...:**  Calculates the starting column index for the extension on each row. 
4. **Create a set of indices to fill:** Generates a set of indices representing the area to be filled, ensuring it doesn't overwrite existing object cells.
5. **Fill the grid:** Paints the identified area with the object's color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the largest object and its bounding box
  largest_object = argmax(objects(I, T, T, T), size)
  top_left = ulcorner(largest_object)

  # Get the color of the largest object
  object_color = color(largest_object)

  # Fill from the left edge to the object's leftmost point on each row
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(top_left[1]):
      if any(value == object_color and row == i for value, (row, col) in largest_object):
        O = paint(O, {(object_color, (i, j))}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the largest object...:**  Identifies the largest object and its top-left corner.
2. **Get the color...:** Retrieves the object's color.
3. **Fill from the left edge...:** Iterates through each row, filling from the left edge (column 0) to the object's leftmost point on that row. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the largest object
  largest_obj = argmax(objects(I, T, T, T), size)
  
  # Get object's color and leftmost column
  target_color = color(largest_obj)
  leftmost_col = min(j for _, (i, j) in largest_obj)

  # Create a patch for the area to be filled
  fill_area = {(i, j) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(leftmost_col) if any(k == j for _, (l, k) in largest_obj if l == i)}

  # Fill the area and then paint the original object back on top
  O = paint(fill(I, target_color, fill_area), largest_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the largest object:**  Identifies the largest object.
2. **Get object's color and leftmost column:**  Extracts the object's color and its leftmost column index.
3. **Create a patch for the area to be filled:** Generates a patch representing the region to be filled, considering the object's presence on each row.
4. **Fill the area...:**  Fills the specified region with the object's color and then overlays the original object to ensure accurate rendering.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the largest object and its bounding box
  obj = argmax(objects(I, T, T, T), size)
  min_j = leftmost(obj)

  # Get the object's color
  c = color(obj)

  # Fill columns left of the object 
  O = I
  for j in range(min_j):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if any(k == i for _, (k, _) in obj):
        O = paint(O, {(c, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the largest object...:** Locates the largest object and its leftmost column.
2. **Get the object's color:**  Retrieves the color of the object.
3. **Fill columns left of the object:** Iterates through columns left of the object, filling cells on rows where the object is present.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the largest object 
  target_object = argmax(objects(I, T, T, T), size)

  # Get the object's color and leftmost column index
  target_color = color(target_object)
  leftmost = min(j for _, (_, j) in target_object)

  # Create a grid with the filled area
  filled_grid = tuple(
    tuple(target_color if any(col <= j and row == i for _, (row, col) in target_object) else I[i][j] for j in range(len(I[0]))) 
    for i in range(len(I))
  ) 
  return filled_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the largest object:**  Identifies the largest object.
2. **Get the object's color...:** Extracts the color and leftmost column of the object.
3. **Create a grid with the filled area:**  Constructs a new grid where each cell is filled with the object's color if it's to the left of the object on a row where the object exists. Otherwise, it retains the original cell value. 

These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility of DSLs for problem-solving.
