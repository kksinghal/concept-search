## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation connects non-background digits that are adjacent vertically. It essentially extends vertical lines of digits downwards until they hit another non-background digit or the edge of the grid.

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 
- The two '8's in column 1 are connected to form a continuous vertical line.
- The '8's in column 6 are already a continuous line and remain unchanged.
- All other digits are background and remain unchanged.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The '8's in column 2 are connected to form a continuous line.
- The '8' in column 7 is connected downwards to form a continuous line with the other '8's in that column.
- All other digits are background and remain unchanged.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- The '8's in column 1 are connected to form a continuous line.
- The '8's in column 6 are connected to form a continuous line. 
- All other digits are background and remain unchanged.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for i in range(height(I) - 1):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        fill_start = i + 1
        while fill_start < height(I) and I[fill_start][j] == mostcolor(I):
          fill_start += 1
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (k, j)) for k in range(i, fill_start)}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create a canvas `O` of the same size as the input grid `I`, filled with the most common color (background).
2. **Iterate through Columns:** Loop through each column `j` of the input grid.
3. **Find Non-Background Digits:** For each row `i` in the column, check if the cell is not background.
4. **Fill Downwards:** If a non-background digit is found, find the next non-background digit in the same column below it (or the edge of the grid). Fill all cells between these two points with the color of the first non-background digit.
5. **Paint to Output:** Paint the filled area to the output canvas `O`.
6. **Return Output:** Return the transformed grid `O`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    connected = False
    for i in range(height(I) - 1, -1, -1):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        if connected:
          O = fill(O, I[i][j], connect((i, j), (i + 1, j)))
        connected = True
      else:
        connected = False
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Initialize the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through Columns:** Loop through each column `j` of the input grid.
3. **Find and Connect from Bottom:** Iterate through rows `i` in reverse order (bottom to top) within each column. 
4. **Track Connected Status:** If a non-background digit is encountered, set `connected` to True. If a background digit is encountered, set `connected` to False.
5. **Fill if Connected:** If `connected` is True (meaning the current digit is part of a vertical line), fill the connection between the current digit and the one above it with the current digit's color.
6. **Return Output:** Return the transformed grid `O`.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  for obj in objs:
    upper = uppermost(obj)
    lower = lowermost(obj)
    left = leftmost(obj)
    O = paint(O, {(I[upper][left], (i, left)) for i in range(upper, lower + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create a blank canvas `O` of the same size as the input grid `I`, filled with the background color.
2. **Identify Objects:** Extract all objects from the input grid `I`, excluding the background.
3. **Iterate through Objects:** Loop through each extracted object `obj`.
4. **Determine Fill Range:** Find the uppermost and lowermost rows (`upper` and `lower`) of the object, as well as the leftmost column (`left`).
5. **Fill Vertically:**  Fill the column `left` from `upper` to `lower` with the color of the object on the output canvas `O`.
6. **Return Output:** Return the transformed grid `O`.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    start = None
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and start is None:
        start = i
      elif I[i][j] == mostcolor(I) and start is not None:
        O = fill(O, I[start][j], connect((start, j), (i, j)))
        start = None
    if start is not None:
      O = fill(O, I[start][j], connect((start, j), (height(I), j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Initialize the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through Columns:** Loop through each column `j` of the input grid.
3. **Track Line Start:** Use `start` variable to keep track of the starting row index of a non-background digit sequence.
4. **Fill on Background Encounter:** If a background digit is encountered and `start` is not None (meaning a line started earlier), fill all the cells from `start` to the current row with the color of the starting digit.
5. **Handle Ending Line:** If `start` is not None after processing all rows in a column, it means a line reached the bottom edge. Fill the remaining cells in the column with the starting digit's color.
6. **Return Output:** Return the transformed grid `O`.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for x in asindices(I):
    if index(I, x) != mostcolor(I):
      fill_start = x
      while index(I, fill_start) != mostcolor(I) and fill_start[0] > 0:
        fill_start = (fill_start[0] - 1, fill_start[1])
      O = paint(O, recolor(index(I, x), connect(fill_start, x)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create a blank canvas `O` of the same size as the input grid `I`, filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate through Cells:** Loop through each cell `x` (as an index tuple) in the input grid.
3. **Find Uppermost Non-Background Cell:** If the cell is not background, find the uppermost non-background cell directly above it in the same column (or the edge of the grid) and store it in `fill_start`.
4. **Recolor and Paint:** Recolor the line segment from `fill_start` to the current cell `x` with the color of the current cell and paint it onto the output canvas `O`.
5. **Return Output:** Return the transformed grid `O`.

These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation. They illustrate the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL in solving spatial reasoning problems.
