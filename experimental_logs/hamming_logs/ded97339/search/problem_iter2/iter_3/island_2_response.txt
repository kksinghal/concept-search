## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '8' on a background of '0's.  The program then extends these objects horizontally either to the left or right to create a single contiguous line of '8's within the object's original row. 

**Example Breakdowns:**

* **Input 0:** The '8' object starting at (3,1) is extended rightward to the last '8' at (3,6), filling the space with '8's.
* **Input 1:** The '8' object starting at (6,6) is extended rightward to the last '8' at (6,9), filling the space with '8's.
* **Input 2:** The '8' object starting at (1,1) is extended rightward to the last '8' at (1,5), and the object starting at (7,6) is extended rightward to the last '8' at (7,9). 


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions for "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 8:
      start = leftmost(obj)
      end = rightmost(obj)
      row = uppermost(obj)
      fill_range = {(row, j) for j in range(start, end + 1)}
      I = fill(I, 8, fill_range)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts objects from the grid `I`, treating '8' as foreground.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** It iterates over each object `obj`, and if its color is '8', it determines the leftmost (`start`) and rightmost (`end`) column indices of the object. Then, it fills the grid `I` with '8's from the `start` to `end` column in the object's row. 


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I,
                 merge({recolor(8,
                                connect((i, j),
                                        (i, rightmost(obj))))
                       for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)
                       if color(obj) == 8
                       for i, j in toindices(obj)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '8' Objects:**  Finds all objects in the input grid (`I`) and filters for those with color '8'.
2. **Find Rightmost Point:** For each '8' object, `rightmost(obj)` finds the column index of the rightmost cell.
3. **Create Connecting Line:** `connect((i, j), (i, rightmost(obj)))` generates a set of indices representing a horizontal line from each cell `(i, j)` in the object to the rightmost cell in the same row.
4. **Recolor Line:** `recolor(8, ...)` sets all cells in the connecting line to '8'.
5. **Merge and Paint:** All re-colored lines are merged into a single set of indices. Finally, `paint(I, ...)` applies these changes to the input grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 8:
      upper_left = ulcorner(obj)
      lower_right = lrcorner(obj)
      for i in range(upper_left[0], lower_right[0]+1):
        I = fill(I, 8, connect((i, upper_left[1]), (i, lower_right[1])))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies distinct objects in the grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Through Objects:** It iterates through each found `obj`.
3. **Check for Color 8:** If the object's color (`color(obj)`) is 8:
    - **Find Corners:** It finds the upper-left (`ulcorner(obj)`) and lower-right (`lrcorner(obj)`) corners of the object.
    - **Fill Horizontally:** It iterates through each row (`i`) from the upper-left to the lower-right corner of the object. For each row, it fills the grid `I` with '8's using `fill(I, 8, connect(...))`. The `connect(...)` function creates a horizontal line of indices connecting the leftmost and rightmost points of the object on that row, effectively filling the object horizontally.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               merge(
                   apply(
                       lambda obj: recolor(
                           8,
                           {(uppermost(obj), j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)}
                       ),
                       colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 8)
                   )
               )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '8' Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` finds all objects and `colorfilter(..., 8)` keeps only those colored '8'.
2. **Create Horizontal Lines:**  For each '8' object:
    - `leftmost(obj)` and `rightmost(obj)` get the column indices of its edges.
    - `{(uppermost(obj), j) for j in range(...)}` creates indices for a horizontal line spanning its width.
3. **Recolor to '8':** `recolor(8, ...)` sets all cells in each line to '8'.
4. **Merge Lines:** `merge(...)` combines all the lines into one set of indices.
5. **Paint onto Grid:** `paint(I, ...)` modifies the input grid `I` by coloring the merged indices with '8'.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 8:
      min_j = leftmost(obj)
      max_j = rightmost(obj)
      i = uppermost(obj)  
      for j in range(len(I[0])):
        if min_j <= j <= max_j:
          I = fill(I, 8, {(i, j)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, T)` finds all objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Modify:** It iterates through each object `obj`:
   - If the object's color is 8 (`color(obj) == 8`):
      - It finds the leftmost (`min_j`) and rightmost (`max_j`) column indices of the object.
      - It gets the row index (`i`) of the object.
      - It then iterates through each column (`j`) in the grid. 
      - If the current column `j` is within the object's horizontal span (`min_j <= j <= max_j`), it fills the cell at (`i`, `j`) with '8' using `fill(I, 8, {(i, j)})`.
3. **Return Modified Grid:**  Finally, it returns the modified grid `I`.
