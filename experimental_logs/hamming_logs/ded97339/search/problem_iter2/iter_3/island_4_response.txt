## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the longest horizontal line segment of a specific color (8 in these examples) for each object and extending it to span the object's horizontal boundaries. 

* **Input_0:** The single object has its horizontal line segment extended to the left, covering all columns where the object exists.
* **Input_1:** The object's longest horizontal segment is extended both left and right to the object's boundaries.
* **Input_2:** Similar to Input_1, the longest horizontal segment is extended to the left and right within the object.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    rows = {i for v, (i, j) in obj}
    for row in rows:
      cols = {j for v, (i, j) in obj if i == row}
      min_col, max_col = min(cols), max(cols)
      for col in range(min_col, max_col + 1):
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {(row, col)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  The code first identifies all objects in the input grid `I` using the `objects` function. The parameters ensure we consider objects of a single color (`univalued=True`), not connected diagonally (`diagonal=False`), and exclude the background (`without_bg=True`).
2. **Iterate through Objects and Rows:** It then iterates through each object and its occupied rows.
3. **Determine Horizontal Span:** For each row, it finds the minimum and maximum column indices (`min_col`, `max_col`) occupied by the object.
4. **Fill Horizontal Line:** The `fill` function then paints a horizontal line from `min_col` to `max_col` on that row with the object's color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    upper, lower = uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj)
    left, right = leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj)
    for i in range(upper, lower + 1):
      if any(I[i][j] == color(obj) for j in range(left, right + 1)):
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
          O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Blank Canvas:** The code initializes an output grid `O` filled with the background color, having the same dimensions as the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through Objects:**  It iterates through each object identified in the input grid.
3. **Find Object Boundaries:** For each object, it determines its bounding box using `uppermost`, `lowermost`, `leftmost`, and `rightmost`.
4. **Check for Horizontal Presence:** For each row within the bounding box, it checks if the object occupies any cell on that row.
5. **Fill Entire Row:** If the object is present in the row, it fills the entire row within the bounding box with the object's color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if any((i, j) in toindices(obj) for j in range(width(I))):
        line = {(i, j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)}
        O = fill(O, color(obj), line)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Rows and Objects:** This version iterates through each row of the grid and then through each object. 
2. **Check Row Intersection:** For every object, it checks if the object intersects with the current row.
3. **Fill Horizontal Line:** If the object intersects the row, it fills a horizontal line spanning from the object's leftmost to rightmost column on that row. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    min_row, max_row = uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj)
    min_col, max_col = leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj)
    for row in range(min_row, max_row + 1):
      for col in range(min_col, max_col + 1):
        if (row, col) in toindices(obj):
          O = fill(O, color(obj), {(row, k) for k in range(min_col, max_col + 1)})
          break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Objects and Boundaries:**  Similar to previous versions, it identifies objects and their bounding boxes.
2. **Iterate and Fill:**  It iterates through every cell within the bounding box. Upon encountering a cell belonging to the object, it fills the entire row within the bounding box with the object's color and moves to the next row.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    min_row, max_row = uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj)
    min_col, max_col = leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj)
    for row in range(min_row, max_row + 1):
      if any(I[row][col] == color(obj) for col in range(min_col, max_col + 1)):
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {(row, j) for j in range(min_col, max_col + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Boundaries:** This version finds each object and its bounding box.
2. **Check Row and Fill:** It then iterates through rows in the bounding box. If any cell in that row, within the bounding box, belongs to the object, it fills the entire row with the object's color. 

These five versions showcase different logical approaches and DSL function combinations to achieve the same visual transformation. Each version utilizes various methods for iterating through the grid, identifying relevant cells, and applying the fill operation.
