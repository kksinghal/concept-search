## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to connect objects of the same color that are horizontally or vertically adjacent. Instead of simply merging them into a single object, the connection is made by filling the space between them with the object's color. 

* **Input_0:** Two separate objects of color '8' are connected horizontally.
* **Input_1:** Two separate objects of color '8' are connected horizontally.
* **Input_2:** Two separate objects of color '8' are connected both horizontally and vertically.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  c = mostcolor(I)
  o = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for i in range(len(o)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(o)):
      oi = totuple(o)[i]
      oj = totuple(o)[j]
      if color(oi) == color(oj):
        if hmatching(oi, oj):
          min_row = min(uppermost(oi), uppermost(oj))
          max_row = max(lowermost(oi), lowermost(oj))
          min_col = min(leftmost(oi), leftmost(oj))
          max_col = max(rightmost(oi), rightmost(oj))
          I = fill(I, color(oi), ((min_row, min_col), (max_row, max_col)))
        if vmatching(oi, oj):
          min_row = min(uppermost(oi), uppermost(oj))
          max_row = max(lowermost(oi), lowermost(oj))
          min_col = min(leftmost(oi), leftmost(oj))
          max_col = max(rightmost(oi), rightmost(oj))
          I = fill(I, color(oi), ((min_row, min_col), (max_row, max_col)))
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** It starts by extracting objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate and Connect:**  It iterates through each pair of objects. 
   - If they share the same color and have matching rows (horizontal connection), it fills the space between them.
   - Similarly, it checks for matching columns (vertical connection) and fills the space if found.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  c = mostcolor(I)
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != c:
        # Horizontal Check
        if j + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j] == I[i][j + 1]:
          O = fill(O, I[i][j], ((i, i), (j, j + 1)))
        # Vertical Check
        if i + 1 < len(I) and I[i][j] == I[i + 1][j]:
          O = fill(O, I[i][j], ((i, i + 1), (j, j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Cells:**  This version iterates directly through each cell of the input grid.
2. **Check Adjacent Cells:** For each non-background cell, it checks its immediate right (horizontal) and bottom (vertical) neighbors.
3. **Fill if Same Color:** If the adjacent cell has the same color, it fills the space between them.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  c = mostcolor(I)
  o = objects(I, T, F, T)
  while True:
    merged = False
    for i in range(len(o)):
      for j in range(i + 1, len(o)):
        oi = totuple(o)[i]
        oj = totuple(o)[j]
        if color(oi) == color(oj) and (hmatching(oi, oj) or vmatching(oi, oj)):
          union = combine(oi, oj)
          I = paint(I, union)
          o = remove(oi, o)
          o = remove(oj, o)
          o = insert(union, o)
          merged = True
          break
      if merged:
        break
    if not merged:
      break
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Merge:** This version iterates through object pairs and merges them if they have the same color and are horizontally or vertically adjacent.
2. **Update Objects:** After each merge, it updates the object set to reflect the newly merged object.
3. **Loop Until No Merges:** This process continues until no more merges are possible.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  c = mostcolor(I)
  o = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in o:
    for other_obj in o:
      if obj != other_obj and color(obj) == color(other_obj):
        # Horizontal Check
        if hmatching(obj, other_obj):
          min_col = min(leftmost(obj), leftmost(other_obj))
          max_col = max(rightmost(obj), rightmost(other_obj))
          for row in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
            I = fill(I, color(obj), ((row, min_col), (row, max_col)))
        # Vertical Check
        if vmatching(obj, other_obj):
          min_row = min(uppermost(obj), uppermost(other_obj))
          max_row = max(lowermost(obj), lowermost(other_obj))
          for col in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1):
            I = fill(I, color(obj), ((min_row, col), (max_row, col)))
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Fill:** This version iterates through pairs of objects, and if they have the same color, it performs both horizontal and vertical checks.
2. **Fill Rows/Columns:** If a connection (matching row or column) is found, it fills the corresponding rows or columns with the object's color.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  for _ in range(len(I)):  # Iterate enough times to ensure connections
    for i in range(len(I)):
      for j in range(len(I[0])):
        if I[i][j] != 0:
          # Connect Right
          if j + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j] == I[i][j + 1] and I[i][j + 1] != 0:
            I = fill(I, I[i][j], ((i, i), (j, j + 1)))
          # Connect Down
          if i + 1 < len(I) and I[i][j] == I[i + 1][j] and I[i + 1][j] != 0:
            I = fill(I, I[i][j], ((i, i + 1), (j, j)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Connect:** This version iterates through the grid multiple times to ensure all possible connections are made.
2. **Connect Direct Neighbors:** It connects cells of the same color that are directly to the right or below the current cell.
3. **Multiple Iterations:** Multiple iterations help in connecting objects that might require multiple steps to be fully linked.


These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation.
