## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '8' on the grid and extending them horizontally to the right edge of the grid, but only until they encounter another object. This means the extension should stop if it reaches another '8' that's part of a different object. 

Let's analyze each input-output pair to understand the behavior:

* **Input_0:** The topmost '8' object extends to the right edge, while the lower object extends rightward until it hits the rightmost '8' of the top object.
* **Input_1:** The single '8' object extends rightwards until it encounters the rightmost '8'.
* **Input_2:**  The top and bottom '8' objects extend rightwards until they hit the rightmost '8' of the other object.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):  # Iterate over all objects
        if color(obj) == 8:  # Consider only objects of color '8'
            max_j = rightmost(obj)  # Find the rightmost column of the object
            for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):  # Iterate over rows of the object
                if (i, max_j) in toindices(obj):  # If the cell is the rightmost cell of the object in that row
                    O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j) for j in range(max_j, width(I)) if (i, j) not in toindices(objects(O, T, F, T))})  # Fill with '8' from the rightmost column to the right edge, but only if the cell doesn't belong to another object
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Objects:**  The program iterates through each '8' object on the grid.
2. **Find Rightmost Column:** For each object, it determines the rightmost column index (`max_j`).
3. **Iterate Rows:** It then iterates through each row of the object.
4. **Rightmost Cell Check:** It checks if the cell at the current row and `max_j` belongs to the object.
5. **Horizontal Extension:** If it does, it extends the object rightwards by filling with '8' until the right edge or another object is encountered.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    occupied = set()  # Keep track of filled cells
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        if color(obj) == 8:
            for i, j in toindices(obj):
                occupied.add((i, j))  # Mark object cells as occupied
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        if color(obj) == 8:
            for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
                for j in range(leftmost(obj), width(I)):
                    if (i, j) in occupied:  # Stop if encountering a filled cell
                        break
                    elif (i, j) in toindices(obj): # Continue if within the object
                        continue
                    else:
                        O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j)})  # Fill with '8' otherwise
                        occupied.add((i, j))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Mark Occupied Cells:** It first iterates over all '8' objects and marks their cells as occupied.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** It iterates again and tries to extend each '8' object cell by cell to the right.
3. **Stop at Filled Cells:** The extension stops if it encounters a cell marked as occupied, signifying either another object or an already extended part of the current object.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        if color(obj) == 8:
            max_j = rightmost(obj)
            for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
                if (i, max_j) in toindices(obj):
                    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, j) for j in range(max_j, width(I)) if index(O, (i, j)) != 8}))  # Fill with '8' from the rightmost column to the right edge, but only if the cell doesn't already contain an '8'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Rightmost Column:**  Similar to Version 1, it determines the rightmost column of each '8' object.
2. **Iterate Rows and Check:**  It iterates through rows and checks for the rightmost cell.
3. **Conditional Painting:** Instead of filling, it uses `paint` to apply the color '8' to a newly created object that spans from the rightmost column to the edge, excluding cells that already contain '8'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        if color(obj) == 8:
            for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
                for k in range(j + 1, width(I)):
                    if index(O, (i, k)) != 8:  # If the cell doesn't contain an '8'
                        O = fill(O, 8, {(i, k)})
                    else:
                        break  # Stop extending if an '8' is encountered
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over Object Cells:**  It iterates over each cell of every '8' object.
2. **Extend Rightward:** For each cell, it tries to extend rightward, cell by cell.
3. **Conditional Filling:** It fills a cell with '8' only if it doesn't already contain an '8'.
4. **Break on '8':**  The extension stops if an '8' is encountered during the rightward scan.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 8:
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
        if any((i, j) in toindices(obj) for j in range(width(I))):  # If the row contains any part of the object
          O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), width(I)) if index(O, (i, j)) != 8})  # Fill the entire row from the object's leftmost point with '8', excluding cells that already contain an '8'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Objects and Rows:** The program iterates over '8' objects and then their rows.
2. **Check for Object Presence:**  For each row, it checks if any part of the object is present in that row.
3. **Fill Entire Row:** If the object is present, it fills the entire row from the object's leftmost point to the right edge with '8', excluding cells that already have an '8'.
