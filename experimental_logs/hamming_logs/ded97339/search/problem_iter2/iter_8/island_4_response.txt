## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to involve extending the color of an object horizontally until it encounters a different object. The background color (0 in these examples) is not modified.

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** The vertical line of 8s is extended rightwards, filling the space until the next object (also an 8) is encountered.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**  The vertical line of 8s is extended rightwards. The extension continues through the background and stops upon encountering another object (an 8) in the seventh row.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:** Both vertical lines of 8s are extended rightwards. Similar to the previous examples, the extension halts upon encountering a different object.

## Program & Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      min_j = leftmost(obj)
      max_j = rightmost(obj)
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
        for j in range(min_j, max_j + 1):
          if (i, j) in toindices(obj):
            first_color = I[i][j]
            O = paint(O, recolor(first_color, frozenset({(i, k) for k in range(min_j, max_j + 1)})))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** The program iterates through each non-background object in the input grid `I`.
2. **Find Horizontal Boundaries:** For each object, it determines the leftmost (`min_j`) and rightmost (`max_j`) column indices occupied by the object.
3. **Fill Horizontally:** It then iterates through each row within the object's vertical span and fills horizontally from `min_j` to `max_j` with the object's color. 

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(height(I)):
      current_color = None
      start_j = None
      for j in range(width(I)):
        if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
          if current_color is None:
            current_color = I[i][j]
            start_j = j
          elif I[i][j] == current_color:
            continue
          else:
            O = paint(O, recolor(current_color, frozenset({(i, k) for k in range(start_j, j)})))
            current_color = I[i][j]
            start_j = j
      if current_color is not None:
        O = paint(O, recolor(current_color, frozenset({(i, k) for k in range(start_j, width(I))})))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Rows:** The program iterates through each row of the input grid.
2. **Track Color and Start:** It maintains `current_color` and `start_j` to track the current object's color and the starting column index.
3. **Fill on Color Change:** When a different non-background color is encountered or the end of the row is reached, it fills horizontally from `start_j` to the current column index (or end of row) with `current_color`.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I) - 1):
            if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I):
                O = paint(O, recolor(I[i][j], frozenset({(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))})))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Identify Gaps:** The program iterates through the grid and identifies instances where a non-background color is followed by the background color in the same row.
2. **Fill from Gap:** When such a gap is found, it fills horizontally from the current column index to the end of the row with the non-background color.


**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return rot270(cacbcbabiceaebfhbbjacgedegbajbdd(rot90(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Rotate Input:** Rotates the input grid 90 degrees clockwise using `rot90`.
2. **Apply Vertical Transformation:** Applies a modified version of the provided `cacbcbabiceaebfhbbjacgedegbajbdd` function, which is designed to work on columns, effectively performing the horizontal extension on the rotated grid.
3. **Rotate Output:** Rotates the resulting grid back to its original orientation using `rot270` (270 degrees clockwise, equivalent to 90 degrees counter-clockwise).

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      first_color = color(obj)
      min_j = leftmost(obj)
      max_j = rightmost(obj)
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
        O = paint(O, recolor(first_color, frozenset({(i, k) for k in range(min_j, max_j + 1)})))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Blank Canvas:** The program starts by creating a blank canvas `O` of the same size as the input grid `I`, filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** It then iterates through each non-background object in the input grid.
3. **Determine Horizontal Span:**  For each object, it identifies the leftmost and rightmost column indices (`min_j`, `max_j`) it occupies.
4. **Paint on Canvas:** Using these boundaries, the program paints the object's color onto the canvas `O`, effectively extending the object horizontally within its vertical span.
