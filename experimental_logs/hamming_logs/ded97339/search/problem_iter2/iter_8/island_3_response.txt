## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the largest object in the grid and extends it horizontally to the right until it encounters another object or the grid boundary.

**Input_0:**  The largest object (color 8) is extended rightward from its existing cells, filling the space until the rightmost '8' in each row.

**Input_1:**  The vertical line of '8's is extended rightward, stopping at the other existing '8's or the grid edge.

**Input_2:** Similar to Input_0 and Input_1, the largest object (color 8) is expanded horizontally to the right.

## Program to be Generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the largest object 
  obj = argmax(objects(I, T, T, T), size)
  
  # Get object color 
  obj_color = color(obj)

  # Create a set of all column indices
  all_cols = frozenset(range(width(I)))

  # Iterate through each row
  O = tuple()
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    # Find columns occupied by the object in this row
    obj_cols = frozenset(j for j, v in enumerate(row) if v == obj_color)

    # Find columns to fill by taking the difference between all columns and 
    # columns not occupied by the object to the right of the object
    fill_cols = all_cols - frozenset(j for j in range(len(row)) if j > min(obj_cols) and j not in obj_cols)

    # Create the new row
    new_row = tuple(obj_color if j in fill_cols else v for j, v in enumerate(row))
    O = O + (new_row,)

  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the largest object and its color:** Like previous versions, we identify the largest object and its color using `objects`, `argmax`, and `color`.
2. **Iterate through rows and find occupied columns:** We loop through each row, identifying the column indices occupied by the target object's color in that row (`obj_cols`).
3. **Determine columns to fill:** For each row, we calculate `fill_cols` - the indices to be filled with the object's color. This involves finding all column indices (`all_cols`) and removing those not occupied by the object to the right of the object's existing cells.
4. **Construct new row and grid:** A new row is created by filling `fill_cols` with the object color and retaining other cells' original values.  The modified rows are combined to form the output grid (`O`).

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the largest object
  obj = argmax(objects(I, T, T, T), size)
  
  # Get object color and rightmost column
  obj_color = color(obj)
  obj_rightmost = rightmost(obj)

  # Extend the object to the right in each row
  O = tuple(
      tuple(
          obj_color if any(j >= k for k in range(obj_rightmost + 1) if I[i][k] == obj_color) else I[i][j]
          for j in range(width(I))
      )
      for i in range(height(I))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the largest object and relevant information:** Similar to previous versions, we locate the largest object, its color, and its rightmost column using `objects`, `argmax`, `color`, and `rightmost`.
2. **Extend the object horizontally:** We iterate through each cell in the grid. If a cell's column index (`j`) is greater than or equal to any column occupied by the target object in that row (`k`), it is filled with the object color. Otherwise, the original cell value is retained.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the largest object
  obj = argmax(objects(I, T, T, T), size)
  
  # Get the object's color
  obj_color = color(obj)

  # Create a function to fill a row to the right from a starting column
  def fill_row_right(row, start_col):
    return tuple(obj_color if j >= start_col and row[j] != obj_color else row[j] for j in range(len(row)))

  # Apply the fill function to each row
  O = tuple(
      fill_row_right(row, min([j for j, v in enumerate(row) if v == obj_color] or [width(I)]))
      for row in I
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate the largest object and its color:** Like previous versions, we find the largest object and its color using `objects`, `argmax`, and `color`.
2. **Define a row filling function:**  We define a helper function `fill_row_right` that takes a row and a starting column as input. It fills the row with the object color from the starting column to the right, preserving other cells.
3. **Apply the filling logic to each row:** We iterate through each row and apply `fill_row_right` starting from the leftmost occurrence of the object color in that row. If the object's color isn't present, the row remains unchanged.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the largest object and its color
  obj = argmax(objects(I, T, T, T), size)
  obj_color = color(obj)

  # Find the rightmost column of the largest object
  max_col = max(j for _, (i, j) in obj)

  # Create a new grid by extending the object to the right
  O = tuple(
      tuple(
          obj_color if any(k <= j <= max_col and v == obj_color for k, v in enumerate(row)) else v
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in I
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the largest object and its color:**  We identify the largest object and its color using `objects`, `argmax`, and `color`.
2. **Determine the rightmost column of the object:** We find the maximum column index (`max_col`) where the object's color is present using a generator expression.
3. **Extend the object to the right:** We iterate through each cell, filling it with the object color if its column index (`j`) falls between the leftmost and rightmost occurrences of the object's color in that row. 

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the largest object
  obj = argmax(objects(I, T, T, T), size)

  # Create a mask indicating object presence
  mask = tuple(
      tuple(1 if I[i][j] == color(obj) else 0 for j in range(width(I)))
      for i in range(height(I))
  )

  # Extend the mask horizontally to the right
  extended_mask = tuple(
      tuple(1 if any(mask[i][k] == 1 for k in range(j + 1)) else 0 for j in range(width(I)))
      for i in range(height(I))
  )

  # Apply the extended mask to fill the grid with the object's color
  O = tuple(
      tuple(color(obj) if extended_mask[i][j] == 1 else I[i][j] for j in range(width(I)))
      for i in range(height(I))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the largest object:** We find the largest object using `objects` and `argmax`.
2. **Create a mask representing object locations:** A binary mask (`mask`) is generated, with '1' indicating the presence of the object's color and '0' otherwise.
3. **Extend the mask horizontally:** The mask is extended to the right (`extended_mask`), marking all cells to the right of an object cell with '1'.
4. **Apply the extended mask to the grid:** We iterate through the grid, filling cells with the object's color where the `extended_mask` value is '1' and retaining the original value otherwise.
