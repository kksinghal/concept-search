## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify horizontal lines within each object and fill them with the color of the leftmost cell in that line. The background color remains unchanged. 

Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** 
* The object consisting of '8's has a single horizontal line spanning columns 2-7 at row 3. 
* This line gets filled with the leftmost '8's color, while other cells of the object retain their original color.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
* The object has two horizontal lines:
    * Columns 7-7 at row 1.
    * Columns 5-9 at row 6. 
* Each line gets filled with the color of its respective leftmost '8', maintaining the gap between them.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
* This input features three horizontal lines within the object:
    * Columns 1-5 at row 1.
    * Columns 5-5 at rows 1-6.
    * Columns 5-9 at row 7.
* As before, each line is filled with its leftmost cell's color.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      row_obj = frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (k, j) in obj if k == i)
      if size(row_obj) > 1:
        first_color = color(extract(objects(row_obj, False, False, True), lambda obj: size(obj) > 1))
        O = paint(O, recolor(first_color, toindices(row_obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Create an empty canvas (`O`) of the same size and background color as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate Objects:** Loop through each object (`obj`) in the input grid (excluding the background).
3. **Iterate Rows:** For each row within the object's bounding box, create a `row_obj` containing cells only from that row.
4. **Identify Horizontal Lines:** If `row_obj` has more than one cell, it represents a potential horizontal line.
5. **Fill with Leftmost Color:** Extract the color of the leftmost cell in the `row_obj` and use it to recolor the entire `row_obj` on the output canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for j in range(width(I)):
      column = frozenset((I[i][j], (i, j)) for i in range(height(I)))
      for obj in objects(column, False, False, True):
        if size(obj) > 1:
          first_color = color(extract(objects(obj, False, False, True), lambda obj: size(obj) > 1))
          O = paint(O, recolor(first_color, toindices(obj)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Columns:** The program iterates over each column of the input grid.
2. **Extract Column Objects:**  For every column, it extracts objects present in that column.
3. **Fill Horizontal Lines:** If an object spans multiple rows within the column, it represents a horizontal line and gets filled with the color of its leftmost cell.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
      for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
        if any((i, k) in toindices(obj) for k in range(j + 1, rightmost(obj) + 1)):
          first_color = I[i][j]
          O = paint(O, {(first_color, (i, k)) for k in range(j, rightmost(obj) + 1)})
          break
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Objects:** Iterates through each object in the input grid.
2. **Find Horizontal Lines:** Within each object, it checks for the presence of horizontal lines by comparing the row indices of adjacent cells.
3. **Fill with Leftmost Color:** If a horizontal line is found, it's filled with the color of the first cell encountered in that line.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
    first_color = I[uppermost(obj)][leftmost_j]
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      if (i, leftmost_j) in toindices(obj):
        O = paint(O, recolor(first_color, {(i, j) for j in range(leftmost_j, rightmost(obj) + 1) if (i, j) in toindices(obj)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Objects:** Loop through each non-background object in the input grid.
2. **Find Leftmost Cell:**  Identify the leftmost cell of the current object and store its color. 
3. **Fill Horizontal Lines:**  Iterate through each row of the object's bounding box. If a cell in this row matches the leftmost cell's column, recolor the continuous horizontal line starting from that cell with the stored color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
        min_j = leftmost(obj)
        first_color = I[first((i, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j == min_j)[0]][min_j]
        for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
            if j == min_j:
                O = paint(O, recolor(first_color, {(k, j) for k in range(i, lowermost(obj) + 1) if (k, j) in toindices(obj)}))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Objects:**  Iterate through all non-background objects in the input. 
2. **Find Leftmost Column:**  For each object, determine the column index (`min_j`) containing the leftmost cells. 
3. **Get First Color:**  Find the first cell within the object that belongs to the leftmost column and store its color. 
4. **Fill Horizontal Lines:**  Iterate through the object's cells. If a cell's column matches the leftmost column (`min_j`), recolor the vertical line starting from that cell downwards with the stored color, but only within the object's boundaries.

These five programs offer diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation while adhering to the provided DSL. Each version demonstrates a different way of identifying and manipulating objects and their properties.
