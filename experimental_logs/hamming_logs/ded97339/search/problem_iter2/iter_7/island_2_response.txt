## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions) of a specific color (8 in this case) and extending them horizontally to the right edge of the grid, but only filling in cells that are not part of other objects. Essentially, it's like painting a horizontal line from the rightmost point of each object to the edge, stopping at the boundaries of other objects.

**Input 0:** The rightmost 8 in each object is extended to the right edge, filling in the empty space but stopping at the existing vertical line of 8s.

**Input 1:** Similar to Input 0, the horizontal extension of 8s happens, but it's more noticeable on the 7th row where the extension stops at the existing object.

**Input 2:** The horizontal extensions occur for each vertical line of 8s, again respecting the boundaries of other objects.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL functions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        if color(obj) == 8:
            max_j = rightmost(obj)
            for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
                if (i, max_j) in toindices(obj):
                    O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j) for j in range(max_j, width(I)) if (i, j) not in toindices(objects(I, T, F, T))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** Loop through each object in the input grid.
2. **Check color:** If the object's color is 8, proceed.
3. **Find rightmost point:** Identify the rightmost column index (`max_j`) of the object.
4. **Iterate through rows:** For each row within the object's bounding box:
    - **Check if cell is part of object:** If the cell at `(i, max_j)` belongs to the object, proceed.
    - **Fill horizontally:**  Fill the cells from `max_j` to the right edge of the grid with 8, but only if the cell is not part of any other object.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for obj in colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 8):
        right_edge = hfrontier((0, rightmost(obj)))
        O = underfill(O, 8, intersection(right_edge, backdrop(obj)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Filter objects by color:** Select only objects with color 8.
2. **Create right edge:** For each object, create a horizontal line (`right_edge`) starting from its rightmost point.
3. **Find intersection:**  Identify the intersection between the right edge and the object's bounding box.
4. **Underfill:** Fill the intersected cells with 8, but only if they are background cells.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), asobject(I))
    for obj in colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 8):
        for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
            if any((i, j) in toindices(obj) for j in range(width(I))):
                O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j) for j in range(rightmost(obj), width(I))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create blank canvas:** Create a canvas filled with the background color and the same dimensions as the input.
2. **Paint existing objects:** Paint all objects from the input onto the blank canvas.
3. **Iterate through objects:**  Loop through each object with color 8.
4. **Iterate through rows:**  For each row within the object's bounding box:
    - **Check for object presence:** If the row contains any part of the object, proceed.
    - **Fill horizontally:** Fill the cells from the object's rightmost point to the right edge with 8.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 8):
    start_j = rightmost(obj)
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      if (i, start_j) in toindices(obj):
        for j in range(start_j + 1, width(I)):
          if (i, j) not in toindices(objects(O, T, F, T)):
            O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j)})
          else:
            break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** Loop through each object with color 8.
2. **Find rightmost point:** Identify the rightmost column index (`start_j`) of the object.
3. **Iterate through rows:** For each row within the object's bounding box:
   - **Check if the cell is part of the object:** If the cell at `(i, start_j)` belongs to the object, proceed.
   - **Extend horizontally:** Iterate through columns from `start_j + 1` to the right edge of the grid:
      - **Fill if empty:** If the cell is not part of any other object, fill it with 8.
      - **Stop if object encountered:** If another object is encountered, stop extending the line for this row.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 8:
      max_col = rightmost(obj)
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
        if any((i, j) in toindices(obj) for j in range(max_col, width(I))):
          O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j) for j in range(max_col, width(I)) if not any((i, k) in toindices(objects(O, T, F, T) - {obj}) for k in range(j, width(I)))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** Loop through each object in the input grid.
2. **Check color:** If the object's color is 8, proceed.
3. **Find rightmost column:** Identify the rightmost column index (`max_col`) of the object.
4. **Iterate through rows:** For each row within the object's bounding box:
   - **Check for object presence to the right:** If the row contains any part of the object to the right of `max_col`, proceed.
   - **Fill horizontally, stopping at objects:** Fill the cells from `max_col` to the right edge of the grid with 8, but only if there are no other objects present in the remaining columns of that row. 

These five program versions offer distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and diversity of solutions possible within the given DSL.
