## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the longest horizontal line of a unique color (different from the background color) in the input grid and extending it to the right edge of the grid. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:**

- **Input 0:** The longest horizontal line is formed by the digit '8' at the 4th row. 
- **Output 0:**  The line of '8's in the 4th row is extended to the right edge of the grid.

**Pair 1:**

- **Input 1:** The longest horizontal line is formed by the digit '8' starting at the 7th row, 6th column.
- **Output 1:** The line of '8's starting at the 7th row, 6th column is extended to the right edge of the grid.

**Pair 2:**

- **Input 2:**  The longest horizontal line is formed by the digit '8' at the 8th row.
- **Output 2:** The line of '8's in the 8th row is extended to the right edge of the grid.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: width(obj) if hline(obj) else 0)
  start = (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj))
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), obj)
  return fill(O, color(obj), connect(start, (start[0], width(I) - 1)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the longest horizontal line:**
    - `objects(I, T, F, T)`: Extracts all objects from the input grid `I`.
    - `argmax(..., lambda obj: width(obj) if hline(obj) else 0)`: Finds the object with maximum width among horizontal lines.
2. **Get starting point for extension:**
    - `start = (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj))`: Finds the rightmost point of the identified line.
3. **Create a canvas and paint the object:**
    - `O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), obj)`: Creates a blank canvas and paints the identified object onto it.
4. **Extend the line:**
    - `fill(O, color(obj), connect(start, (start[0], width(I) - 1)))`: Fills the canvas with the object's color from the starting point to the right edge.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if hline(obj):
      start = (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj))
      O = paint(O, obj)
      O = fill(O, color(obj), connect(start, (start[0], width(I) - 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through all objects:**
    - `for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):`: Iterates through each object in the input grid.
2. **Check for horizontal lines:**
    - `if hline(obj):`:  Proceeds only if the object is a horizontal line.
3. **Extend the line:**
    - Same as in Version 1, extends the line from its rightmost point to the right edge.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  lines = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), hline)
  longest_line = argmax(lines, lambda obj: width(obj))
  start = (uppermost(longest_line), rightmost(longest_line))
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), longest_line)
  return fill(O, color(longest_line), connect(start, (start[0], width(I) - 1)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Filter for horizontal lines:**
    - `lines = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), hline)`: Extracts only the horizontal lines from the input grid.
2. **Find the longest line:**
    - `longest_line = argmax(lines, lambda obj: width(obj))`: Determines the longest line among the filtered lines.
3. **Extend the line:**
    - Similar to previous versions, extends the longest line to the right edge.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    row = I[i]
    if len(set(row)) == 2 and mostcommon(row) == mostcolor(I):
      v = other(set(row), mostcolor(I))
      O = fill(O, v, connect((i, row.index(v)), (i, width(I) - 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:**
    - `for i in range(height(I)):`: Iterates through each row of the input grid.
2. **Identify rows with a single unique color:**
    - `if len(set(row)) == 2 and mostcommon(row) == mostcolor(I):`: Checks if the row has only two unique colors and the most common one is the background color. 
3. **Extend the line:**
    - `v = other(set(row), mostcolor(I))`: Gets the unique color in the row.
    - `O = fill(O, v, connect((i, row.index(v)), (i, width(I) - 1)))`: Fills the row from the first occurrence of the unique color to the right edge.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    column = tuple(I[i][j] for i in range(height(I)))
    if len(set(column)) == 2 and mostcommon(column) == mostcolor(I):
      v = other(set(column), mostcolor(I))
      O = fill(O, v, connect((column.index(v), j), (height(I) - 1, j)))
  return rot270(O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Rotate the grid:**
    - Uses `rot270(O)` to apply the logic to columns instead of rows.
2. **Iterate through columns:**
    - `for j in range(width(I)):`: Iterates through each column (now represented as rows after rotation).
3. **Identify columns with a single unique color:**
    -  Similar to Version 4, but applied to columns.
4. **Extend the line:**
    - Similar to Version 4, but fills the column (visually a row after rotation).
5. **Rotate back to the original orientation:**
    - The final `rot270(O)` rotates the grid back to its original orientation. 

These five program versions provide diverse approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing different DSL function combinations and logic flows.
