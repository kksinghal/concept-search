## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to identify objects in the grid and extends them horizontally to the right, stopping either at the grid border or when encountering another object. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
* The object formed by the digit '8' is extended horizontally to the right.
* The extension stops at the right border of the grid.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
* The vertical object of '8's is extended horizontally.
* The extension stops upon encountering the single '8' cell to the right.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
* Each of the three objects ('8' clusters) is extended horizontally.
* The top and bottom extensions stop at the right border.
* The middle extension stops upon encountering the rightmost '8' object.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, each employing different logic and DSL functions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      for j in range(leftmost(obj), len(I[0])):
        if (i, j) in toindices(obj) or index(O, (i, j)) == 8:
          O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j)})
        else:
          break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** Loop through each object detected in the grid.
2. **Iterate through Rows of Object:** Loop through the rows where the object is present.
3. **Extend Rightward:**  Iterate through columns from the object's leftmost point to the grid's right edge.
4. **Fill or Break:** If the current cell is part of the object or already filled with '8', fill it with '8'. Otherwise, stop extending for that row.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      for j in range(rightmost_j, len(I[0])):
        if index(O, (i, j)) != 8:
          O = fill(O, 8, {(i, k) for k in range(rightmost_j, j)})
          break
        rightmost_j = j + 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** Loop through each object in the grid.
2. **Find Initial Rightmost Point:** Store the initial rightmost column index of the object.
3. **Iterate through Rows:**  Loop through the rows where the object is present.
4. **Extend and Update:**  Iterate rightward from the current rightmost point. Fill with '8' until a non-'8' cell is encountered. Update the rightmost point.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      O = fill(O, 8, {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I)) if not any((i, l) in toindices(o) for l in range(j, k) for o in objs - {obj})})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Get all objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate through Object Cells:**  Loop through each cell belonging to an object.
3. **Extend and Check:** For each cell, extend rightward, filling with '8'. Stop if the extension encounters a cell that belongs to a different object.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      extension = {(i, j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), width(I)) if index(I, (i, j)) == 8 or (i, j) in toindices(obj)}
      O = paint(O, recolor(8, extension))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** Loop through each object in the grid.
2. **Determine Extension:** For each row of the object, identify the continuous horizontal line that includes the object and any existing '8's.
3. **Paint Extension:** Fill the identified extension with '8' on the output grid. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    max_col = max(j for _, j in obj)
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      if any((i, j) in toindices(obj) for j in range(max_col + 1)):
        O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), width(I)) if (i, j) not in toindices(objects(O, T, F, T) - {obj})})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** Loop through each object.
2. **Find Maximum Column:** Determine the rightmost column occupied by the current object.
3. **Conditional Row Extension:** For each row, if the object has cells in columns up to the maximum column, extend the object rightward until encountering another object or the grid border. 


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same goal, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for solving spatial reasoning problems.
