## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the largest object in the grid and extending its color horizontally to the right, stopping at the grid's edge or the beginning of another object.

**Input 0:**
- The largest object is the vertical line of 8s. 
- The program extends the 8s to the right until reaching the edge of the grid.

**Input 1:**
- The largest object is the vertical line of 8s.
- The program extends the 8s to the right from the bottommost 8 in the object, stopping at the existing 8 in the same row.

**Input 2:**
- The largest object is the vertical line of 8s.
- The program extends the 8s to the right from the bottommost 8 in the object, stopping at the edge of the grid.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the largest object 
  obj = argmax(objects(I, T, T, T), size)
  
  # Get object color 
  obj_color = color(obj)

  # Find the rightmost column occupied by the object
  max_col = rightmost(obj)

  # Create a new grid, filling with the object color to the right up to max_col
  O = tuple(
    tuple(
      obj_color if any((i, j) in toindices(obj) for i in range(height(I))) and j <= max_col else v 
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the largest object and its color:** Uses `argmax`, `objects`, `size`, and `color` functions to find these.
2. **Find the rightmost occupied column:** Uses the `rightmost` function on the object.
3. **Fill to the right:** Iterates through the grid, filling cells with the object color if they are to the left of the rightmost occupied column and in a row where the object exists.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Get the largest object
  obj = argmax(objects(I, T, T, T), size)

  # Get the object's color
  obj_color = color(obj)

  # Iterate over each row of the input grid
  O = tuple()
  for i in range(height(I)):
    # Extract the current row
    row = I[i]

    # Check if the object is present in this row
    if any((i, j) in toindices(obj) for j in range(width(I))):
      # Find the rightmost occurrence of the object color in the row
      max_j = max(j for j in range(width(I)) if (i, j) in toindices(obj))
      
      # Extend the object color to the right in the row
      new_row = tuple(obj_color if j <= max_j else v for j, v in enumerate(row))
    else:
      # Keep the row unchanged if the object is not present
      new_row = row
    
    # Append the modified row to the output grid
    O = O + (new_row,)

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify largest object and color:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Iterate through rows:** Processes each row individually.
3. **Check object presence:** Determines if the object has cells in the current row.
4. **Find rightmost occurrence:** If the object is present, finds the highest column index containing the object's color in that row.
5. **Extend color:** Fills cells with the object color up to the rightmost occurrence in the row. 

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the largest object
  obj = argmax(objects(I, T, T, T), size)

  # Get the color of the largest object
  obj_color = color(obj)

  # Create a new grid, filling cells based on the object's presence
  O = tuple(
      tuple(
          obj_color if any(
              (k, l) in toindices(obj) and j <= l for k in range(height(I)) for l in range(width(I))
          ) else v
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in I
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify largest object and color:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Fill based on object presence:** Directly constructs the output grid. For each cell, it checks if there exists a cell belonging to the object in the same row and to the left of the current cell. If so, it fills the cell with the object color; otherwise, it keeps the original value.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the largest object in the grid
  obj = argmax(objects(I, T, T, T), size)
  
  # Determine the color of the largest object
  obj_color = color(obj)

  # Create a lambda function to check if a cell is part of the largest object
  is_in_obj = lambda i, j: (i, j) in toindices(obj)

  # Iterate over each row in the input grid
  O = tuple()
  for i in range(height(I)):
    # Find the rightmost column index occupied by the object in the current row
    occupied_cols = frozenset(j for j in range(width(I)) if is_in_obj(i, j))
    max_col = max(occupied_cols, default=-1)
    
    # Create the new row by filling cells to the right of the object with its color
    new_row = tuple(obj_color if j <= max_col else v for j, v in enumerate(I[i]))
    
    # Append the modified row to the output grid
    O = O + (new_row,)

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify largest object and color:** Same as previous versions.
2. **`is_in_obj` function:** Creates a lambda function for convenient checking if a cell is part of the largest object.
3. **Iterate through rows:** Similar to Version 2, processes each row.
4. **Find rightmost occupied column:** Uses the `is_in_obj` function to efficiently identify the highest column index containing the object's color in each row.
5. **Fill based on object presence:** Fills cells in the row to the right of the object with its color.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Identify the largest object in the input grid
  largest_object = argmax(objects(I, T, T, T), size)

  # Determine the color of the largest object
  object_color = color(largest_object)

  # Create a new grid by iterating over rows and columns
  O = tuple(
    tuple(
      # Check if the current cell or any cell to its left in the same row belongs to the object
      object_color if any((i, k) in toindices(largest_object) for k in range(j + 1)) else I[i][j]
      for j in range(width(I))
    )
    for i in range(height(I))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify largest object and color:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Construct new grid directly:** Uses nested loops to iterate through rows and columns, creating the output grid directly.
3. **Fill based on leftward object presence:** For each cell, it checks if the cell itself or any cell to its left in the same row belongs to the largest object. If true, it fills with the object color, maintaining the original value otherwise.

These five program versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the desired grid transformation, utilizing different function combinations and logical structures while adhering to the provided DSL.
