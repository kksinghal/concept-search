## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects composed of the digit '8' within the input grid.  For each of these objects, the transformation then extends the object horizontally to the right, filling in any empty spaces with '8's until it reaches the right edge of the grid, but only if these empty spaces do not already belong to another object. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

- The '8' object on the 4th row is extended to the right edge.
- The '8' objects on rows 5, 6, 7, 9 remain unchanged as they are blocked by another '8' object to their right.
- The '8' object on row 8 is extended to the right edge.

**Input_1:**

- The '8' object on the 2nd row is extended to the right edge.
- The '8' objects on rows 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 remain unchanged as they are blocked by another '8' object to their right.
- The '8' object on row 7 is extended to the right edge.

**Input_2:**

- The '8' object on the 2nd row is extended to the right edge.
- The '8' objects on rows 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 remain unchanged as they are blocked by another '8' object to their right.
- The '8' object on row 8 is extended to the right edge.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 8:
      for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
        O = fill(O, 8, {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I)) if (i, k) not in toindices(objects(O, T, F, T))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over objects:**  The code iterates through each object in the input grid `I`.
2. **Filter by color:** It checks if the object's color is '8'.
3. **Iterate over object cells:** For each cell belonging to the object, it attempts to fill the grid horizontally to the right.
4. **Conditional filling:** The filling only occurs if the cell being considered is not already part of another object in the current state of the output grid `O`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] == 8:
        O = fill(O, 8, {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I)) if (i, k) not in toindices(objects(O, T, F, T))})
        break  # Move to the next row once an '8' is encountered
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** The code iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check for '8':** If the cell's value is '8', it attempts to fill the grid horizontally to the right.
3. **Conditional filling:** The filling only occurs if the cell being considered is not already part of another object in the current state of the output grid `O`.
4. **Row break:** Once an '8' is encountered and processed in a row, the program moves to the next row to avoid unnecessary iterations.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 8:
      start_j = rightmost(obj)
      I = fill(I, 8, {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for j in range(start_j, width(I)) 
                     if (i, j) not in toindices(objs - {obj})})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** The code first identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate over objects:** It then iterates through each object.
3. **Filter by color:** It checks if the object's color is '8'.
4. **Fill from rightmost:** It identifies the rightmost column of the object and fills horizontally from that column to the right edge of the grid.
5. **Exclude self-collision:** The filling explicitly avoids overwriting cells belonging to other objects by excluding the current object from the collision check.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 8:
      max_j = rightmost(obj)
      row_indices = {i for i, j in toindices(obj)}  # Get all row indices occupied by the object
      for i in row_indices:
        I = fill(I, 8, {(i, j) for j in range(max_j, width(I)) if I[i][j] != 8})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over objects:**  The code iterates through each object in the input grid.
2. **Filter by color:** It checks if the object's color is '8'.
3. **Get object row indices:** The code identifies all row indices occupied by the object.
4. **Iterate over rows and fill:** For each row occupied by the object, it fills the grid horizontally to the right, starting from the rightmost column of the object.
5. **Direct color check:** It checks for empty spaces directly using the color value '8' during filling.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 8:
        I = fill(I, 8, {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I)) 
                       if all(I[i][l] != 8 for l in range(j, k))})  # Fill only if all cells between are not '8'
        break  # Move to the next row
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** The code iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check for '8':** If a cell contains '8', it proceeds to fill.
3. **Fill with condition:** It fills horizontally to the right only if all cells between the current cell and the target cell are not '8'. This ensures that it doesn't extend the object into other existing objects.
4. **Row break:**  After processing an '8', the program jumps to the next row to avoid redundant checks.

These five versions showcase different approaches and logic flows to achieve the same goal. They highlight the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL, allowing for diverse solutions to the same problem.
