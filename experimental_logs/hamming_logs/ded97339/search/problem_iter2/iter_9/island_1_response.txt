## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on each distinct object within the grid (a group of connected, same-valued cells). The transformation then stretches this object horizontally to the right, filling the row with its value until it encounters another non-background object.

**Input_0:**

* The single '8'-valued object is extended rightwards, filling the row until the last '8' in its row.

**Input_1:**

* The topmost '8' remains unchanged.
* The vertical '8'-valued object is stretched rightwards, encountering another '8' and thus stopping its expansion. 

**Input_2:**

* The topmost horizontal '8'-valued object is extended rightwards to the edge of the grid.
* The vertical '8'-valued object behaves similarly to Input_1.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, each utilizing different DSL functions and logic:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  c = mostcolor(I)
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      for k in range(j + 1, width(I)):
        if index(I, (i, k)) != c:
          break
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], ((i, i), (j, k)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** `O` is initialized as a copy of the input grid `I`. The most common color `c` (background) is identified.
2. **Iterating Objects:** The program iterates through each object (connected component) in the grid using `objects`.
3. **Horizontal Expansion:** For each cell in the object, the program expands rightwards, filling cells with the object's color until it hits a non-background cell. 
4. **Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    u, l = ulcorner(obj)
    r = rightmost(obj)
    O = paint(O, {(I[u][l], (u, j)) for j in range(l, r + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** `O` is initialized as a blank canvas (filled with the background color) of the same shape as the input grid.
2. **Object Iteration:** The code iterates through each distinct object in the grid.
3. **Horizontal Line Drawing:** For each object, the program identifies its upper-left and rightmost column indices. It then paints a horizontal line with the object's color from the left edge to the rightmost point of the object on the output canvas. 
4. **Output:** The canvas `O` now containing the stretched objects is returned.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  c = mostcolor(I)
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != c:
        k = j + 1
        while k < width(I) and I[i][k] == c:
          O = fill(O, I[i][j], ((i, i), (j, k)))
          k += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1, `O` is initialized as a copy of the input and the background color `c` is identified.
2. **Cell Iteration:** The program iterates through each cell of the grid.
3. **Rightward Expansion:** If a non-background cell is encountered, it expands rightwards, filling with the cell's color until it encounters a non-background cell or the edge of the grid.
4. **Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    j = 0
    while j < width(I):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        k = j + 1
        while k < width(I) and I[i][k] == mostcolor(I):
          k += 1
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], ((i, i), (j, k - 1)))
        j = k
      else:
        j += 1
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  `O` is initialized as a copy of the input grid.
2. **Row-wise Iteration:** The program iterates through each row.
3. **Finding Non-Background:** In each row, it finds the first non-background cell.
4. **Expanding and Skipping:** It expands this cell rightwards until a non-background cell is encountered, filling with the original cell's color. It then skips to the next non-background cell. 
5. **Output:**  The modified grid `O` is returned.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          next((v for v in row[j:] if v != mostcolor(I)), mostcolor(I)) 
          for j in range(len(row))
      )
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Row-wise Transformation:** This version uses list comprehension for a concise solution. It iterates through each row of the input grid. 
2. **Finding First Non-Background:** For each cell position in the row, it finds the first non-background value starting from that position. If none is found, it defaults to the background color.
3. **Output:**  The transformed grid is directly created and returned within the list comprehension.
