## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the longest horizontal segment within each object composed of the digit '8' and extending it to the right edge of the grid. Let's break down each input-output example:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The longest horizontal '8' segment is in the 4th row.
- This segment is extended rightward, filling the rest of the row with '8's.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The longest horizontal '8' segment is in the 7th row.
- This segment is extended rightward, filling the rest of the row with '8's.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
-  Two segments tie for the longest horizontal '8' segment (2nd and 8th rows).
-  Both segments are extended rightward, filling the rest of their respective rows with '8's.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if 8 in {v for v, _ in obj}:
      indices = toindices(obj)
      row_indices = [(i,j) for i, j in indices if I[i][j] == 8]  # Get indices of '8' cells within the object
      max_length = 0
      start_j = 0
      for i in range(height(obj)):
          current_length = 0
          for j in range(width(obj)):
              if (i + uppermost(obj), j + leftmost(obj)) in row_indices:
                  current_length += 1
              else:
                  current_length = 0
              if current_length > max_length:
                  max_length = current_length
                  start_j = j - current_length + 1
      O = fill(O, 8, {(uppermost(obj) + i, j + leftmost(obj) + start_j) for i in range(height(obj)) for j in range(max_length, width(I))}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** Loop through each object in the input grid `I`.
2. **Check for color '8':** If the object contains the digit '8', proceed.
3. **Find longest segment:**  Iterate through the object to determine the length and starting position of the longest horizontal segment of '8's.
4. **Extend segment:** Fill the grid `O` with '8's from the end of the longest segment to the right edge of the grid.
5. **Return modified grid:** Return the transformed grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 8:
      max_width = 0
      max_row = 0
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
          current_width = 0
          for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1):
              if (i, j) in toindices(obj) and I[i][j] == 8:
                  current_width += 1
              else:
                  current_width = 0
              if current_width > max_width:
                  max_width = current_width
                  max_row = i
      O = fill(O, 8, {(max_row, j) for j in range(leftmost(obj) + max_width - 1, len(I[0]))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Check for color '8':** Similar to Version 1.
3. **Find longest segment:** Iterate through each row of the object, tracking the length of consecutive '8's. Update `max_width` and `max_row` accordingly.
4. **Extend segment:** Fill the grid `O` with '8's from the end of the longest segment on `max_row` to the right edge.
5. **Return modified grid:** Similar to Version 1. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        if color(obj) == 8:
            indices = toindices(obj)
            row_counts = {i: sum(1 for _,j in indices if i == _ and I[i][j] == 8) for i in range(height(I))}
            max_row = max(row_counts, key=row_counts.get)
            O = fill(O, 8, {(max_row, j) for j in range(len(I[0])) if (max_row, j) in indices or j >= rightmost(obj)}) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Check for color '8':** Similar to Version 1.
3. **Count '8's in each row:** Use a dictionary `row_counts` to store the count of '8's in each row of the object.
4. **Find row with maximum '8's:** Identify the `max_row` having the highest count of '8's.
5. **Extend segment:** Fill the grid `O` with '8's in the `max_row`. Fill from the rightmost '8' of the object in that row to the right edge of the grid. 
6. **Return modified grid:** Similar to Version 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        if 8 in {v for v, _ in obj}:
            row_data = {}
            for i, j in toindices(obj):
                if I[i][j] == 8:
                    if i not in row_data:
                        row_data[i] = []
                    row_data[i].append(j)
            max_len = 0
            target_row = 0
            for row, cols in row_data.items():
                if len(cols) > max_len:
                    max_len = len(cols)
                    target_row = row
            O = fill(O, 8, {(target_row, j) for j in range(rightmost(obj), len(I[0]))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Check for color '8':** Similar to Version 1.
3. **Store '8' column indices for each row:** Use a dictionary `row_data` to store the column indices of '8's for each row in the object.
4. **Find row with longest '8' sequence:** Iterate through `row_data`, track the row with the maximum number of consecutive '8' column indices.
5. **Extend segment:** Fill the grid `O` with '8's in the identified `target_row`, extending from the rightmost '8' to the grid's right edge.
6. **Return modified grid:** Similar to Version 1. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        if color(obj) == 8:
            row_segments = {}
            current_row = None
            segment_start = None
            for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1):
                for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
                    if (i, j) in toindices(obj) and I[i][j] == 8:
                        if current_row is None:
                            current_row = i
                            segment_start = j
                        elif current_row != i:
                            if current_row not in row_segments:
                                row_segments[current_row] = (segment_start, j)
                            current_row = i
                            segment_start = j
                    else:
                        if current_row is not None:
                            if current_row not in row_segments:
                                row_segments[current_row] = (segment_start, j)
                            current_row = None
            if current_row is not None:
                row_segments[current_row] = (segment_start, rightmost(obj) + 1)
            max_len = 0
            target_row = 0
            for row, (start, end) in row_segments.items():
                if end - start > max_len:
                    max_len = end - start
                    target_row = row
            O = fill(O, 8, {(target_row, j) for j in range(rightmost(obj), len(I[0]))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Check for color '8':** Similar to Version 1.
3. **Identify horizontal '8' segments in each row:** Use `row_segments` to store the start and end column indices of each '8' segment in each row of the object.
4. **Find row with the longest segment:**  Iterate through `row_segments`, identifying the row with the longest '8' segment based on the difference between start and end indices.
5. **Extend segment:** Similar to Version 4, fill the grid from the segment's end to the grid's right edge.
6. **Return modified grid:** Similar to Version 1. 

These five versions offer diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation by employing different function combinations and logic within the provided DSL. They demonstrate the flexibility and power of the DSL in tackling spatial reasoning tasks.
