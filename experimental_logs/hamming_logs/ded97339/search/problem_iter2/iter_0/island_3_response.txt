## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place involves identifying the largest object in the grid (excluding the background color 0), extending this object horizontally to the right edge of the grid, and then keeping the original color of the object only in the cells that were originally part of the object. All other cells, including the newly filled cells, take on the background color. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The largest object consists of the digit '8'. This object is extended horizontally to the right edge of the grid.  The original '8' digits remain, while the newly filled cells and the rest of the grid become '0'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  Similar to the previous case, the largest object (digit '8') is extended to the right. Again, only the original '8' digits maintain their color.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The same logic applies here. The largest object, again '8', is extended horizontally, and only the original '8's retain their color.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the largest object
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T) 
  x2 = argmax(x1, size) 

  # Get object color and bounding box
  x3 = color(x2) 
  x4 = ulcorner(x2)
  x5 = lrcorner(x2)

  # Create a patch representing the filled area
  x6 = frozenset((x4[0]+i, j) for i in range(x5[0]-x4[0]+1) for j in range(x4[1], len(I[0])))

  # Fill the grid and then paint only the original object
  O = paint(fill(I, 0, x6), x2)  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify the largest object:** Uses `objects`, `argmax`, and `size` as in the examples.
2. **Get object properties:**  Extracts the color (`color`) and bounding box corners (`ulcorner`, `lrcorner`) of the largest object.
3. **Create fill patch:**  Generates a patch (`frozenset`) representing the area to be filled, extending from the object's leftmost to rightmost column and top row to the bottom of the grid.
4. **Fill and paint:** First, fills the entire area defined by the patch with the background color (`fill`). Then, paints the original object back onto the grid (`paint`), effectively achieving the desired outcome.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the largest object (same as Version 1)
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T) 
  x2 = argmax(x1, size) 

  # Get object color and rightmost column
  x3 = color(x2)  
  x4 = rightmost(x2)

  # Create a new object by extending each cell to the right edge
  x5 = frozenset((x3, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in x2 for k in range(x4, len(I[0]))) 

  # Paint the new object onto a blank canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), x5)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify largest object:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Get color and rightmost column:** Extracts the object's color and the column index of its rightmost cell.
3. **Extend object:** Creates a new object (`frozenset`) where each cell of the original object is extended horizontally to the right edge of the grid.
4. **Paint on blank canvas:** Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input (`canvas`) and then paints the extended object onto it.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the largest object (same as Version 1)
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T)
  x2 = argmax(x1, size)

  # Get object color and dimensions
  x3 = color(x2)
  x4 = shape(I) 

  # Create a mask by filling a canvas with 1s at the object's location
  x5 = underfill(canvas(0, x4), 1, toindices(x2))  

  # Multiply the input grid with the mask
  O = cellwise(I, x5, 0) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify largest object:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Get color and grid dimensions:** Extracts the object's color and the dimensions of the input grid.
3. **Create a mask:** Generates a mask grid where cells corresponding to the object's location have the value '1' and the rest are '0'. 
4. **Apply the mask:** Performs element-wise multiplication between the input grid and the mask.  This retains the original color in the object's location and sets other cells to '0'.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the largest object (same as Version 1)
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T)
  x2 = argmax(x1, size)

  # Get object color and its indices
  x3 = color(x2)
  x4 = toindices(x2) 

  # Iterate through the grid, keeping color only at object indices 
  O = tuple(tuple(v if (i, j) in x4 else 0 for j, v in enumerate(r)) for i, r in enumerate(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify largest object:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Get object properties:** Extracts the object's color and the indices of its cells.
3. **Iterate and filter:** Iterates through each cell in the grid. If a cell's index is present in the object's indices, it retains its color; otherwise, it's set to the background color '0'.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the largest object (same as Version 1)
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T) 
  x2 = argmax(x1, size) 

  # Get object's leftmost and rightmost column
  x3 = leftmost(x2) 
  x4 = rightmost(x2) 

  # Split the grid vertically into segments
  x5 = vsplit(I, len(I[0]))

  # Modify segments containing the object, keeping the rest unchanged
  O = tuple(s if x3 <= i <= x4 else tuple(0 for _ in range(len(s))) for i, s in enumerate(x5))
  return hconcat(*O)
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify largest object:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Find object's horizontal span:**  Determines the leftmost and rightmost columns occupied by the object. 
3. **Split into vertical segments:** Divides the grid into vertical segments, each one-column wide.
4. **Modify segments:** Iterates through the segments. If a segment's index falls within the object's horizontal span, it's kept as is; otherwise, it's replaced with a segment of all '0's. Finally, the segments are concatenated horizontally (`hconcat`) to form the output grid.


Each of these program versions provides a different approach to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility of the provided DSL and offering diverse solutions to the problem.
