## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on horizontally connecting non-background colored cells within each column that are directly adjacent to each other. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The single column of 8s in the input is extended horizontally to form a single connected object in the output.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Two separate vertical lines of 8s are connected horizontally at their point of vertical adjacency, creating a single L-shaped object.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**  Similar to Input_1, the vertically adjacent 8s are connected horizontally. This time, two separate objects are formed, as there's no vertical adjacency in the top and bottom parts of the column.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for i in range(height(I) - 1):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and I[i + 1][j] != mostcolor(I):
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j)), (I[i + 1][j], (i + 1, j))})
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], connect((i, j), (i + 1, j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Create a canvas `O` with the same shape as the input `I`, filled with the most common color (background).
2. **Iterate Through Columns:** Loop through each column `j` of the grid.
3. **Connect Adjacent Cells:** For each cell `(i, j)`, check if it and the cell below `(i + 1, j)` are not background. If true, paint both cells onto the canvas and connect them horizontally by filling the line between them with the color of the top cell.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for i in range(height(I) - 1):
      if index(I, (i, j)) == index(I, (i + 1, j)) and index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, index(O, (i, j)), connect((i, j), (i + 1, j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Modification:**  Instead of creating a new canvas, directly modify the input grid `I` and store it as `O`.
2. **Check for Same Color:** Iterate through the grid and connect cells if they are vertically adjacent and have the same color, excluding the background color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  for obj in objs:
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
      if contained((v, (i + 1, j)), obj):
        O = fill(O, v, connect((i, j), (i + 1, j)))
  return paint(O, merge(objs)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Detect all non-background objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Connect Within Objects:** For each object, find cells directly below each other and connect them horizontally.
3. **Paint Objects:** After connecting cells within each object, paint all objects onto the initially blank canvas `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    current_color = mostcolor(I)
    start_i = None
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and current_color == mostcolor(I):
        current_color = I[i][j]
        start_i = i
      elif I[i][j] == mostcolor(I) and current_color != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, current_color, connect((start_i, j), (i - 1, j)))
        current_color = mostcolor(I)
        start_i = None
    if current_color != mostcolor(I):
      O = fill(O, current_color, connect((start_i, j), (height(I) - 1, j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Track Color Changes:** Iterate through each column, tracking the current non-background color and its starting row index (`start_i`).
2. **Fill on Color Change:**  When the color changes back to background, fill the line between `start_i` and the current row index `i - 1`. 
3. **Handle Final Segment:** Fill the remaining segment if the column doesn't end with the background color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    contiguous_cells = [(i, j) for i in range(height(I)) if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I)]
    if len(contiguous_cells) > 1:
      for i in range(len(contiguous_cells) - 1):
        O = fill(O, I[contiguous_cells[i][0]][j], connect(contiguous_cells[i], contiguous_cells[i + 1]))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Non-Background Cells:** For each column, create a list `contiguous_cells` containing indices of non-background cells.
2. **Connect if Multiple Cells:** If a column has more than one non-background cell, connect them horizontally. 

These five versions showcase diverse approaches to solving the transformation using the provided DSL. Each version employs different logic and function combinations, demonstrating a multifaceted understanding of the problem.
