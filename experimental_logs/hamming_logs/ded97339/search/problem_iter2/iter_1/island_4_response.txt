## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation connects horizontally adjacent, same-colored non-background cells within each row. 

**Input 0:** The scattered '8's in each row are connected into a single horizontal line segment starting from the leftmost '8'.

**Input 1:** Similar to Input 0, the '8's in each row are connected. Notice the connection includes the isolated '8' in the top right corner.

**Input 2:** Again, the transformation connects the '8's. Observe how a single '8' on a row results in no change.

## Code Generation:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def connect_horizontal(I):
  O = []
  for row in I:
    newRow = list(row)
    first_non_zero = next((j for j, x in enumerate(row) if x != mostcolor(I)), -1)
    if first_non_zero != -1:
      for j in range(first_non_zero + 1, width(I)):
        if row[j - 1] != mostcolor(I) and row[j] != mostcolor(I):
          newRow[j] = row[j - 1]
    O.append(tuple(newRow))
  return tuple(O) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:**  The program iterates through each row of the input grid.
2. **Find the first non-background cell:** It locates the first non-background cell in the row. 
3. **Connect horizontally:** If a non-background cell is found, it iterates through the remaining cells in the row. If the current cell and the previous cell are both non-background, it replaces the current cell's value with the previous cell's value, effectively connecting them.
4. **Return modified grid:** After processing all rows, the program returns the modified grid.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def connect_horizontal_objects(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  for obj in objs:
    min_j = min(j for i, j in toindices(obj))
    max_j = max(j for i, j in toindices(obj))
    for j in range(min_j, max_j):
      I = fill(I, color(obj), {(uppermost(obj), j)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** The program identifies objects (connected components) of the non-background color.
2. **Connect within objects:** For each object, it finds the leftmost and rightmost column indices and fills all cells between them with the object's color. 

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def connect_horizontal_frontier(I):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      for j in range(1, width(I)):
        if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and I[i][j-1] != mostcolor(I):
          I = fill(I, I[i][j-1], {(i, j)})
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** The program iterates through each cell of the input grid.
2. **Check left neighbor:** For each cell, it checks if the current cell and its left neighbor are both non-background.
3. **Connect:** If the condition is met, it fills the current cell with the color of its left neighbor.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def connect_horizontal_shift(I):
  for i in range(height(I)):
    row = I[i]
    for j in range(1, width(I)):
      if row[j] != mostcolor(I) and row[j - 1] == mostcolor(I):
        shift_amount = next((k for k in range(1, j + 1) if row[j - k] != mostcolor(I)), 1)
        I = paint(I, shift(toobject({(i, j)}, I), (0, -shift_amount)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** This program iterates through each cell of the grid.
2. **Find gaps:** If it encounters a non-background cell followed by a background cell, it calculates the distance to the nearest non-background cell to the left.
3. **Shift and paint:** It then shifts the current object (single cell in this case) to the left by the calculated distance and paints it onto the grid.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def connect_horizontal_rle(I):
    O = []
    for row in I:
        newRow = []
        currentColor = mostcolor(I)
        currentCount = 0
        for c in row:
            if c == currentColor:
                currentCount += 1
            else:
                newRow.extend([currentColor] * currentCount)
                currentColor = c
                currentCount = 1
        newRow.extend([currentColor] * currentCount)
        O.append(tuple(newRow))
    return tuple(O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Run Length Encoding (RLE):**  This program uses a simplified version of run-length encoding to process each row. 
2. **Iterate and track:** It iterates through the row, tracking the current color and its consecutive count.
3. **Extend output:** When the color changes, it appends the previous color to the output row based on its count. 

## Conclusion:

These five program versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation. They showcase the flexibility and expressiveness of DSL in solving spatial reasoning tasks.
