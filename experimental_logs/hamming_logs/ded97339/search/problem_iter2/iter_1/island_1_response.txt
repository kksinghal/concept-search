## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to connect objects of the same color that are adjacent either horizontally or vertically. This connection manifests as a filled rectangle encompassing the original objects. 

**Input_0:** The two '8' objects are connected horizontally, forming a single rectangular object.

**Input_1:** The vertically aligned '8' objects are connected, forming a single rectangular object. The lone '8' remains unchanged.

**Input_2:** Two connections are made. First, the top two '8's are connected horizontally. Second, the vertically aligned '8's are connected, forming a single rectangular object. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def connect_objects(I):
  c = mostcolor(I)  # Find the background color
  o = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract all objects (excluding background)
  for i in range(len(o)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(o)):
      oi = totuple(o)[i]
      oj = totuple(o)[j]
      if color(oi) == color(oj):  # Check if objects have the same color
        if hmatching(oi, oj):  # Check horizontal matching
          min_row = min(uppermost(oi), uppermost(oj))
          max_row = max(lowermost(oi), lowermost(oj))
          I = fill(I, color(oi), (interval(min_row, max_row + 1, 1), interval(leftmost(oi), rightmost(oj) + 1, 1)))  # Fill horizontally
        if vmatching(oi, oj):  # Check vertical matching
          min_col = min(leftmost(oi), leftmost(oj))
          max_col = max(rightmost(oi), rightmost(oj))
          I = fill(I, color(oi), (interval(uppermost(oi), lowermost(oj) + 1, 1), interval(min_col, max_col + 1, 1)))  # Fill vertically
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify all objects (excluding the background) in the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Compare:** Loop through each pair of objects.
3. **Color Check:** If the objects have the same color, proceed.
4. **Horizontal/Vertical Matching:** Check for matching rows or columns, indicating potential for connection.
5. **Fill Rectangle:** If a match is found, calculate the bounding box of the combined objects and fill it with the object's color.

**Version 2:** 

```python
def connect_objects(I):
  c = mostcolor(I)
  o = objects(I, T, F, T)
  while True:
    merged = False
    for i in range(len(o)):
      for j in range(i + 1, len(o)):
        oi = totuple(o)[i]
        oj = totuple(o)[j]
        if color(oi) == color(oj) and adjacent(oi, oj):
          o = frozenset(remove(o, oi))
          o = frozenset(remove(o, oj))
          o = insert(combine(oi, oj), o)
          merged = True
          break
      if merged:
        break
    if not merged:
      break
  O = I
  for obj in o:
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Identify objects (excluding the background) in the input grid.
2. **Iterative Merging:** Repeatedly iterate through object pairs, merging adjacent objects of the same color until no more merges are possible.
3. **Paint Merged Objects:** After all merges, paint the final set of objects back onto a blank canvas.

**Version 3:**

```python
def connect_objects(I):
  c = mostcolor(I)
  o = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in o:
    for direction in [(0, 1), (1, 0)]: # Check horizontal and vertical directions
      shifted_obj = shift(obj, direction)
      for other_obj in o:
        if obj != other_obj and color(obj) == color(other_obj) and len(intersection(toindices(shifted_obj), toindices(other_obj))) > 0:
          I = paint(I, combine(obj, other_obj))
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Identify objects (excluding the background) in the input grid.
2. **Directional Shift and Check:** For each object, shift it horizontally and vertically and check for overlap with other objects of the same color.
3. **Merge and Paint:** If an overlap is found, merge the objects and paint the result back onto the grid.


**Version 4:**

```python
def connect_objects(I):
  c = mostcolor(I)
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != c:
        for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0)]:
          new_i, new_j = i + di, j + dj
          if 0 <= new_i < len(I) and 0 <= new_j < len(I[0]) and I[new_i][new_j] == I[i][j]:
            O = fill(O, I[i][j], ((i, new_i), (j, new_j + 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** Go through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check Neighbors:** For non-background cells, examine their right and bottom neighbors.
3. **Connect and Fill:** If a neighbor has the same color, fill the rectangle encompassing both cells with that color.

**Version 5:**

```python
def connect_objects(I):
  c = mostcolor(I)
  o = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for i in range(len(o)):
    obj = totuple(o)[i]
    expansion_made = True
    while expansion_made:
      expansion_made = False
      for direction in [(0, 1), (1, 0)]:
        shifted_obj = shift(obj, direction)
        for other_obj in o:
          if obj != other_obj and color(obj) == color(other_obj) and len(intersection(toindices(shifted_obj), toindices(other_obj))) > 0:
            obj = combine(obj, other_obj)
            expansion_made = True
            break
        if expansion_made:
          break
    I = paint(I, obj)
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify all objects (excluding the background) in the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Expand:** For each object, attempt to expand it iteratively in horizontal and vertical directions if it overlaps with another object of the same color. 
3. **Paint Expanded Objects:** After expansion attempts, paint the final objects back onto the grid.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the desired object connection transformation within the provided DSL. They showcase different strategies involving object manipulation, grid iteration, and conditional filling.
