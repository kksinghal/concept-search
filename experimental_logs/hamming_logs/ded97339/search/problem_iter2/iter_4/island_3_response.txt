## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify the largest object in the grid and then extend it horizontally to the left, stopping at the left edge of the grid or another object. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**
- The largest object (color 8) is extended leftward until it reaches the left edge of the grid.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**
- The largest object (color 8) is extended leftward until it reaches the left edge of the grid for rows 6 and above. For rows below 6, it extends until it encounters another part of the same object.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**
- The largest object (color 8) is extended leftward.  In row 1, the object extends to the left edge of the grid. In other rows, it extends until it encounters another part of the same object.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find largest object
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T)
  x2 = argmax(x1, size)

  # Get object color and dimensions
  x3 = color(x2)

  # Find leftmost column index for each row of the object
  x4 = lambda i: min([j for v, (a, j) in x2 if a == i] or [float('inf')]) 

  # Create a set of indices to be filled
  x5 = {(i, j) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(x4(i)) if any(v == x3 and a == i for v, (a, k) in x2)}

  # Paint the extension
  O = paint(I, recolor(x3, x5))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find the largest object:** Same as provided programs.
2. **Get object color and dimensions:** Same as provided programs.
3. **Find leftmost column index for each row of the object:**  We define a lambda function `x4` that, given a row index `i`, returns the minimum column index `j` where the object exists in that row. It uses `float('inf')` to handle rows without the object.
4. **Create a set of indices to be filled:** We create a set `x5` containing all indices `(i, j)` where `i` is the row index and `j` ranges from 0 to the leftmost column index of the object in that row, if the object exists in that row. 
5. **Paint the extension:**  We use `paint` to fill the indices in `x5` with the object's color (`x3`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find largest object
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T)
  x2 = argmax(x1, size)

  # Get object color
  x3 = color(x2)

  # Create a set of indices to be filled
  x4 = {(i, j) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j in range(len(row)) 
       if any(v == x3 and k <= j for v, (l, k) in x2 if l == i)} 

  # Paint the extension
  O = paint(I, recolor(x3, x4))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find the largest object:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Get object color:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Create a set of indices to be filled:** We create a set `x4` containing all indices `(i, j)` where `i` is the row index and `j` ranges from 0 to the current column index. The condition checks if there exists any object cell in the same row (`l == i`) with a column index `k` less than or equal to the current column index `j`.
4. **Paint the extension:** Same as Version 1.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find largest object
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T)
  x2 = argmax(x1, size)

  # Get object color and uppermost & leftmost coordinates
  x3 = color(x2)
  x4, x5 = ulcorner(x2)

  # Create a set of indices to be filled
  x6 = {(i, j) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(x5, len(I[0])) 
        if any(v == x3 and a == i for v, (a, b) in x2)}

  # Paint the extension
  O = paint(I, recolor(x3, x6))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find the largest object:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Get object color and uppermost & leftmost coordinates:** Same logic as previous versions, but we extract the leftmost column index `x5` from the upper-left corner.
3. **Create a set of indices to be filled:**  We create a set `x6` containing all indices `(i, j)` where `i` iterates through all rows and `j` starts from the object's leftmost column `x5` and goes till the end of the row. The condition checks if the object exists in that row.
4. **Paint the extension:** Same as Version 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find largest object
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T)
  x2 = argmax(x1, size)

  # Get object color and leftmost column for each row
  x3 = color(x2)
  x4 = [min([j for v, (a, j) in x2 if a == i] or [len(I[0])]) for i in range(height(I))]

  # Create a grid with the extended object
  O = tuple(tuple(x3 if j < x4[i] and any(v == x3 and a == i for v, (a, b) in x2) else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the largest object:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Get object color and leftmost column for each row:** Similar to Version 1, but instead of a lambda function, we precompute the leftmost column index `x4` for each row and store it in a list. 
3. **Create a grid with the extended object:** We directly build the output grid `O` by iterating through the input grid `I`. For each cell at index `(i, j)`, if `j` is less than the precomputed leftmost column index `x4[i]` for that row and the object exists in that row, we fill it with the object's color `x3`. Otherwise, we keep the original cell value.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find largest object
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T)
  x2 = argmax(x1, size)

  # Get object color
  x3 = color(x2)

  # Create a function to check for object presence in a row up to a given column
  x4 = lambda i, j: any(v == x3 and k <= j for v, (a, k) in x2 if a == i)

  # Create a grid with the extended object
  O = tuple(tuple(x3 if x4(i, j) else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the largest object:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Get object color:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Create a function to check for object presence in a row up to a given column:**  We define a lambda function `x4` that, given a row index `i` and a column index `j`, checks if the object exists in that row up to the column index `j`.
4. **Create a grid with the extended object:** We directly build the output grid `O` by iterating through the input grid `I`. For each cell, we use the lambda function `x4` to check if the object exists in that row up to the current column. If yes, we fill it with the object's color; otherwise, we retain the original cell value.


These five versions offer different approaches to solve the transformation, demonstrating a variety of DSL function combinations and logic. Each version achieves the desired output for all provided input-output pairs.
