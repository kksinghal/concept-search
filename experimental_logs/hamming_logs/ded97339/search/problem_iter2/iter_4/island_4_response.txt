## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on horizontally connecting digits of the same value that are on the same row. 

* **Input_0:** The single 8-valued object is extended horizontally to the left until it reaches another 8-valued cell. 
* **Input_1:** The row with multiple 8-valued cells is extended to the right, connecting the individual digits into a single horizontal object.
* **Input_2:**  This example showcases both left and right extension. The top row extends left to connect with the leftmost 8. The bottom row extends right to connect with the rightmost 8.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        O = paint(O, recolor(I[i][j], hfrontier((i, j))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Starts with output `O` as the input grid `I`.
2. **Iteration:** Iterates through each cell in the grid.
3. **Horizontal Extension:** If a cell is not the background color, it paints the entire horizontal frontier starting from that cell with the cell's color. 
4. **Output:** Returns the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    i, j = first(toindices(obj))
    O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), {(i, k) for k in range(width(I))}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Detection:** Identifies all non-background objects in the input.
2. **Canvas Creation:** Creates an empty canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
3. **Horizontal Painting:** For each object, it paints a horizontal line across the entire row of the object's first cell, using the object's color.
4. **Output:** Returns the painted canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        O = paint(O, recolor(I[i][j], connect((i, 0), (i, width(I) - 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Creates an empty canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Iteration & Connection:** Iterates through each cell, and if it's not the background color, it draws a horizontal line connecting the leftmost and rightmost points of that row using the cell's color.
3. **Output:** Returns the modified canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    row = I[i]
    first_non_bg = next((j for j, v in enumerate(row) if v != mostcolor(I)), None)
    if first_non_bg is not None:
      O = paint(O, recolor(row[first_non_bg], {(i, k) for k in range(width(I))}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Starts with output `O` as the input grid `I`.
2. **Row Iteration:** Iterates through each row.
3. **First Non-Background:** Finds the first non-background color in the row.
4. **Horizontal Painting:** If a non-background color is found, it paints the entire row with that color.
5. **Output:** Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    uppermost_row = uppermost(obj)
    O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), hfrontier((uppermost_row, 0))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Starts with output `O` as the input grid `I`.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each non-background object in the grid.
3. **Horizontal Frontier Painting:** For each object, it paints the horizontal frontier starting from the leftmost cell of the object's uppermost row, using the object's color.
4. **Output:** Returns the modified grid.


These five versions use different approaches and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same outcome, showcasing diverse solutions within the provided DSL.
