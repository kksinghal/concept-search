## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects made of the digit '8' on the grid. For each object, the transformation extends the object horizontally to the right edge of the grid, but only on a single row. This row is determined by finding the row within the object with the most number of '8's.

**Input_0:** The object is extended horizontally from the row with the most '8's (row 4).

**Input_1:**  The transformation acts on the row with the most '8's (row 7).

**Input_2:**  The row with the most '8's (row 3) is extended to the right edge.


## Program Version 1

**Code:**

```python
def solve_1fad071e(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        if 8 in {v for v, _ in obj}:
            row_data = {}
            for i, j in toindices(obj):
                if I[i][j] == 8:
                    if i not in row_data:
                        row_data[i] = []
                    row_data[i].append(j)
            max_len = 0
            target_row = 0
            for row, cols in row_data.items():
                if len(cols) > max_len:
                    max_len = len(cols)
                    target_row = row
            O = fill(O, 8, {(target_row, j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), len(I[0]))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** The code iterates through each object in the input grid `I` using `objects(I, T, F, T)`. 
2. **Identify '8' Objects:** It checks if the object contains the digit '8'.
3. **Find Row with Most '8's:** It finds the row index (`target_row`) with the maximum number of '8's within the object.
4. **Fill Row:**  Uses the `fill` function to fill the `target_row` with '8's from the leftmost '8' of the object to the right edge of the grid.

**Improvement over Existing Programs:**

- This version directly reuses the logic from Program_B, which already identified the correct row for extension.
- It modifies the `fill` function call to start from the `leftmost(obj)` instead of `rightmost(obj)` to extend the object to the right edge.


## Program Version 2

**Code:**

```python
def solve_1fad071e(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        if color(obj) == 8:
            rows = {i for i, j in toindices(obj)}
            target_row = max(rows, key=lambda r: len([1 for j in range(len(I[0])) if (r, j) in toindices(obj)]))
            O = fill(O, 8, {(target_row, j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), len(I[0]))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** Iterates through objects in the grid using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Check Object Color:** Uses `color(obj)` to check if the object is made of '8's.
3. **Find Row with Most '8's:** 
    - `rows = {i for i, j in toindices(obj)}` extracts all row indices of the object.
    - `max(rows, key=...)` finds the row with the maximum count of '8's using a lambda function to count occurrences on each row.
4. **Fill Row:**  Fills the `target_row` with '8's from the object's `leftmost` position to the grid's right edge using `fill`.

**Improvement over Existing Programs:**

- Uses `color(obj)` for a more concise check of the object's color.
- Employs a lambda function within `max` for a more compact way to find the row with the most '8's. 


## Program Version 3

**Code:**

```python
def solve_1fad071e(I):
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        if color(obj) == 8:
            target_row = valmax(toindices(obj), lambda x: x[0])
            O = paint(O, {(8, (target_row, j)) for j in range(leftmost(obj), len(I[0]))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** Creates an empty output grid `O` of the same size as the input `I` using `canvas` filled with '0's.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** Iterates over objects using `objects`.
3. **Check Object Color:**  Uses `color(obj)` to filter for objects made of '8'.
4. **Find Row with Most '8's:** `valmax(toindices(obj), lambda x: x[0])` finds the maximum row index within the object (since higher row indices mean more '8's in that row).
5. **Paint Row:**  Paints a horizontal line of '8's on the `target_row` from the object's leftmost point to the grid's right edge using `paint`.

**Improvement over Existing Programs:**

- Starts with an empty canvas for a cleaner approach.
- Uses `valmax` with a lambda function for a more efficient way to find the maximum row index directly. 


## Program Version 4

**Code:**

```python
def solve_1fad071e(I):
    O = I 
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        if 8 in {v for v, _ in obj}:
            hist = [0] * len(I) 
            for i, j in toindices(obj):
                if I[i][j] == 8:
                    hist[i] += 1
            target_row = argmax(range(len(hist)), lambda i: hist[i])
            O = fill(O, 8, {(target_row, j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), len(I[0]))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** Iterates through objects in the grid.
2. **Check for '8':** Checks if the object contains the digit '8'.
3. **Histogram for '8' Counts:** Creates a histogram `hist` to store the count of '8's in each row of the object.
4. **Find Row with Maximum '8's:** Uses `argmax` with a lambda function to find the index (row) with the maximum value in the histogram.
5. **Fill Row:**  Fills the `target_row` with '8's from the object's leftmost point to the grid's right edge.

**Improvement over Existing Programs:**

- Introduces the concept of a histogram for a more visual and potentially efficient way to count '8' occurrences in each row.
- Demonstrates the use of `argmax` for finding the index of the maximum value. 


## Program Version 5

**Code:**

```python
def solve_1fad071e(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        if color(obj) == 8:
            target_row = max(toindices(obj), key=lambda x: x[0])[0]
            O = paint(cover(O, obj), {(8, (target_row, j)) for j in range(leftmost(obj), len(I[0]))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** Iterates through objects in the grid.
2. **Check Object Color:** Checks if the object is made of '8's using `color(obj)`.
3. **Find Row with Most '8's (Implicit):**  `max(toindices(obj), key=lambda x: x[0])[0]` finds the maximum row index within the object's indices. This implicitly relies on the fact that higher row indices will be present if there are more '8's in those rows.
4. **Cover Existing Object:**  Uses `cover(O, obj)` to replace the original object on the grid with the background color. 
5. **Paint Row:** Paints a horizontal line of '8's on the `target_row` from the object's leftmost point to the right edge.

**Improvement over Existing Programs:**

- Combines the object covering and row painting steps for a more concise code structure.
- Implicitly finds the row with the most '8's by focusing on the maximum row index within the object.
