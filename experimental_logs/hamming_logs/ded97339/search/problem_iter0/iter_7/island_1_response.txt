## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying non-background digits in the input grid and extending them horizontally towards the right edge of the grid. However, this extension is limited by the vertical position of other non-background digits.  Let's break down the transformation for each example:

**Input_0:** The '8' digits are extended rightwards. However, the extension stops at the same row as another '8'.

**Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the '8' digits extend rightwards.  Notice how the extensions in columns 4 and 8 stop at the same row as the bottommost '8' in column 6.

**Input_2:**  Again, the '8's extend rightwards, but their extension is halted by the presence of other '8's in the same row. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def extend_right_limited(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        right_limit = width(I)
        for k in range(i + 1, height(I)):
          if index(I, (k, j)) != mostcolor(I):
            right_limit = min(right_limit, j + 1)
        O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, l) for l in range(j, right_limit)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  `O` is initialized as a copy of input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through Cells:** The code iterates through each cell `(i, j)` of the grid.
3. **Non-Background Check:** It checks if the current cell is a non-background color (`!= mostcolor(I)`). 
4. **Find Right Limit:** For each non-background cell, it finds the rightmost column index (`right_limit`) allowed for extension. This is determined by finding the nearest non-background cell below the current cell in the same column.
5. **Horizontal Extension:**  The program then fills the cells from the current cell's column `j` up to the `right_limit` with the current cell's color. 

**Program Version 2**

```python
def extend_right_limited(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    right_limit = width(I)
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, l) for l in range(j, right_limit)})
        right_limit = min(right_limit, j + 1)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty canvas `O` of the same size as the input grid, filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate through Columns:** Iterate through each column `j`.
3. **Right Limit Initialization:** For each column, initialize `right_limit` to the grid's width.
4. **Iterate through Rows:** For each row `i` in the current column:
   - **Non-Background Check:** If the cell `(i, j)` is not background:
      - Fill cells in `O` from `(i, j)` to `(i, right_limit - 1)` with the color at `(i, j)`.
      - Update `right_limit` to `j + 1` to limit further extensions in the same column. 

**Program Version 3**

```python
def extend_right_limited(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
    i, j = ulcorner(obj)
    right_limit = width(I)
    for k in range(i + height(obj), height(I)):
      if index(I, (k, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        right_limit = min(right_limit, j + 1)
    O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, l) for l in range(j, right_limit) for i in range(i, i + height(obj))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** `O` is initialized with the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** Iterate through each non-background object in `I`.
3. **Find Upper-Left Corner and Right Limit:** For each object, determine its upper-left corner `(i, j)` and initialize the `right_limit`.
4. **Determine Extension Limit:**  Find the row `k` of the nearest non-background cell below the object in the same column. Update `right_limit` accordingly.
5. **Fill:** Fill a rectangular region in `O` starting from `(i, j)` extending to `(right_limit - 1, j + height(obj) - 1)` with the object's color.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def extend_right_limited(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    extension_color = mostcolor(I)
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and extension_color == mostcolor(I):
        extension_color = index(I, (i, j))
      elif extension_color != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, extension_color, {(i, j)})
    extension_color = mostcolor(I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** `O` is set to the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through Columns:** Iterate through each column `j` of the grid.
3. **Track Extension Color:** Initialize `extension_color` to the background color for each column.
4. **Iterate through Rows:** For each row `i` in the current column:
   - **Start Extension:** If a non-background cell is encountered and `extension_color` is still the background color, update `extension_color` to the cell's color.
   - **Continue Extension:**  If `extension_color` is not the background color (meaning an extension is active), fill the current cell `(i, j)` in `O` with `extension_color`.
   - **Reset Extension:**  After each column, reset `extension_color` to the background color.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def extend_right_limited(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    current_color = mostcolor(I)
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        if current_color == mostcolor(I):
          current_color = index(I, (i, j))
        else:
          O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
      else:
        current_color = mostcolor(I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Initialize the output grid `O` with the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through Rows:** Iterate through each row `i` of the input grid.
3. **Track Current Color:** For each row, initialize a `current_color` variable to the background color. 
4. **Iterate through Columns:**  Iterate through each column `j` in the current row:
   - **New Non-Background Color:** If a non-background cell is encountered and `current_color` is still the background, update `current_color` to the cell's color.
   - **Extend Color:** If `current_color` is not the background color (meaning an extension is ongoing), fill the current cell `(i, j)` in the output grid `O` with the `current_color`.
   - **Reset Current Color:** If the current cell is a background cell, reset `current_color` to the background color.
