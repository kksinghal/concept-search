## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be identifying objects (groups of connected same-value digits) in the input grid and then extending them either horizontally or vertically until they hit another object or the grid boundary. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
* The single '8' object at the top row gets extended horizontally to the right.
* The single '8' object at the rightmost column gets extended vertically downwards. 
* The single '8' object at the bottom row gets extended horizontally to the left.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
* The single '8' object at the rightmost column of the second row gets extended horizontally to the left.
* The single '8' object at the 7th row, 6th column gets extended horizontally to the right. 
* The vertical line of '8's gets extended vertically upwards and downwards.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
* The horizontal line of '8's in the second row gets extended to the left and right.
* The vertical line of '8's gets extended vertically upwards.
* The single '8' object at the bottom left corner gets extended horizontally to the right. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for direction in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
      shifted_obj = shift(obj, direction)
      while len(intersection(toindices(shifted_obj), asindices(O))) == 0 and len(toindices(shifted_obj)) == len(obj):
        O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), toindices(shifted_obj)))
        shifted_obj = shift(shifted_obj, direction)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  `objs = objects(I, True, False, False)` finds all connected objects in the input grid.
2. **Iterate and extend:** For each object, it tries extending in all four directions ((0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)) one step at a time.
3. **Check for collision:** Before painting the extended object, it checks if the new location overlaps with existing objects or goes outside the grid boundaries (`len(intersection(toindices(shifted_obj), asindices(O))) == 0 and len(toindices(shifted_obj)) == len(obj)`).
4. **Paint:** If no collision, it paints the extended object onto the grid (`O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), toindices(shifted_obj)))`).
5. **Repeat:**  The process continues until the extended object hits another object or the grid boundary.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        for direction in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
          ni, nj = i + direction[0], j + direction[1]
          while 0 <= ni < height(I) and 0 <= nj < width(I) and I[ni][nj] == mostcolor(I):
            O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (ni, nj))})
            ni, nj = ni + direction[0], nj + direction[1]
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** This version iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Identify non-background cells:** It checks if the cell value is different from the background color (`if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I)`).
3. **Extend in four directions:** For each non-background cell, it tries extending in all four directions.
4. **Check for collision:** It extends until it hits a non-background cell or grid boundary (`0 <= ni < height(I) and 0 <= nj < width(I) and I[ni][nj] == mostcolor(I)`).
5. **Paint:** If no collision, it paints the extended cell onto the grid (`O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (ni, nj))})` ).


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    ul = ulcorner(obj)
    lr = lrcorner(obj)
    for i in range(ul[0], lr[0] + 1):
      for j in range(ul[1], lr[1] + 1):
        if I[i][j] == mostcolor(I):
          O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects and bounding box:** This version identifies each object and its bounding box (defined by its upper-left and lower-right corners).
2. **Iterate within bounding box:** It then iterates through each cell within the object's bounding box.
3. **Fill with object color:** If a cell within the bounding box belongs to the background, it gets filled with the object's color (`if I[i][j] == mostcolor(I): O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, j))})`).

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    for (i, j) in delta(obj):
      if 0 <= i < height(I) and 0 <= j < width(I) and I[i][j] == mostcolor(I):
        O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects and their deltas:** This version identifies objects and their "deltas," which are the cells within the object's bounding box but not part of the object itself.
2. **Iterate through delta:** It then iterates through each delta cell.
3. **Fill with object color:** If the delta cell belongs to the background, it gets filled with the object's color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    bbox = backdrop(obj)
    for (i, j) in bbox:
      if 0 <= i < height(I) and 0 <= j < width(I):
        if (i, j) in toindices(obj):
          O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, j))})
        else:
          O = paint(O, {(mostcolor(I), (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create blank canvas:**  This version creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate through objects and bounding boxes:**  It iterates through each object and determines its bounding box.
3. **Fill bounding box:**  For each cell within the bounding box:
     - If the cell belongs to the object, it's painted with the object's color.
     - If the cell doesn't belong to the object, it's painted with the background color.

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL. Each version utilizes a unique combination of functions and logic, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for solving spatial reasoning tasks.
