## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to connect all instances of the same non-zero color within each column, extending from the uppermost occurrence to the lowermost. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

- The two '8's in the fourth column are connected, forming a vertical line.
- The three '8's in the seventh column are connected, forming a vertical line.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

- The four '8's in the second column are connected, forming a vertical line.
- The five '8's in the eighth and ninth columns are connected, forming a single horizontal line.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

- The five '8's in the second and third columns are connected, forming a single horizontal line.
- The five '8's in the sixth and seventh columns are connected, forming a single horizontal line.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions in the given DSL that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) # Initialize output grid
  for j in range(width(I)):  # For each column
    for color in palette(I) - {ZERO}:
      indices = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(height(I)) if I[i][j] == color)
      if indices:
        O = paint(O, recolor(color, connect((uppermost(indices), j), (lowermost(indices), j))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** An empty canvas `O` is created with the same dimensions as the input grid `I`.
2. **Column Iteration:** The code iterates through each column `j` of the input grid.
3. **Color Identification:**  For each non-zero color present in the input grid, it identifies the indices of cells in the current column `j` that contain that color.
4. **Connection and Painting:** If the color exists in the column, it connects the uppermost and lowermost occurrences of that color with a line and paints it onto the output canvas `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for v in palette(I) - {ZERO}:
    for j in range(width(I)):
      column_indices = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(height(I)) if I[i][j] == v)
      if column_indices:
        O = paint(O, recolor(v, connect((uppermost(column_indices), j), (lowermost(column_indices), j))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** The output grid `O` is initialized as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Color Iteration:** The code iterates through each non-zero color `v` present in the input grid.
3. **Column Processing:** For each color and column, it identifies the indices of cells containing that color within the column.
4. **Line Drawing and Painting:** If the color is found in the column, it connects its uppermost and lowermost occurrences with a line and paints it on the output grid `O`, overwriting any existing values.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    column = (I[i][j] for i in range(height(I)))
    for v in set(column) - {ZERO}:
      first_i = next((i for i, val in enumerate(column) if val == v), None)
      last_i = next((height(I) - i - 1 for i, val in enumerate(column[::-1]) if val == v), None)
      if first_i is not None and last_i is not None:
        line = connect((first_i, j), (last_i, j))
        O = paint(O, recolor(v, line))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** An empty canvas `O` is created with the input grid's dimensions.
2. **Column Iteration:** The program iterates through each column of the input grid.
3. **Color Processing:** It identifies each distinct non-zero color in the current column.
4. **Finding First and Last Occurrence:** For each color, it determines the row indices of its first and last occurrences within the column.
5. **Line Creation and Painting:** If both first and last occurrences are found, it connects them with a line and paints it onto the output canvas using the identified color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    column_colors = set(I[i][j] for i in range(height(I))) - {ZERO}
    for c in column_colors:
      c_indices = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(height(I)) if I[i][j] == c)
      top_i = min(i for i, j in c_indices)
      bottom_i = max(i for i, j in c_indices)
      O = paint(O, recolor(c, connect((top_i, j), (bottom_i, j))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  The output grid `O` starts as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Column-wise Processing:** It iterates through each column of the grid.
3. **Color Identification:** It identifies all unique non-zero colors present within the current column.
4. **Connecting Occurrences:** For each unique color in the column, it determines the topmost and bottommost occurrences and connects them with a line of that color, overwriting any existing values on the output grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for color in palette(I) - {ZERO}:
    for j in range(width(I)):
      column = [I[i][j] for i in range(height(I))]
      if color in column:
        start_i = column.index(color)
        end_i = len(column) - 1 - column[::-1].index(color)
        O = paint(O, recolor(color, connect((start_i, j), (end_i, j))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates a blank canvas `O` of the same size as input `I`.
2. **Color Iteration:** Iterates through each distinct non-zero color in the input.
3. **Column Scanning:** For each color and column, it checks if the color exists within the column.
4. **Locating and Connecting:** If the color is found, it identifies the row indices of its first and last occurrences within the column and connects them with a line of that color on the output canvas.


These five versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic. Each version effectively connects occurrences of the same color within each column, extending the connection from the topmost to the bottommost occurrence.
