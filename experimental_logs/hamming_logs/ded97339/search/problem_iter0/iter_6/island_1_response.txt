## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (clusters of the same digit different from the background digit) and extending them horizontally or vertically until they hit another object or the grid boundary. The direction of extension depends on the initial object's orientation:

* **Horizontal Extension:** If the object is wider than it is tall, it extends horizontally to the left and right.
* **Vertical Extension:** If the object is taller than it is wide, it extends vertically upwards and downwards.

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The '8' objects are extended horizontally.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** The '8' objects are extended vertically.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The '8' objects are extended both horizontally and vertically based on their initial orientation.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_4be741c5(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if width(obj) > height(obj):
      O = fill(O, color(obj), backdrop(obj))
    else:
      O = fill(O, color(obj), backdrop(dmirror(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies distinct '8' objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** The code iterates through each object.
   - **Horizontal Extension:** If `width(obj) > height(obj)`, the object is wider; hence, the `backdrop` function creates a horizontally extended patch, and `fill` colors it with the object's color.
   - **Vertical Extension:** Otherwise, the object is taller; hence `dmirror` is applied first to make it wider. Then `backdrop` and `fill` are used similarly to extend and color the object vertically.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_4be741c5(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I,(i,j)) != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, index(I, (i,j)), backdrop(objects(crop(I, (0, 0), (height(I), j+1)), True, False, True)[0]))
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Rows and Cells:** The code iterates through each cell in each row.
2. **Identify Object:**  When a non-background cell is found, `objects` is used on a cropped section of the grid (from the start to the current column) to find the object containing that cell.
3. **Horizontal Extension:** `backdrop` is applied to the object to get the indices of its bounding box, effectively extending it horizontally. `fill` colors this area. 
4. **Break and Move to Next Row:** After extending the first object encountered in a row, the loop breaks and moves to the next row.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_4be741c5(I):
  O = dmirror(I)
  for i in range(height(O)):
    for j in range(width(O)):
      if index(O,(i,j)) != mostcolor(O):
        O = fill(O, index(O, (i,j)), backdrop(objects(crop(O, (0, 0), (height(O), j+1)), True, False, True)[0]))
        break
  return dmirror(O)
```

**Explanation:**

This version is identical to version 2, but it operates on a diagonally mirrored version of the input grid. This cleverly exploits the existing logic for horizontal extension to achieve vertical extension.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_4be741c5(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    if width(obj) > height(obj):
      O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), backdrop(obj)))
    else:
      O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), backdrop(dmirror(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 1 but utilizes `paint` and `recolor` instead of `fill`. 

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects` identifies the '8' objects.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** The code iterates through each object.
   - **Horizontal/Vertical Extension:**  `backdrop` is used similarly to Version 1 to get the extended indices. 
   - **Recolor and Paint:** `recolor` creates a new object with the desired color and extended shape, and `paint` applies it to the output grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_4be741c5(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    orientation = position(obj, shift(obj, (1,0)))
    if orientation == (0,0): 
      orientation = (1, 0)
    O = fill(O, color(obj), backdrop(shift(obj, multiply(orientation, (height(I), width(I))))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects` identifies the '8' objects.
2. **Determine Orientation:**  `position` compares the object's position with a slightly shifted version of itself to determine if it's oriented more horizontally or vertically. If no clear orientation is found (single cell object), a default vertical orientation is assigned.
3. **Extend and Fill:** The `orientation` tuple is multiplied with the grid dimensions to create a large offset in the dominant direction. `shift` moves the object by this offset, ensuring it extends to the grid boundary. Finally, `backdrop` and `fill` are used to fill the extended area. 

These five versions provide diverse approaches to solving the given transformation problem using the DSL. Each version showcases different function combinations and logic, achieving the same output with unique code structures.
