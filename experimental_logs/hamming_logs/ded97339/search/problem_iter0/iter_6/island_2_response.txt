## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation connects non-zero digits of the same value horizontally. However, the connection only occurs if the digit lies on the same row as the lowermost occurrence of that digit.

**Input 0:** 

* The lowermost '8' in the 4th column is at (9,3). So, all '8's in the 4th column get connected.
* The lowermost '8' in the 7th column is at (9,6). So, all '8's in the 7th column get connected. 
* The lowermost '8' in the 8th column is at (7,8). So, only the '8' at (7,8) remains unconnected.

**Input 1:**

* Similar logic applies, connecting '8's in the 8th and 9th columns. 

**Input 2:**

* Similar logic applies, connecting '8's in the 2nd, 6th, and 9th columns.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for v in palette(I) - {ZERO}:  # For each non-zero color
    for j in range(width(I)):  # For each column
      column = (I[i][j] for i in range(height(I)))  # Get column values
      if v in column:  # If the color is present in the column
        max_i = max((i for i, val in enumerate(column) if val == v))  # Find the row of the lowermost occurrence
        connected_line = connect((max_i, j), (uppermost(ofcolor(I, v)), j))  # Connect from the lowermost to the uppermost occurrence
        O = paint(O, recolor(v, connected_line))  # Paint the connection
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through colors:**  The code first iterates through all non-zero colors in the grid.
2. **Iterate through columns:** For each color, it iterates through each column.
3. **Find lowermost occurrence:** If the color is present in the column, it finds the row index (`max_i`) of the lowermost occurrence of that color in the column.
4. **Connect and paint:** It then creates a connected line from the lowermost occurrence to the uppermost occurrence of the color in that column and paints it on the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):  # For each object
    v = color(obj)  # Get object color
    j = leftmost(obj)  # Get object's column
    max_i = lowermost(obj)  # Get the row of the lowermost occurrence
    connected_line = connect((max_i, j), (uppermost(ofcolor(I, v)), j))  # Connect from the lowermost to the uppermost occurrence
    O = paint(O, recolor(v, connected_line))  # Paint the connection
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** This version iterates directly through the objects found in the grid.
2. **Extract information:** For each object, it extracts the color, column index, and row index of the lowermost cell.
3. **Connect and paint:**  Similar to Version 1, it connects the lowermost occurrence to the uppermost occurrence and paints it on the output grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))  # Initialize output canvas
  for j in range(width(I)):  # For each column
    column = (I[i][j] for i in range(height(I)))  # Get column values
    for v in palette(column) - {ZERO}:  # For each non-zero color in the column
      indices = frozenset((i, j) for i, val in enumerate(column) if val == v)  # Get indices of the color
      max_i = lowermost(indices)  # Find the row of the lowermost occurrence
      O = paint(O, recolor(v, connect((max_i, j), (uppermost(indices), j))))  # Connect and paint 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize canvas:** This version first initializes an empty canvas for the output.
2. **Iterate and connect:**  It iterates through columns and then through each non-zero color within the column. It identifies the indices of the color, finds the lowermost occurrence, and directly connects it to the uppermost occurrence on the output canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  lines = set()
  for j in range(width(I)):  # For each column
    column = tuple(I[i][j] for i in range(height(I)))
    for v in palette(column) - {ZERO}:
      indices = frozenset((i, j) for i, val in enumerate(column) if val == v)
      if len(indices) > 1:  # Connect only if there are at least two occurrences
        lines.add(connect(ulcorner(indices), lrcorner(indices)))  # Store the connection
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda indices: recolor(I[first(indices)[0]][first(indices)[1]], indices), lines)))  # Paint all connections
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Store connections:** This version first identifies and stores all the necessary connections in a set called `lines`.
2. **Paint connections:** Finally, it paints all the stored connections on the input grid to produce the output.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      v = I[i][j]
      if v != ZERO:  # For each non-zero cell
        bottom_i = lowermost(ofcolor(I, v))  # Find the row of the lowermost occurrence of that color
        if i == bottom_i:  # If the cell is the lowermost occurrence, skip
          continue
        connected_line = connect((i, j), (bottom_i, j))  # Connect to the lowermost occurrence
        O = paint(O, recolor(v, connected_line))  # Paint the connection
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** This version iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check for lowermost:** For each non-zero cell, it checks if it's the lowermost occurrence of its color in its column.
3. **Connect if not lowermost:** If it's not the lowermost, it connects it to the lowermost occurrence and paints the connection.

These five programs offer distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation while utilizing different DSL function combinations. Each program highlights a different aspect of the DSL and showcases its versatility in solving spatial reasoning tasks.
