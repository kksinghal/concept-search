## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation connects all occurrences of the same digit within each column, effectively filling the space between the uppermost and lowermost occurrences of that digit in each column.

**Input 0:**

- Each isolated '8' is extended vertically to form a continuous line of '8's within its column.

**Input 1:**

- Similar to Input 0, vertical lines of '8's are created. Note the connection across rows in the bottom right corner due to the adjacent '8's in the input.

**Input 2:**

-  Again, vertical lines of '8's are formed, showcasing the transformation's consistent behavior across different input configurations.

## Program Version 1:

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I                  # Initialize output as a copy of input
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):  # Iterate over each connected object
    for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1): # Iterate over object's columns
      O = fill(O, color(obj), connect((uppermost(obj), j), (lowermost(obj), j)))  # Fill vertically
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over Objects:** The code first identifies all connected objects (groups of the same digit) in the input grid.
2. **Iterate over Columns:** For each object, the program then iterates through its columns, from the leftmost to the rightmost.
3. **Vertical Connection:** Within each column, the `connect` function creates a vertical line of indices spanning from the uppermost to the lowermost occurrence of the object. The `fill` function then paints this line with the object's color, effectively connecting the digits.

## Program Version 2:

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  w = width(I)
  for j in range(w):   # Iterate over columns
    column = {I[i][j] for i in range(height(I))}  # Get unique digits in the column
    for d in column:
      if d != mostcommon(I):  # Ignore background digit
        O = fill(O, d, connect((uppermost(ofcolor(I, d)), j), (lowermost(ofcolor(I, d)), j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over Columns:** This version iterates directly over the columns of the input grid.
2. **Identify Unique Digits:** For each column, it identifies the unique digit values present.
3. **Connect and Fill:** For each unique digit (excluding the background), the code finds the uppermost and lowermost occurrences of that digit within the column and connects them using the `connect` and `fill` functions.

## Program Version 3:

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  # Initialize output with background
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):      # Iterate over objects
    if color(obj) != mostcommon(I):     # Ignore background object
      left, right = leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj)
      for j in range(left, right + 1):
        O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), connect((uppermost(obj), j), (lowermost(obj), j))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Background Canvas:** This version initializes the output grid with a canvas filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate over Objects:** Similar to previous versions, it iterates over the connected objects.
3. **Connect, Recolor, and Paint:** For each non-background object, it connects its occurrences within each column, recolors the resulting line with the object's color, and paints it onto the background canvas.

## Program Version 4:

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):       # Iterate over columns
    indices = [(i, j) for i in range(height(I)) if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I)]  # Find non-background indices
    if indices:
      top = min(indices, key=lambda x: x[0])[0]  # Find uppermost row
      bottom = max(indices, key=lambda x: x[0])[0] # Find lowermost row
      O = fill(O, I[top][j], connect((top, j), (bottom, j)))  # Connect and fill
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over Columns:** The code iterates over each column of the input grid.
2. **Identify Non-Background Indices:** Within each column, it identifies the indices containing non-background digits.
3. **Find Uppermost and Lowermost:** It then determines the uppermost and lowermost row indices within those non-background positions.
4. **Connect and Fill:** Using these indices, it connects them vertically and fills the line with the color of the uppermost non-background digit in that column.

## Program Version 5:

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in partition(I):     # Iterate over objects based on color
    if color(obj) != mostcommon(I):  # Ignore background object
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition by Color:** This version uses the `partition` function to group grid cells based on their color, effectively creating objects for each digit.
2. **Iterate over Objects:** It iterates through these color-based objects.
3. **Fill Vertical Lines:** For each non-background object, it directly fills the vertical lines within the object's bounding box, achieving the desired connection.
