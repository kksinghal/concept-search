## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation connects all non-zero digits of the same value within each column, effectively drawing a vertical line through them.

**Example:**

Input:

```
0 0 8 0
0 8 0 0
0 0 8 0 
```

Output:

```
0 8 8 0
0 8 0 0
0 8 8 0
```

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = palette(I) - {ZERO}  # Find all non-zero colors
  x2 = apply(lambda c: ofcolor(I, c), x1) # Get indices of each color
  x3 = apply(lambda indices: frozenset((i, j) for i, j in indices if any(v != ZERO for v in get_column(I, j))), x2)  # Filter indices to those within columns with the same color
  x4 = apply(lambda indices: merge(apply(lambda i: connect((i, min(j for _, j in indices)), (i, max(j for _, j in indices))), range(height(I)))), x3) # Connect the minimum and maximum indices for each color in each row
  O = paint(I, merge(apply(lambda indices: recolor(I[first(indices)[0]][first(indices)[1]], indices), x4)))  # Recolor the connected lines with the original color
  return O

def get_column(grid, j):
  return tuple(row[j] for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **x1:** Identifies all unique non-zero colors in the grid.
2. **x2:** Finds all indices of each non-zero color.
3. **x3:** Filters the indices, keeping only those within columns where the same color exists in another row.
4. **x4:** Connects the minimum and maximum indices for each color in each row, effectively drawing a vertical line.
5. **O:** Paints the connected lines onto the original grid with their respective colors.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)): # Iterate over each column
    column = tuple(row[j] for row in I) # Extract the column
    for c in palette(column) - {ZERO}: # Iterate over non-zero colors in the column
      indices = frozenset((i, j) for i, v in enumerate(column) if v == c) # Get indices of the color in the column
      if len(indices) > 1: # If the color appears more than once
        O = paint(O, recolor(c, connect(ulcorner(indices), lrcorner(indices)))) # Connect the top and bottom appearances of the color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over columns:** The program goes through each column of the grid.
2. **Extract and analyze column:** For each column, it extracts the color values and iterates over unique non-zero colors.
3. **Connect occurrences:** If a color appears multiple times in a column, it connects the topmost and bottommost occurrences with a line of that color.
4. **Paint lines:** The connected lines are painted onto the grid, effectively filling in the vertical connections.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = objects(I, False, False, True) # Extract non-background objects
    x2 = apply(lambda obj: (uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj), leftmost(obj)), x1) # Get the top, bottom and leftmost indices for each object
    x3 = apply(lambda obj: connect((obj[0], obj[2]), (obj[1], obj[2])), x2) # Connect the top and bottom points of each object at the leftmost column
    O = paint(I, merge(apply(lambda indices: recolor(I[first(indices)[0]][first(indices)[1]], indices), x3))) # Paint the connected lines onto the input grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identifies distinct non-background objects in the grid.
2. **Find Key Points:**  For each object, it determines the uppermost, lowermost, and leftmost indices.
3. **Connect Vertically:** It connects the uppermost and lowermost points at the leftmost column of the object, creating a vertical line.
4. **Paint Lines:**  The connected lines are painted onto the original grid, filling in the object vertically.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = partition(I) - {frozenset({(ZERO, (i, j)) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(width(I)) if I[i][j] == ZERO})} # Partition by color, excluding the background
  x2 = apply(lambda obj: connect(ulcorner(obj), lrcorner(obj)), x1) # Connect top-left and bottom-right corners of each object
  x3 = apply(lambda indices: frozenset((i, j) for i, j in indices if I[i][j] != ZERO), x2) # Remove connections passing through background cells
  O = paint(I, merge(apply(lambda indices: recolor(I[first(indices)[0]][first(indices)[1]], indices), x3))) # Paint the lines on the original grid
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition by Color:** Divides the grid into objects based on color, excluding the background color.
2. **Connect Corners:** For each object, it connects the top-left and bottom-right corners, potentially creating diagonal lines.
3. **Filter Connections:**  Removes any connections that pass through background cells, ensuring only vertical lines within the objects remain.
4. **Paint Lines:** The filtered lines are painted onto the original grid, achieving the desired effect.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) # Create an empty canvas
  for j in range(width(I)): # Iterate over columns
    for i in range(height(I)): # Iterate over rows
      if I[i][j] != ZERO: # If the cell is not background
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))}) # Paint the cell onto the canvas
        if i > 0 and O[i-1][j] == I[i][j]: # If the cell above has the same color
          O = paint(O, recolor(I[i][j], connect((i, j), (i-1, j)))) # Connect them vertically
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** Generates an empty grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate and Paint:** It iterates through each cell of the input grid, painting non-background cells onto the canvas.
3. **Connect Vertically:** If a painted cell has an adjacent cell above it with the same color, it connects them vertically on the canvas.
4. **Return Canvas:** Finally, the program returns the canvas with the connected lines, representing the transformed grid.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version utilizes a unique combination of functions, showcasing various ways to manipulate and analyze the grid data.
