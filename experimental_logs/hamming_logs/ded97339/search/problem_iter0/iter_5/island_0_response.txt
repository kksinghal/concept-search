## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation logic applied to each input grid involves identifying individual objects (groups of connected non-background digits) and then extending those objects horizontally to connect their leftmost and rightmost points within their respective rows. 

Let's illustrate with an example:

**Input_0:**

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 
```

**Output_0:**

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 
```

In this example, the program identifies three distinct '8' objects. For each object, it finds the leftmost and rightmost '8' within its row and then fills all cells between them with '8'.  This process is repeated for each row in the input grid.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for obj in objects(crop(I, (i, 0), (1, len(I[0]))), T, F, F):
      left = leftmost(toindices(obj))
      right = rightmost(toindices(obj))
      O = fill(O, color(obj), connect((i, left), (i, right)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  The output grid `O` is initialized as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterating over Rows and Objects:**  The program iterates over each row (`i`) of the grid. For each row, it identifies individual objects using `objects(crop(I, (i, 0), (1, len(I[0]))), T, F, F)`. This function identifies connected components within a row.
3. **Finding Leftmost and Rightmost Points:** For each object within the row, the `leftmost(toindices(obj))` and `rightmost(toindices(obj))` functions are used to determine the column indices of the leftmost and rightmost points of the object.
4. **Filling Horizontally:** The `connect((i, left), (i, right))` function generates a set of indices representing a horizontal line connecting the leftmost and rightmost points. The `fill` function then fills these indices with the object's color (`color(obj)`) in the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        left = min(k for k in range(len(I[0])) if I[i][k] == I[i][j])
        right = max(k for k in range(len(I[0])) if I[i][k] == I[i][j])
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], connect((i, left), (i, right)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  A blank canvas (`O`) is created with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Iterating over Cells:** The program iterates over each cell in the input grid `I`.
3. **Finding Object Boundaries:** If a cell is not the background color, it finds the leftmost (`left`) and rightmost (`right`) occurrences of that color within the same row. 
4. **Filling Horizontally:** Similar to Version 1, it connects the leftmost and rightmost points and fills the line with the corresponding color.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for row in range(height(I)):
    for obj in objects(crop(I, (row, 0), (1, width(I))), T, F, F):
      O = fill(O, color(obj), product({row}, interval(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1, 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses similar logic to version 1 but utilizes different functions for conciseness:

- `height(I)` and `width(I)` are used instead of `len(I)` and `len(I[0])`.
- `product({row}, interval(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1, 1))` elegantly creates the indices for the horizontal line.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    row_obj = objects(crop(I, (i, 0), (1, len(I[0]))), T, F, F)
    if row_obj:
      obj = row_obj.pop()
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on optimizing the object detection:

- It only iterates over objects if they exist in a row (`if row_obj`).
- It directly accesses the first (and likely only) object in `row_obj` using `.pop()`, simplifying the logic. 

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in mapply(lambda x: toobject(x, I), objects(I, T, F, F)):
    top, left = ulcorner(obj)
    bottom, right = lrcorner(obj)
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
      O = fill(O, color(obj), connect((i, left), (i, right)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version takes a different approach by first identifying all objects in the grid and then processing them:

1. **Identify all objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` finds all connected components (objects) in the grid.
2. **Convert to objects:** `mapply(lambda x: toobject(x, I), ...)` converts the indices from `objects` into actual object representations.
3. **Iterate over objects:** For each object, it finds its bounding box and then fills each row within the bounding box horizontally with the object's color.

These are just a few examples, and many other variations are possible using the provided DSL.  The key is to understand the underlying transformation logic and then explore different ways to implement that logic using the available functions.
