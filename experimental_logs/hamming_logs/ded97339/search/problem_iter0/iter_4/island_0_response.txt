## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

**For each object (connected components of the same digit):**

1. **Identify the object's horizontal boundaries:** Determine the leftmost and rightmost columns occupied by the object.
2. **Fill horizontally:** Fill all the cells within the object's bounding box along the rows between these boundaries with the object's color (digit value).

This effectively "stretches" each object horizontally to cover the entire span between its leftmost and rightmost points.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Extract objects from the input grid
  O = I                      # Initialize output as a copy of input
  for obj in objs:
    left = leftmost(obj)    # Leftmost column index of the object
    right = rightmost(obj)   # Rightmost column index of the object
    for j in range(left, right + 1): # Iterate over columns within the boundaries
      O = fill(O, color(obj), connect((uppermost(obj), j), (lowermost(obj), j)))  # Fill vertically
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify and separate objects in the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** For each object, determine its horizontal boundaries (leftmost and rightmost columns). Iterate over all columns within these boundaries. For each column, draw a vertical line using the object's color, effectively filling the space between its top and bottom rows.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(len(I[0])): # Iterate over columns
    column_indices = [i for i in range(len(I)) if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I)] # Find non-background indices in the column
    for k in range(1, len(column_indices)): # Iterate through pairs of consecutive indices
      start = column_indices[k-1]
      end = column_indices[k]
      if end == start + 1: # If they are consecutive, connect them
        O = fill(O, I[start][j], connect((start, j), (end, j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over Columns:** Go through each column of the input grid.
2. **Identify Object Segments:** Within each column, find consecutive non-background cells. 
3. **Connect Segments:** For each pair of consecutive non-background cells, draw a vertical line connecting them using their color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):  # Iterate over rows
    for j in range(len(I[0])):  # Iterate over columns
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I): # If cell is not background
        left = leftmost(objects(crop(I, (i, 0), (1, len(I[0]))), T, F, F).pop()) # Find the leftmost point of the object in the row
        right = rightmost(objects(crop(I, (i, 0), (1, len(I[0]))), T, F, F).pop()) # Find the rightmost point of the object in the row
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], connect((i, left), (i, right))) # Fill horizontally
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over Cells:** Go through each cell in the input grid.
2. **Horizontal Fill:** If a cell is not background, identify the leftmost and rightmost points of the object within that row. Then, draw a horizontal line connecting them using the cell's color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create an empty canvas of the same size as input
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F): # Iterate over objects
    O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), backdrop(connect((uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)), (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj)))))) # Paint the bounding box of the object
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** Generate an empty grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Paint Bounding Boxes:** For each object, determine its bounding box coordinates based on its top-left and bottom-right corners. Paint this entire bounding box on the canvas using the object's color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F): # Iterate over objects
    min_row, max_row = uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj)
    min_col, max_col = leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj)
    for i in range(min_row, max_row + 1): # Iterate over rows within object boundaries
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j) for j in range(min_col, max_col + 1)}) # Fill horizontally
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over Objects:**  Extract individual objects from the input grid.
2. **Fill Bounding Box:**  For each object, determine its bounding box by finding its minimum and maximum row and column indices. Then, iterate over each row within the bounding box and fill the entire row with the object's color. 


These five programs represent distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation. Each leverages different combinations of DSL functions and logic flow, highlighting the flexibility of the DSL in solving this spatial reasoning problem.
