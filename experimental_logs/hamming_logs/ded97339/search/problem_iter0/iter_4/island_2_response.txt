## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying all non-zero colored objects on the input grid and drawing a horizontal line of that color connecting the object's leftmost and rightmost points.

**Input_0:**  The '8' colored objects are identified, and a horizontal line of '8's is drawn across their width.

**Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, horizontal lines are drawn for each non-zero colored object, but the objects are positioned differently.

**Input_2:** Again, horizontal lines of the respective colors are drawn across the width of each non-zero colored object.

## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, False, False, True)  # Extract non-zero objects
  x2 = apply(lambda obj: (leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj)), x1)  # Get leftmost and rightmost column indices for each object
  x3 = apply(lambda obj, lr: connect((uppermost(obj), lr[0]), (uppermost(obj), lr[1])), pair(x1, x2))  # Connect leftmost and rightmost points of each object
  x4 = fork(recolor, identity, merge(x3)) # Recolor the connected lines
  x5 = apply(x4, palette(I) - {ZERO}) # Apply recoloring for each non-zero color
  O = paint(I, merge(x5))  # Paint the recolored lines onto the input grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **x1:** Extracts all non-zero colored objects from the input grid.
2. **x2:**  For each object, it determines the column indices of its leftmost and rightmost points.
3. **x3:**  Uses the object and its leftmost-rightmost indices to generate a line connecting these points.
4. **x4:** Prepares for recoloring by merging the lines and creating a function to apply the color.
5. **x5:** Applies the recoloring function to each non-zero color present in the input grid.
6. **O:** Paints the recolored lines onto the input grid, resulting in the desired output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) # Initialize an empty canvas
  for c in palette(I) - {ZERO}: # Iterate through each non-zero color
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True): # Iterate through objects of that color
      if color(obj) == c: # If object matches the current color
        left = leftmost(obj) # Get leftmost index
        right = rightmost(obj) # Get rightmost index
        line = connect((uppermost(obj), left), (uppermost(obj), right)) # Draw a line between them
        O = paint(O, recolor(c, line)) # Paint the line on the canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **O:** An empty canvas is initialized with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. **Iterate through colors:**  The program iterates through each non-zero color present in the input.
3. **Iterate through objects:** For each color, the program extracts objects of that color.
4. **Draw and paint lines:** The leftmost and rightmost points of the object are connected with a line, which is then recolored and painted onto the canvas. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I 
  for j in range(width(I)): # Iterate over columns
    col = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(height(I))) # Get column indices
    col_obj = toobject(col, I) # Get objects in the column
    for c in palette(col_obj) - {ZERO}: # For each non-zero color in the column
      indices = ofcolor(I, c) & col # Get indices of that color in the column
      if indices: # If there are indices of that color
        O = fill(O, c, connect((uppermost(indices), j), (lowermost(indices), j))) # Draw a horizontal line of that color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **O:** Initializes the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. **Iterate through columns:** The program iterates through each column of the grid.
3. **Extract column objects:**  Objects present in the current column are extracted.
4. **Identify and connect:** For each non-zero color in the column, the program identifies its indices and connects the uppermost and lowermost points with a horizontal line of that color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True): # Iterate through non-zero objects
    upper = uppermost(obj) # Get uppermost row index
    O = fill(O, color(obj), connect((upper, leftmost(obj)), (upper, rightmost(obj)))) # Draw a horizontal line at the uppermost row 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **O:**  Initializes the output as a copy of the input.
2. **Iterate through objects:**  The program iterates through each non-zero colored object in the grid.
3. **Draw horizontal lines:**  For each object, the program determines its uppermost row index and draws a horizontal line of the same color, connecting its leftmost and rightmost points at that row. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  lines = set() # Initialize an empty set for lines
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True): # Iterate through non-zero objects
    start = (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)) # Get top-left corner
    end = (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj)) # Get top-right corner
    lines.add(connect(start, end)) # Add connecting line to the set
  O = paint(I, merge(apply(lambda l: recolor(index(I, first(l)), l), lines))) # Recolor and paint lines on the input grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **lines:** Initializes an empty set to store the connecting lines.
2. **Iterate and connect:** The program iterates through non-zero objects and adds a connecting line between their top-left and top-right corners to the 'lines' set.
3. **Recolor and paint:** The lines are then recolored based on the color of their starting point on the input grid and painted onto the input grid, generating the final output.
