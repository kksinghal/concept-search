## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation connects non-background digits horizontally within each row, effectively creating horizontal lines of digits where they were originally scattered single digits.

**Input_0:** Each '8' is extended rightward to connect with any other '8' on the same row.

**Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, '8's are connected horizontally. Notice how the single '8' on row 1 remains unchanged.

**Input_2:**  The '8's are again connected horizontally. Observe how the vertical alignment of '8's in columns 1 and 6 doesn't affect the horizontal connection.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(height(I)):
      row_indices = frozenset({j for v, (k, j) in obj if k == i})
      if len(row_indices) > 0:
        O = fill(O, color(obj), product({i}, interval(minimum(row_indices), maximum(row_indices) + 1, 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` finds all non-background connected components ('8's in this case).
2. **Iterate and Connect:** For each object, it iterates through rows. If the object has cells in a row, it finds the minimum and maximum column indices and fills the entire range between them with the object's color.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    indices = ofcolor(I, 8)
    row_indices = frozenset({j for row, col in indices if row == i})
    if len(row_indices) > 0:
      O = fill(O, 8, product({i}, interval(minimum(row_indices), maximum(row_indices) + 1, 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Rows:** Iterates through rows of the input grid.
2. **Find '8' Indices:**  `ofcolor(I, 8)` gets the indices of all '8's in the grid.
3. **Connect on Row:** For each row, if it contains '8's, it fills the range between the minimum and maximum column indices of those '8's with the color '8'.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = paint(O, frozenset({(color(obj), (i, j)) for i, j in product({uppermost(obj)}, interval(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1, 1))}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Blank Canvas:** `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` generates a blank grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Draw Horizontal Lines:** For each object, it draws a horizontal line of the object's color, spanning the width of the object, at the object's uppermost row.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    row = I[i]
    if 8 in row:
      start = row.index(8)
      end = len(row) - 1 - row[::-1].index(8)
      O = fill(O, 8, product({i}, interval(start, end + 1, 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Rows:** Iterates through rows of the input grid.
2. **Find '8' Positions:** For each row, it finds the first and last occurrences of '8' using `row.index(8)` and `len(row) - 1 - row[::-1].index(8)`.
3. **Fill Between '8's:** If '8's are found, it fills the range between their positions with '8'.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), product({uppermost(obj)}, interval(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1, 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies the non-background objects.
2. **Create and Paint Lines:** For each object:
    -  `product({uppermost(obj)}, interval(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1, 1))` generates the indices for a horizontal line spanning the object's width at its uppermost row.
    -  `recolor(color(obj), ...)` assigns the object's color to these indices, creating a horizontal line object.
    - This object is then painted onto the output grid.
