## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to connect non-background digits to the rightmost edge of the grid, extending their values horizontally. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** 
* All '8' digits are extended rightwards until they reach the right edge.
* Note how the single '8' on the fourth row doesn't extend to the existing '8' on the same row, indicating it only fills with the background color.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
* Similar to Input_0, '8' digits are extended to the right edge. 
* We see this applies even when other '8' digits exist on the same row (see the seventh row).

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
* The pattern holds true here as well, reaffirming our understanding of the transformation.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" in the provided DSL, along with explanations:


**Program Version 1**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialize:** `O = I` starts by creating a copy of the input grid.
2. **Iterate:** It then iterates through each cell of the grid.
3. **Identify Non-Background:** `if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):` checks if the cell is not the background color.
4. **Fill Rightwards:** If it's not background, `O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))})` fills the current row from the current column to the right edge with the digit's value.

**Program Version 2**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, j)) for i, j in toindices(obj) | {(i, k) for i, j in toindices(obj) for k in range(j, width(I))}})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Background Canvas:** Creates an empty canvas filled with the background color and the same shape as the input.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Iterates through each object (connected component of non-background cells) in the input.
3. **Extend and Paint:** For each object, it calculates the indices to paint, including the object's original cells and the cells extending to the right edge. It then paints this extended object onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1, -1, -1):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))})
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialize & Iterate:**  Similar to Version 1, but iterates through each row from right to left.
2. **Find First Non-Background:** The loop looks for the first non-background digit from the right.
3. **Fill and Break:** Upon finding a non-background digit, it fills the row from that digit's position to the right edge and then breaks the inner loop, moving to the next row. This avoids unnecessary iterations.

**Program Version 4**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    rightmost_j = max(j for _, (i, j) in obj)
    extension = {(i, k) for _, (i, j) in obj for k in range(rightmost_j + 1, width(I))}
    O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), extension))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialize & Iterate Objects:** Similar to previous versions, it initializes with the input and iterates over non-background objects.
2. **Find Rightmost Point:** For each object, it determines the rightmost column occupied by the object.
3. **Calculate Extension:** It calculates the indices needing filling by extending from the rightmost point to the grid's edge.
4. **Paint Extension:** Finally, it paints the calculated extension onto the output grid using the object's color.

**Program Version 5**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for row in range(height(I)):
    for col in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (row, col)) != mostcolor(I):
        O = paint(O, {(index(I, (row, col)), (row, c)) for c in range(col, width(I))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Direct Iteration and Painting:** This version iterates directly through the grid, and upon encountering a non-background digit, it paints the output grid from the digit's column to the right edge with the digit's color. 

These five versions offer different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL. Each version utilizes a different set of DSL functions and logic, demonstrating diverse solutions to the problem.
