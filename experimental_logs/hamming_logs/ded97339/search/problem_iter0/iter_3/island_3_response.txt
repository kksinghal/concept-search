## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place in all three input-output pairs can be described as follows:

**For each distinct object (defined by a unique digit) in the input grid, connect all instances of that object's digit using horizontal and vertical lines filled with that object's digit.**

Let's break down how this applies to each example:

* **Input_0:** There are two '8' digits. The transformation connects them horizontally. 
* **Input_1:**  There are four '8' digits. They are connected vertically to form a single vertical line.
* **Input_2:** There are five '8' digits. They are connected to form a horizontal line and a vertical line, effectively connecting all instances of the digit '8'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    indices = toindices(obj)
    horizontal_line = frozenset((i, j) for i, _ in indices for j in range(leftmost(indices), rightmost(indices) + 1))
    vertical_line = frozenset((i, j) for _, j in indices for i in range(uppermost(indices), lowermost(indices) + 1))
    O = underfill(O, color(obj), horizontal_line)
    O = underfill(O, color(obj), vertical_line)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  It identifies the distinct objects in the input grid using the `objects` function.
2. **Iterate and Connect:** For each object, it calculates the indices that would form a horizontal and a vertical line spanning the object's extent. It then fills these lines with the object's color using the `underfill` function.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = partition(I)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) != bg:
      O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), box(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition by Color:** The `partition` function is used to group cells with the same color into objects.
2. **Draw Bounding Boxes:** For each non-background object, it directly draws the bounding box of the object, effectively connecting all its instances. 

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(height(obj)):
      start = (uppermost(obj) + i, leftmost(obj))
      end = (uppermost(obj) + i, rightmost(obj))
      O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), connect(start, end)))
    for j in range(width(obj)):
      start = (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj) + j)
      end = (lowermost(obj), leftmost(obj) + j)
      O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), connect(start, end)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** It iterates through the objects in the grid.
2. **Draw Lines:** For each object, it draws horizontal and vertical lines covering the entire span of the object, effectively connecting all instances of its color.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        min_i, min_j = ulcorner(obj)
        max_i, max_j = lrcorner(obj)
        for i in range(min_i, max_i + 1):
            O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), {(i, j) for j in range(min_j, max_j + 1)}))
        for j in range(min_j, max_j + 1):
            O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), {(i, j) for i in range(min_i, max_i + 1)}))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Corners:**  This version identifies the upper-left and lower-right corners of each object.
2. **Fill Between Corners:** It then fills in all cells within the rectangle defined by these corners using horizontal and vertical lines.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    ulx, uly = ulcorner(obj)
    lrx, lry = lrcorner(obj)
    for x in range(ulx, lrx + 1):
        for y in range(uly, lry + 1):
            if index(I, (x, y)) == color(obj):
                O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), connect((x, y), (ulx, y)) | connect((x, y), (x, uly))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Connect to Origin:** This version iterates through each cell of each object and connects it to the upper-left corner of the object's bounding box using horizontal and vertical lines. 


These are just a few examples â€“ many other valid programs could be written using the DSL to achieve this transformation!
