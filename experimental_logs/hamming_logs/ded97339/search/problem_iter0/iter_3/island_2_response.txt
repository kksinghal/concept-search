## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to connect all non-zero digit occurrences within each column, effectively creating vertical lines of the same digit color. 

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**  All occurrences of digit '8' within each column are connected to form vertical lines.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**  Similar to the previous case, '8's are connected vertically. Note how the single '8' on the right edge remains unconnected, highlighting that the transformation only connects within columns.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:** The pattern continues, confirming the transformation logic consistently applies to all inputs.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" utilizing different approaches within the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = palette(I)  
  x2 = remove(ZERO, x1)  
  x3 = lbind(ofcolor, I)  
  x4 = apply(x3, x2)  
  x5 = mapply(lambda indices: connect((uppermost(indices), leftmost(indices)), (lowermost(indices), leftmost(indices))), x4)
  x6 = merge(x5)
  x7 = fork(recolor, identity, x6)
  x8 = apply(x7, x2)
  O = paint(I, merge(x8)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify unique colors (excluding 0):**  `x1` stores the palette, `x2` removes zero.
2. **Get indices for each color:** `x3` creates a partially applied function, `x4` applies it to get indices for each color in `x2`.
3. **Connect top & bottom indices for each color:**  `x5` connects the uppermost and lowermost indices of each color group, effectively creating a line.
4. **Merge connected lines:** `x6` merges all lines into a single set of indices.
5. **Recolor and paint:**  `x7` creates a function to recolor with the original color, `x8` applies this function to each color in `x2`, and `O` paints the lines onto the original grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(len(I[0])):
    color = first(sfilter(set(column(I, j)), lambda v: v != ZERO), default=ZERO) 
    if color != ZERO:
      O = fill(O, color, frozenset((i, j) for i in range(len(I)))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns:** Loops through each column (`j`) of the input grid (`I`).
2. **Find first non-zero color:** `color` stores the first non-zero color found in the current column. 
3. **Fill the column:** If a non-zero color is found, the entire column (`j`) is filled with that `color`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = transpose(I)
  x2 = cfafafaabdbaeaebiedhafebcfigeejc(x1) 
  O = transpose(x2) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transpose the grid:** `x1` stores the transposed grid, effectively turning columns into rows.
2. **Apply horizontal line logic:** `x2` utilizes Program_A (provided earlier) which connects elements in rows. 
3. **Transpose back:** `O` transposes the result back to its original orientation.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    indices = ofcolor(column(I, j), other(palette(column(I, j)), ZERO))
    if indices:
      O = fill(O, other(palette(column(I, j)), ZERO), connect(first(indices), last(indices)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns:** Iterates over each column index `j`.
2. **Identify non-zero color:**  Finds the non-zero color in the column using `other` function.
3. **Get indices of the color:** Retrieves the indices of the non-zero color within the column.
4. **Connect and fill:**  Connects the first and last occurrences of the color and fills the column with that color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, False, False, True)
  x2 = apply(lambda obj: connect((uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)), (lowermost(obj), leftmost(obj))), x1)
  x3 = merge(x2)
  x4 = fork(recolor, identity, x3)
  x5 = apply(x4, palette(I) - {ZERO})
  O = paint(I, merge(x5))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `x1` identifies objects (connected components) on the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Connect top and bottom of each object:** `x2` connects the uppermost and lowermost points of each object, creating a vertical line. 
3. **Merge lines:** `x3` merges all lines into a single set of indices.
4. **Recolor and paint:**  `x4` creates a function to recolor indices with their corresponding color, `x5` applies this function to all non-zero colors, and `O` paints the lines back onto the original grid.
