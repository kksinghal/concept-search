## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

**For each non-background cell in the input grid:**

1. **Identify the horizontal line** passing through that cell.
2. **Fill the line** with the color of the non-background cell **until it reaches another non-background cell or the grid border**.


## Program Version 1:

```python
def solve_b9b7f026(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        connected_cells = connect((i, j), (i, len(I[0]) - 1))
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], connected_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through each cell** of the input grid `I`.
2. **If the cell is not the background color**, construct a horizontal line `connected_cells` from the current cell to the right edge of the grid.
3. **Fill the line** `connected_cells` on the output grid `O` with the color of the current cell using the `fill` function.


## Program Version 2:

```python
def solve_b9b7f026(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
    i, j = first(toindices(obj))
    O = fill(O, I[i][j], connect((i, j), (i, len(I[0]) - 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create an empty output grid** `O` filled with the background color using `canvas` and `shape` functions.
2. **Iterate through each non-background object** in the input grid `I` using `objects` function.
3. For each object, **find the top-left cell** coordinates `(i, j)`.
4. **Construct a horizontal line** from the identified cell to the right edge of the grid using `connect`.
5. **Fill the line** on the output grid `O` with the object's color using `fill`.


## Program Version 3:

```python
def solve_b9b7f026(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    current_color = mostcolor(I)
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        current_color = I[i][j]
      O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize output grid** `O` with the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through each row** of the grid.
3. **Initialize a `current_color` variable** with the background color for each row.
4. **Iterate through each cell** in the row.
5. **If the cell is not the background color**, update the `current_color` to the cell's color.
6. **Fill the current cell** on the output grid `O` with the `current_color`.


## Program Version 4:

```python
def solve_b9b7f026(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  lines = frozenset({connect((i, j), (i, len(I[0]) - 1)) for obj in objs for i, j in toindices(obj)})
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for line in lines:
    i, j = first(line)
    O = fill(O, I[i][j], line)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify all non-background objects** in the input grid using `objects`.
2. **Generate a set of horizontal lines** `lines` corresponding to each non-background cell in the identified objects.
3. **Create an empty output grid** `O` filled with the background color using `canvas` and `shape`.
4. **Iterate through the generated lines** `lines`.
5. For each line, **find the leftmost cell** coordinates `(i, j)`.
6. **Fill the line** on the output grid `O` with the color of the identified cell.


## Program Version 5:

```python
def solve_b9b7f026(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = list(list(r) for r in I)
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        for k in range(j, w):
          if I[i][k] != mostcolor(I):
            O[i][k] = I[i][j]
  return tuple(tuple(r) for r in O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a mutable copy** `O` of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through each cell** in the grid.
3. **If the cell is not the background color**:
    - **Iterate from the current cell to the right edge of the grid.**
    - **For each cell encountered, if it is also not the background color, fill it with the color of the initial cell.**
4. **Convert the modified list of lists `O` back to a tuple of tuples** and return it as the output grid.

These five programs showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation, using various combinations of DSL functions and logic. Each version offers a unique perspective on solving the problem while adhering to the provided DSL constraints.
