## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve extending the color of objects to the right until it hits another object or the edge of the grid. Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
* The single 8-objects are extended to the right until they hit the right edge of the grid.
* The two 8-objects in the same column are extended to the right until they hit each other.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
* All 8-objects are extended to the right until they hit another 8-object or the right edge of the grid. 

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
*  Similar to Input_1, all 8-objects are extended rightward until they meet another 8-object or reach the grid's edge.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I)) if index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** `O = I` - starts with the output grid being the same as the input.
2. **Iterate over cells:** The program uses nested loops to iterate through each cell of the input grid (`I`).
3. **Identify non-background cells:** `if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I)` -  checks if the current cell is not the background color (most common color).
4. **Extend color rightward:**  `O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I)) if index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I)})` - This line does the following:
    * `index(I, (i, j))` - Gets the color of the current non-background cell.
    * `{(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I)) if index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I)}` - Creates a set of indices representing the cells to the right of the current cell until it encounters a non-background color.
    * `fill(O, color, indices)` - Fills the specified indices in the output grid (`O`) with the extracted color.
5. **Return Output:** Returns the transformed grid `O`.


**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
    i, j = ulcorner(obj)
    for k in range(j + 1, width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, k)) != mostcolor(I):
        break
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, l) for l in range(j, k)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** `O = I` - Initializes output as input.
2. **Iterate over Objects:**  `for obj in objects(I, False, False, True)` - Iterates through each non-background object in the input.
3. **Get Object Corner:** `i, j = ulcorner(obj)` -  Gets the upper-left corner coordinates of the current object.
4. **Extend Rightward:** 
   * `for k in range(j + 1, width(I))` - Iterates horizontally from the object's right edge to the grid's right edge.
   * `if index(I, (i, k)) != mostcolor(I): break` -  Stops extending if a non-background color is encountered.
   * `O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, l) for l in range(j, k)})` - Fills the output grid with the object's color from its right edge to the current position `k`.
5. **Return Output:** Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    j = 0
    while j < width(I):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        k = j + 1
        while k < width(I) and index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I):
          k += 1
        O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, l) for l in range(j, k)})
        j = k
      else:
        j += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** `O = I` - The output grid is initialized as a copy of the input grid.
2. **Iterate over Rows:**  The code iterates through each row (indexed by `i`) of the grid.
3. **Find Non-Background Cell:** Within each row, it looks for a cell that doesn't have the background color (`mostcolor(I)`).
4. **Extend Color:**
    * If a non-background cell is found at position `(i, j)`, it tries to extend the color to the right until it hits another non-background cell or the edge of the grid. This is done by finding the index `k` of the next non-background cell in the same row.
    * The `fill` function then fills the output grid (`O`) with the color of the cell at `(i, j)` for all cells from `(i, j)` to `(i, k-1)`. 
5. **Continue Iteration:** The loop continues to the next cell after the extended region (`j = k`), or to the next cell if the current cell was a background cell (`j += 1`).
6. **Return Output:** Finally, the function returns the modified output grid (`O`).

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    j = 0
    while j < width(I):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        O = paint(O, {(index(I, (i, j)), (i, k)) for k in range(j, width(I)) if index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I)})
        j = width(I) # Exit inner loop after painting
      else:
        j += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Creates a canvas `O` of the same size as the input grid `I`, filled with the background color (`mostcolor(I)`).
2. **Iterate over Rows and Cells:** Iterates through each row `i` and then each cell `j` within the row.
3. **Identify Non-background Cells:** If a cell `(i, j)` with a color different from the background is encountered:
    * `O = paint(O, {(index(I, (i, j)), (i, k)) for k in range(j, width(I)) if index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I)})` - This line paints the color of the cell `(i, j)` onto the output grid `O` starting from position `(i, j)` and extending rightward as long as the corresponding cells in the input grid `I` have the background color.
    * `j = width(I)` -  The inner loop (iterating over `j`) is exited to move onto the next row after the painting is done.
4. **Continue Iteration:** If the current cell has the background color, the loop continues to the next cell (`j += 1`).
5. **Return Output:**  The function returns the transformed grid `O`.

**Program Version 5** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    current_color = mostcolor(I)
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(O, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and current_color == mostcolor(I):
        current_color = index(O, (i, j))
      elif current_color != mostcolor(I) and index(O, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
      else:
        current_color = mostcolor(I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Sets `O` to be the same as the input `I`.
2. **Iterate by Row:** Iterates through each row of the input grid.
3. **Track Current Color:** Uses `current_color` to keep track of the color being extended rightward, initialized as the background color.
4. **Extend Color:**
   * If a non-background color is encountered and `current_color` is still the background, update `current_color` to this new color.
   * If `current_color` is a non-background color and the current cell is the background color, fill the current cell in the output `O` with `current_color`.
   * Otherwise, reset `current_color` to the background color.
5. **Return Output:**  The modified `O` is returned.

These are five distinct programs that achieve the desired transformation on the given input grids. Each program uses different logic and combinations of DSL functions.
