## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation connects all non-zero digits of the same value within each column, effectively creating vertical lines. 

**Input 0:**
- The '8' digits in column 1 are connected, forming a vertical line.
- The '8' digits in column 6 are connected, forming a vertical line.

**Input 1:**
- The '8' digits in column 7 are connected, forming a vertical line.
- The '8' digits in column 6 are connected, forming a vertical line.

**Input 2:**
- The '8' digits in column 1 are connected, forming a vertical line.
- The '8' digits in column 5 are connected, forming a vertical line.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = palette(I)
  x2 = remove(ZERO, x1)
  x3 = lbind(ofcolor, I)
  x4 = apply(x3, x2)
  x5 = mapply(lambda indices: connect((uppermost(indices), leftmost(indices)), (lowermost(indices), leftmost(indices))), x4) 
  x6 = merge(x5)
  x7 = fork(recolor, identity, x6)
  x8 = mapply(x7, x2)
  O = paint(I, x8)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify non-zero colors:**  `x1` gets all colors, `x2` removes '0'.
2. **Find indices of each color:** `x3` creates a function to find indices of a given color in the input, `x4` applies this function to each non-zero color.
3. **Connect top and bottom indices:** `x5` connects the uppermost and lowermost indices of each color group within each column.
4. **Merge and recolor connected lines:**  `x6` merges the connected lines, `x7` prepares for recoloring, and `x8` recolors the lines with their original color.
5. **Paint onto the original grid:** `O` paints the recolored lines onto the original grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = transpose(I) # Transpose the grid
  x2 = palette(x1) 
  x3 = remove(ZERO, x2)
  x4 = lbind(ofcolor, x1)
  x5 = apply(x4, x3)
  x6 = mapply(lambda indices: connect((leftmost(indices), uppermost(indices)), (rightmost(indices), uppermost(indices))), x5) # Connect leftmost and rightmost on transposed grid
  x7 = merge(x6)
  x8 = fork(recolor, identity, x7)
  x9 = mapply(x8, x3)
  x10 = paint(x1, x9)
  O = transpose(x10) # Transpose back to the original orientation
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transpose the grid:**  `x1` transposes the grid, making columns into rows.
2. **Identify non-zero colors:**  `x2` gets all colors, `x3` removes '0'.
3. **Find indices of each color (transposed):** `x4` creates a function to find indices of a given color in the transposed grid, `x5` applies this function.
4. **Connect leftmost and rightmost (transposed):** `x6` connects leftmost and rightmost indices in the transposed grid (effectively connecting top and bottom in the original grid).
5. **Merge and recolor connected lines:**  Same as version 1 (x7, x8, x9).
6. **Paint and transpose back:** `x10` paints lines onto the transposed grid, `O` transposes it back to the original orientation.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) # Initialize output grid
  for j in range(width(I)):
    column = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(height(I)))
    column_obj = toobject(column, I)
    non_zero_colors = palette(column_obj) - {ZERO}
    for color in non_zero_colors:
      color_indices = ofcolor(I, color) & column
      line = connect((uppermost(color_indices), j), (lowermost(color_indices), j))
      recolored_line = recolor(color, line)
      O = paint(O, recolored_line)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize output grid:**  `O` is initialized as a blank grid.
2. **Iterate over columns:** The code iterates through each column of the input grid.
3. **Extract column and colors:** For each column, it extracts the column's content and identifies non-zero colors present.
4. **Connect color indices:** For each non-zero color, it finds its indices within the column and connects the uppermost and lowermost indices to create a vertical line.
5. **Paint lines onto the output:** The recolored line is painted onto the output grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    column_indices = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(height(I)))
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != ZERO:
        connected_line = connect((i, j), (lowermost(column_indices), j))
        O = underfill(O, index(I, (i, j)), connected_line) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns and cells:** The code iterates through each column and cell of the input grid.
2. **Connect to bottom:** For each non-zero cell, it directly connects it to the bottom of the column.
3. **Underfill with original color:** `underfill` is used to fill the connected line only where the background color (0) is present, ensuring only the intended connections are made.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, True, False, True)
  x2 = apply(lambda obj: connect((uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)), (lowermost(obj), leftmost(obj))), x1)
  x3 = merge(x2)
  x4 = fork(recolor, identity, x3)
  x5 = mapply(x4, palette(I) - {ZERO})
  O = paint(I, x5)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `x1` identifies objects in the input grid (considering each connected group of the same color as one object).
2. **Connect top and bottom of objects:** `x2` connects the uppermost and lowermost points of each object within their respective columns.
3. **Merge, recolor, and paint:** `x3`, `x4`, and `x5` are similar to previous versions, merging connected lines, preparing for recoloring, recoloring, and finally painting onto the original grid.
