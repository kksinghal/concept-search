## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently connects the non-background color digits in each column. Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 
- The '8' digits in the 4th and 7th columns are extended downwards to connect with the '8' digit in the last row of the same column.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The '8' digits in the 8th column are extended downwards to connect with the '8' digit in the 7th row. 
- The '8' digits in the 7th row are extended rightwards to connect with the last '8' digit.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- The '8' digits in the 2nd column are extended downwards to connect with the '8' digit in the 5th row.
- The '8' digits in the 6th and 9th columns are extended upwards to connect with the '8' digit in the 8th row.
- The '8' digits in the 8th row are extended leftwards to connect with the '8' digit in the 6th column. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, leveraging functions from the DSL:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(len(I[0])): # Iterate over columns
    non_bg_indices = [i for i in range(len(I)) if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I)] # Find non-background indices in the column
    if non_bg_indices:
      start = non_bg_indices[0]
      end = non_bg_indices[-1]
      O = fill(O, I[start][j], connect((start, j), (end, j))) # Connect the first and last non-background indices
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over columns:** The program iterates through each column of the input grid.
2. **Identify Non-Background Indices:** For each column, it identifies the row indices containing digits different from the background color.
3. **Connect Non-Background Digits:** It connects the first and last non-background digits in each column using the `connect` function, effectively filling the space between them.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True) # Get all foreground objects
  for obj in objs:
    upper = uppermost(obj)
    lower = lowermost(obj)
    left = leftmost(obj)
    O = fill(O, color(obj), connect((upper,left), (lower,left))) # Connect topmost and bottommost points of each object vertically
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  It uses `objects` to identify all foreground objects in the grid.
2. **Connect Extremes:** For each object, it finds its uppermost and lowermost points within its column and connects them using `connect` and `fill`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    column = tuple(I[i][j] for i in range(height(I)))
    for i in range(len(column)):
      if column[i] != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, column[i], connect((i,j), (len(column)-1, j))) # Connect each non-background digit to the bottom of the column
        break # Stop after connecting the first non-background digit
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Columns:** Similar to Version 1, it iterates through columns.
2. **Connect to Bottom:** For each non-background digit encountered in a column, it directly connects it to the bottom of the column.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create a blank canvas of the same size and background color
  for j in range(width(I)):
    indices = [i for i in range(height(I)) if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I)] # Get all non-background indices in the column
    if indices:
      O = paint(O, recolor(I[indices[0]][j], connect((indices[0], j), (indices[-1], j)))) # Paint the connected line directly onto the blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Blank Canvas:**  Instead of modifying the input grid, it creates a blank canvas.
2. **Paint Connected Lines:**  It identifies non-background indices for each column and directly paints the connected line onto the canvas.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in fgpartition(I): # Get all objects without background
    j = leftmost(obj) # Get the column of the object
    O = fill(O, color(obj), connect((uppermost(obj),j), (lowermost(obj),j))) # Connect the top and bottom of the object vertically
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Foreground Objects:** It uses `fgpartition` to efficiently get all objects except the background.
2. **Vertical Connection:** For each object, it finds its uppermost and lowermost points and connects them vertically using `connect` and `fill`.


Each of these versions offers a different approach to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
