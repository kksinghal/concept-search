## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves extending objects horizontally to the right, until they encounter another object or the edge of the grid.

* **Input_0:** The single 8-valued object in each column is extended rightwards, creating horizontal lines of 8s.
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the 8-valued objects are extended rightwards to form horizontal lines. The existing connected horizontal line remains unchanged.
* **Input_2:** Again, each vertically separated 8-valued object is extended rightwards into a horizontal line.

## Code Generation:

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 1):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        O = paint(O, {(index(I, (i, j)), (i, k)) for k in range(j, width(I))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through grid:** The program iterates through each cell in the input grid `I`.
2. **Identify non-background cells:** For each cell, it checks if its value is different from the background color (most frequent color).
3. **Extend horizontally:** If the cell is not background, it paints a horizontal line from the cell's column to the right edge of the grid with the cell's color.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 2):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
      O = paint(O, {(v, (i, k)) for k in range(j, width(I))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract univalued objects:** The program identifies individual objects in the input `I`, considering connected cells with the same color.
2. **Iterate through objects and cells:** For each cell in every object, it paints a horizontal line to the right edge of the grid.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 3):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        O = paint(O, {(index(I, (i, j)), (i, k)) for k in range(j, width(I))})
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create blank canvas:**  The program initializes an empty grid `O` filled with the background color and having the same dimensions as the input `I`.
2. **Iterate through columns:** It then iterates through each column of the input grid.
3. **Find first non-background cell:** In each column, it searches for the first cell that doesn't have the background color.
4. **Extend line:** Once found, it draws a horizontal line from that cell's position to the right edge of the grid `O` and moves to the next column.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 4):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I) - 1):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if index(O, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and index(O, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I):
        O = paint(O, {(index(O, (i, j)), (i, j + 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through grid:** This version iterates through the input grid `I` cell by cell.
2. **Check right neighbor:** For each cell, it checks if its right neighbor is the background color.
3. **Extend if non-background:** If the current cell is not background and its right neighbor is, it extends the current cell's color to the right neighbor.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 5):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    current_color = mostcolor(I)
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        current_color = index(I, (i, j))
      O = paint(O, {(current_color, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** This version iterates through the input grid `I` row by row.
2. **Track current color:** It keeps track of the current color being extended, starting with the background color.
3. **Update and paint:**  For each cell, it updates the `current_color` if it encounters a non-background color. Then it paints the cell with the `current_color`.
