## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all the examples aims to connect the digit '8' present in the input grid. Here's a breakdown for each example:

**Example 0:** All the '8's in the input are connected horizontally forming a single horizontally stretched object of '8's in the output.

**Example 1:** Similar to Example 0, all the '8's in the input are connected vertically forming a single vertically stretched object of '8's in the output.

**Example 2:** This example combines the logic of the previous two examples. The '8's are connected both horizontally and vertically such that all the '8's become part of a single object in the output. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the described transformation:


### Program Version 1

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True) 
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        if color(obj) != bg:
            uppermost_row = uppermost(obj)
            for i, j in toindices(obj):
                if i == uppermost_row:
                    O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies contiguous objects of the same color (excluding background).
2. **Iterate and Fill:**  The code iterates through each object. For each object, it identifies the topmost row (`uppermost_row`) and fills all cells in that row with the object's color.


### Program Version 2

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        connected_cells = connect((i, j), (i, len(I[0]) - 1))
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], connected_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:** The code iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Connect and Fill:** If a cell is not the background color, it connects this cell with all cells to its right on the same row (`connect`). Then, it fills these connected cells with the current cell's color.


### Program Version 3

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
        for i in range(len(I)):
            if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
                connected_cells = connect((i, j), (len(I)-1, j))
                O = fill(O, I[i][j], connected_cells)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:** The code iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Connect and Fill:** If a cell is not the background color, it connects this cell with all cells below it in the same column (`connect`). Then, it fills these connected cells with the current cell's color.


### Program Version 4

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    start_cell = ulcorner(obj)
    target_cell = (start_cell[0], len(I[0]) - 1)  # Rightmost cell on the same row
    connected_cells = connect(start_cell, target_cell)
    O = fill(O, color(obj), connected_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` retrieves all non-background objects.
2. **Connect and Fill:** For each object, it gets the top-left corner (`ulcorner`) and connects it with the rightmost cell on the same row. Then it fills the connected cells with the object's color. 


### Program Version 5

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    start_cell = ulcorner(obj)
    target_cell = (len(I) - 1, start_cell[1])  # Bottommost cell in the same column
    connected_cells = connect(start_cell, target_cell)
    O = fill(O, color(obj), connected_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` retrieves all non-background objects.
2. **Connect and Fill:** For each object, it gets the top-left corner (`ulcorner`) and connects it with the bottom-most cell in the same column. Then it fills the connected cells with the object's color.
