## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation connects all non-zero color cells within the same row. If two or more non-zero color cells are present in a row, the transformation fills in the cells between them with the non-zero color, effectively drawing a horizontal line connecting them.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:**  Two '8' cells in the 4th row are connected, as well as two '8' cells in the 10th row. All other non-zero cells are isolated and remain unchanged.
* **Input_1:** Two '8' cells in the 7th row are connected. Note how the connection spans across existing '0' cells. All other non-zero cells are isolated.
* **Input_2:** Two '8' cells in the 2nd row are connected, as well as two '8' cells in the 8th row. All other non-zero cells are isolated.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def connect_horizontally(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    nonzero_indices = [j for j, v in enumerate(row) if v != 0]
    if len(nonzero_indices) > 1:
      start, end = min(nonzero_indices), max(nonzero_indices) + 1
      O = fill(O, row[start], frozenset((i, j) for j in range(start, end)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** The program iterates through each row (index `i`) of the input grid `I`.
2. **Find non-zero indices:** For each row, it identifies the column indices (`j`) where the cell value is not zero.
3. **Connect if multiple non-zero cells:** If more than one non-zero cell exists in the row, it determines the start and end indices of the connection line.
4. **Fill the line:** Using the `fill` function, the program paints the cells between the start and end indices with the non-zero color (taken from the first non-zero cell in the row).
5. **Return modified grid:** Finally, it returns the modified grid `O`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def connect_horizontally(I):
  x1 = palette(I)
  x2 = remove(ZERO, x1)
  x3 = lbind(ofcolor, I)
  x4 = apply(x3, x2)
  x5 = mapply(lambda indices: connect(astuple(uppermost(indices), leftmost(indices)), astuple(uppermost(indices), rightmost(indices))), x4)
  x6 = merge(x5)
  x7 = fork(recolor, identity, x6)
  x8 = mapply(x7, x2)
  O = paint(I, x8)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Non-Zero Colors:** Find all unique colors in the grid (excluding 0).
2. **Find Indices of Each Color:** For each non-zero color, get the indices of all cells with that color.
3. **Calculate Horizontal Span:** For each color's indices, determine the leftmost and rightmost column indices within the same row (using `uppermost`, `leftmost`, and `rightmost` functions).
4. **Connect the Span:** Create a line of indices connecting the leftmost and rightmost points obtained in the previous step using the `connect` function.
5. **Recolor and Paint:** Recolor the connected indices with their respective color and paint them onto a copy of the input grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def connect_horizontally(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
    if height(obj) == 1:
      start = (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj))
      end = (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj))
      O = fill(O, color(obj), connect(start, end))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Non-Background Objects:** Identify all distinct objects in the grid, excluding the background color.
2. **Filter Horizontal Objects:** Select objects that only occupy a single row (height of 1).
3. **Connect the Row:** For each horizontal object, find the leftmost and rightmost column indices and connect them using the `connect` function.
4. **Fill with Object Color:**  Fill the connected indices with the object's color using the `fill` function.

**Version 4:**

```python
def connect_horizontally(I):
  x1 = palette(I)
  x2 = remove(ZERO, x1)
  x3 = apply(lambda c: {(i, j) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(row) if v == c}, x2)
  x4 = apply(lambda indices: mpapply(lambda a, b: connect(a, b), totuple(indices), totuple(indices)), x3)
  x5 = mapply(lambda x: extract(x, lambda line: len(line) > 1), x4)
  x6 = compose(merge, x5)
  x7 = fork(recolor, identity, x6)
  x8 = mapply(x7, x2)
  O = paint(I, x8)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find All Non-Zero Colors:**  Identify all unique colors in the grid (excluding 0).
2. **Get Indices For Each Color:** Find all indices of cells containing each non-zero color.
3. **Connect All Pairs Within Color:**  For each color, connect every pair of indices within that color group using the `connect` function.
4. **Filter Single-Cell Lines:** Remove lines generated in the previous step that only contain a single cell, effectively keeping only lines connecting multiple cells.
5. **Recolor and Paint:** Recolor the filtered lines with their corresponding color and paint them onto a copy of the input grid. 

**Version 5:**

```python
def connect_horizontally(I):
  x1 = objects(I, False, False, True)
  x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda obj: height(obj) == 1)
  x3 = apply(lambda obj: connect((uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)), (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj))), x2)
  x4 = merge(x3)
  x5 = fork(recolor, identity, x4)
  x6 = mapply(x5,  palette(I) - {ZERO})
  O = paint(I, x6)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Non-Background Objects:** Identify all distinct objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Filter Horizontal Objects:** Select objects that occupy a single row (height of 1).
3. **Connect Left and Right Extremes:**  For each horizontal object, connect its leftmost and rightmost points using the `connect` function.
4. **Merge and Recolor:** Merge all the connected lines and recolor them with their respective color.
5. **Paint onto Grid:** Paint the recolored, connected lines onto a copy of the input grid.
