## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation connects all occurrences of the non-background color within each input grid, creating a continuous line. The line prioritizes horizontal connections and extends to the rightmost occurrence within the same row.

**Input 0:** All '8's on the same row are connected, forming a horizontal line.

**Input 1:** Similar to Input 0, '8's on the same row are connected. Since there are '8's in different columns, a continuous line is formed, extending downwards at the connecting column.

**Input 2:** Same principle applies, connecting '8's on the same row. This results in multiple horizontal lines stacked vertically.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  color_val = color(first(objs))
  filled_indices = mpapply(lambda o1, o2: connect(center(o1), center(o2)), objs, objs)
  O = paint(I, recolor(color_val, filled_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** We use `objects(I, True, False, True)` to identify distinct objects in the grid, excluding the background. 
2. **Extract color:**  `color(first(objs))` retrieves the color of the first object, assuming all objects share the same color.
3. **Connect objects:** `mpapply` iterates through all object pairs and uses `connect` to generate indices forming a line between their centers.
4. **Paint the line:**  Finally, `paint` draws the connected line onto the original grid `I` using the extracted color.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  color_val = leastcolor(I)
  connected_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == color_val and any(index(I, (loc[0], j)) == color_val for j in range(loc[1] + 1, width(I))))
  O = paint(I, recolor(color_val, connected_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify color:**  `leastcolor(I)` determines the non-background color.
2. **Connect horizontally:** `mfilter` iterates through all grid indices and keeps those that:
    - Have the target color.
    - Have at least one other cell with the same color to their right on the same row.
3. **Paint the line:** Similar to version 1, `paint` draws the connected line using the identified color.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  color_val = color(first(objs))
  connected_line =  frozenset({loc for obj in objs for loc in obj if any((loc[0], j) in toindices(obj) for j in range(loc[1] + 1, width(I)))})
  O = paint(I, recolor(color_val, connected_line))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects & color:** Similar to version 1, we identify objects and their color.
2. **Connect within objects:** For each object, we identify cells that have another cell with the same color to their right within the same object.
3. **Paint the line:**  Similar to previous versions, `paint` draws the connected line.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  color_val = leastcolor(I)
  connected_cells = set()
  for i in range(height(I)):
    row_indices = [(i, j) for j in range(width(I)) if index(I, (i, j)) == color_val]
    if row_indices:
      connected_cells.update(connect(row_indices[0], row_indices[-1]))
  O = paint(I, recolor(color_val, frozenset(connected_cells)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify color:** Similar to version 2, we identify the non-background color.
2. **Connect within rows:** We iterate through each row and:
    - Find all cell indices with the target color.
    - If such cells exist, connect the leftmost and rightmost using `connect`.
3. **Paint the line:** Similar to previous versions, `paint` draws the connected line.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  color_val = color(first(objs))
  lines = mapply(lambda obj: connect(ulcorner(obj), urcorner(obj)), objs)
  O = paint(I, recolor(color_val, lines))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects & color:** Similar to previous versions, we identify objects and their color.
2. **Connect within objects:** For each object, we use `connect` to draw a line between its upper-left and upper-right corners.
3. **Paint the line:** Similar to previous versions, `paint` draws the connected line.

Each version utilizes different functions and logic to achieve the same transformation. While some directly connect object centers, others rely on identifying horizontal connections or utilizing bounding boxes for line generation.
