## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place in all three examples involves identifying objects within the grid (groups of connected digits of the same value different from the background) and extending them horizontally towards the rightmost occurrence of the same object within the same row. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- There are three distinct objects (groups of 8s).
- The top-most object is extended to the right, filling in the spaces between the two existing 8s.
- The middle object remains unchanged as it already touches the rightmost 8 in its row.
- The bottom-most object is extended similarly to the top-most object.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- There are five distinct objects.
- The two top-most objects remain unchanged as they are already touching the rightmost occurrences of 8 in their respective rows.
- The third and fourth objects are extended to the right to meet the rightmost 8 in their row.
- The bottom-most object remains unchanged.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

- This example follows the same logic as the previous two.
- The top-most object is extended to the right.
- The second object remains unchanged.
- The third, fourth, and fifth objects are extended rightwards.
- The bottom-most object remains unchanged.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" utilizing the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(height(I)):
      row_obj = frozenset({(v, (i, j)) for v, (k, j) in obj if k == i})
      if len(row_obj) > 0:
        max_j = rightmost(row_obj)
        O = paint(O, frozenset({(color(obj), (i, j)) for j in range(leftmost(row_obj), max_j + 1) if (i, j) in backdrop(obj) or index(I, (i, j)) == color(obj)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all distinct objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** The code iterates through each object and each row. For every row containing part of the object, it determines the rightmost column (`max_j`) of the object in that row.
3. **Fill:** It then paints the cells from the leftmost column of the object in that row to `max_j` with the object's color, effectively extending it rightwards. It only paints over cells that are either part of the object's backdrop or share the same color as the object in the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    row_objs = objects(crop(I, (i, 0), (1, width(I))), T, F, T)
    for obj in row_objs:
      max_j = rightmost(obj)
      O = paint(O, frozenset({(color(obj), (i, j)) for j in range(leftmost(obj), max_j + 1)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Rows:** This version iterates directly through each row of the input grid.
2. **Identify Row Objects:** For each row, it identifies objects within that row using `objects`.
3. **Extend Objects:** For each object in the row, it determines the rightmost column and paints all cells between the leftmost and rightmost columns with the object's color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    min_i, min_j = ulcorner(obj)
    max_i, max_j = lrcorner(obj)
    for i in range(min_i, max_i + 1):
      O = paint(O, frozenset({(color(obj), (i, j)) for j in range(min_j, max_j + 1) if index(I, (i, j)) == color(obj) or (i, j) in backdrop(obj)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Bounding Box:** This version identifies each object and its bounding box using `ulcorner` and `lrcorner`.
2. **Fill within Bounding Box:**  It then iterates through each cell within the object's bounding box. If the cell either shares the object's color in the input grid or falls within the object's backdrop, it is painted with the object's color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
      if color(obj) in row:
        j_indices = frozenset({j for j, v in enumerate(row) if v == color(obj)})
        min_j = min(j_indices)
        max_j = max(j_indices)
        O = paint(O, frozenset({(color(obj), (i, j)) for j in range(min_j, max_j + 1) if (i, j) in backdrop(obj)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Iterate:** Similar to other versions, it identifies objects and iterates through them.
2. **Check for Color in Row:**  For each object and row, it checks if the object's color is present in that row. 
3. **Determine Column Range and Fill:** If present, it identifies the minimum and maximum column indices of the object's color within the row and fills all cells between them that belong to the object's backdrop.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(height(I)):
        row = I[i]
        for c in palette(row):
            if colorcount(row, c) > 1:
                indices = frozenset({j for j, v in enumerate(row) if v == c})
                min_j, max_j = min(indices), max(indices)
                O = paint(O, {(c, (i, j)) for j in range(min_j, max_j + 1)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Rows and Colors:**  This version iterates through each row and then each distinct color within that row.
2. **Check for Multiple Occurrences:** If a color appears more than once in a row, it means there's an object to potentially extend.
3. **Determine Column Range and Fill:** It identifies the minimum and maximum column indices of that color and fills all cells between them, effectively extending the object.


These are just five examples, and many other valid solutions within the DSL could achieve the same transformation. Each version uses slightly different logic and function combinations, demonstrating the flexibility of the DSL and the potential for diverse solutions.
