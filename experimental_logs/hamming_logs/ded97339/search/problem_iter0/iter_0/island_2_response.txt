## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place in these input-output pairs can be described as **connecting disconnected components of the same color within each input grid**. This connection is achieved by filling in the spaces between the components with the shared color, effectively creating a continuous line or shape.

**Example:**

In Input_0, there are three distinct '8' digits. The transformation connects these digits horizontally, resulting in a single horizontal line of '8's in Output_0.

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_connect_components(I):
  x1 = palette(I)
  x2 = remove(ZERO, x1)
  x3 = lbind(ofcolor, I)
  x4 = apply(x3, x2)
  x5 = mapply(lambda x: connect(first(x), last(x)), x4)
  x6 = compose(merge, x5)
  x7 = fork(recolor, identity, x6)
  x8 = mapply(x7, x2)
  O = paint(I, x8)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify unique colors:** `x1 = palette(I)` extracts the set of unique colors in the grid.
2. **Remove background color:** `x2 = remove(ZERO, x1)` removes the background color (assumed to be 0).
3. **Get indices of each color:** `x3 = lbind(ofcolor, I)` creates a function that takes a color and returns the indices of that color in the grid.
4. **Apply to each color:** `x4 = apply(x3, x2)` applies the function from step 3 to each color, creating a list of index sets for each color.
5. **Connect first and last indices:** `x5 = mapply(lambda x: connect(first(x), last(x)), x4)` connects the first and last indices of each color's index set, effectively creating a line connecting the furthest points.
6. **Merge connected indices:** `x6 = compose(merge, x5)` merges the connected indices into a single set.
7. **Recolor connected indices:** `x7 = fork(recolor, identity, x6)` creates a function that takes a color and the merged indices, then recolors the indices with that color.
8. **Apply recoloring to each color:** `x8 = mapply(x7, x2)` applies the recoloring function to each color and its corresponding indices.
9. **Paint onto the original grid:** `O = paint(I, x8)` paints the recoloured indices onto the original grid, generating the output.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_connect_components(I):
  x1 = palette(I)
  x2 = remove(ZERO, x1)
  x3 = lbind(ofcolor, I)
  x4 = apply(x3, x2)
  x5 = mapply(lambda indices: mpapply(lambda a, b: connect(a, b), totuple(indices), totuple(indices)), x4)
  x6 = merge(x5)
  x7 = fork(recolor, identity, x6)
  x8 = mapply(x7, x2)
  O = paint(I, x8)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a different approach for connecting components within `x5`. Instead of connecting the first and last indices, it generates connections between all pairs of indices for each color using `mpapply`. This ensures that even complex shapes are properly connected.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_connect_components(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, True, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    indices = toindices(obj)
    hull = mpapply(lambda a, b: connect(a, b), totuple(indices), totuple(indices))
    recolored_hull = recolor(color(obj), hull)
    O = paint(O, recolored_hull)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version first identifies all objects in the input grid using `objects(I, False, True, True)`. Then, for each object, it calculates the convex hull using `mpapply(lambda a, b: connect(a, b), totuple(indices), totuple(indices))` and paints it on the grid with the object's color. This approach directly leverages the concept of objects and convex hulls for a more concise solution.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_connect_components(I):
  x1 = palette(I)
  x2 = remove(ZERO, x1)
  connected_components = set()
  for color in x2:
    indices = ofcolor(I, color)
    while indices:
      start = first(indices)
      connected = {start}
      queue = {start}
      while queue:
        current = queue.pop()
        for neighbor in dneighbors(current):
          if neighbor in indices and neighbor not in connected:
            connected.add(neighbor)
            queue.add(neighbor)
      connected_components.add(recolor(color, frozenset(connected)))
      indices = indices - connected
  O = paint(I, merge(connected_components))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find connected components for each color.  It iterates through each color, finds all indices of that color, and then performs BFS starting from an arbitrary index of that color. The connected component found by BFS is recolored and added to the `connected_components` set. Finally, all connected components are painted onto the original grid.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_connect_components(I):
  O = I
  for color in palette(I) - {ZERO}:
    painted = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), recolor(color, ofcolor(I, color)))
    for i in range(height(I)):
      for j in range(width(I) - 1):
        if painted[i][j] == color and painted[i][j + 1] == color:
          O = fill(O, color, connect((i, j), (i, j + 1)))
    for j in range(width(I)):
      for i in range(height(I) - 1):
        if painted[i][j] == color and painted[i + 1][j] == color:
          O = fill(O, color, connect((i, j), (i + 1, j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each non-background color and creates a temporary grid where only that color is present. It then iterates through the grid horizontally and vertically, connecting adjacent cells of the same color on the original grid. This approach avoids complex data structures and relies on simple iterations and comparisons for connecting components.
