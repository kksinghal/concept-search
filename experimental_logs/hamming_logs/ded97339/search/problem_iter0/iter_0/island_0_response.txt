## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place involves identifying objects within the grid (defined as connected components of the same digit) and then extending these objects horizontally to create a contiguous line of the same digit. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:**  There are three distinct '8' objects. Each object is extended rightward until it merges with another '8' object or reaches the grid border.
* **Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0, the '8' objects are extended rightward. Note how the bottom-most '8' merges with the extended line from the '8' above it.
* **Input_2:**  Again, the '8' objects are extended horizontally.  Notice how the extensions stop upon encountering another '8' or the grid edge.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions, along with explanations, that achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) 
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    start_j = leftmost(obj)
    end_j = rightmost(obj)
    for j in range(start_j, end_j):
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(uppermost(obj), j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all connected components of the same digit in the grid.
2. **Iterate through Objects:**  The code iterates through each object found.
3. **Determine Horizontal Span:** `start_j` and `end_j` store the column indices of the leftmost and rightmost cells of the object.
4. **Fill Horizontally:** For each column between `start_j` and `end_j`, the code fills the grid `O` with the object's color at the object's row (`uppermost(obj)`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    current_color = None
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        current_color = I[i][j]
      if current_color is not None:
        O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate Row-wise:** This version iterates through the grid row by row.
2. **Track Current Color:**  `current_color` stores the digit being extended on the current row.  It's set to `None` at the beginning of each row.
3. **Update and Fill:**  If a cell's value is not the background color, `current_color` is updated. If `current_color` is set, the corresponding cell in the output grid is filled with that color. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), backdrop(connect(ulcorner(obj), urcorner(obj))))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects and Create Canvas:**  Similar to Version 1, it identifies objects and creates an empty canvas.
2. **Connect and Recolor:** For each object, it connects the upper-left and upper-right corners using `connect`. The resulting line is then recolored with the object's color.
3. **Paint on Canvas:**  The recolored line (which represents the horizontally extended object) is painted onto the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, val, {(i, k) for k in range(j, len(row))})
        break  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate and Fill:** This version directly iterates through the grid. 
2. **Find First Non-Background:**  For each row, it finds the first cell that's not the background color.
3. **Fill Until End:** From that cell onwards, it fills the entire row with the identified color and then moves to the next row (`break`). 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    min_j, max_j = leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj)
    for j in range(min_j, max_j + 1):
      O = underfill(O, color(obj), {(uppermost(obj), j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to versions 1 and 3, it identifies objects.
2. **Find Horizontal Extremes:** For each object, `min_j` and `max_j` store the column indices of the leftmost and rightmost cells, respectively.
3. **Underfill Horizontally:** It iterates through each column from `min_j` to `max_j`. For each column, it uses `underfill` to paint the object's color onto the canvas, but only where the canvas currently has the background color.


## Conclusion

These five distinct programs demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation in the DSL. Each program leverages the provided DSL functions in unique ways to identify objects, determine their horizontal span, and fill the grid accordingly.
