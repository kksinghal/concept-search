## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation connects all occurrences of a non-background color on the same row with a line of that color.  

* **Input 0:** The single 8s in each column are connected horizontally, forming continuous lines.
* **Input 1:** Similar to Input 0, but demonstrates that the connection only occurs within the same row, as the vertically aligned 8s remain separate.
* **Input 2:**  Further emphasizes row-wise connection, with some rows having multiple separate 8 groups that are each connected internally.


## Program Version 1: (Inspired by Program_B)

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], connect((i, 0), (i, len(I[0])-1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates an empty canvas (`O`) of the same size as the input (`I`), filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate Rows:** Iterates through each row (`i`) of the input grid.
3. **Connect Row:** For each non-background color in a row, it draws a line of that color across the entire row in the output canvas.
4. **Return Output:**  Returns the modified canvas as the output.


## Program Version 2: (Inspired by Program_A & Program_B)

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    color_to_connect = None
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and color_to_connect is None:
        color_to_connect = I[i][j]
    if color_to_connect is not None:
      O = fill(O, color_to_connect, connect((i, 0), (i, len(I[0])-1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:**  The output (`O`) starts as a copy of the input.
2. **Iterate and Identify:** Iterates through rows, identifying the first non-background color (`color_to_connect`) in each row.
3. **Conditional Connection:** If a non-background color is found in the row, a line of that color is drawn across the entire row in the output.
4. **Return Output:**  The modified grid is returned.


## Program Version 3: (Inspired by Program_B, using `objects`)

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
        i = uppermost(obj)
        O = fill(O, color(obj), connect((i, 0), (i, len(I[0])-1)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates an empty canvas (`O`) of the same size as the input (`I`), filled with the background color.
2. **Identify Objects:**  Uses `objects` function to get a set of objects (connected components) in the input, excluding the background.
3. **Iterate Objects:** Iterates through each identified object.
4. **Connect Row:** For each object, it determines its row (`i`) and draws a line of that object's color across the entire row in the output.
5. **Return Output:** Returns the modified canvas. 


## Program Version 4: (Inspired by Program_B, using `hconcat`)

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (len(I), 1))
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        O[i] = (I[i][j],) * len(I[0])
        break
  return hconcat(*O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates a canvas (`O`) with the background color, initially one column wide and the height of the input.
2. **Iterate and Find Color:**  Iterates through rows of the input. For each row, it finds the first non-background color. 
3. **Fill Row:** If a non-background color is found, the corresponding row in the canvas is filled with that color.
4. **Horizontal Concatenation:** All rows of the canvas are concatenated horizontally to create the final output.


## Program Version 5: (Inspired by Program_A, using `extract`)

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    non_bg_color = extract(I[i], lambda x: x != mostcolor(I))
    if non_bg_color is not None:
        O = fill(O, non_bg_color, connect((i, 0), (i, len(I[0])-1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:**  The output (`O`) begins as a copy of the input.
2. **Iterate Rows and Extract:**  Iterates through rows, using the `extract` function to find the first non-background color (`non_bg_color`) in each row.
3. **Conditional Connection:** If a non-background color is found, a line of that color is drawn across the entire row.
4. **Return Output:** The modified grid is returned.
