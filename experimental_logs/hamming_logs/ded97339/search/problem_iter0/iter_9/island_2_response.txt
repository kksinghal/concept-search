## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected components) of non-zero values in the input grid and then extending them horizontally either to the left or right until they encounter another non-zero object or reach the grid boundary. 

* **Input_0:** The single 8-valued object is extended rightward until it hits the other 8-valued object or the right edge of the grid.
* **Input_1:** The 8-valued objects are extended rightward until they hit another 8-valued object or the right edge of the grid.
* **Input_2:** Similar to Input_1, but some objects are extended leftward instead of rightward, depending on their position relative to other objects.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:


### Program Version 1: 

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    v = color(obj)
    left = leftmost(obj)
    right = rightmost(obj)
    top = uppermost(obj)
    bottom = lowermost(obj)
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
      if left == 0 or index(I, (i, left - 1)) != 0:
        O = paint(O, recolor(v, {(i, j) for j in range(left, width(I))}))
      elif right == width(I) - 1 or index(I, (i, right + 1)) != 0:
        O = paint(O, recolor(v, {(i, j) for j in range(0, right + 1)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create a canvas 'O' filled with zeros, matching the input grid's shape.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** Loop through each object in the input grid 'I'.
3. **Determine Extension Direction:** For each row of an object, check if its left or right side is either at the grid boundary or adjacent to another non-zero object. This determines the direction of extension.
4. **Extend Object:** Based on the direction, extend the object horizontally by painting the corresponding cells in the output grid 'O' with the object's color. 

This version iterates through each row of an object to determine the extension direction, making it potentially less efficient than other versions.


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    v = color(obj)
    left = leftmost(obj)
    right = rightmost(obj)
    if left <= width(I) - right - 1:
      O = paint(O, recolor(v, {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for j in range(left, width(I))}))
    else:
      O = paint(O, recolor(v, {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for j in range(0, right + 1)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Initialize the output grid 'O' as a copy of the input grid 'I'.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** Loop through each object in 'I'.
3. **Calculate Distances:** For each object, calculate the distances from its leftmost and rightmost points to the respective grid boundaries.
4. **Determine Extension Direction:**  Extend the object towards the direction with the smaller distance.
5. **Extend Object:** Paint the corresponding cells in 'O' with the object's color.

This version determines the extension direction based on the object's overall position, making it potentially more efficient than version 1.


### Program Version 3: 

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    column = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(height(I)))
    column_obj = toobject(column, I)
    for obj in objects(column_obj, True, False, True):
      v = color(obj)
      top = uppermost(obj)
      bottom = lowermost(obj)
      if j == 0 or index(I, (top, j - 1)) != 0:
        O = paint(O, recolor(v, {(i, j) for i in range(top, height(I))}))
      elif j == width(I) - 1 or index(I, (top, j + 1)) != 0:
        O = paint(O, recolor(v, {(i, j) for i in range(0, top + 1)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty output grid 'O' with the same shape as the input 'I'.
2. **Iterate through Columns:**  Loop through each column in the input grid.
3. **Process Objects in Column:** For each object within the current column, determine the direction to extend (up or down).
4. **Extend Object:** Extend the object vertically until reaching the top/bottom edge or encountering a non-zero value.
5. **Paint Grid:** Paint the extended object onto the output grid 'O'.

This version processes the grid column-wise instead of object-wise. 


### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    row = tuple((i, j) for j in range(width(I)))
    row_obj = toobject(row, I)
    for obj in objects(row_obj, True, False, True):
      v = color(obj)
      left = leftmost(obj)
      right = rightmost(obj)
      if any(index(I, (k, j)) != 0 for k in range(i + 1, height(I)) for j in range(left, right + 1)):
        O = paint(O, recolor(v, {(i, j) for j in range(0, left)}))
      else:
        O = paint(O, recolor(v, {(i, j) for j in range(right + 1, width(I))}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** The output grid 'O' starts as a copy of the input grid 'I'.
2. **Row-wise Iteration:** Iterate through each row of the grid.
3. **Object Detection in Row:** Identify objects (connected components of non-zero values) within the current row.
4. **Check for Obstacles:** For each object, check if there are any non-zero values below it.
5. **Conditional Extension:** If obstacles are found below, extend the object to the left; otherwise, extend it to the right.
6. **Update Output:** Update the output grid 'O' with the extended objects.

This version iterates through rows and extends objects based on the presence of other non-zero values below them. 


### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  for obj in objs:
    v = color(obj)
    left = leftmost(obj)
    right = rightmost(obj)
    extension = connect((uppermost(obj), left), (uppermost(obj), right))
    if any(index(I, (i, j)) != 0 for (i, j) in shift(extension, (1, 0))):
      extension = connect((uppermost(obj), left), (uppermost(obj), 0))
    else:
      extension = connect((uppermost(obj), right), (uppermost(obj), width(I) - 1))
    O = paint(O, recolor(v, extension))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty output grid 'O' with the same dimensions as the input grid 'I'.
2. **Object Identification:** Identifies all distinct objects in the input grid.
3. **Iterate Through Objects:**  Loops through each identified object.
4. **Horizontal Extension Line:**  Creates a horizontal line representing the object's initial extension.
5. **Check for Collision:** Determines if the extension line collides with any existing non-zero values in the input grid.
6. **Adjust Extension:** If a collision is detected, the extension line is adjusted to extend in the opposite direction.
7. **Paint Extension:** The adjusted extension line is painted onto the output grid with the object's color.

This version first creates a potential extension line and then adjusts it based on collisions, providing a different approach to object extension. 

These five program versions provide distinct approaches to solving the transformation task, showcasing the flexibility and diversity of solutions possible within the DSL.
