## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected components of the same digit) in the input grid and extending them horizontally or vertically based on their initial orientation:

* **Horizontal Extension:** If an object is wider than it is tall (landscape), extend it horizontally to both edges of the grid.
* **Vertical Extension:** If an object is taller than it is wide (portrait), extend it vertically to both the top and bottom edges of the grid.

**Example:**

In **Input_0**, the '8' objects are initially 1x2 (portrait).  Therefore, they are extended vertically to the top and bottom, resulting in 10x2 objects in **Output_0**. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I,
               mapply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), 
                                       backdrop(branch(portrait(obj), 
                                                   vfrontier, 
                                                   hfrontier)(ulcorner(obj)))),
                      objects(I, T, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies all objects (connected components of the same digit) in the input grid `I`.
2. **`mapply(...)`:** Applies the following transformation to each object and merges the results:
   - **`lambda obj: ...`:**  Defines an anonymous function that takes an object as input.
   - **`ulcorner(obj)`:** Finds the upper-left corner of the object.
   - **`branch(portrait(obj), vfrontier, hfrontier)(...)`:** 
     - **`portrait(obj)`:**  Checks if the object is taller than it is wide. 
     - If True (portrait), it calls `vfrontier(...)` to create a vertical line extending from the object's upper-left corner.
     - If False (landscape), it calls `hfrontier(...)` to create a horizontal line from the corner.
   - **`backdrop(...)`:**  Expands the line to cover the entire row or column.
   - **`recolor(color(obj), ...)`:** Recolors the expanded area with the original object's color.
3. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the transformed objects onto a copy of the input grid `I`, resulting in the output grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    direction = vfrontier if portrait(obj) else hfrontier
    O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), backdrop(direction(ulcorner(obj)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version achieves the same outcome as Version 1 but with a more readable structure using a for loop and a conditional assignment for the `direction` function.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    start = (0, ulcorner(obj)[1]) if portrait(obj) else (ulcorner(obj)[0], 0)
    end = (len(I)-1, start[1]) if portrait(obj) else (start[0], len(I[0])-1)
    O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), connect(start, end)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly calculates the start and end points of the line to be drawn based on the object's orientation, eliminating the need for `vfrontier` and `hfrontier`.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I,
               merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj),
                                             backdrop(branch(portrait(obj),
                                                         vfrontier,
                                                         hfrontier)(ulcorner(obj)))),
                           objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 1 but uses `merge` and `apply` instead of `mapply` to combine the transformed objects.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if portrait(obj):
      O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), {(i, ulcorner(obj)[1]) for i in range(len(I))}))
    else:
      O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), {(ulcorner(obj)[0], j) for j in range(len(I[0]))}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version avoids using `vfrontier`, `hfrontier`, and `backdrop` altogether. It directly constructs the set of indices representing the extended line within the `paint` function based on the object's orientation.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches and function combinations within the DSL to achieve the same desired transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the language.
