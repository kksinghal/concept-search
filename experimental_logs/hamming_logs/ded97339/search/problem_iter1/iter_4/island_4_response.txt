## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation connects non-background digits in each column, but only up to the rightmost occurrence of that digit in the row. 

**Input 0:**
- Column 4: Connects the '8's from row 3 to row 7.
- Column 6: Connects the '8's from row 3 to row 9.
- Other columns: No change as they either have all '0's or a single '8'.

**Input 1:**
- Column 7: Connects the '8's from row 1 to row 6.
- Column 9: Connects the '8's from row 6 to row 6 (effectively no change).
- Other columns: Similar to Input 0.

**Input 2:**
- Column 1: Connects the '8's from row 1 to row 4.
- Column 5: Connects the '8's from row 1 to row 4.
- Column 7: Connects the '8's from row 7 to row 7 (effectively no change).
- Column 9: Connects the '8's from row 1 to row 2.
- Other columns: Similar to Input 0.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(len(I[0])): # Loop through columns
    for i in range(len(I)): # Loop through rows
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I): # If non-background color
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], connect((i, j), (i, max(j for k in range(j, len(I[0])) if I[i][k] == I[i][j])))) # Connect up to rightmost same color
        break # Move to the next column after connecting
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version iterates through each cell, and if it finds a non-background color, it connects it to the rightmost occurrence of the same color in that row. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True): # Get objects
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      O = fill(O, color(obj), connect((i, j), (i, max(k for k in range(j, len(I[0])) if I[i][k] == color(obj)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version utilizes the `objects` function to find individual objects and then connects each cell within the object to the rightmost cell of the same color in its row.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)): # Loop through rows
    for j in range(len(I[0])): # Loop through columns
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I): # Non-background color
        rightmost_j = next((k for k in range(len(I[0])-1, j-1, -1) if I[i][k] == I[i][j]), j) # Find rightmost same color index
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], connect((i, j), (i, rightmost_j))) # Connect
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version optimizes the search for the rightmost same-colored cell by iterating from the end of the row towards the current cell.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Initialize output with background color
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True): # For each object
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1): # For each row in object's bounding box
      rightmost_j = max(j for _, (row, j) in enumerate(obj) if row == i) # Rightmost column in the row
      O = fill(O, color(obj), connect((i, leftmost(obj)), (i, rightmost_j))) # Fill from leftmost to rightmost
  return O 
```

**Explanation:** This version utilizes bounding box information of each object to efficiently connect cells within the object.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)): # For each row
    last_seen = {} # Store the last seen column index for each color
    for j in range(len(I[0])): # For each column
      color = I[i][j]
      if color != mostcolor(I): # If not background
        if color in last_seen:
          O = fill(O, color, connect((i, j), (i, last_seen[color]))) # Connect to the last seen
        last_seen[color] = j # Update last seen index
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version efficiently keeps track of the last seen index for each color in a row, reducing redundant searches for the rightmost cell.
