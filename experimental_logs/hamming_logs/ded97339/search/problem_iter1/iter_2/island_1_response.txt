## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending each object in the input grid horizontally to the right until it either reaches the edge of the grid or encounters another object.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input 0:** The '8' objects extend to the right until they hit another '8' object or the grid's edge.
* **Input 1:** Similar to Input 0, the '8' objects extend rightwards. Note how the bottom-most '8' object extends to include the two isolated '8's to its right.
* **Input 2:** The pattern continues, showcasing the horizontal extension behavior of the transformation.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to implement the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      for k in range(j + 1, w):
        if index(I, (i, k)) != mostcolor(I):
          break
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, l) for l in range(j, k + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** For each object, the code iterates through its cells. For each cell, it extends to the right, filling with the object's color (`fill`), until it encounters a non-background cell (`index(I, (i, k)) != mostcolor(I)`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      j = leftmost(obj)
      while j < len(I[0]) and index(I, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j)})
        j += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object-wise Iteration:**  Iterates through each object.
2. **Horizontal Scan & Fill:**  For each row within an object's bounding box, it starts from the leftmost column and extends rightward, filling with the object's color until a non-background cell is encountered.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    right_edge = rightmost(obj)
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      for j in range(right_edge + 1, len(I[0])):
        if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
          break
        right_edge = j
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, k) for k in range(leftmost(obj), right_edge + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Objects and Right Edge:**  Identifies objects and determines the initial rightmost column for each.
2. **Extend Right Edge:**  Scans rightward from the current right edge, updating it if a background cell is encountered.
3. **Fill Row:** Fills the row from the object's leftmost point to the updated right edge.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    current_color = None
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        current_color = index(I, (i, j))
      elif current_color is not None:
        O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Row-wise Iteration:** Iterates through each row of the grid.
2. **Color Tracking:**  Tracks the current object color encountered in each row. If it encounters a non-background color, it stores it.
3. **Fill Until Next Object:**  As long as it encounters background cells (`elif current_color is not None:`) and it has a stored color, it fills those cells with the stored color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    left, right = leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj)
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j) for j in range(left, right + 1)})
      for j in range(right + 1, len(I[0])):
        if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
          break
        right = j
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates a blank canvas filled with the background color.
2. **Object-wise Processing:**  Iterates through each object.
3. **Fill Initial Span:** Fills the initial horizontal span of the object.
4. **Extend Span:** Checks for potential rightward extension and updates the span if possible.
5. **Paint to Canvas:**  Paints the extended object onto the canvas.
