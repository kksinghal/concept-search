## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying horizontal segments of the same non-background color within each column and then extending those segments either to the left or right to create a single continuous segment of that color in each column. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* In column 4, the two isolated '8's are connected to form a single horizontal line extending to the left.
* In column 7, the three isolated '8's are connected to form a single vertical line.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* In column 2, the three isolated '8's are connected to form a single vertical line.
* In columns 7 and 9, the two isolated '8's in each column are connected to form single horizontal lines extending to the right.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* In columns 1 and 5, the multiple isolated '8's are connected to form single horizontal lines extending to the right.
* In column 7, the two isolated '8's are connected to form a single horizontal line extending to the right.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, each with a different approach:


### **Program Version 1**

**Code:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    column = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(height(I)))
    column_obj = toobject(column, I)
    for v in palette(column_obj) - {mostcolor(I)}:
      indices = ofcolor(I, v) & column
      start = uppermost(indices)
      end = lowermost(indices)
      O = fill(O, v, connect((start, j), (end, j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over columns:**  The program iterates through each column of the input grid (`I`).
2. **Identify non-background colors:** Within each column, it identifies the colors that are not the background color.
3. **Find upper and lowermost occurrences:** For each non-background color, it determines the row indices of the uppermost and lowermost occurrences of that color in the column.
4. **Connect occurrences:** It then connects these uppermost and lowermost occurrences by filling all cells between them with the same color, effectively creating a continuous segment.

This approach directly leverages the logic from `Program_A` and `Program_B` to identify and connect the non-background segments within each column.

### **Program Version 2**

**Code:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    upper, lower = uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj)
    left, right = leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj)
    O = fill(O, color(obj), connect((upper, left), (lower, right)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** The code first uses the `objects` function to identify all distinct connected components of non-background colors.
2. **Find bounding box:** For each object, it determines the coordinates of its bounding box using `uppermost`, `lowermost`, `leftmost`, and `rightmost`.
3. **Connect within bounding box:** It connects the object's bounding box horizontally by filling all cells between the leftmost and rightmost columns within the bounding box rows with the object's color.

This version simplifies the logic by directly working with identified objects and their bounding boxes, utilizing functions like `objects`, `color`, and `connect` effectively.

### **Program Version 3**

**Code:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    segment_start = None
    segment_color = None
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        if segment_start is None:
          segment_start = i
          segment_color = I[i][j]
        O = fill(O, segment_color, {(i, j)})
      else:
        segment_start = None
        segment_color = None
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize output grid:** Starts by creating an empty output grid (`O`) filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate and track segments:** Iterates through each cell of the input, tracking the start (`segment_start`) and color (`segment_color`) of non-background segments within each column.
3. **Fill segments:**  If a cell continues a segment, its color is copied to the output. If a segment ends (background color encountered), the tracking variables are reset.

This version uses a stateful iteration approach, effectively "painting" the connected segments onto a blank canvas based on the encountered colors.


### **Program Version 4**

**Code:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    column_indices = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(height(I)))
    for obj in objects(toobject(column_indices, I), univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
      O = fill(O, color(obj), connect(ulcorner(obj), lrcorner(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate columns & identify objects:**  Iterates through each column, treating it as a separate grid, and identifies objects (continuous segments) within it.
2. **Connect object corners:** Connects the upper-left and lower-right corners of each identified object using the `connect` function to form a continuous horizontal line.

This version breaks down the problem by treating each column as an independent entity and then applies object identification and connection logic to each column separately.


### **Program Version 5**

**Code:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    prev_color = mostcolor(I)
    start_row = None
    for i in range(height(I)):
      current_color = I[i][j]
      if current_color != mostcolor(I):
        if current_color == prev_color:
          O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
        else:
          if start_row is not None:
            O = fill(O, prev_color, connect((start_row, j), (i - 1, j)))
          start_row = i
          O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
      else:
        if start_row is not None:
          O = fill(O, prev_color, connect((start_row, j), (i - 1, j)))
        start_row = None
      prev_color = current_color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and track colors:** Iterates through the grid, keeping track of the previous color encountered in each column (`prev_color`) and the starting row of potential segments (`start_row`).
2. **Connect on color change:** When a new non-background color is encountered, it connects the previous segment (if any) and updates the `start_row`.
3. **Handle segment end:** If a background color is encountered or the end of the column is reached, it connects the last tracked segment.

This version uses a more intricate iteration and tracking mechanism to identify and connect segments based on color changes within each column.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the desired transformation, utilizing various combinations of functions provided in the DSL. Each version offers a unique perspective on solving the problem while adhering to the constraints of the DSL.
