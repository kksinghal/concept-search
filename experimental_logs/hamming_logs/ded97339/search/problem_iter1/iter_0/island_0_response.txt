## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

* **Identify Objects:** First, the program needs to identify individual objects within the grid. An object is defined as a group of connected cells with the same value, considering only direct adjacency (not diagonal). 
* **Extend Objects:**  For each object, the program needs to extend it horizontally or vertically until it encounters another object or the edge of the grid. The direction of extension (horizontal or vertical) depends on the object's initial shape:
    * If the object is taller than it is wide, it extends vertically.
    * If the object is wider than it is tall, it extends horizontally.
    * If the object is a square, it does not extend.

**Example:**

In `Input_0`, there are three distinct '8' objects. The top and bottom objects are taller than they are wide, so they extend vertically. The middle object is wider than it is tall, so it extends horizontally.


## Program Version 1:

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if portrait(obj):
      start = (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj))
      end = (lowermost(obj) + 1, leftmost(obj) + 1)
      O = fill(O, color(obj), connect(start, end))
    else:
      start = (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj))
      end = (uppermost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + 1)
      O = fill(O, color(obj), connect(start, end))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The code starts by identifying all objects in the input grid `I` using the `objects` function. 
2. **Iterate and Extend:**  It then iterates through each object:
   - **Determine Extension Direction:** `portrait(obj)` checks if the object is taller than it is wide.
   - **Calculate Start and End Points:** Based on the extension direction, the code calculates the start and end points for the line that will extend the object.
   - **Fill:**  The `connect` function creates a line of indices between the start and end points. The `fill` function then fills these indices in the grid `O` with the object's color.
3. **Return Output:** Finally, the modified grid `O` is returned as the output.


## Program Version 2:

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if height(obj) > width(obj):
      O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), backdrop(vfrontier(centerofmass(obj)))))
    elif height(obj) < width(obj):
      O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), backdrop(hfrontier(centerofmass(obj)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1, the code identifies all objects in the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** It iterates through each object:
   - **Determine Extension Direction:** It compares the object's height and width to determine the extension direction.
   - **Create Frontier:** Based on the direction, it creates a horizontal (`hfrontier`) or vertical (`vfrontier`) line of indices passing through the object's center of mass.
   - **Create Bounding Box:** The `backdrop` function expands the frontier line into a bounding box encompassing the entire extension area.
   - **Recolor and Paint:** The bounding box indices are then recolored with the object's color using `recolor`, and this recolored patch is painted onto the output grid `O` using `paint`.
3. **Return Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned.


## Program Version 3:

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    h, w = shape(obj)
    if h > w:
      O = fill(O, color(obj), product(interval(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1, 1), interval(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1, 1)))
    elif h < w:
      O = fill(O, color(obj), product(interval(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1, 1), interval(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1, 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Like the previous versions, this code first identifies all the objects in the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** It then iterates through each object and determines the direction of extension by comparing its height and width.
   - **Generate Indices:** It uses `interval` to generate a sequence of row indices and column indices covering the extended area. 
   - **Cartesian Product:** The `product` function generates all possible pairs of row and column indices, effectively creating a rectangular region. 
   - **Fill:**  The `fill` function fills this region with the object's color in the output grid.
3. **Return Output:** The modified grid is returned as the output.


## Program Version 4:

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    direction = (1, 0) if height(obj) > width(obj) else (0, 1)
    O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), backdrop(shoot(center(obj), direction))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  This version also begins by identifying all objects in the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Determine Direction:** It iterates through each object and determines the direction of extension by comparing its height and width. The direction is represented as a tuple `(vertical_step, horizontal_step)`.
3. **Shoot and Create Bounding Box:**  It uses the `shoot` function to create a line of indices extending infinitely in the determined direction from the object's center. The `backdrop` function then creates a bounding box encompassing this line, effectively covering the entire extension area.
4. **Recolor and Paint:** The bounding box indices are recolored with the object's color, and this recolored patch is painted onto the output grid.
5. **Return Output:** The modified grid is returned as the output.


## Program Version 5:

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    if portrait(obj):
      for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1):
        O = fill(O, color(obj), vfrontier((uppermost(obj), j)))
    else:
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
        O = fill(O, color(obj), hfrontier((i, leftmost(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The code identifies all objects in the input grid.
2. **Initialize Output:** It initializes an empty output grid `O` with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color.
3. **Iterate and Extend:**  It iterates through each object:
   - **Determine Extension Direction:** `portrait(obj)` checks if the object is taller than it is wide.
   - **Fill Rows/Columns:** Based on the direction, it iterates through either the rows or columns that the object occupies and fills them entirely with the object's color using  `vfrontier` (for vertical extension) or `hfrontier` (for horizontal extension).
4. **Return Output:** Finally, the modified grid `O` is returned as the output. 

Each of these versions provides a different approach to achieving the desired object extension transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
