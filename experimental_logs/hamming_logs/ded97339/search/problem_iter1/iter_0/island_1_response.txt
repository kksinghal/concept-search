## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected components of the same digit) on the grid and extending them horizontally until they reach another object or the grid border. 

**Input 0:** The object '8' is extended to the right until it hits another '8' or the grid edge.

**Input 1:** Similar to Input 0, the object '8' is extended horizontally. Notice how the bottom row of '8's extends to the right edge.

**Input 2:** Again, '8's are extended horizontally, showcasing that the extension stops upon encountering another object. 

## Code Generation:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) 
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      for k in range(j+1, w):
        if (i, k) in toindices(combine(*objs)) or k == w-1:
          break
        O = fill(O, grid[i][j], {(i, l) for l in range(j, k+1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all objects in the grid, considering only directly connected cells of the same value.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** The code iterates over each object and each cell within that object. For each cell, it extends horizontally (`k` loop) until it encounters another object's cell or the grid edge.
3. **Fill:** `fill()` function fills the cells between the original cell and the encountered obstacle/edge with the object's color.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
    rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      for j in range(leftmost_j, rightmost_j + 1):
        if (i, j) not in toindices(obj):
          if any((i, k) in toindices(combine(*objs)) for k in range(j, rightmost_j + 1)):
            break
          O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, l) for l in range(j, rightmost_j + 1)})
          break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Similar to Version 1, it identifies objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Check:** Iterates over each object, but instead of iterating through each cell, it goes row by row within the object's bounding box.
3. **Extend and Fill:** For each row, it checks if a cell needs filling. If so, it fills until an object or edge is encountered.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      start_j = leftmost(obj)
      end_j = rightmost(obj) + 1
      for other_obj in objs:
        if other_obj != obj and hmatching(obj, other_obj):
          other_left = leftmost(other_obj)
          other_right = rightmost(other_obj)
          if other_left > end_j and other_left <= rightmost(obj) + 1:
            end_j = other_left
          if other_right < start_j and other_right >= leftmost(obj):
            start_j = other_right + 1
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j) for j in range(start_j, end_j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions, identifies objects.
2. **Pre-calculate Extension:** Instead of checking during extension, this version pre-calculates the starting and ending columns for each row by comparing with other objects.
3. **Efficient Filling:**  Fills the row efficiently using the pre-calculated bounds.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      extension = shoot((i,j), (0, 1))
      for other_obj in objs:
        if other_obj != obj:
          extension -= toindices(other_obj)
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j) for i, j in extension if j >= 0 and j < len(I[0])})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Identifies objects.
2. **Shoot and Prune:** Uses `shoot()` function to create a horizontal line representing potential extension. Then, it removes indices that belong to other objects, effectively pruning the extension.
3. **Fill:**  Fills the remaining indices with the object's color.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    right_frontier = {(i, rightmost(obj) + 1) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)}
    collision = intersection(right_frontier, toindices(combine(*objs)))
    while len(collision) > 0:
      obj = combine(obj, recolor(color(obj), collision))
      right_frontier = {(i, rightmost(obj) + 1) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)}
      collision = intersection(right_frontier, toindices(combine(*objs)))
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Identifies objects.
2. **Frontier and Collision:** Calculates the right frontier of the current object. Checks for collisions with other objects on this frontier.
3. **Expand and Recolor:** If collisions exist, the object expands to include the collided cells, which are recolored. The process repeats until no more collisions are found.
4. **Paint:**  Finally, paints the expanded object onto the output grid.
