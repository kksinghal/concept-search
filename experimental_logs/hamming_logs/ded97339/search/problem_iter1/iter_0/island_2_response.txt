## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific objects (connected components of the same digit) within the input grid and extending them horizontally towards the right edge of the grid. The extension maintains the original shape of the object above the line connecting the leftmost and rightmost points of the object.

**Input_0:** 
- The object '8' is extended to the right, maintaining the shape above the diagonal line.

**Input_1:**
- Similar to Input_0, the object '8' is extended horizontally. 

**Input_2:**
- Again, the object '8' is extended horizontally, preserving the shape above the connection line.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    v = mostcolor(I)
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    obj = argmax(objs, size)
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
    rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
    extension = frozenset((i, j) for i, j in asindices(I) if j > leftmost_j and j < rightmost_j and I[i][j] == v)
    filled = fill(I, 8, extension)
    return filled

```
**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Background:** Determine the background color (most frequent) in the grid.
2. **Extract Largest Object:** Isolate the largest object from the grid.
3. **Determine Extension Area:**  Find the area between the object's leftmost and rightmost points, excluding the object itself.
4. **Fill Extension:** Fill the identified extension area with the object's color.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    target_color = leastcolor(I)
    filled_grid = I
    for i in range(height(I)):
        row_start = next((j for j, v in enumerate(I[i]) if v == target_color), -1)
        if row_start != -1:
            filled_grid = fill(filled_grid, target_color, frozenset((i, j) for j in range(row_start, width(I))))
    return filled_grid
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Find Target Color:** Identify the least common color, which represents the object to be extended.
2. **Iterate Row-wise:** Loop through each row of the grid.
3. **Locate Object Start:** Find the first occurrence of the target color in the row.
4. **Fill from Start to Right Edge:** If the target color is found, fill the row from that point to the right edge with the target color.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    c = leastcolor(I)
    O = I
    for i, r in enumerate(I):
        if c in r:
            j = r.index(c)
            O = fill(O, c, frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))))
    return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Get Target Color:** Find the least common color in the grid, representing the object.
2. **Iterate and Modify Rows:** Loop through each row and its index. If the target color exists in the row, find its index (first occurrence) and fill the row from that index to the right edge with the target color.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    color_to_extend = leastcolor(I)
    extended_grid = I
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I)):
            if extended_grid[i][j] == color_to_extend:
                extended_grid = fill(extended_grid, color_to_extend, frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))))
                break  # Move to the next row once the color is found and extended in the current row
    return extended_grid
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Identify the Extension Color:** Find the least common color in the grid.
2. **Iterate Through Cells:** Go through each cell in the grid row by row.
3. **Extend on Color Match:** If a cell matches the extension color, fill the row from that cell's column to the right edge with the extension color. Then, stop processing the current row and proceed to the next one.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  obj = argmax(objs, lambda obj: -uppermost(obj)) #select the topmost obj
  fill_indices = frozenset(
  (i,j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj)+1) for j in range(leftmost(obj), width(I))
  )
  O = fill(I, color(obj), fill_indices)
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Identify the Objects:** Extract objects from the input grid.
2. **Select the Topmost Object:** Find the object with the lowest row index (topmost).
3. **Calculate Fill Indices:** Define the indices to be filled based on the topmost object's bounding box extended to the right edge.
4. **Fill the Grid:** Fill the specified indices with the object's color.

These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired grid transformation using different combinations of DSL functions. Each version demonstrates a different way to analyze the input grid, identify the object to extend, and execute the filling operation.
