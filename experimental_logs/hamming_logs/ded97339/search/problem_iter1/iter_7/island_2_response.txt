## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

* **Identify the non-background object:** The transformation focuses on the object formed by digits other than the background digit (0 in this case).
* **Extend the object:** The object is extended either horizontally or vertically, depending on its original orientation. 
    * If the object is wider than it is tall, it's extended horizontally to the edge of the grid.
    * If the object is taller than it is wide, it's extended vertically to the edge of the grid.
* **Maintain object boundaries:** The extension only fills in background cells and does not overwrite existing non-background digits.

**Example:**

In Input_0, the object formed by digit '8' is taller than it is wide. Therefore, it is extended vertically, filling the background cells below each '8' until reaching the bottom of the grid.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = next((color(obj) for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)), 0)
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  target_obj = argmax(objs, size)
  if width(target_obj) >= height(target_obj):
    O = fill(I, target_color, product(range(height(I)), range(leftmost(target_obj), rightmost(target_obj) + 1)))
  else:
    O = fill(I, target_color, product(range(uppermost(target_obj), lowermost(target_obj) + 1), range(width(I))))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify target color:** The `target_color` is identified from the objects present in the grid, excluding the background. 
2. **Find the largest object:** `objects`, `argmax`, and `size` are used to find the largest object formed by the `target_color`.
3. **Determine orientation:** The object's orientation (horizontal or vertical) is determined by comparing its width and height.
4. **Fill based on orientation:** Based on the orientation:
   * **Horizontal:** The grid is filled with `target_color` from the leftmost to the rightmost column of the object, spanning the entire height of the grid.
   * **Vertical:**  The grid is filled with `target_color` from the uppermost to the lowermost row of the object, spanning the entire width of the grid.


**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = next((c for c, _ in asobject(I) if c != 0), 0)
  filled = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == target_color:
        if width(objects(I, True, False, True)[0]) >= height(objects(I, True, False, True)[0]):
          filled = fill(filled, target_color, product(range(height(I)), range(j, width(I))))
        else:
          filled = fill(filled, target_color, product(range(i, height(I)), range(width(I))))
        return filled
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify target color:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Iterate and fill:** The code iterates through each cell of the grid. When it encounters the `target_color`, it determines the orientation of the corresponding object and fills the grid accordingly. The filling process is similar to Version 1.
3. **Early return:** The function returns the `filled` grid as soon as it encounters and processes the `target_color`.


**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  obj = argmax(objs, size)
  if width(obj) >= height(obj):
    start_j = leftmost(obj)
    O = tuple(tuple(color(obj) if j >= start_j else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for row in I)
  else:
    start_i = uppermost(obj)
    O = tuple(tuple(color(obj) for _ in range(width(I))) if i >= start_i else row for i, row in enumerate(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the largest object:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Determine orientation and fill:** The code determines the orientation of the largest object.
   * **Horizontal:**  It iterates through each cell, filling with the object's color if the cell's column index is greater than or equal to the object's leftmost column.
   * **Vertical:** It iterates through each row, replacing the entire row with the object's color if the row index is greater than or equal to the object's uppermost row.


**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = next((c for c, _ in asobject(I) if c != 0), 0)
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  obj = argmax(objs, size)
  if width(obj) >= height(obj):
    O = tuple(tuple(target_color if any(j >= leftmost(obj) for _, (i, j) in obj) else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for row in I)
  else:
    O = tuple(tuple(target_color if any(i >= uppermost(obj) for _, (i, j) in obj) else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify target color and largest object:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Conditional filling:** This version directly modifies the grid cells based on the object's orientation. 
   * **Horizontal:** It fills a cell with `target_color` if any cell in the object has a column index greater than or equal to the current cell's column index.
   * **Vertical:**  It fills a cell with `target_color` if any cell in the object has a row index greater than or equal to the current cell's row index.


**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    for target_color in palette(I) - {0}:
        objs = colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), target_color)
        obj = argmax(objs, size)
        if width(obj) >= height(obj):
            I = fill(I, target_color, product(range(height(I)), range(leftmost(obj), width(I))))
        else:
            I = fill(I, target_color, product(range(uppermost(obj), height(I)), range(width(I))))
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through colors:** This version iterates through each non-background color in the input grid.
2. **Find the largest object for each color:** For each color, it identifies the largest object and determines its orientation.
3. **Fill based on orientation:** It then fills the grid based on the object's orientation, similar to previous versions.
4. **Iterative filling:** The filling is done iteratively for each non-background color, ensuring all objects are extended correctly.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic.
