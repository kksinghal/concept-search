## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as **horizontal expansion**:

* **Identify objects:** Objects are defined as connected regions of the same color (digit).
* **Expand horizontally:** For each object, expand its cells to the right until reaching either another object or the grid border.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      for k in range(j+1, w):
        if (i, k) in toindices(merge(*objs)) or k == w-1:
          break
        O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, l) for l in range(j, k+1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to the provided programs, this version first identifies individual objects in the input grid `I` using `objects(I, T, F, F)`.
2. **Iterate and Expand:** It iterates through each object (`obj`) and its individual cells (`(i, j)`).
3. **Horizontal Scan:** For each cell, it scans horizontally to the right (`k` from `j+1` to grid width).
4. **Expansion Condition:**  It expands the object's color rightward (`fill` function) until:
    - It encounters a cell belonging to another object (`(i, k) in toindices(merge(*objs))`).
    - It reaches the right border of the grid (`k == w-1`).

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
    rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      for j in range(leftmost_j, rightmost_j + 1):
        if (i, j) not in toindices(obj):
          if any((i, k) in toindices(merge(*objs)) for k in range(j, rightmost_j + 1)):
            break
          O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, l) for l in range(j, rightmost_j + 1)})
          break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification and Initialization:**  Identifies objects and initializes the output grid `O` like the previous version.
2. **Bounding Box Iteration:** Instead of iterating over all cells of an object, it focuses on its bounding box. It determines the `leftmost_j` and `rightmost_j` column indices for each object.
3. **Horizontal Expansion:** It scans horizontally within the bounding box. If it finds an empty cell within the object's potential expansion area and an obstacle (another object) exists to the right, it stops the expansion. Otherwise, it fills the row with the object's color up to the rightmost boundary.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    right_frontier = {(i, rightmost(obj) + 1) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)}
    collision = intersection(right_frontier, toindices(merge(*objs)))
    while len(collision) > 0:
      obj = combine(obj, recolor(color(obj), collision))
      right_frontier = {(i, rightmost(obj) + 1) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)}
      collision = intersection(right_frontier, toindices(merge(*objs)))
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object and Frontier:** Identifies objects and defines a `right_frontier` set containing the indices immediately to the right of the object's boundary.
2. **Collision Detection:** It checks for `collision` between the `right_frontier` and other objects using `intersection` and `merge`.
3. **Expansion and Recoloring:** If a collision exists, it expands the current object to include the colliding cells (`combine`) and recolors them (`recolor`) to the object's color.
4. **Iteration:** The process repeats until no more collisions are found, effectively expanding the object to its maximum horizontal extent.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** It identifies objects and creates an empty canvas (`O`) filled with the background color (`mostcolor(I)`).
2. **Direct Expansion:** It iterates through each object and directly fills its color horizontally from each cell's `j` coordinate to the right edge of the grid (`width(I)`). 

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    min_j = leftmost(obj)
    max_j = rightmost(obj)
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j) for j in range(min_j, max_j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Boundaries:**  This version calculates the `min_j` (leftmost) and `max_j` (rightmost) column indices for each object.
2. **Direct Row Fill:**  It iterates through the rows within the object's bounding box (`i`) and directly fills the entire row segment from `min_j` to `max_j` with the object's color, effectively expanding it horizontally.
