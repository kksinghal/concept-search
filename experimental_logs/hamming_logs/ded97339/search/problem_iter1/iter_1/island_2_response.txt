## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same color, excluding the background color 0) and extending them horizontally until they encounter another object or a grid border. 

Let's break down the transformations for each input-output pair:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:**
* The single object (color 8) is extended to the right until it reaches the right border of the grid. 

**Input 1 -> Output 1:**
* The object at the top right (color 8) remains unchanged as it's already touching the right border.
* The other objects (color 8) are extended to the right until they encounter the object at the top right or the grid border.

**Input 2 -> Output 2:**
* The objects are extended to the right until they encounter another object or the right border of the grid.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, along with explanations for each:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_1fad071e(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Get all objects, excluding background
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj) # Find leftmost column of the object
    for i in range(height(I)): # Iterate through rows
      if (i, leftmost_j) in toindices(obj): # Check if cell is part of the object
        for j in range(leftmost_j + 1, width(I)): # Iterate from the next column to the right border
          if index(I, (i,j)) == mostcolor(I): # If cell is background
            O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i,j)}) # Fill the cell with object color
          else: 
            break # Stop extending if another object or border is encountered
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **Identify objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts all objects from the input grid.
2. **Iterate and extend:** For each object, the code finds its leftmost column and iterates through each row at that column.
3. **Fill background cells:** If the cell to the right is background, it's filled with the object's color. 
4. **Stop at obstacles:** The extension stops if a non-background cell (another object or border) is encountered.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_1fad071e(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create a blank canvas filled with background color
  for i, row in enumerate(I): # Iterate through rows
    current_color = None # Keep track of current object color
    for j, value in enumerate(row): # Iterate through columns
      if value != mostcolor(I): # If cell is not background
        current_color = value # Update current color
      if current_color is not None: # If within an object
        O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)}) # Fill the cell on the canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Blank canvas:** Creates a canvas with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Row-wise iteration:** Iterates through each row, maintaining a `current_color` variable.
3. **Track object color:** Updates `current_color` when a non-background cell is encountered.
4. **Fill canvas:** Fills the corresponding cell on the canvas with the `current_color` until a new object or the end of the row is reached.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_1fad071e(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(1, width(I)):
      if index(O, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I) and index(O, (i, j - 1)) != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, index(O, (i, j-1)), {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and compare:** Iterates through the grid and checks if the current cell is background and the cell to its left is not background.
2. **Fill with left neighbor's color:** If the condition is met, the current cell is filled with the color of its left neighbor, effectively extending the object.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_1fad071e(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if (i, rightmost_j) in toindices(obj):
        for j in range(rightmost_j - 1, -1, -1):
          if index(I, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I):
            O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j)})
          else:
            break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 1 but extends objects to the left instead of the right.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_1fad071e(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I) - 1):
    column = tuple(I[i][j] for i in range(height(I)))
    next_column = tuple(I[i][j + 1] for i in range(height(I)))
    if all(v == mostcolor(I) for v in next_column) and any(v != mostcolor(I) for v in column):
      for i in range(height(I)):
        if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
          O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Column-wise iteration:** This version iterates through columns instead of rows.
2. **Check empty column:** For each column, it checks if the next column is entirely background and the current column has at least one non-background cell.
3. **Extend objects:** If the conditions are met, it extends the objects in the current column to the next column.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, using various DSL functions and logic. Each version offers a distinct way of thinking about and solving the problem.
