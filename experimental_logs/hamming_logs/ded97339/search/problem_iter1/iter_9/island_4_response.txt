## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending each connected component (object) of non-zero digits in the input grid along its vertical axis until it either:

1. **Connects with another object of the same color:** In this case, the extension continues until it merges with the other object.
2. **Reaches the edge of the grid:** The extension continues until it hits the top or bottom edge.

This process effectively "draws lines" downwards and upwards from each object until they connect with a similar object or reach the grid's edge.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    c = color(obj)
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      O = fill(O, c, connect((i, j), (0, j)))
      O = fill(O, c, connect((i, j), (len(I) - 1, j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Creates an empty canvas `O` of the same size as the input `I` filled with zeros.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** Iterates through each connected component (object) of non-zero digits in the input grid using `objects`.
3. **Vertical Extension:** For each cell `(i, j)` in the object:
   - Draws a vertical line from the cell upwards to the top edge of the grid using `connect((i, j), (0, j))` and fills it with the object's color.
   - Draws a vertical line downwards to the bottom edge using `connect((i, j), (len(I) - 1, j))` and fills it.
4. **Return Output:** Returns the transformed grid `O`.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  h = height(I)
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    c = color(obj)
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      for k in range(i + 1, h):
        if index(O, (k, j)) == c:
          O = fill(O, c, connect((i, j), (k, j)))
          break
      for k in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
        if index(O, (k, j)) == c:
          O = fill(O, c, connect((i, j), (k, j)))
          break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Starts with the output `O` as the input `I`.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** Iterates through each object in `I`.
3. **Vertical Search & Extension:** For each cell in the object:
   - Searches downwards for another cell of the same color. If found, connects the two cells with a line.
   - Searches upwards for another cell of the same color. If found, connects the two cells.
4. **Return Output:** Returns the modified grid `O`.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    connected = False
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if I[i][j] != ZERO:
        if not connected:
          O = fill(O, I[i][j], connect((i, j), (0, j)))
          connected = True
        else:
          O = fill(O, I[i][j], connect((i, j), (i - 1, j)))
      else:
        connected = False
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Creates an empty canvas `O`.
2. **Iterate through Columns:** Iterates through each column `j` of the input grid.
3. **Track Connectivity:** Uses a flag `connected` to track if the current cell is part of an already connected component.
4. **Connect and Fill:** 
   - If a non-zero cell is encountered and it's not connected, draw a line upwards to the top edge and mark it as connected.
   - If it's connected, draw a line upwards to the previous non-zero cell.
   - Reset `connected` if a zero cell is encountered. 
5. **Return Output:** Returns the transformed grid `O`.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    last_seen = None
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if I[i][j] != ZERO:
        if last_seen is not None:
          O = fill(O, I[i][j], connect((i, j), last_seen))
        last_seen = (i, j)
      else:
        last_seen = None
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Starts with output `O` as the input `I`.
2. **Iterate through Columns:** Iterates through each column.
3. **Remember Last Non-Zero:** Keeps track of the last non-zero cell's index `last_seen`.
4. **Connect to Last Seen:** If a non-zero cell is encountered, and `last_seen` is not None, connects the current cell to the `last_seen` cell with a line of the current cell's color.
5. **Update Last Seen:** Updates `last_seen` to the current non-zero cell or None if it's a zero cell.
6. **Return Output:** Returns the modified grid `O`.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    topmost = uppermost(obj)
    bottommost = lowermost(obj)
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      O = fill(O, color(obj), connect((i, j), (topmost, j)))
      O = fill(O, color(obj), connect((i, j), (bottommost, j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:**  Starts with output `O` as the input `I`.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** Iterates through each object in the input grid.
3. **Find Extremes:** For each object, find the row indices of the topmost `topmost` and bottommost `bottommost` cells.
4. **Vertical Connection:** For each cell in the object:
   - Connect it to the topmost cell in the same column with a line of the object's color.
   - Connect it to the bottommost cell in the same column.
5. **Return Output:** Returns the modified grid `O`.
