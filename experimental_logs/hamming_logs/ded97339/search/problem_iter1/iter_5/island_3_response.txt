## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the least common color in the input grid and then extending it horizontally or vertically to connect with other occurrences of the same color. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The least common color (8) is extended horizontally to connect with other 8s in the same row.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  The least common color (8) is extended vertically to connect with other 8s in the same column.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The least common color (8) is extended both horizontally and vertically to connect with other 8s. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = leastcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, False, False, False)
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, target_color)
  filled_cells = mapply(lambda obj: connect(ulcorner(obj), lrcorner(obj)), target_objs)
  O = paint(I, recolor(target_color, filled_cells))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Color:** `target_color = leastcolor(I)` identifies the least common color in the grid.
2. **Isolate Target Objects:**  `objs = objects(I, False, False, False)` identifies all objects in the grid. `target_objs = colorfilter(objs, target_color)` filters the objects to get only those with the target color.
3. **Connect Occurrences:** `filled_cells = mapply(lambda obj: connect(ulcorner(obj), lrcorner(obj)), target_objs)` connects the upper-left and lower-right corners of each target object using the `connect` function.
4. **Paint and Return:** `O = paint(I, recolor(target_color, filled_cells))` recolors the connected cells with the target color and paints them onto the original grid.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = leastcolor(I)
  indices = ofcolor(I, target_color)
  connected_cells = mfilter(indices, lambda loc: any(n in indices for n in neighbors(loc)))
  O = paint(I, recolor(target_color, connected_cells))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Color and Indices:**  Similar to Version 1, we find the least common color and its indices.
2. **Find Connected Cells:**  `connected_cells = mfilter(indices, lambda loc: any(n in indices for n in neighbors(loc)))` filters the target indices to keep only those with at least one neighbor also having the target color, effectively finding connected components.
3. **Paint and Return:** Similar to Version 1.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = leastcolor(I)
  horizontal_lines = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: all(I[i][loc[1]] == target_color for i in range(height(I)) if (i, loc[1]) in ofcolor(I, target_color)))
  vertical_lines = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: all(I[loc[0]][j] == target_color for j in range(width(I)) if (loc[0], j) in ofcolor(I, target_color)))
  O = paint(paint(I, recolor(target_color, horizontal_lines)), recolor(target_color, vertical_lines))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Color:** As before.
2. **Find Horizontal and Vertical Lines:** This version explicitly finds complete horizontal and vertical lines formed by the target color.
3. **Paint Twice and Return:** It first paints horizontal lines and then vertical lines on the original grid.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = leastcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  filled_cells = set()
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == target_color:
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
        for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1):
          filled_cells.add((i, j))
  O = paint(I, recolor(target_color, frozenset(filled_cells)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Color and Objects:** Similar to Version 1 but excludes the background.
2. **Fill Bounding Boxes:** Iterates through objects, and if an object's color matches the target color, it fills the entire bounding box of that object with the target color.
3. **Paint and Return:** As before.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    target_color = leastcolor(I)
    rows = vsplit(I, height(I))
    modified_rows = tuple(tuple(target_color if any(v == target_color for v in row) else v for v in row) for row in rows)
    joined_grid = hconcat(*modified_rows)
    return joined_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Color:** Find the least common color.
2. **Split into Rows:** Divide the grid into individual rows using `vsplit`.
3. **Modify Rows:**  For each row, if it contains the target color, replace all cells with the target color.
4. **Join Rows:**  Recombine the modified rows horizontally using `hconcat`.

This program effectively extends the target color horizontally across the entire row if any cell in that row has the target color.


## Code Extraction:

Each program version is presented in a separate code block for easy copy-pasting and testing.
