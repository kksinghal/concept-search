## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same color) and extending them horizontally to form a continuous line within their bounding box. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The single 8-colored object is extended rightward to the edge of its bounding box.
* **Input_1:**  The vertical 8-colored object is extended rightward to the edge of its bounding box. The two horizontally aligned 8's are connected. 
* **Input_2:** The transformation is applied to all three 8-colored objects. Notice how the objects are extended only within their individual bounding boxes and not merged into a single object.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    start_j = leftmost(obj)
    end_j = rightmost(obj)
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j) for j in range(start_j, end_j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all connected objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Initialize Output:** `O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates an output grid `O` of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
3. **Iterate and Extend:** The program iterates through each object `obj` in `objs`. For each row `i` within the object's bounding box, it fills the output grid `O` with the object's color from the leftmost column `start_j` to the rightmost column `end_j`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        left_j = j
        while left_j >= 0 and index(I, (i, left_j)) != mostcolor(I):
          left_j -= 1
        right_j = j
        while right_j < width(I) and index(I, (i, right_j)) != mostcolor(I):
          right_j += 1
        O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, k) for k in range(left_j + 1, right_j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1, it initializes the output grid `O`.
2. **Iterate and Find Boundaries:** The program iterates through each cell. If a cell is not the background color, it searches left and right along the row to find the boundaries of the object.
3. **Fill:** It fills the output grid `O` from the left boundary to the right boundary with the object's color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = fill(O, color(obj), backdrop(toindices(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Identifies connected objects using `objects(I, T, F, F)`.
2. **Fill Bounding Boxes:**  Iterates through each object and directly fills its entire bounding box (`backdrop`) with the object's color in the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != mostcolor(I):
        left_j = next((k for k in range(j, -1, -1) if index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I)), 0)
        right_j = next((k for k in range(j, width(I)) if index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I)), width(I) - 1)
        O = fill(O, val, {(i, k) for k in range(left_j, right_j + 1)})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Initializes the output grid `O` with the background color.
2. **Efficient Boundary Search:** Uses `next` function for a more efficient search of object boundaries within each row.
3. **Fill:** Fills the output grid between identified boundaries.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
      upper = uppermost(obj)
      lower = lowermost(obj)
      left = leftmost(obj)
      right = rightmost(obj)
      for i in range(upper, lower + 1):
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j) for j in range(left, right + 1)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:** Identifies connected objects in the input grid using the `objects` function.
2. **Iterative Filling:** Iterates through each identified object and fills its bounding box row by row.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility of the provided DSL.
