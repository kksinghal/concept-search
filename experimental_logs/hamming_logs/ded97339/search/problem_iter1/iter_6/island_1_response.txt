## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be extending objects horizontally to connect with other objects of the same color on the same row. 

* **Input 0:** The two single-cell objects on the 4th row merge into a single object spanning from the 2nd to the 7th column. Similarly, all single-cell objects on the 7th column merge into a single object. Other objects remain unchanged.
* **Input 1:** Similar to input 0, objects on the 7th row and 3rd column extend horizontally to connect with other objects of the same color.
* **Input 2:**  Objects on the 2nd and 8th row, and the 2nd column extend horizontally. 

## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct program versions:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) 
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj): 
      extension = shoot((i, j), (0, 1))  
      for other_obj in objs:
        if other_obj != obj and hmatching(obj, other_obj) and color(obj) == color(other_obj): 
          extension -= toindices(other_obj) 
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, k) for i, k in extension if 0 <= k < len(I[0])}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Get all objects in the grid (`objects`).
2. **Iterate & Extend:**  For each object, iterate through its cells (`toindices`). For each cell, create a horizontal line extending to the right (`shoot`).
3. **Collision Detection:** Check for other objects of the same color on the same row (`hmatching`, `color`).  Remove colliding cells from the extension (`-=`).
4. **Fill Grid:** Fill the extended area with the object's color (`fill`).

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(len(I)):
    row_objs = sorted(objects(crop(I, (i, 0), (1, len(I[0]))), T, F, F), key=lambda obj: leftmost(obj)) 
    current_color = None 
    start_j = 0
    for obj in row_objs:
      if color(obj) != current_color:
        current_color = color(obj)
        start_j = leftmost(obj)
      else:
        O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j) for j in range(start_j, rightmost(obj) + 1)}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** Initialize an output grid filled with the background color (`canvas`).
2. **Process Row-wise:** Iterate through each row.
3. **Sort Objects:**  Identify and sort objects in the current row based on their leftmost column (`objects`, `sorted`, `crop`).
4. **Merge Same-Color Objects:**  Iterate through sorted objects. If an object has the same color as the previous, merge them by filling the gap (`fill`).

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    row = I[i]
    for j in range(len(row) - 1):
      if row[j] == row[j + 1] and row[j] != mostcommon(I): 
        O = fill(O, row[j], {(i, k) for k in range(j, j + 2)}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Cell-wise:** Loop through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check for Same Color:** If a cell has the same color as its right neighbor and is not the background color, merge them.
3. **Fill Cells:**  Fill the merged cells with their common color (`fill`).

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    j = 0
    while j < len(I[0]) - 1:
      if I[i][j] == I[i][j + 1] and I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        start_j = j
        while j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j] == I[i][j + 1]:
          j += 1
        O = fill(O, I[i][start_j], {(i, k) for k in range(start_j, j + 1)}) 
      j += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate & Find Starting Point:** Loop through each row, finding the starting cell of a potential horizontal object.
2. **Extend Object:** Continue iterating to determine the object's end.
3. **Fill Object:** Fill the entire object area with its color. 


**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    left_bound = leftmost(obj)
    right_bound = rightmost(obj)
    for other_obj in objs:
      if other_obj != obj and hmatching(obj, other_obj) and color(obj) == color(other_obj):
        if leftmost(other_obj) < left_bound:
          left_bound = leftmost(other_obj)
        if rightmost(other_obj) > right_bound:
          right_bound = rightmost(other_obj)
    O = fill(O, color(obj), {(uppermost(obj), j) for j in range(left_bound, right_bound + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find all objects in the grid.
2. **Calculate Merged Boundaries:**  For each object, find its leftmost and rightmost boundaries after merging.
3. **Draw Merged Objects:** Fill the calculated area on the output grid with the object's color.

These five versions offer different approaches to achieve the desired transformation.  Each version highlights a different way of thinking about and manipulating the grid data using the DSL functions.
