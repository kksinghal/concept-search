## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to identify the primary object (the one different from the background color 0) and extends it either horizontally or vertically, creating a contiguous line of its color. 

**Input 0:** The primary object (color 8) is extended horizontally to the right from its leftmost point.

**Input 1:** The primary object (color 8) is extended vertically downwards from its topmost point.

**Input 2:** The primary object (color 8) is extended vertically downwards from its topmost point.


## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = next((c for c, _ in asobject(I) if c != 0), 0)
  obj = objects(I, True, False, True)[0]
  if width(obj) >= height(obj):
    start_j = leftmost(obj)
    filled = fill(I, target_color, product(range(height(I)), range(start_j, width(I))))
  else:
    start_i = uppermost(obj)
    filled = fill(I, target_color, product(range(start_i, height(I)), range(width(I))))
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Color:** Find the first non-zero color in the grid, assuming it's the target color.
2. **Identify Primary Object:** Extract the primary object (different from background).
3. **Determine Extension Direction:** If the object is wider than tall, extend horizontally; otherwise, extend vertically.
4. **Fill Grid:** Fill the grid with the target color, starting from the object's leftmost point for horizontal extension or topmost point for vertical extension.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = leastcolor(I) if mostcolor(I) == 0 else mostcommon(I)
  obj = next((obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)), frozenset())
  if width(obj) >= height(obj):
    filled = fill(I, target_color, {(i, j) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(leftmost(obj), width(I))})
  else:
    filled = fill(I, target_color, {(i, j) for j in range(width(I)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), height(I))})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Color:** Determine the target color based on the grid's most common color (excluding background).
2. **Get Primary Object:** Extract the primary object from the grid.
3. **Choose Extension Direction:** Extend horizontally if the object is wider, vertically if taller.
4. **Fill Grid:** Fill the grid with the target color, extending from the object's leftmost or topmost point based on the chosen direction.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = next((obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if len(obj) > 1), frozenset())
  target_color = color(obj)
  h_extension = width(obj) >= height(obj)
  filled = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if (h_extension and j >= leftmost(obj)) or (not h_extension and i >= uppermost(obj)):
        filled = fill(filled, target_color, {(i, j)})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Non-Background Object:** Locate the object with more than one cell, assuming it's not background.
2. **Get Object Color:** Extract the object's color.
3. **Determine Extension:** Decide whether to extend horizontally or vertically based on the object's dimensions.
4. **Iterate and Fill:** Go through each grid cell, filling it with the target color if it meets the horizontal or vertical extension conditions.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = objects(I, True, False, True)[0]
  target_color = color(obj)
  horizontal = width(obj) >= height(obj)
  filled = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if (horizontal and j >= leftmost(obj)) or (not horizontal and i >= uppermost(obj)):
        filled = fill(filled, target_color, {(i, j)})
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Primary Object:**  Extract the primary object from the grid.
2. **Get Object Color:** Extract the color of the primary object.
3. **Decide Extension Direction:** Determine if the extension should be horizontal or vertical based on the object's dimensions.
4. **Iterate and Fill:** Go through each cell in the grid, filling it with the object's color if the cell's position satisfies the extension condition (horizontal or vertical).


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = next((c for c, _ in asobject(I) if c != 0), 0)
  obj = objects(I, True, False, True)[0]
  direction = RIGHT if width(obj) >= height(obj) else DOWN
  start = ulcorner(obj)
  current = start
  filled = I
  while contained(current, backdrop(asindices(I))):
    filled = fill(filled, target_color, {current})
    current = add(current, direction)
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Color:** Find the first non-zero color, assuming it's the target.
2. **Identify Primary Object:**  Extract the primary object from the grid.
3. **Determine Direction:**  Choose horizontal (RIGHT) or vertical (DOWN) extension based on the object's dimensions.
4. **Iterate and Fill:** Starting from the object's top-left corner, repeatedly fill the current cell with the target color and move to the next cell in the chosen direction until reaching the grid's boundary.

These are five distinct programs, each with a slightly different approach to solving the task. They all achieve the same output for the provided inputs.
