## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending the non-background colored objects vertically and horizontally to connect with other objects of the same color. The extension follows these rules:

**Horizontal Extension:**
- If two or more objects of the same color share the same row (horizontally aligned), they are connected by extending their boundaries to form a single continuous object in that row.

**Vertical Extension:**
-  Each non-background colored cell extends downwards to create a continuous vertical line until it reaches another object of the same color or the bottom of the grid.

## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != mostcolor(I):
        line = shoot((i, j), DOWN)
        for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
          line = line - toindices(obj) if color(obj) != val else line
        O = fill(O, val, line)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Starts with the input grid `I` and creates a copy `O`. 
2. **Iteration:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`.
3. **Non-Background Check:** If a cell is not the background color:
    -  `line`:  A vertical line is drawn downwards from the cell's position using `shoot` function.
    -  `Collision Detection`: This line is then iteratively subtracted by the indices of all objects of different colors than the current cell. This ensures the line doesn't extend through those objects.
    -  `Filling`: The remaining line is filled with the current cell's color in the output grid `O`.
4. **Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, leftmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), height(I))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas `O` of the same size as the input grid, filled with the background color.
2. **Object Iteration:**  Iterates through each object in the input grid.
3. **Object Painting:**  Paints the current object onto the canvas `O`.
4. **Vertical Extension:** Draws a vertical line from the top of the object to the bottom of the grid, at the column index of the object's leftmost cell. This line is filled with the object's color, effectively extending it downwards.
5. **Output:** Returns the modified canvas `O`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    current_color = None
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        if current_color is None:
          current_color = I[i][j]
        O = fill(O, current_color, {(k, j) for k in range(i, height(I))})
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Starts with the input grid `I` and creates a copy `O`.
2. **Column Iteration:** Iterates through each column of the grid.
3. **Color Tracking:**  Keeps track of the current non-background color (`current_color`) encountered in the column.
4. **Vertical Filling:** 
   - When a non-background color is found:
      - If it's the first non-background color in the column, it's stored as `current_color`.
      - A vertical line is drawn from the current cell's row index to the bottom of the grid at the current column index, and filled with `current_color`.
5. **Output:** Returns the modified grid `O`.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), height(I)):
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Starts with the input grid `I` and creates a copy `O`.
2. **Object Iteration:**  Iterates through each object in the input grid.
3. **Row Filling:** For each row from the object's topmost row to the bottom of the grid:
   - Fills a horizontal line with the object's color, spanning from the object's leftmost to rightmost column indices. This effectively extends the object both vertically and horizontally to connect with other objects of the same color. 
4. **Output:** Returns the modified grid `O`.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    connected = False
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(k, j) for k in range(i, height(I))})
        if not connected:
          O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, k) for k in range(width(I))})
          connected = True
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas `O` of the same size as the input grid, filled with the background color.
2. **Column Iteration:**  Iterates through each column of the input grid.
3. **Connection Flag:** Uses a flag `connected` to track if a horizontal connection has been made for the current object.
4. **Vertical and Horizontal Filling:**
   - When a non-background color is encountered:
      - Draws a vertical line from the current cell downwards, filling with the cell's color.
      - If `connected` is False (meaning a horizontal connection hasn't been made yet):
         - Draws a horizontal line across the entire row at the current cell's row index, filling with the cell's color.
         - Sets `connected` to True to avoid further horizontal connections for the same object.
5. **Output:** Returns the modified canvas `O`.
