## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to connect non-background colored digits in each column to the closest edge of the grid while preserving their original color. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- Each '8' in a column is connected horizontally to the closest grid edge using a line of '8's.
- Digits closer to the right edge connect to the right edge, and those closer to the left connect to the left.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- Same logic as Input_0 to Output_0 applies.
- Note how the single '8's in columns remain unchanged.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

-  The same principle of connecting to the nearest edge is maintained.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        if j < width(I) // 2:
          O = fill(O, I[i][j], connect((i, j), (i, 0)))
        else:
          O = fill(O, I[i][j], connect((i, j), (i, width(I)-1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns:**  The outer loop iterates through each column (`j`) of the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate through rows:** The inner loop iterates through each row (`i`) within the current column.
3. **Check for non-background color:** If the current cell's color is not the background color, it proceeds.
4. **Determine closest edge:** If the cell is in the left half of the grid, it connects to the left edge (column 0). Otherwise, it connects to the right edge (column `width(I)-1`).
5. **Connect to the edge:**  The `connect` function draws a line with the cell's color from its position to the chosen edge.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) 
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    start_i, start_j = first(toindices(obj))
    target_j = 0 if start_j < width(I) // 2 else width(I) - 1
    O = fill(O, color(obj), connect((start_i, start_j), (start_i, target_j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create blank canvas:**  Starts with a blank canvas (`O`) filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate through objects:** Uses `objects` to iterate through each non-background color object.
3. **Get object details:** Extracts the starting row (`start_i`), starting column (`start_j`), and color of the object.
4. **Determine closest edge:**  Identifies the target column (`target_j`) based on the object's starting column.
5. **Draw the connection:**  Uses `fill` and `connect` to draw a line of the object's color from its starting point to the target edge.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    column = frozenset((I[i][j], (i, j)) for i in range(height(I)))
    for cell in column:
      if cell[0] != mostcolor(I):
        start_i = cell[1][0]
        target_j = 0 if j < width(I) // 2 else width(I) - 1
        O = fill(O, cell[0], connect((start_i, j), (start_i, target_j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns:** Iterates through each column (`j`) of the input grid.
2. **Create column representation:** Creates a `frozenset` representing the current column, storing color and index information for each cell.
3. **Iterate through cells in the column:**  Iterates through each `cell` in the current column representation.
4. **Check for non-background color:** If the cell's color is not the background, it proceeds.
5. **Determine closest edge:** Calculates the target column (`target_j`) based on the current column's position.
6. **Connect to the edge:** Draws a line of the cell's color from its position to the chosen edge.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    direction = -1 if leftmost(obj) < width(I) // 2 else 1 
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      O = fill(O, color(obj), connect((i, j), (i, j + direction * (width(I) - 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** Iterates through non-background color objects using `objects`.
2. **Determine connection direction:**  Determines the direction (`direction`) to connect based on whether the object is closer to the left or right edge.
3. **Iterate through object cells:**  Iterates through each cell (`i`, `j`) within the current object.
4. **Connect to the edge:** Draws a line of the object's color from the cell's position towards the determined edge.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        target_j = 0 if j < width(I) // 2 else width(I) - 1
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, k) for k in range(min(j, target_j), max(j, target_j) + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create blank canvas:** Creates a canvas (`O`) filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate through cells:**  Iterates through each cell (`i`, `j`) in the input grid.
3. **Check for non-background color:**  If the cell is not the background color, it proceeds.
4. **Determine closest edge:**  Calculates the target column (`target_j`) based on the cell's position.
5. **Connect to the edge:** Directly fills all cells between the current cell and the target edge with the cell's color using set comprehension.
