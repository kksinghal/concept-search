## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation connects all instances of the least common color within each row. This effectively creates horizontal lines of that color extending between the leftmost and rightmost occurrences in each row.

**Example:**

In Input_0:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0
```

The least common color is '8'. The transformation creates horizontal lines of '8's connecting the existing '8's in each row, resulting in Output_0:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0
```


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = leastcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, False, False, False)
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, target_color)
  filled_rows = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((i, j) for _, (i, j) in obj for j in range(width(I)) if i == uppermost(obj)), target_objs)
  O = paint(I, recolor(target_color, filled_rows))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`target_color = leastcolor(I)`:**  Identifies the least frequent color in the grid.
2. **`objs = objects(I, False, False, False)`:**  Extracts all objects from the grid, regardless of color or shape.
3. **`target_objs = colorfilter(objs, target_color)`:** Filters the objects to retain only those containing the target color.
4. **`filled_rows = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((i, j) for _, (i, j) in obj for j in range(width(I)) if i == uppermost(obj)), target_objs)`:** This line generates the horizontal lines. For each object with the target color, it identifies its uppermost row (using `uppermost(obj)`). Then, for every column within that row, it creates a set of indices (`(i, j)`) representing the entire row. Finally, it merges these sets across all objects, effectively creating horizontal lines of the target color.
5. **`O = paint(I, recolor(target_color, filled_rows))`:**  Paints the identified indices (`filled_rows`) with the target color on the input grid.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = leastcolor(I)
  rows = vsplit(I, height(I))
  modified_rows = apply(lambda row: tuple(target_color if target_color in r else v for r in row for v in r), rows)
  O = vconcat(*modified_rows)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`target_color = leastcolor(I)`:**  Identifies the least frequent color in the grid.
2. **`rows = vsplit(I, height(I))`:** Splits the grid into individual rows.
3. **`modified_rows = apply(lambda row: tuple(target_color if target_color in r else v for r in row for v in r), rows)`:** Iterates through each row. If the target color exists in the row, it replaces the entire row with the target color. Otherwise, it retains the original row.
4. **`O = vconcat(*modified_rows)`:** Concatenates the modified rows vertically to reconstruct the output grid.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = leastcolor(I)
  O = tuple(
    tuple(target_color if any(v == target_color for v in r) else v for v in r) for r in I
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`target_color = leastcolor(I)`:** Identifies the least common color in the input grid.
2.  The code iterates through each row (`r`) of the input grid (`I`).
3.  For each row, it checks if the target color (`target_color`) exists within the row using `any(v == target_color for v in r)`.
4.  If the target color is present in the row, the entire row is filled with the target color. 
5.  If the target color is not present, the row remains unchanged.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = leastcolor(I)
  painted_grid = canvas(target_color, shape(I))
  O = cellwise(painted_grid, I, ZERO)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`target_color = leastcolor(I)`:**  Finds the least common color in the input grid (`I`).
2. **`painted_grid = canvas(target_color, shape(I))`:** Creates a new grid (`painted_grid`) with the same dimensions as the input grid (`I`) and fills it entirely with the `target_color`.
3. **`O = cellwise(painted_grid, I, ZERO)`:**  Performs a cell-by-cell comparison between `painted_grid` and the input grid (`I`). If the values at a specific cell match, the value from `painted_grid` (which is `target_color`) is retained. If the values don't match, the cell is filled with `ZERO`.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = leastcolor(I)
  O = tuple(
      tuple(branch(target_color in row, target_color, v) for v in row) 
      for row in I
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`target_color = leastcolor(I)`:** Determines the least frequent color in the grid.
2. The code iterates through each row (`row`) in the input grid (`I`).
3. Within each row, it iterates through each value (`v`).
4. For each value, it uses the `branch` function to decide what the output value should be. The condition is `target_color in row`.
    - If the `target_color` is present anywhere in the current row, the output value for this cell will be the `target_color`.
    - If the `target_color` is not present in the row, the output value for this cell will be the original value (`v`). 
5.  This process essentially creates horizontal lines of the `target_color` connecting any existing instances of that color within each row, while leaving other cells unchanged.
