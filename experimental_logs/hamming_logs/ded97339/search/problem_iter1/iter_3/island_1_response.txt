## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same color) and extending them either horizontally or vertically until they hit another object or the grid border. The direction of extension depends on the object's initial position:

* **Input_0:** Objects extend horizontally to the right.
* **Input_1:** Objects extend vertically downwards.
* **Input_2:**  Objects extend vertically downwards.

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    direction = (1, 0) if portrait(I) else (0, 1)
    for step in range(1, 10):
      shifted_obj = shift(obj, multiply(step, direction))
      if len(intersection(toindices(shifted_obj), asindices(I))) != len(obj):
        break
      O = paint(O, shifted_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, F)` extracts objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Determine Extension Direction:** `direction` is set to `(1, 0)` (downwards) if the grid is taller than it is wide (`portrait(I)`) and `(0, 1)` (rightwards) otherwise.
3. **Iterate and Extend:** For each object, the code iterates up to 9 steps in the determined direction.
4. **Check for Collision:** In each step, it checks if the shifted object overlaps with any existing non-background cells using `intersection` and `asindices`.
5. **Paint Extended Object:** If no collision occurs, the shifted object is painted onto the output grid `O`.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(len(I)):
      for j in range(len(I[0])):
        if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
          if portrait(I):
            O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(k, j) for k in range(i, len(I))})
          else:
            O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, k) for k in range(j, len(I[0]))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** The code iterates over each cell of the input grid.
2. **Check for Non-Background Color:** If a cell doesn't have the background color, it proceeds.
3. **Determine Extension Direction:** It checks if the grid is a portrait or landscape using `portrait(I)`.
4. **Fill Cells:** Based on the direction, it fills the cells either vertically downwards or horizontally to the right from the current cell's position using `fill` function.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objs:
      ul = ulcorner(obj)
      if portrait(I):
        O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, ul[1])) for i in range(ul[0], len(I))})
      else:
        O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (ul[0], j)) for j in range(ul[1], len(I[0]))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` extracts objects from the grid.
2. **Create Empty Canvas:** An empty canvas `O` is created with the same size and background color as the input grid.
3. **Iterate through Objects:** The code iterates over each extracted object.
4. **Determine Upper-Left Corner and Direction:** For each object, it gets the upper-left corner using `ulcorner(obj)` and determines the extension direction (vertical or horizontal). 
5. **Paint Extended Object:** It then paints the object onto the canvas `O`, extending it in the determined direction until the edge of the grid.


### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  direction = DOWN if portrait(I) else RIGHT
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        k = 1
        while True:
          new_i, new_j = add((i, j), multiply(k, direction))
          if new_i >= len(I) or new_j >= len(I[0]) or index(I, (new_i, new_j)) != mostcolor(I):
            break
          O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(new_i, new_j)})
          k += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Determine Extension Direction:** `direction` is set to `DOWN` for portrait grids and `RIGHT` for landscape grids.
2. **Iterate through Cells:**  It iterates over each cell in the input grid `I`.
3. **Check for Non-Background Color:** If a cell isn't the background color, it enters the extension loop.
4. **Extend in the Direction:**  The loop continues as long as the next cell in the `direction` is within the grid boundaries and has the background color.
5. **Fill Cell:**  If the conditions are met, it fills the next cell with the current cell's color.


### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if portrait(I):
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), len(I)):
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)})
    else:
      for j in range(leftmost(obj), len(I[0])):
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` is used to extract all objects from the input grid.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** The code iterates through each identified object.
3. **Determine Extension Direction and Fill:**  For each object, it determines the direction based on the grid orientation using `portrait(I)`. It then iterates in that direction and fills the corresponding row or column with the object's color using the `fill` function, effectively extending the object.


These five program versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation, leveraging different DSL functions and logic.
