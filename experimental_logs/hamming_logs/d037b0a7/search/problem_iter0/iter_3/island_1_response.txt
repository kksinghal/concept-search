## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending the colors of non-background objects downwards to the bottom of the grid. However, the extension only occurs if the cell below the object is also a background color. 

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

**Input 0:**

* The object with color '4' extends downwards to fill the background cell below it.
* The object with color '3' also extends downwards.

**Input 1:**

* The object with color '7' extends downwards to fill the background cells below it. 

**Input 2:**

* The object with color '4' extends downwards to fill the background cells below it. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1:** (Iterative Approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for i in range(height(I) - 1):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and I[i+1][j] == mostcolor(I):
        I = fill(I, I[i][j], {(k, j) for k in range(i + 1, height(I))})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** Loop through each row of the grid except the last one.
2. **Iterate through columns:** For each row, loop through all the columns.
3. **Check for object and background:** Check if the current cell is part of an object (not the background color) and the cell below it is a background color.
4. **Extend color downwards:** If the condition is true, fill the cells below with the object's color using `fill`.

**Version 2:** (Functional Approach with `apply`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_color(j):
    for i in range(height(I) - 1):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and I[i+1][j] == mostcolor(I):
        return fill(I, I[i][j], {(k, j) for k in range(i + 1, height(I))})
    return I
  return apply(extend_color, range(width(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `extend_color`:** This function takes a column index `j` and extends the color downwards in that column if needed.
2. **Apply to each column:** Apply `extend_color` to each column index using `apply`. 

**Version 3:** (Object-Based Approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  for obj in objs:
    bottom_row = lowermost(obj)
    for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1):
      if bottom_row < height(I) - 1 and I[bottom_row + 1][j] == mostcolor(I):
        I = fill(I, color(obj), {(k, j) for k in range(bottom_row + 1, height(I))})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get objects:** Identify all non-background objects using `fgpartition`.
2. **Iterate through objects:** For each object:
    * Find the bottom row.
    * Iterate through columns within the object's width.
    * Extend the color downwards if the cell below is background.

**Version 4:** (Using `shift` and Cell-wise comparison)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grid = shift(asobject(I), (1, 0))
  return cellwise(
      I, 
      paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), shifted_grid), 
      I[0][0] # Doesn't matter, overwritten anyway
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift grid down:** Shift the entire grid downwards by one row.
2. **Create a blank canvas:** Create a new grid filled with the background color.
3. **Paint shifted grid:** Paint the shifted grid onto the blank canvas. This effectively moves all objects down by one row.
4. **Cell-wise comparison:** Compare the original grid with the shifted grid using `cellwise`. If the cell in the original grid is a background color, use the corresponding cell from the shifted grid (which might contain the object's color).

**Version 5:** (Recursive Approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_downwards(grid, row):
    if row == height(grid) - 1:
      return grid
    for j in range(width(grid)):
      if grid[row][j] != mostcolor(grid) and grid[row+1][j] == mostcolor(grid):
        grid = fill(grid, grid[row][j], {(k, j) for k in range(row + 1, height(grid))})
    return extend_downwards(grid, row + 1)
  return extend_downwards(I, 0)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `extend_downwards`:** This recursive function takes the grid and the current row as input. 
2. **Base case:** If the current row is the last row, return the grid.
3. **Recursive step:** Otherwise, extend colors downwards in the current row and call `extend_downwards` for the next row.
