## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to identify an object based on color difference from its surrounding cells and extends that object downwards to the bottom of the grid. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
* The object with color '4' is extended downwards.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
* The object with color '7' is extended downwards.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
* The object with color '4' is extended downwards.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # 1. Identify objects different from their surroundings
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T) 
  # 2. Choose the first object (assuming only one such object exists)
  x2 = first(x1)
  # 3. Get the object's color
  x3 = color(x2) 
  # 4. Get the column index of the leftmost cell in the object
  x4 = leftmost(x2) 
  # 5. Create a vertical line from below the object to the bottom of the grid
  x5 = interval(lowermost(x2) + 1, height(I), 1) 
  x6 = apply(tojvec, x5) 
  x7 = mapply(rbind(astuple, x4), x6)
  # 6. Combine original object indices and extension line indices
  x8 = combine(toindices(x2), x7)
  # 7. Fill the grid with the object's color at combined indices
  O = fill(I, x3, x8) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. We identify objects different from their surroundings.
2. Assuming one such object, we get its color and leftmost cell's column index.
3. We create a vertical line of indices from below the object to the grid's bottom.
4. We combine the object and extension line indices.
5. We fill the grid with the object's color at the combined indices.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # 1. Identify objects with a different color than the most frequent one
  x1 = fgpartition(I)
  # 2. Select the first object 
  x2 = first(x1)
  # 3. Determine the object's color
  x3 = color(x2)
  # 4. Get the column indices where the object is present
  x4 = apply(lambda x: x[1][1], x2)
  # 5. Create vertical lines from below the object to the grid bottom for each column
  x5 = apply(lambda j: frozenset((i, j) for i in range(lowermost(x2) + 1, height(I))), x4)
  # 6. Combine the object and all extension lines
  x6 = combine(toindices(x2), merge(x5))
  # 7. Fill the grid with the object's color at combined indices
  O = fill(I, x3, x6) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identify objects that are not the background color.
2. Select the first object and determine its color.
3. Get the column indices where the object exists.
4. For each of those columns, create a vertical line of indices extending downwards from the object's bottom edge to the grid's bottom edge.
5. Combine all these lines with the original object's indices.
6. Fill the grid with the object's color at the combined indices.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # 1. Partition the grid into objects
  x1 = fgpartition(I)
  # 2. Find the object with a different color than the most frequent one
  x2 = extract(x1, lambda obj: color(obj) != mostcolor(I))
  # 3. Get the object's color
  x3 = color(x2)
  # 4. Create a rectangular patch from below the object to the bottom of the grid
  x4 = astuple(lowermost(x2) + 1, height(I))
  x5 = astuple(leftmost(x2), rightmost(x2) + 1)
  x6 = product(interval(x4[0], x4[1]), interval(x5[0], x5[1]))
  # 5. Combine object indices and rectangle indices
  x7 = combine(toindices(x2), x6)
  # 6. Fill the grid with the object's color at the combined indices
  O = fill(I, x3, x7)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. Divide the input grid into objects based on color.
2. Identify the object that is not the background color.
3. Determine the object's color.
4. Calculate the boundaries of a rectangle extending from below the object to the grid's bottom and covering the object's width.
5. Combine the indices of the object and the rectangle.
6. Fill the grid with the object's color at the combined indices. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # 1. Identify objects different from their surroundings
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  # 2. Choose the first object (assuming only one such object exists)
  x2 = first(x1)
  # 3. Get the object's color
  x3 = color(x2)
  # 4. Get the bounding box of the object
  x4 = backdrop(x2)
  # 5.  Get the indices below the object within the bounding box
  x5 = sfilter(x4, lambda loc: loc[0] > lowermost(x2))
  # 6. Combine the object indices and the indices below
  x6 = combine(toindices(x2), x5)
  # 7. Fill the grid with the object's color at the combined indices
  O = fill(I, x3, x6)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identify objects that are not the background color.
2. Select the first object and determine its color.
3. Calculate the bounding box encompassing the object.
4. Identify indices within the bounding box that are below the object.
5. Combine the object's indices with the indices below it.
6. Fill the grid with the object's color at the combined indices.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # 1. Find the row index of the upper most cell that is not the background color
  x1 = extract(enumerate(I), lambda row: row[1] != repeat(mostcommon(I), width(I))).index
  # 2. Get the indices of all cells below that row index
  x2 = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(x1 + 1, height(I)) for j in range(width(I)))
  # 3. Fill those indices with the color of the cell at (x1, 0)
  O = fill(I, I[x1][0], x2) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Find the first row from the top that isn't entirely the background color.
2. Collect the indices of all cells below that row.
3. Fill the collected cells with the color of the first cell in the identified row.
