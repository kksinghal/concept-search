## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking the leftmost object (excluding the background color) in the input grid and extending its color downwards to fill the grid below it.

**Example:**

Input_0:
```
0 0 6
0 4 0
3 0 0 
```

Output_0:
```
0 0 6
0 4 6
3 4 6
```

Here, the leftmost object (excluding background color 0) is the digit '4'. The transformation fills the grid below it with the color '4'.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_0a938d79(I):
    # Find the leftmost non-background object
    obj = first(objects(I, True, False, True))
  
    # Get object's color 
    color = first(obj)[0]

    # Fill downwards from the leftmost column of the object
    O = I
    for i in range(height(I)):
        if index(I, (i, leftmost(obj))) == color:
            for k in range(i, height(I)):
                O = fill(O, color, {(k, leftmost(obj))})
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the leftmost object:** Uses `objects(I, True, False, True)` to identify distinct objects, `first` to select the leftmost one, and stores it in `obj`.
2. **Get object's color:** Extracts the color of the object using `first(obj)[0]` and stores it in `color`.
3. **Fill downwards:** Iterates through each row (`i`) of the grid. If the cell at the leftmost column of the object (`(i, leftmost(obj))`) has the object's `color`, it fills downwards from that cell to the bottom of the grid using `fill`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_0a938d79(I):
  # Identify the leftmost object using its color
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, True))
  color = first(obj)[0]

  # Create a vertical line spanning the grid's height at the object's leftmost column
  fill_line = frozenset({(i, leftmost(obj)) for i in range(height(I))})

  # Fill the grid with the object's color at the created line's indices
  O = fill(I, color, fill_line)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify object and color:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Create vertical line:** Generates a set of indices representing a vertical line (`fill_line`) that spans the grid's height and is positioned at the object's leftmost column.
3. **Fill the line:** Uses `fill` to color the cells at the indices in `fill_line` with the object's `color`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_0a938d79(I):
    # Find the leftmost non-background object
    obj = first(objects(I, True, False, True))
    
    # Get object's color and leftmost column index
    color = first(obj)[0]
    left_j = leftmost(obj)
    
    # Generate a vertical line object representing the fill area
    fill_obj = frozenset((color, (i, left_j)) for i in range(height(I)))
    
    # Paint the grid with the generated fill object
    O = paint(I, fill_obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify object and extract information:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Generate fill object:** Creates a new object (`fill_obj`) representing a vertical line with the desired `color` at the object's leftmost column, spanning the entire grid height.
3. **Paint with fill object:** Utilizes `paint` to directly apply the `fill_obj` onto the input grid (`I`), effectively filling the area below the object.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_0a938d79(I):
  # Get the leftmost column of the grid
  left_column = tuple(I[i][0] for i in range(height(I)))
  
  # Find the first non-background color in the leftmost column
  fill_color = next((color for color in left_column if color != mostcommon(I)), None)
  
  # Fill the grid downwards from the first occurrence of the fill color
  O = I
  for i, color in enumerate(left_column):
    if color == fill_color:
      O = fill(O, fill_color, {(k, 0) for k in range(i, height(I))})
      break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract leftmost column:**  Gets the leftmost column of the grid and stores it as `left_column`.
2. **Find fill color:**  Iterates through `left_column` to find the first color different from the background color (`mostcommon(I)`) and stores it as `fill_color`.
3. **Fill downwards:** Similar to Version 1, but uses `fill_color` and focuses on the leftmost column (`(k, 0)`).


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_0a938d79(I):
    # Directly modify the input grid (for efficiency)
    for j in range(width(I)):
        # Iterate through each column
        for i in range(1, height(I)):
            # If the current cell is background color
            if I[i][j] == mostcommon(I):
                # Fill downwards with the color from the cell above
                I = fill(I, I[i-1][j], {(k, j) for k in range(i, height(I))})
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns:** Iterates through each column (`j`) of the grid.
2. **Fill downwards from non-background:** For each cell in the column (starting from the second row), if the cell's color is the background color (`mostcommon(I)`), it fills downwards with the color of the cell directly above it (`I[i-1][j]`). This effectively extends the color of any non-background cell downwards.

These are five distinct program versions that utilize different logic and DSL functions to achieve the same transformation. Each version offers a unique approach to solving the problem, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
