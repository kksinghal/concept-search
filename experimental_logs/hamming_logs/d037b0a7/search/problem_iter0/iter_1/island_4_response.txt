## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve extending the color of the bottom-right object to the left and upward, filling the bottom row and rightmost column with it.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The bottom-right object (color '6') extends leftward and upward, filling the bottom row and rightmost column. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The bottom-right object (color '8') extends leftward and upward, filling the bottom row and rightmost column.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The bottom-right object (color '0') extends leftward and upward, filling the bottom row and rightmost column.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    # 1. Get the color of the bottom-right cell.
    x1 = I[len(I)-1][len(I[0])-1]
    # 2. Create a patch for the bottom row.
    x2 = backdrop(toindices({(0, (len(I)-1, 0))}))
    x3 = lambda loc: loc[0] == len(I)-1
    x4 = sfilter(x2, x3)
    # 3. Create a patch for the rightmost column.
    x5 = backdrop(toindices({(0, (0, len(I[0])-1))}))
    x6 = lambda loc: loc[1] == len(I[0])-1
    x7 = sfilter(x5, x6)
    # 4. Combine the two patches.
    x8 = combine(x4, x7)
    # 5. Fill the combined patch with the extracted color.
    O = fill(I, x1, x8)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Extract the color of the bottom-right cell.
2. Create a patch covering the entire bottom row.
3. Create a patch covering the entire rightmost column.
4. Combine the two patches.
5. Fill the combined patch with the extracted color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # 1. Identify the bottom-right object.
  x1 = fgpartition(I)
  x2 = lambda obj: lrcorner(obj) == (len(I)-1, len(I[0])-1)
  x3 = extract(x1, x2)
  # 2. Get the object's color.
  x4 = color(x3)
  # 3. Extend the object horizontally to the left.
  x5 = (0, -42)
  x6 = shift(toindices(x3), x5)
  x7 = connect(lrcorner(x3), first(x6))
  # 4. Extend the object vertically upwards.
  x8 = (-42, 0)
  x9 = shift(toindices(x3), x8)
  x10 = connect(lrcorner(x3), first(x9))
  # 5. Combine the extensions with the original object's indices.
  x11 = combine(x7, x10)
  x12 = combine(x11, toindices(x3))
  # 6. Fill the combined area with the object's color.
  O = fill(I, x4, x12)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identify the bottom-right object using `fgpartition` and `lrcorner`.
2. Extract the object's color.
3. Shift the object's indices far to the left and connect the corner to the shifted point creating a horizontal line.
4. Shift the object's indices far upwards and connect the corner to the shifted point creating a vertical line.
5. Combine the horizontal and vertical lines with the original object's indices.
6. Fill the combined area with the object's color.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # 1. Find the color of the bottom-right cell.
  x1 = I[len(I)-1][len(I[0])-1]
  # 2. Fill the bottom row with the color.
  x2 = canvas(x1, (1, len(I[0])))
  x3 = vconcat(crop(I, (0, 0), (len(I)-1, len(I[0]))), x2)
  # 3. Fill the rightmost column with the color.
  x4 = canvas(x1, (len(x3), 1))
  O = hconcat(crop(x3, (0, 0), (len(x3), len(x3[0])-1)), x4)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Extract the color of the bottom-right cell.
2. Create a new row filled with the extracted color and concatenate it to the input grid, replacing the bottom row.
3. Create a new column filled with the extracted color and concatenate it to the right of the modified grid, filling the rightmost column.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # 1. Get the bottom-right corner color.
  x1 = I[len(I)-1][len(I[0])-1]
  # 2. Create a patch covering the entire grid.
  x2 = canvas(0, shape(I))
  x3 = backdrop(asindices(x2))
  # 4. Remove the top row and leftmost column from the patch.
  x4 = lambda loc: loc[0] == 0 or loc[1] == 0
  x5 = sfilter(x3, x4)
  x6 = difference(x3, x5)
  # 5. Fill the remaining area with the extracted color.
  O = fill(I, x1, x6)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Extract the color of the bottom-right cell.
2. Create a patch covering the entire grid.
3. Identify the indices of the top row and leftmost column.
4. Remove the top row and leftmost column indices from the full grid patch.
5. Fill the remaining area (bottom row and rightmost column) with the extracted color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # 1. Identify the bottom-right object.
  x1 = fgpartition(I)
  x2 = lambda obj: lrcorner(obj) == (len(I)-1, len(I[0])-1)
  x3 = extract(x1, x2)
  # 2. Get the object's color.
  x4 = color(x3)
  # 3. Create a patch covering the bottom row and rightmost column.
  x5 = {(len(I)-1, j) for j in range(len(I[0]))}
  x6 = {(i, len(I[0])-1) for i in range(len(I))}
  x7 = combine(x5, x6)
  # 4. Fill the combined area with the object's color.
  O = fill(I, x4, x7)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identify the bottom-right object using `fgpartition` and `lrcorner`.
2. Extract the object's color.
3. Generate a patch directly covering the bottom row and rightmost column indices.
4. Fill the combined area with the object's color.
