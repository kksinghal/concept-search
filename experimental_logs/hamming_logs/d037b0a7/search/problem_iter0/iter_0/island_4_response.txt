## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on expanding the colors of objects located in the bottom-right corner of the grid to fill their respective rows and columns. 

* **Input 0:** The '6' at the bottom-right expands leftwards and upwards, filling its row and column.
* **Input 1:** The '8' expands leftwards and upwards, filling its row and column. 
* **Input 2:** The '0' expands upwards, filling its column.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Identify the objects in the grid, excluding the background.
  x1 = fgpartition(I)
  # 2. Extract the object at the bottom-right corner.
  x2 = lambda obj: lrcorner(obj) == (len(I)-1, len(I[0])-1)
  x3 = extract(x1, x2)
  # 3. Get the color of the bottom-right object.
  x4 = color(x3)
  # 4. Create a patch covering the entire bottom row.
  x5 = backdrop(toindices(x3))
  x6 = lambda loc: loc[0] == len(I)-1
  x7 = sfilter(x5, x6)
  # 5. Create a patch covering the entire rightmost column.
  x8 = lambda loc: loc[1] == len(I[0])-1
  x9 = sfilter(x5, x8)
  # 6. Combine the two patches.
  x10 = combine(x7, x9)
  # 7. Fill the combined patch with the extracted color.
  O = fill(I, x4, x10) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** We start by identifying all distinct objects in the grid, excluding the background, using `fgpartition(I)`.
2. **Extract bottom-right object:** We define a lambda function `x2` to check if an object's lower-right corner matches the grid's lower-right corner. Then, `extract(x1, x2)` retrieves the desired object.
3. **Get object color:** `color(x3)` extracts the color of the bottom-right object.
4. **Create bottom row patch:**  We generate a patch representing the entire bottom row using `backdrop` and `sfilter`.
5. **Create rightmost column patch:**  Similarly, we create a patch representing the rightmost column.
6. **Combine patches:** The two patches are combined using `combine`.
7. **Fill with color:** Finally, we use `fill` to color the combined patch with the extracted object color, achieving the desired transformation.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Get the color of the bottom-right cell.
  x1 = I[len(I)-1][len(I[0])-1]
  # 2. Create a patch for the bottom row.
  x2 = astuple(len(I)-1, 0)
  x3 = astuple(len(I)-1, len(I[0]))
  x4 = connect(x2, x3)
  # 5. Create a patch for the rightmost column.
  x5 = astuple(0, len(I[0])-1)
  x6 = astuple(len(I), len(I[0])-1)
  x7 = connect(x5, x6)
  # 6. Combine the two patches.
  x8 = combine(x4, x7)
  # 7. Fill the combined patch with the extracted color.
  O = fill(I, x1, x8)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get bottom-right color:** We directly access the bottom-right cell's color using `I[len(I)-1][len(I[0])-1]`.
2. **Create bottom row patch:** Using `astuple` and `connect`, we generate a patch representing the entire bottom row.
3. **Create rightmost column patch:** Similarly, we create a patch for the rightmost column.
4. **Combine patches:** The two patches are combined using `combine`.
5. **Fill with color:** Finally, we use `fill` to color the combined patch with the extracted color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Identify the bottom-right corner cell.
  x1 = (len(I)-1, len(I[0])-1) 
  # 2. Get the color at that cell.
  x2 = index(I, x1) 
  # 3. Fill the last row with the extracted color.
  x3 =  fill(I, x2, hfrontier(x1))
  # 4. Fill the last column of the modified grid with the extracted color.
  O = fill(x3, x2, vfrontier(x1)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify corner cell:** We directly define the bottom-right corner cell's coordinates.
2. **Get cell color:** We use `index` to extract the color at the corner cell.
3. **Fill bottom row:** `hfrontier` is used to create a patch representing the bottom row, which is then filled with the extracted color.
4. **Fill rightmost column:** We use `vfrontier` to create a patch for the rightmost column and fill it with the extracted color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Find locations of the bottom-right color.
  x1 = I[len(I)-1][len(I[0])-1]
  x2 = ofcolor(I, x1)
  # 2. Identify the bottom-right object.
  x3 = lambda obj: lrcorner(obj) == (len(I)-1, len(I[0])-1)
  x4 = extract(x2, x3)
  # 3. Extend the object horizontally to the left.
  x5 = (0, -42)
  x6 = shift(x4, x5)
  x7 = connect(x4, x6)
  # 4. Extend the object vertically upwards.
  x8 = (-42, 0)
  x9 = shift(x4, x8)
  x10 = connect(x4, x9)
  # 5. Combine the extensions.
  x11 = combine(x7, x10)
  # 6. Fill the combined area with the object's color.
  O = fill(I, x1, x11)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find color locations:** We identify all cells with the same color as the bottom-right cell.
2. **Identify bottom-right object:**  We extract the specific object located at the bottom-right corner.
3. **Extend horizontally:**  Using `shift` and `connect`, we create a patch extending the object leftwards to the edge of the grid.
4. **Extend vertically:** Similarly, we extend the object upwards.
5. **Combine extensions:** We combine the horizontal and vertical extensions into a single patch.
6. **Fill with color:** Finally, we fill the combined patch with the object's color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
    # 1. Get the color at the bottom-right corner.
    x1 = I[-1][-1] 
    # 2. Create a new grid with the bottom row filled with the extracted color.
    x2 = tuple(tuple(x1 if i == len(I)-1 else v for j, v in enumerate(r)) for i, r in enumerate(I))
    # 3. Further modify the grid to fill the last column with the extracted color.
    O = tuple(tuple(x1 if j == len(I[0])-1 else v for j, v in enumerate(r)) for i, r in enumerate(x2))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get bottom-right color:** Directly access and store the color of the bottom-right cell.
2. **Fill bottom row:** Iterate through the grid, replacing the color of each cell in the last row with the extracted color while preserving others.
3. **Fill rightmost column:** Using the modified grid from the previous step, iterate again and replace the color of each cell in the last column with the extracted color, achieving the desired transformation.

These five versions showcase diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation. Each utilizes a different combination of DSL functions, highlighting the flexibility and power of the provided language.
