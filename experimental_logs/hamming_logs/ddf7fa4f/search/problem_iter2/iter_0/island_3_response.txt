## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to follow these rules:

**General Rule:**
* Identify the second smallest and second largest objects based on the number of cells they occupy.
* Swap the colors of the second smallest and second largest objects.

**Example Breakdowns:**

* **Input 0:** 
    - Second smallest object: Color '2' (3 cells).
    - Second largest object: Color '8' (6 cells).
    - The colors '2' and '8' are swapped.

* **Input 1:**
    - Second smallest object: Color '1' (5 cells).
    - Second largest object: Color '4' (4 cells).
    - The colors '1' and '4' are swapped. 

* **Input 2:**
    - Second smallest object: Color '1' (5 cells).
    - Second largest object: Color '6' (6 cells).
    - The colors '1' and '6' are swapped. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions for the described transformation:


### **Program Version 1**

**Code:**

```python
def solve_1f642eb9(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Get all objects
    sizes = apply(size, objs)  # Get sizes of all objects
    sorted_objs = order(objs, lambda obj: size(obj))  # Sort objects by size
    second_smallest = first(remove(first(sorted_objs), sorted_objs))  # Get the second smallest object
    second_largest = first(remove(last(sorted_objs), sorted_objs))  # Get the second largest object
    color_a = color(second_smallest) 
    color_b = color(second_largest)
    O = replace(I, color_a, color_b)  # Replace color a with b
    O = replace(O, color_b, color_a)  # Replace color b with a
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** It identifies all the distinct objects in the grid using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2.  **Sort by Size:** It sorts these objects based on their size using `order` and `size`.
3.  **Select Second:**  The code extracts the second smallest and second largest objects.
4.  **Swap Colors:**  Finally, it swaps the colors of the selected objects using `replace`.



### **Program Version 2**

**Code:**

```python
def solve_1f642eb9(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    size_obj = astuple(size(argmin(objs, size)), size(argmax(objs, size)))  # Get sizes of the smallest and largest objects
    filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) != size_obj[0] and size(obj) != size_obj[1]) # Filter out objects with the smallest and largest sizes
    sorted_objs = order(filtered_objs, lambda obj: size(obj))  # Sort the remaining objects by size
    second_smallest = first(sorted_objs)  # Get the second smallest object
    second_largest = last(sorted_objs)  # Get the second largest object
    color_a = color(second_smallest)
    color_b = color(second_largest)
    O = replace(I, color_a, color_b)  # Replace color a with b
    O = replace(O, color_b, color_a)  # Replace color b with a
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify and Filter:** Similar to version 1, it identifies all objects. Then, it filters out the smallest and largest objects using `argmin`, `argmax`, and `sfilter`.
2.  **Sort and Select:** It sorts the remaining objects by size and selects the first (second smallest) and last (second largest).
3.  **Swap Colors:** It swaps the colors of the selected objects.


### **Program Version 3**

**Code:**

```python
def solve_1f642eb9(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    sorted_sizes = order(apply(size, objs), lambda x: x)  # Sort sizes of all objects
    second_smallest_size = first(remove(first(sorted_sizes), sorted_sizes))  # Get the size of the second smallest object
    second_largest_size = first(remove(last(sorted_sizes), sorted_sizes))  # Get the size of the second largest object
    second_smallest = extract(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) == second_smallest_size)  # Get the second smallest object
    second_largest = extract(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) == second_largest_size)  # Get the second largest object
    color_a = color(second_smallest)
    color_b = color(second_largest)
    O = replace(I, color_a, color_b)
    O = replace(O, color_b, color_a)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sort Sizes:** It calculates and sorts the sizes of all objects.
2. **Find Target Sizes:** It finds the sizes of the second smallest and second largest objects from the sorted sizes.
3. **Extract by Size:** It extracts the objects matching those target sizes.
4. **Swap Colors:** It swaps the colors of the extracted objects.


### **Program Version 4**

**Code:**

```python
def solve_1f642eb9(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  obj_sizes = tuple((size(obj), obj) for obj in objs)  # Create tuples of (size, object)
  sorted_objs = order(obj_sizes, lambda x: x[0]) # Sort tuples by size
  second_smallest = sorted_objs[1][1]  # Get the second smallest object
  second_largest = sorted_objs[-2][1] # Get the second largest object 
  color_a = color(second_smallest)
  color_b = color(second_largest)
  O = replace(I, color_a, color_b) 
  O = replace(O, color_b, color_a) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Size-Object Pairs:** It creates tuples containing the size and the object itself.
2. **Sort Pairs:** It sorts these tuples based on size.
3. **Direct Access:** It directly accesses the second smallest and second largest objects from the sorted list of tuples.
4. **Swap Colors:** It swaps the colors of the selected objects.


### **Program Version 5**

**Code:**

```python
def solve_1f642eb9(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    objs_without_smallest = remove(argmin(objs, size), objs) # Remove the smallest object 
    objs_without_extremes = remove(argmax(objs_without_smallest, size), objs_without_smallest) # Remove the largest object from the remaining objects
    second_smallest = argmin(objs_without_extremes, size) # Now the smallest object is actually the second smallest 
    second_largest = argmax(objs_without_extremes, size) # Now the largest object is actually the second largest
    color_a = color(second_smallest)
    color_b = color(second_largest)
    O = replace(I, color_a, color_b) 
    O = replace(O, color_b, color_a)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Remove Extremes:** It removes the smallest and then the largest object from the set of objects.
2. **Select New Extremes:**  After removal, the smallest and largest remaining objects are actually the second smallest and second largest.
3.  **Swap Colors:** It swaps the colors of these selected objects. 

All these versions achieve the desired transformation using different approaches within the limitations of the provided DSL.
