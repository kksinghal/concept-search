## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve swapping the positions of two specific objects in the grid while preserving their original shapes. The objects to be swapped are selected based on their color and size, with the background color (most frequent color) remaining unchanged.

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The object with color '2' and the object with color '8' swap positions.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** The object with color '1' and the object with color '4' swap positions.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The object with color '5' and the object with color '7' swap positions.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  obj1 = min([obj for obj in objs if size(obj) > 1], key=lambda obj: (color(obj), ulcorner(obj)[0], ulcorner(obj)[1]))
  obj2 = min([obj for obj in objs if color(obj) != color(obj1) and size(obj) > 1], key=lambda obj: (color(obj), ulcorner(obj)[0], ulcorner(obj)[1]))
  O = paint(cover(I, obj1), recolor(color(obj2), toindices(obj1)))
  O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj1), toindices(obj2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects in the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Select Objects to Swap:** Select the two smallest objects with different colors based on their color value and top-left corner position.
3. **Swap Objects:** 
    - Paint the first object with the background color.
    - Paint the first object's indices with the second object's color.
    - Paint the second object's indices with the first object's color.


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  obj1 = argmin(objs, lambda obj: (color(obj), size(obj)))
  obj2 = argmin([obj for obj in objs if color(obj) != color(obj1)], lambda obj: (color(obj), size(obj)))
  O = I
  for v, (i, j) in obj1:
    O = fill(O, color(obj2), {(i, j)})
  for v, (i, j) in obj2:
    O = fill(O, color(obj1), {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects in the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Select Objects to Swap:** Select the two smallest objects with different colors based on their color value and size.
3. **Swap Objects:**
    - Iterate through each cell of the first object and fill it with the second object's color.
    - Iterate through each cell of the second object and fill it with the first object's color.


### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  obj1 = extract(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)
  obj2 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) != color(obj1) and size(obj) > 1)
  ind1 = toindices(obj1)
  ind2 = toindices(obj2)
  O = fill(I, color(obj2), ind1)
  O = fill(O, color(obj1), ind2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects in the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Select Objects to Swap:** Extract the first two objects found that have a size greater than 1 and different colors.
3. **Swap Objects:**
    - Fill the indices of the first object with the second object's color.
    - Fill the indices of the second object with the first object's color.


### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  obj1, obj2 = sorted(objs, key=lambda obj: (color(obj), size(obj)))[:2]
  temp_color = max(palette(I)) + 1
  O = paint(cover(I, obj1), recolor(temp_color, toindices(obj1)))
  O = paint(cover(O, obj2), recolor(color(obj1), toindices(obj2)))
  O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj2), ofcolor(O, temp_color)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects in the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Select Objects to Swap:** Select the two smallest objects with different colors by sorting all objects based on color and size.
3. **Swap Objects:**
    - Use a temporary color to avoid overwriting during the swap.
    - Paint the first object with the temporary color.
    - Paint the second object with the first object's color.
    - Paint the areas with the temporary color to the second object's color.


### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  color_counts = {}
  for obj in objs:
    c = color(obj)
    if c != mostcommon(I):
      color_counts[c] = color_counts.get(c, 0) + size(obj)
  c1, c2 = sorted(color_counts, key=color_counts.get)[:2]
  O = paint(cover(I, recolor(0, ofcolor(I, c1))), recolor(c2, ofcolor(I, c1)))
  O = paint(O, recolor(c1, ofcolor(I, c2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Count Colors:** Identify all objects and count the occurrences of each color in the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Select Colors to Swap:** Select the two least frequent colors.
3. **Swap Colors:**
    - Paint the areas with the first color to the background color.
    - Paint the areas with the background color to the second color.
    - Paint the areas with the second color to the first color.
