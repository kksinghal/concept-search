## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves swapping the positions of two specific objects while retaining their original shapes and colors. The objects to be swapped are determined based on their color palletes, specifically:

* **Object 1:** The object with the second most frequent color in the input grid.
* **Object 2:** The object with the third most frequent color in the input grid.


### Example Breakdown:

* **Input_0:** The second most frequent color is '2', and the third most frequent color is '6'. Hence, the object formed by '2's is swapped with the object formed by '6's.
* **Input_1:** The second most frequent color is '1', and the third most frequent color is '4'. The objects formed by these colors are swapped.
* **Input_2:**  The second most frequent color is '1', and the third most frequent color is '6'. The corresponding objects are swapped.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the `Program_to_be_generated` in the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_de1cd16c(I):
  # Sort colors by frequency
  palette_sorted = order(palette(I), lambda c: colorcount(I, c))
  # Extract the second and third most frequent colors
  color_b = palette_sorted[1]
  color_c = palette_sorted[2]
  # Create objects based on the extracted colors
  obj_b = objects(replace(I, color_c, 0), True, False, True)
  obj_c = objects(replace(I, color_b, 0), True, False, True)
  # Find the displacement needed to swap the objects
  displacement = subtract(centerofmass(extract(obj_c, identity)), centerofmass(extract(obj_b, identity)))
  # Swap the objects by shifting them
  O = paint(paint(cover(I, extract(obj_b, identity)), shift(extract(obj_b, identity), displacement)), shift(extract(obj_c, identity), invert(displacement)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Colors:** The code first identifies the second and third most frequent colors (`color_b` and `color_c`) in the input grid (`I`).
2. **Isolate Objects:** It then creates temporary grids where one of the target colors is replaced with the background color. This isolates the objects formed by `color_b` and `color_c`.
3. **Calculate Displacement:** The code calculates the displacement vector required to move the center of mass of the object with `color_b` to the center of mass of the object with `color_c`.
4. **Swap Objects:** Finally, the code covers the original objects in the input grid and paints the shifted objects to their new positions using the calculated displacement vector.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_de1cd16c(I):
  # Sort colors by frequency
  palette_sorted = order(palette(I), lambda c: colorcount(I, c))
  # Extract the second and third most frequent colors
  color_b = palette_sorted[1]
  color_c = palette_sorted[2]
  # Swap the colors in the original grid
  O = tuple(
      tuple(
          color_c if v == color_b else color_b if v == color_c else v 
          for v in row
      )
      for row in I
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Colors:** Similar to Version 1, this code identifies `color_b` and `color_c`.
2. **Swap Colors:** Instead of manipulating objects, this version directly iterates through the grid and swaps the values of `color_b` and `color_c` for each cell. This achieves the same visual effect of swapping the objects.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_de1cd16c(I):
  # Sort colors by frequency
  palette_sorted = order(palette(I), lambda c: colorcount(I, c))
  # Extract the second and third most frequent colors
  color_b = palette_sorted[1]
  color_c = palette_sorted[2]
  # Create objects based on the extracted colors
  obj_b = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == color_b)
  obj_c = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == color_c)
  # Find the displacement needed to swap the objects
  displacement = subtract(ulcorner(obj_c), ulcorner(obj_b))
  # Swap the objects by shifting them
  O = paint(paint(cover(I, obj_b), shift(obj_b, displacement)), shift(obj_c, invert(displacement)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 1 but uses a different approach for object identification and displacement calculation:

1. **Direct Object Extraction:** Instead of replacing colors and generating all objects, this version directly extracts the target objects (`obj_b`, `obj_c`) based on their colors using the `extract` function.
2. **Corner-based Displacement:** This version calculates the displacement vector based on the difference between the upper-left corners of the two objects.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_de1cd16c(I):
  # Sort colors by frequency
  palette_sorted = order(palette(I), lambda c: colorcount(I, c))
  # Extract the second and third most frequent colors
  color_b = palette_sorted[1]
  color_c = palette_sorted[2]
  # Create masks for the objects
  mask_b = frozenset((i, j) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(row) if v == color_b)
  mask_c = frozenset((i, j) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(row) if v == color_c)
  # Swap the colors in the grid using the masks
  O = tuple(
      tuple(
          color_c if (i, j) in mask_b else color_b if (i, j) in mask_c else v 
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a mask-based approach to swap colors:

1. **Generate Masks:** It generates masks (`mask_b`, `mask_c`) containing the indices of cells where the target colors are present. 
2. **Swap using Masks:** It then iterates through the grid and uses these masks to identify the cells where the colors need to be swapped.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_de1cd16c(I):
  # Sort colors by frequency
  palette_sorted = order(palette(I), lambda c: colorcount(I, c))
  # Extract the second and third most frequent colors
  color_b = palette_sorted[1]
  color_c = palette_sorted[2]
  # Replace one color with a temporary value
  temp_grid = replace(I, color_b, -1)
  # Swap the second color with the third color
  temp_grid = replace(temp_grid, color_c, color_b)
  # Replace the temporary value with the third color
  O = replace(temp_grid, -1, color_c)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a temporary color for swapping:

1. **Temporary Replacement:** It replaces one of the target colors (`color_b`) with a temporary value (`-1`) to avoid conflicts during the swap.
2. **Swap and Restore:** It then swaps the other target color (`color_c`) with `color_b` and finally replaces the temporary value (`-1`) with `color_c`. This efficiently swaps the colors without explicitly dealing with object boundaries.


These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing diverse applications of the DSL functions. They are all distinct in their logic and function usage, providing a range of solutions for the given problem.
