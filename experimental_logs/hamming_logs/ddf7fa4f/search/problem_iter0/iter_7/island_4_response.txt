## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all examples involves swapping the colors of the smallest and the second smallest objects in the input grid. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The smallest object is the one with digit '2' and the second smallest is the one with digit '6'. The output grid has their colors swapped. 
* **Input_1:**  The smallest object is the one with digit '1' and the second smallest is the one with digit '7'. The output grid has their colors swapped.
* **Input_2:** The smallest object is the one with digit '1' and the second smallest is the one with digit '7'. The output grid has their colors swapped.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  sorted_objs = sorted(objs, key=size)
  smallest_obj = sorted_objs[0]
  second_smallest_obj = sorted_objs[1]
  O = paint(I, recolor(color(second_smallest_obj), smallest_obj))
  O = paint(O, recolor(color(smallest_obj), second_smallest_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all distinct objects in the grid `I`.
2. **Sort by Size:** `sorted_objs = sorted(objs, key=size)` sorts the objects based on their size.
3. **Select Smallest Two:** `smallest_obj` and `second_smallest_obj` are assigned the first two objects from the sorted list.
4. **Swap Colors:** The colors of the two smallest objects are swapped using `recolor` and `paint` functions.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  min1 = argmin(objs, size)
  objs = remove(min1, objs)
  min2 = argmin(objs, size)
  O = paint(I, recolor(color(min2), min1))
  return paint(O, recolor(color(min1), min2))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Smallest:** Find the smallest object (`min1`) using `argmin(objs, size)`.
2. **Remove and Find Second Smallest:** Remove `min1` and find the next smallest object (`min2`). 
3. **Swap Colors:** Swap the colors of `min1` and `min2` using `recolor` and `paint`.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  sizes = apply(size, objs)
  smallest_size = minimum(sizes)
  sizes = remove(smallest_size, sizes)
  second_smallest_size = minimum(sizes)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if size(obj) == smallest_size:
      O = paint(O, recolor(second_smallest_size, obj))
    elif size(obj) == second_smallest_size:
      O = paint(O, recolor(smallest_size, obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Object Sizes:** Calculate and store sizes of all objects.
2. **Find Two Smallest Sizes:** Identify the smallest and the second smallest sizes from the `sizes` set. 
3. **Iterate and Swap:**  Iterate through each object. If the object's size matches either of the two smallest sizes, recolor it with the other size's value.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  obj_sizes = tuple((obj, size(obj)) for obj in objs)
  sorted_objs = order(obj_sizes, lambda x: x[1])
  smallest_obj = sorted_objs[0][0]
  second_smallest_obj = sorted_objs[1][0]
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if obj == smallest_obj:
      O = paint(O, recolor(color(second_smallest_obj), obj))
    elif obj == second_smallest_obj:
      O = paint(O, recolor(color(smallest_obj), obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Object-Size Tuples:** Create tuples pairing each object with its size.
2. **Sort by Size:** Sort the object-size tuples based on the size.
3. **Extract Smallest Objects:** Extract the smallest and second smallest objects from the sorted list. 
4. **Iterate and Swap:**  Iterate through each object. If the object matches either of the two smallest objects, recolor it with the other object's color.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  smallest_obj = argmin(objs, size)
  smallest_size = size(smallest_obj)
  O = paint(I, recolor(99, smallest_obj))
  second_smallest_obj = argmin(objects(O, T, F, T), size)
  O = paint(O, recolor(color(smallest_obj), second_smallest_obj))
  return replace(O, 99, color(second_smallest_obj))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find and Temporarily Recolor:** Find the smallest object and recolor it with a temporary color (e.g., '99').
2. **Find Second Smallest:** With the smallest object temporarily recolored, find the next smallest object.
3. **Swap Colors and Restore:** Swap the colors of the smallest and second smallest objects. Finally, replace the temporary color ('99') with the original color of the second smallest object.
