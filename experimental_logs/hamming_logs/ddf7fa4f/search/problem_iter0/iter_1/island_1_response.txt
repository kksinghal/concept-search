## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation swaps the colors of the two least common objects in the grid while preserving their shapes and positions. 

**Input 0:** The two least common colors are 2 (occurs 6 times) and 6 (occurs 8 times). The output grid swaps these colors.

**Input 1:** The two least common colors are 1 (occurs 5 times) and 4 (occurs 4 times). The output grid swaps these colors.

**Input 2:** The two least common colors are 1 (occurs 5 times) and 6 (occurs 3 times). The output grid swaps these colors.


## Program to be Generated:

Here are five different versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the two least common colors
  color_a = leastcolor(I)
  color_b = leastcommon(list(remove(color_a, palette(I))))

  # Swap colors using nested list comprehension
  O = tuple(
      tuple(
          color_b if v == color_a else color_a if v == color_b else v 
          for v in row
      )
      for row in I
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the least common colors:** We find the least common color (`color_a`) and the next least common color (`color_b`) by removing the least common color from the palette and finding the least common of the remaining colors. 
2. **Swap colors:** We use nested list comprehension to iterate through each cell in the grid. If the cell's value matches `color_a`, we replace it with `color_b` and vice-versa. Otherwise, we keep the cell value unchanged.

**Inspiration:** This version is inspired by the cell-by-cell iteration approach of `fgcehcjfcciceichifeafbeffcffeeeg` and the least common color identification logic of `baajjbbededdecddidbbeacfadhhhbde`. 


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the two least common colors
  color_a = leastcolor(I)
  color_b = leastcommon(list(remove(color_a, palette(I))))

  # Create masks for each color
  mask_a = tuple(
      tuple(1 if v == color_a else 0 for v in row) 
      for row in I
  )
  mask_b = tuple(
      tuple(1 if v == color_b else 0 for v in row) 
      for row in I
  )

  # Apply color swapping using masks
  O = tuple(
      tuple(
          color_b if mask_a[i][j] else color_a if mask_b[i][j] else v 
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      ) 
      for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify least common colors:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Create color masks:** We generate two grids (`mask_a` and `mask_b`) where each cell contains 1 if the corresponding cell in the input grid has the target color and 0 otherwise. 
3. **Swap colors using masks:** We iterate through the input grid. For each cell, if the corresponding cell in `mask_a` is 1, we replace the cell's value with `color_b`. If the corresponding cell in `mask_b` is 1, we replace it with `color_a`. Otherwise, we leave the cell unchanged.

**Inspiration:** This version is inspired by the concept of using masks for color operations, drawing from image processing techniques.


### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Partition the grid into objects
  objs = partition(I)

  # Find the two least common objects
  color_a = leastcolor(I)
  color_b = leastcommon(list(remove(color_a, palette(I))))
  obj_a = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == color_a)
  obj_b = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == color_b)

  # Swap the object colors
  O = paint(
      paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(color_b, obj_a)),
      recolor(color_a, obj_b)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify least common colors and objects:**  We find the least common colors and then use `extract` to find the corresponding objects within the partitioned grid.
2. **Swap colors and paint:** We create a blank canvas and paint the recolored objects onto it. We swap the colors by using `recolor` to change the colors of the extracted objects.

**Inspiration:** This version combines the object-based approach from `jcjgcdgjjcadehdiacegdbddgcahhach` and the least common color logic from other examples.


### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Extract objects based on unique colors 
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  color_a = leastcolor(I)
  color_b = leastcommon(list(remove(color_a, palette(I))))
  obj_a = first(colorfilter(objs, color_a))
  obj_b = first(colorfilter(objs, color_b))

  # Recolor the objects and paint onto a blank canvas
  O = paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(color_b, obj_a)), recolor(color_a, obj_b))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify unique colors and objects:** We identify the least common colors and extract the corresponding objects from the grid.
2. **Recolor and paint:** We create a blank canvas and paint the recolored objects onto it, swapping their colors during the process.

**Inspiration:** This version is directly inspired by  `jcjgcdgjjcadehdiacegdbddgcahhach` but modifies the color selection to target the least common colors instead of the two unique colors.


### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the two unique colors
  color_a = leastcolor(I)
  color_b = leastcommon(list(remove(color_a, palette(I))))

  # Swap colors using the switch function
  O = switch(I, color_a, color_b)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the two unique colors**: We identify the least common color (`color_a`) and the next least common color (`color_b`).
2. **Swap the colors**: We use the `switch` function to directly swap the identified colors in the input grid, creating the output grid.

**Inspiration**: This version simplifies the process by directly utilizing the `switch` function from the DSL for a more concise and efficient solution.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same goal, highlighting the flexibility and versatility of the provided DSL. Each version leverages different functions and logic, offering distinct solutions to the color swapping transformation problem.
