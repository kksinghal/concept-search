## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid and replacing them with objects of a different digit. The new digit is determined by finding a single-cell object adjacent to the original object. 

**Example:**

In Input_0, the object composed of '5's has a single-cell object of '2' adjacent to it. The transformation replaces all '5's with '2's. Similarly, the single '8' is replaced by '6' as a single-cell '6' object is adjacent to it. 

This logic applies to all input-output pairs.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  for obj in objs:
    if size(obj) > 1:
      n = rbind(adjacent, obj)
      neighbors = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), n)
      single_neighbors = sizefilter(neighbors, 1)
      if len(single_neighbors) > 0:
        new_color = color(first(single_neighbors))
        I = paint(cover(I, obj), recolor(new_color, toindices(obj)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate and Transform:** The code iterates through each identified object `obj`.
3. **Check for Multi-Cell Objects:** `if size(obj) > 1` focuses on objects with more than one cell.
4. **Find Adjacent Single-Cell Objects:** 
    * `rbind(adjacent, obj)` creates a function checking for adjacency with the current `obj`.
    * `mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), n)` finds all objects adjacent to `obj`.
    * `sizefilter(neighbors, 1)` isolates single-cell objects from the neighbors.
5. **Recolor:**
    * If single-cell neighbors exist (`if len(single_neighbors) > 0`):
        * `new_color = color(first(single_neighbors))` extracts the digit of the first single-cell neighbor.
        * `I = paint(cover(I, obj), recolor(new_color, toindices(obj)))` replaces the original object with the new digit. 
6. **Return Transformed Grid:** The modified grid `I` is returned.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  for i in palette(I):
    obj = asobject(replace(I, i, 1))
    adj_objs =  mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), rbind(adjacent, obj))
    for j in palette(I):
      if size(intersection(toindices(obj), toindices(recolor(j, asobject(replace(I, j, 1)))))) > 0:
        for k in palette(I):
          if size(intersection(toindices(recolor(k, asobject(replace(I, k, 1)))), toindices(adj_objs))) == 1:
            I = replace(I, i, k)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Colors:** The code iterates through each unique color `i` in the input grid `I`.
2. **Isolate Object of Color `i`:**  
    * `replace(I, i, 1)` replaces all occurrences of color `i` with '1'.
    * `asobject(...)` converts the modified grid into an object representing the original object of color `i`.
3. **Find Adjacent Objects:** `mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), rbind(adjacent, obj))` identifies all objects adjacent to the object of color `i`.
4. **Iterate Through Colors Again:**  The code iterates through each color `j` in the input grid.
5. **Check for Single-Cell Adjacent Objects:** The code iterates through each color `k` in the input grid and checks if a single-cell object of color `k` is adjacent to the object of color `i`.
6. **Replace Color:** If a single-cell adjacent object of color `k` is found, all occurrences of color `i` are replaced with `k`.
7. **Return Transformed Grid:** The modified grid `I` is returned.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  for c in palette(I):
    obj = recolor(1, ofcolor(I, c))
    if size(obj) > 1:
      for d in palette(I):
        adj_obj = recolor(1, ofcolor(I, d))
        if size(adj_obj) == 1 and adjacent(obj, adj_obj):
          I = replace(I, c, d)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Colors:** The code iterates through each unique color `c` in the input grid `I`.
2. **Isolate Object of Color `c`:** `recolor(1, ofcolor(I, c))` creates an object representing the regions of color `c`, effectively isolating it.
3. **Check Object Size:** `if size(obj) > 1` proceeds only if the object has more than one cell.
4. **Iterate Through Colors Again:** The code iterates through each color `d` in the input grid.
5. **Check for Single-Cell Adjacency:**
   * `adj_obj = recolor(1, ofcolor(I, d))` isolates the potential adjacent object of color `d`.
   * `if size(adj_obj) == 1 and adjacent(obj, adj_obj)` verifies if `adj_obj` is a single-cell object and adjacent to the main object.
6. **Replace Color:** If the conditions are met, the original color `c` is replaced with color `d` in the grid.
7. **Return Transformed Grid:**  The modified grid `I` is returned.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def check_and_replace(obj):
    for d in palette(I):
      adj_obj = recolor(1, ofcolor(I, d))
      if size(adj_obj) == 1 and adjacent(obj, adj_obj):
        return paint(cover(I, obj), recolor(d, toindices(obj)))
    return I
  return mapply(check_and_replace, objects(I, T, F, F))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Helper Function:**  `check_and_replace(obj)` is defined to encapsulate the logic of finding an adjacent single-cell object and performing the replacement.
2. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
3. **Apply and Merge:**  
    * `mapply(check_and_replace, objects(I, T, F, F))` applies the `check_and_replace` function to each object and merges the results.
4. **Helper Function Logic:**
    * Iterates through colors `d` in the grid.
    * Isolates potential adjacent object `adj_obj` of color `d`.
    * Checks if `adj_obj` is a single-cell object adjacent to the input `obj`.
    * If found, replaces the input `obj` with the color `d` and returns the modified grid.
    * If no suitable adjacent object is found, returns the original grid `I`.
5. **Return Transformed Grid:** The modified grid resulting from the `mapply` operation is returned.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def transform_object(obj):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      adj_colors =  set(color(n) for n in mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), rbind(adjacent, obj)) if size(n) == 1)
      if adj_colors:
        return recolor(first(adj_colors), toindices(obj))
    return toindices(obj)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(transform_object, objects(I, T, F, F))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Helper Function:** `transform_object(obj)` handles the transformation logic for individual objects.
2. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all objects in the grid.
3. **Apply Transformation and Merge:**
    * `apply(transform_object, objects(I, T, F, F))` applies `transform_object` to each object.
    * `merge(...)` combines the results into a single set of indices.
4. **Helper Function Logic:**
    * Checks if the object has more than one cell (`if size(obj) > 1`).
    * Finds adjacent single-cell objects and stores their colors in `adj_colors`.
    * If `adj_colors` is not empty, recolors the object with the first color from `adj_colors`.
    * If the object is not transformed (single-cell or no adjacent single-cell objects), returns its original indices.
5. **Create New Grid and Paint:**
    * `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates a blank canvas filled with the background color of the input.
    * `paint(..., ...)` paints the transformed objects onto the canvas.
6. **Return Transformed Grid:** The painted canvas representing the transformed grid is returned.
