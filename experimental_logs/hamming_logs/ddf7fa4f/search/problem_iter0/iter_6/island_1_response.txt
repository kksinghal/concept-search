## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all three examples follows a consistent pattern:

1. **Identify and Group Objects:** The input grids contain distinct objects formed by connected cells of the same digit. The background (most common color) is not considered an object.

2. **Relocate and Recolor:** Each object is relocated and recolored based on its size and original position.

    * **Smallest Object:** Remains in its original position but is recolored to match the color of the second smallest object.
    * **Second Smallest Object:**  Shifted upwards by twice its height. It retains its original color.
    * **Largest Object:** Shifted downwards by twice its height. It retains its original color.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions that implement the transformation using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  objs_sorted = order(objs, lambda obj: len(obj))
  smallest = objs_sorted[0]
  second_smallest = objs_sorted[1]
  largest = objs_sorted[-1]
  shifted_second_smallest = shift(second_smallest, (-2 * height(second_smallest), 0))
  shifted_largest = shift(largest, (2 * height(largest), 0))
  recolored_smallest = recolor(color(second_smallest), smallest)
  O = paint(paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), shifted_second_smallest), shifted_largest), recolored_smallest)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Sort Objects:**  Identifies objects, sorts them by size, and stores the smallest, second smallest, and largest.
2. **Calculate Shifts:** Computes the upward shift for the second smallest and the downward shift for the largest object.
3. **Shift and Recolor:** Shifts the second smallest and largest objects, recolors the smallest object.
4. **Paint to Canvas:**  Creates a blank canvas and paints the shifted and recolored objects onto it.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  size_dict = {}
  for obj in objs:
    size_dict[len(obj)] = obj
  size_sorted = order(size_dict, identity)
  smallest_size = size_sorted[0]
  second_smallest_size = size_sorted[1]
  recolored = recolor(color(size_dict[second_smallest_size]), size_dict[smallest_size])
  shifted_up = shift(size_dict[second_smallest_size], (-2 * height(size_dict[second_smallest_size]), 0))
  shifted_down = shift(size_dict[size_sorted[-1]], (2 * height(size_dict[size_sorted[-1]]), 0))
  O = paint(paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolored), shifted_up), shifted_down)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Size Dictionary:** Creates a dictionary mapping object sizes to objects.
2. **Size-Based Sorting:** Sorts sizes and retrieves the smallest and second smallest.
3. **Recolor and Shift:** Recolors the smallest object and shifts the second smallest upwards and the largest downwards.
4. **Paint to Canvas:** Paints the transformed objects onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  objs_list = list(objs)
  objs_sorted = order(objs_list, lambda obj: len(obj))
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge([
      recolor(color(objs_sorted[1]), shift(objs_sorted[0], (0, 0))),
      shift(objs_sorted[1], (-2 * height(objs_sorted[1]), 0)),
      shift(objs_sorted[-1], (2 * height(objs_sorted[-1]), 0))
  ]))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object List and Sorting:**  Converts objects to a list and sorts by size.
2. **Inline Transformations:** Directly recolors and shifts the objects within the `merge` function call.
3. **Paint to Canvas:** Paints the transformed objects onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  smallest = argmin(objs, len)
  largest = argmax(objs, len)
  remaining = difference(objs, frozenset({smallest, largest}))
  second_smallest = argmin(remaining, len)
  shifted_up = shift(second_smallest, (-2 * height(second_smallest), 0))
  shifted_down = shift(largest, (2 * height(largest), 0))
  recolored = recolor(color(second_smallest), smallest)
  O = paint(paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), shifted_up), shifted_down), recolored)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Smallest and Largest:** Uses `argmin` and `argmax` to find the smallest and largest objects directly.
2. **Find Second Smallest:**  Removes the smallest and largest to find the second smallest.
3. **Shift and Recolor:** Performs shifting and recoloring operations.
4. **Paint to Canvas:**  Paints transformed objects onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  size_objs = list(zip(map(len, objs), objs))
  size_objs.sort()
  smallest, second_smallest, largest = size_objs[0][1], size_objs[1][1], size_objs[-1][1]
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge([
      recolor(color(second_smallest), smallest),
      shift(second_smallest, (-2 * height(second_smallest), 0)),
      shift(largest, (2 * height(largest), 0))
  ]))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Size-Object Tuples:** Creates tuples of (size, object) for sorting.
2. **Sort and Extract:** Sorts tuples by size and extracts objects.
3. **Inline Transformations:** Applies recoloring and shifting directly within the `merge` function.
4. **Paint to Canvas:** Paints the transformed objects onto a blank canvas.

These five versions provide diverse implementations using different DSL function combinations and logic while achieving the same transformation. Each version offers a unique approach to solving the problem.
