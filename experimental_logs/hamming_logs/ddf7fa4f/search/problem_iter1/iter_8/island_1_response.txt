## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the smallest objects of the most and least common colors in the input grid and swapping their colors in the output grid.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- Most common color: 0
- Least common color: 5
- Smallest object with color 0: Single cell at (1, 0) 
- Smallest object with color 5: 2x2 square at (4, 1)
- Transformation: The 2x2 square becomes color 0 and the single cell at (1, 0) becomes color 5.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- Most common color: 5
- Least common color: 1
- Smallest object with color 5: Single cell at (0, 1)
- Smallest object with color 1: 2x2 square at (7, 3)
- Transformation: The 2x2 square becomes color 5 and the single cell at (0, 1) becomes color 1.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

- Most common color: 0
- Least common color: 5
- Smallest object with color 0: Single cell at (1, 0)
- Smallest object with color 5: 2x2 square at (3, 1)
- Transformation: The 2x2 square becomes color 0 and the single cell at (1, 0) becomes color 5.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Extract objects
  mc = mostcommon(I) # Find most common color
  lc = leastcommon(I) # Find least common color
  
  # Find smallest object with most common color
  target_obj1 = argmin(colorfilter(objs, mc), size) 
  # Find smallest object with least common color
  target_obj2 = argmin(colorfilter(objs, lc), size) 
  
  # Swap colors and paint
  O = paint(I, recolor(lc, toindices(target_obj1)))
  O = paint(O, recolor(mc, toindices(target_obj2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` extracts all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Find most and least common colors:**  `mostcommon(I)` and `leastcommon(I)` identify the most and least common colors in `I`.
3. **Find target objects:**
   - `colorfilter(objs, mc)` filters objects to those with the most common color.
   - `argmin(..., size)` finds the smallest object based on size. 
   - This is repeated for the least common color.
4. **Swap colors:**
   - `recolor(lc, toindices(target_obj1))` recolors the smallest object of the most common color to the least common color.
   -  This is repeated for the other object, swapping colors.
5. **Paint objects:**  `paint(I, ...)` paints the recolored objects onto a copy of the input grid. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def swap_color(obj):
    return recolor(leastcommon(I) if color(obj) == mostcommon(I) else mostcommon(I), toindices(obj))
  return paint(I, merge(apply(swap_color, objects(I, T, F, F))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `swap_color` function:** This function takes an object as input and recolors it based on the most and least common colors in the input grid. 
2. **Extract objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` extracts all objects from the input grid `I`.
3. **Apply `swap_color` to each object:** `apply(swap_color, ...)` applies the `swap_color` function to each extracted object.
4. **Merge recolored objects:** `merge(...)` combines the recolored objects into a single set.
5. **Paint onto the grid:**  `paint(I, ...)` paints the merged, recolored objects onto a copy of the input grid. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def find_and_recolor(color_to_find, replacement_color):
    target_obj = argmin(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), color_to_find), size)
    return recolor(replacement_color, toindices(target_obj))
  mc = mostcommon(I)
  lc = leastcommon(I)
  return paint(I, merge({find_and_recolor(mc, lc), find_and_recolor(lc, mc)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `find_and_recolor` function:** This function finds the smallest object of a given color and recolors it to a specified replacement color. 
2. **Find most and least common colors:** `mostcommon(I)` and `leastcommon(I)` identify the most and least common colors in the input grid.
3. **Find and recolor target objects:**  `find_and_recolor(mc, lc)` finds the smallest object of the most common color and recolors it to the least common color. This is repeated for the least common color.
4. **Merge recolored objects:**  `merge(...)` combines the two recolored objects.
5. **Paint onto the grid:**  `paint(I, ...)` paints the merged, recolored objects onto a copy of the input grid. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def process_color(color_to_find, replacement_color, grid):
        smallest_obj = argmin(colorfilter(objects(grid, T, F, F), color_to_find), size)
        return paint(grid, recolor(replacement_color, toindices(smallest_obj)))
    O = process_color(mostcommon(I), leastcommon(I), I)
    return process_color(leastcommon(I), mostcommon(I), O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `process_color` function:** This function finds the smallest object of a given color in a provided grid, recolors it to a specified replacement color, and paints it back onto the grid. 
2. **Process most common color:**  `process_color(mostcommon(I), leastcommon(I), I)` finds the smallest object of the most common color in the input grid and recolors it to the least common color. The result is stored in `O`.
3. **Process least common color:**  `process_color(leastcommon(I), mostcommon(I), O)` finds the smallest object of the least common color in the partially transformed grid `O` and recolors it to the most common color. 
4. **Return final grid:** The final transformed grid is returned.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  def swap(obj): 
    return (size(obj), color(obj))
  sorted_objs = order(apply(swap, objs), lambda x: x[0])
  smallest_color = sorted_objs[0][1]
  largest_color = sorted_objs[-1][1]
  return paint(I, merge({recolor(largest_color if color(obj) == smallest_color else smallest_color, toindices(obj)) for obj in objs})) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects and define  `swap` function:** Similar to previous versions, this extracts objects and defines a helper function. Here, `swap` creates tuples of (object size, object color).
2. **Sort objects by size:** `apply(swap, objs)` applies `swap` to each object, creating a list of (size, color) tuples. `order(..., lambda x: x[0])` then sorts these tuples based on size, resulting in `sorted_objs`.
3. **Extract smallest and largest object colors:**  The color of the smallest object is retrieved from `sorted_objs[0][1]`, and the color of the largest from `sorted_objs[-1][1]`.
4. **Recolor and paint:**  Similar to other versions, the code iterates through all objects and recolors them based on whether their color matches the smallest or largest object's color. The recolored objects are then merged and painted onto a copy of the input grid. 


These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired color-swapping transformation while adhering to the provided DSL.
