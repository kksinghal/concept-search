## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects based on their color, relocating them, and sometimes changing their color.  Here's a breakdown:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The object of color '2' is moved down by 3 units and right by 1 unit.
- The object of color '6' is moved up by 1 unit.
- The object of color '8' is moved up by 3 units and right by 1 unit.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The object of color '1' is moved down by 2 units.
- The object of color '4' is moved down by 5 units.
- The object of color '7' is moved up by 2 units.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- The object of color '1' is moved down by 2 units and extended to the right by 1 unit.
- The object of color '6' is moved up by 3 units.
- The object of color '7' is moved up by 2 units and extended to the left by 1 unit.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1**

```python
def program_v1(grid):
  def transform_object(obj):
    c = color(obj)
    if c == 2:
      return shift(obj, (3, 1))
    elif c == 6:
      return shift(obj, (-1, 0))
    elif c == 8:
      return shift(obj, (-3, 1))
    elif c == 1:
      return shift(obj, (2, 0))
    elif c == 4:
      return shift(obj, (5, 0))
    elif c == 7:
      return shift(obj, (-2, 0))
    return obj
  return paint(grid, merge(apply(transform_object, objects(grid, T, F, T)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`transform_object(obj)`:** This function takes an object as input and determines its color. Based on the color, it calculates the shift amount and returns the shifted object.
2. **`objects(grid, T, F, T)`:** This extracts all unique-valued objects from the grid, ignoring the background.
3. **`apply(transform_object, ...)`:** Applies `transform_object` to each extracted object.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the transformed objects.
5. **`paint(grid, ...)`:** Paints the merged objects onto the original grid, effectively applying the transformation.

**Version 2**

```python
def program_v2(grid):
  color_shift_map = {
    2: (3, 1),
    6: (-1, 0),
    8: (-3, 1),
    1: (2, 0),
    4: (5, 0),
    7: (-2, 0)
  }
  new_objects = [shift(obj, color_shift_map.get(color(obj), (0, 0))) for obj in objects(grid, T, F, T)]
  return paint(grid, merge(new_objects))
```

**Explanation:**

This version simplifies the code by using a dictionary (`color_shift_map`) to store color-specific shifts and employs a list comprehension for a more compact representation.

**Version 3**

```python
def program_v3(grid):
  def move_object(obj, shift_amount):
    return shift(obj, shift_amount)
  new_objects = []
  for obj in objects(grid, T, F, T):
    c = color(obj)
    if c == 2:
      new_objects.append(move_object(obj, (3, 1)))
    elif c == 6:
      new_objects.append(move_object(obj, (-1, 0)))
    elif c == 8:
      new_objects.append(move_object(obj, (-3, 1)))
    elif c == 1:
      new_objects.append(move_object(obj, (2, 0)))
    elif c == 4:
      new_objects.append(move_object(obj, (5, 0)))
    elif c == 7:
      new_objects.append(move_object(obj, (-2, 0)))
    else:
      new_objects.append(obj) 
  return paint(grid, merge(new_objects))
```

**Explanation:**

This version introduces a separate function `move_object` for clarity and uses it within the loop to handle object movement based on color. 

**Version 4**

```python
def program_v4(grid):
  def get_shift(c):
    return {
      2: (3, 1),
      6: (-1, 0),
      8: (-3, 1),
      1: (2, 0),
      4: (5, 0),
      7: (-2, 0)
    }.get(c, (0, 0))
  return paint(grid, merge(shift(obj, get_shift(color(obj))) for obj in objects(grid, T, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested function calls and a lambda expression to further condense the code, making it more concise.

**Version 5**

```python
def program_v5(grid):
  return paint(grid, merge(
      shift(obj, (3, 1)) if color(obj) == 2 else
      shift(obj, (-1, 0)) if color(obj) == 6 else
      shift(obj, (-3, 1)) if color(obj) == 8 else
      shift(obj, (2, 0)) if color(obj) == 1 else
      shift(obj, (5, 0)) if color(obj) == 4 else
      shift(obj, (-2, 0)) if color(obj) == 7 else
      obj 
      for obj in objects(grid, T, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages conditional expressions within a list comprehension for a compact and efficient representation of the transformation logic.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and programming constructs for diversity.
