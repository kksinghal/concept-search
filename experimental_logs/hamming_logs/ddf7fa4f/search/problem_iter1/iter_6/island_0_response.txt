## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific objects within the input grid based on their size and relative position, and then swapping the colors of these objects while preserving their original shapes and positions.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The largest object (color 5) swaps colors with the smallest object (color 8).
- The second smallest object (color 2) also swaps colors with the (originally) smallest object (now color 8).

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The largest object (color 5) swaps colors with the smallest object (color 7).
- The second smallest object (color 1) also swaps colors with the (originally) smallest object (now color 7).

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- The largest object (color 5) swaps colors with the smallest object (color 7).
- The second smallest object (color 1) also swaps colors with the (originally) smallest object (now color 7).

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each utilizing different logic and DSL functions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  size_objs = order(objs, size)
  small_obj = size_objs[0]
  large_obj = size_objs[-1]
  second_small_obj = size_objs[1] if len(size_objs) > 1 else large_obj
  O = paint(paint(I, recolor(color(small_obj), large_obj)), 
            recolor(color(large_obj), small_obj))
  O = paint(paint(O, recolor(color(second_small_obj), large_obj)), 
            recolor(color(large_obj), second_small_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects in the grid using `objects(I, T, F, F)`.
2. **Sort by Size:** Order objects by their size using `order(objs, size)`.
3. **Select Objects:** Select the smallest, second smallest, and largest objects.
4. **Swap Colors:** Swap colors of the largest object with the smallest and then with the second smallest using `paint` and `recolor`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  small_color = color(argmin(objs, size))
  large_color = color(argmax(objs, size))
  second_small_color = color(argmin(remove(argmin(objs, size), objs), size)) if len(objs) > 1 else large_color
  O = switch(switch(I, large_color, small_color), small_color, second_small_color)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects in the grid using `objects(I, T, F, F)`.
2. **Find Colors:** Find the colors of the smallest, second smallest, and largest objects using `argmin`, `argmax`, `color`, and `remove`.
3. **Swap Colors:** Perform a double color swap using `switch` to achieve the desired output.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, T, F, F), key=len)
  small_color, large_color = color(objs[0]), color(objs[-1])
  second_small_color = color(objs[1]) if len(objs) > 1 else large_color
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == small_color:
        O = paint(O, {(large_color, (i, j))})
      elif val == large_color:
        O = paint(O, {(small_color, (i, j))})
  O = switch(O, small_color, second_small_color)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify & Sort:** Identify and sort objects by size using `objects` and `sorted`.
2. **Find Colors:** Get the colors of the relevant objects using `color`.
3. **Iterate and Swap:** Iterate through the grid and swap colors of the smallest and largest objects using `paint`.
4. **Final Swap:** Finally, swap the colors of the smallest and second smallest objects using `switch`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  small_obj = min(objs, key=len)
  large_obj = max(objs, key=len)
  second_small_obj = min(objs - {small_obj}, key=len, default=large_obj)
  O = I
  for cell in small_obj:
    O = paint(O, {(color(large_obj), cell[1])})
  for cell in large_obj:
    O = paint(O, {(color(small_obj), cell[1])})
  for cell in second_small_obj:
    O = paint(O, {(color(large_obj), cell[1])})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects in the grid using `objects(I, T, F, F)`.
2. **Find Objects:** Find the smallest, second smallest, and largest objects using `min` and `max` based on their size.
3. **Iterate and Swap:** Iterate through each object and swap their colors with the target object by painting individual cells using `paint`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  objs_by_size = sorted(objs, key=lambda x: len(x))
  small_color = color(objs_by_size[0])
  large_color = color(objs_by_size[-1])
  second_small_color = color(objs_by_size[1]) if len(objs_by_size) > 1 else large_color
  O = canvas(large_color, shape(I))
  for obj in objs_by_size:
    if color(obj) == small_color:
      O = paint(O, recolor(small_color, obj))
    elif color(obj) == second_small_color:
      O = paint(O, recolor(second_small_color, obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify and Sort:** Identify objects and sort them by size using `objects` and `sorted`.
2. **Get Colors:** Obtain colors of relevant objects using `color`.
3. **Create Canvas:** Create a canvas filled with the largest object's color using `canvas`.
4. **Paint Objects:** Paint the smallest and second smallest objects back onto the canvas with their respective colors using `paint` and `recolor`.


These are just five examples, and many other valid and distinct programs can be generated using the provided DSL to achieve the same transformation. The key is to understand the underlying logic of the transformation and then leverage the available DSL functions creatively to implement it.
