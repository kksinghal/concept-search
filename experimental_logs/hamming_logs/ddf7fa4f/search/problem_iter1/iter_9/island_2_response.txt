## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves selectively shifting objects of specific colors within the grid. Let's break down the movement for each color based on the input-output pairs:

* **Color 1:** Shifted upwards by 2 units.
* **Color 2:** Shifted upwards by 4 units.
* **Color 4:** Shifted upwards by 2 units.
* **Color 6:** Shifted upwards by 3 units.
* **Color 7:** Shifted upwards by 2 units.
* **Color 8:** Shifted upwards by 3 units.

All other colors remain in their original positions.


## Program Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  shifts = {
    1: (-2, 0),
    2: (-4, 0),
    4: (-2, 0),
    6: (-3, 0),
    7: (-2, 0),
    8: (-3, 0)
  }
  return paint(grid, merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, shifts.get(color(obj), (0, 0))), objects(grid, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifts` Dictionary:** Defines a dictionary mapping each relevant color to its corresponding shift amount. 
2. **`objects(grid, T, F, T)`:** Extracts all univalued objects from the grid, excluding the background.
3. **`apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, shifts.get(color(obj), (0, 0))), ...)`:** Applies a lambda function to each object:
    - `color(obj)`: Retrieves the color of the object.
    - `shifts.get(..., (0, 0))`: Fetches the shift amount from the `shifts` dictionary based on the object's color. If the color is not found, it defaults to (0, 0), meaning no shift.
    - `shift(obj, ...)`: Shifts the object by the retrieved amount.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges all the shifted objects back into a single set.
5. **`paint(grid, ...)`:** Paints the merged objects onto the original grid, effectively applying the shifts.


## Program Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  new_grid = canvas(0, shape(grid))
  for obj in objects(grid, T, F, T):
    c = color(obj)
    if c == 1:
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(obj, (-2, 0)))
    elif c == 2:
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(obj, (-4, 0)))
    elif c == 4:
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(obj, (-2, 0)))
    elif c == 6:
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(obj, (-3, 0)))
    elif c == 7:
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(obj, (-2, 0)))
    elif c == 8:
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(obj, (-3, 0)))
    else:
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, obj) 
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(0, shape(grid))`:** Creates a new empty grid of the same size as the input.
2. **Iterate over Objects:** Loops through each univalued object (excluding background) in the grid.
3. **Conditional Shifting:** Based on the object's color (`c`), applies the specific upward shift using `shift(obj, (-x, 0))`.
4. **Paint to New Grid:** Paints the shifted (or unshifted) object onto the `new_grid`.
5. **Return New Grid:** Returns the `new_grid` with the transformed objects.


## Program Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def move_object(obj):
    c = color(obj)
    shift_amount = (-2, 0) if c in {1, 4, 7} else (-4, 0) if c == 2 else (-3, 0) if c in {6, 8} else (0, 0)
    return shift(obj, shift_amount)
  return paint(grid, merge(apply(lambda obj: frozenset({move_object(obj)}), objects(grid, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`move_object(obj)` Function:** 
   - Takes an object as input.
   - Determines the appropriate shift based on its color using a conditional expression.
   - Returns the shifted object.
2. **Apply and Merge:**
   - `objects(grid, T, F, T)`: Gets all univalued objects (excluding background).
   - `apply(lambda obj: frozenset({move_object(obj)}), ...)`: Applies `move_object` to each object and wraps the result in a frozenset to maintain the structure for `merge`.
   - `merge(...)`: Merges all shifted objects.
3. **Paint:**
   - `paint(grid, ...)`: Paints the merged, shifted objects onto the original grid.


## Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for c in [1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8]:
    shift_amount = (-2, 0) if c in {1, 4, 7} else (-4, 0) if c == 2 else (-3, 0)
    obj = extract(objects(grid, T, F, T), matcher(color, c))
    if obj:
      grid = paint(cover(grid, obj), shift(obj, shift_amount))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Colors:** Loops through the colors that require shifting.
2. **Determine Shift:** Calculates the shift amount for the current color (`c`).
3. **Extract Object:** `extract(objects(grid, T, F, T), matcher(color, c))` finds and extracts the object of the specific color.
4. **Conditional Shifting and Painting:**
   - If an object of the current color exists:
     - `cover(grid, obj)`: "Erases" the object from its original position by filling it with the background color.
     - `shift(obj, shift_amount)`: Shifts the object.
     - `paint(..., ...)`:  Paints the shifted object back onto the grid.
5. **Return Modified Grid:** Returns the grid after processing all colors.


## Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def process_color(grid, c, shift_amount):
    obj = extract(objects(grid, T, F, T), matcher(color, c))
    return paint(cover(grid, obj), shift(obj, shift_amount)) if obj else grid
  grid = process_color(grid, 1, (-2, 0))
  grid = process_color(grid, 2, (-4, 0))
  grid = process_color(grid, 4, (-2, 0))
  grid = process_color(grid, 6, (-3, 0))
  grid = process_color(grid, 7, (-2, 0))
  grid = process_color(grid, 8, (-3, 0))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`process_color` Function:**
   - Takes the grid, a color, and a shift amount as input.
   - Attempts to extract an object of the given color.
   - If found, it covers the original object, shifts it, and paints it back onto the grid.
   - If not found, it returns the grid unchanged.
2. **Sequential Processing:** Calls `process_color` for each relevant color, updating the `grid` with each call. This ensures that each color's transformation builds upon the previous one.
3. **Return Final Grid:** Returns the grid after processing all colors.
