## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all examples involves identifying three distinct objects (excluding the background) in the input grid and then swapping their positions while also changing their color. The smallest object takes the position and color of the largest object, the medium-sized object takes the position and color of the smallest object, and the largest object takes the position and color of the medium-sized object. 

Let's break it down:

**Example 1:**

* **Input:** Three objects with colors 2, 5, and 8.
* **Transformation:**
    * Object with color 2 (smallest) moves to the position of object with color 8 (largest) and changes color to 8.
    * Object with color 5 (medium) moves to the position of object with color 2 (smallest) and changes color to 2.
    * Object with color 8 (largest) moves to the position of object with color 5 (medium) and changes color to 5.

**Example 2 & 3:** Follow the same logic as Example 1, swapping object positions and colors based on their size ranking.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  small_obj = argmin(objs, size)
  large_obj = argmax(objs, size)
  medium_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: obj != small_obj and obj != large_obj)
  O = paint(paint(paint(I, recolor(color(large_obj), toindices(small_obj))), 
                   recolor(color(small_obj), toindices(medium_obj))), 
                   recolor(color(medium_obj), toindices(large_obj)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects in the input grid `I` using `objects`.
2. **Find Small, Medium, Large:** Determine the smallest, medium-sized, and largest objects using `argmin`, `argmax`, and `extract` functions based on their size.
3. **Swap and Recolor:** Use nested `paint` and `recolor` functions to simultaneously swap the positions and change the colors of the objects according to the transformation logic.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, T, F, F), key=size)
  small_obj, medium_obj, large_obj = objs[0], objs[1], objs[2]
  return paint(paint(paint(I, recolor(color(large_obj), toindices(small_obj))),
                   recolor(color(small_obj), toindices(medium_obj))),
                   recolor(color(medium_obj), toindices(large_obj)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sort Objects:** Sort all identified objects based on their size using `sorted` and `size` functions.
2. **Assign Objects:**  Directly assign the sorted objects to `small_obj`, `medium_obj`, and `large_obj` variables.
3. **Swap and Recolor:** Similar to Version 1, use nested `paint` and `recolor` functions for the transformation.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  s, m, l = sorted(objs, key=size)
  return paint(cover(paint(cover(paint(I, recolor(color(l), toindices(s))), s),
                   recolor(color(s), toindices(m))), m), 
                   recolor(color(m), toindices(l)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sort Objects:** Similar to Version 2, sort objects by size.
2. **Assign Objects:** Use a more compact assignment for `small_obj (s)`, `medium_obj (m)`, and `large_obj (l)`.
3. **Paint and Cover:** This version uses nested `paint` and `cover` functions to first paint the objects in their new positions and then cover the original objects.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
  def transform_object(obj, target_obj):
    return recolor(color(target_obj), toindices(obj))
  objs = sorted(objects(I, T, F, F), key=size)
  s, m, l = objs
  return paint(paint(paint(I, transform_object(s, l)),
                   transform_object(m, s)),
                   transform_object(l, m)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Helper Function:** This version introduces a helper function `transform_object` to improve code readability. 
2. **Sort and Assign:** Similar to previous versions.
3. **Apply Transformation:**  Applies the `transform_object` function sequentially to each object for the swap and recolor.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  small_obj = min(objs, key=size)
  large_obj = max(objs, key=size)
  medium_obj = next(obj for obj in objs if obj != small_obj and obj != large_obj)
  I = fill(I, color(large_obj), toindices(small_obj))
  I = fill(I, color(small_obj), toindices(medium_obj))
  I = fill(I, color(medium_obj), toindices(large_obj))
  return I 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Find Objects:** Uses `min` and `max` functions with `key=size` to determine the smallest and largest objects. The medium-sized object is found using a generator expression.
3. **Sequential Filling:**  Instead of using `paint` and `recolor`, this version uses sequential `fill` operations to achieve the transformation, making it more efficient.


These five versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL functions. Each version uses distinct logic and function combinations, showcasing the flexibility and versatility of the DSL.
