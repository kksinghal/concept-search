## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '5' and expanding these objects upwards and downwards to form filled rectangles of width 3.  The other cells in the grid remain unchanged.

**Example:**

Input:

```
0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0
```

Output:

```
0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 
```


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the `Program_to_be_generated` using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    # Find indices of the digit '5'
    five_indices = ofcolor(I, FIVE)
    # Get the minimum and maximum column indices of the object
    min_col = leftmost(five_indices) 
    max_col = rightmost(five_indices)
    # Create a patch covering the entire vertical span within the column range
    expansion_patch = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(min_col, max_col + 1))
    # Fill the expansion patch with the digit '1'
    O = fill(I, ONE, expansion_patch)
    return O 
```

**Explanation:** This version directly identifies the column range occupied by the '5' object and creates a patch covering the entire vertical span within that range.  It then fills this patch with '1's.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    # Find the object formed by the digit '5'
    obj = first(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))
    # Get the bounding box indices of the object
    bounding_box = backdrop(toindices(obj))
    # Fill the bounding box with '1's
    O = fill(I, ONE, bounding_box)
    return O
```

**Explanation:** This version identifies the '5' object and then utilizes the `backdrop` function to get the indices covering its bounding box. It fills this bounding box with '1's.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    # Extract objects from the grid 
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
    # Create a patch for each object spanning the grid's height
    patches = frozenset(frozenset((row, col) for row in range(len(I)) for col in range(leftmost(obj_indices), rightmost(obj_indices) + 1)) 
                        for obj in objs for obj_indices in [toindices(obj)]) 
    # Fill the patches with '1's
    O = I
    for patch in patches:
        O = fill(O, ONE, patch)
    return O
```

**Explanation:** This version extracts all objects, determines the column range for each, and then creates patches spanning the grid's height for each range. These patches are then filled with '1's.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    # Get indices of the digit '5'
    five_indices = ofcolor(I, FIVE) 
    # Create horizontal lines at the top and bottom of the object
    top_line = frozenset((0, j) for j in range(leftmost(five_indices), rightmost(five_indices) + 1))
    bottom_line = frozenset((len(I) - 1, j) for j in range(leftmost(five_indices), rightmost(five_indices) + 1))
    # Connect the top and bottom lines to form the expansion area
    expansion_area =  frozenset(connect(first(top_line), first(bottom_line)))
    # Fill the expansion area with '1's
    O = fill(I, ONE, expansion_area)
    return O
```

**Explanation:** This version focuses on creating the expansion area by connecting the topmost and bottommost points of the '5' object with a vertical line. The area enclosed by these lines is then filled.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    # Identify the object formed by the digit '5'
    obj = first(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))
    # Calculate the width of the object
    object_width = width(obj) 
    # Create a canvas filled with '1's with the object's width and the grid's height
    rect = canvas(ONE, (len(I), object_width))
    # Position the rectangle at the object's location
    O = paint(I, shift(asobject(rect), ulcorner(toindices(obj)))) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:** This version takes a constructive approach. It creates a separate rectangle of '1's with the desired dimensions and then paints it directly onto the input grid at the object's location.

## Code Extraction:

To extract the code for any of the versions, simply copy the code between the `def solve_generated(I):` and `return O` lines.
