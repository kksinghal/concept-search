## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a grid of digits and expands every occurrence of the digit '5' into a 3x3 square of '1's, centered at the original '5'.

**Input_0 Example:**

* A single '5' at (1, 1) becomes a 3x3 square of '1's centered at (1, 1). 
* A single '5' at (7, 7) becomes a 3x3 square of '1's centered at (7, 7).

**Input_1 Example:**

* Each of the three '5's are replaced with 3x3 squares of '1's in their respective locations. 
* When two '5's are close, their squares overlap, creating a larger connected area of '1's.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    fives = colorfilter(objs, FIVE)
    squares = mapply(lambda obj: backdrop(shift(obj, (-1, -1))), fives)
    O = fill(I, ONE, squares)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identify all connected objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`fives = colorfilter(objs, FIVE)`:** Filter out only the objects consisting of the digit '5'.
3. **`squares = mapply(lambda obj: backdrop(shift(obj, (-1, -1))), fives)`:**  For each '5' object:
    * **`shift(obj, (-1, -1))`:** Shift the object one cell up and one cell left to center the 3x3 square.
    * **`backdrop(...)`:**  Get the indices of the 3x3 bounding box around the shifted object.
4. **`O = fill(I, ONE, squares)`:** Fill the input grid `I` with the digit '1' at all the indices within the calculated squares.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == FIVE:
        for di in range(-1, 2):
          for dj in range(-1, 2):
            if 0 <= i + di < len(I) and 0 <= j + dj < len(I[0]):
              O = fill(O, ONE, {(i + di, j + dj)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initialize the output grid `O` with the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through every cell `(i, j)` of the grid:**
   * **`if I[i][j] == FIVE:`:** If the current cell contains a '5':
     * **Iterate through a 3x3 neighborhood around `(i, j)` using `di` and `dj`:** 
        * **`if 0 <= i + di < len(I) and 0 <= j + dj < len(I[0]):`:** Check if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries.
          * **`O = fill(O, ONE, {(i + di, j + dj)})`:** Fill the corresponding cell in the output grid `O` with a '1'.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    locs = ofcolor(I, FIVE)
    shifted = mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0] + i, loc[1] + j) for i in range(-1, 2) for j in range(-1, 2)}, locs)
    O = fill(I, ONE, shifted)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`locs = ofcolor(I, FIVE)`:** Get the indices of all cells containing the digit '5'.
2. **`shifted = mapply(lambda loc: ..., locs)`:** For each '5' location:
    * **`{(loc[0] + i, loc[1] + j) for i in range(-1, 2) for j in range(-1, 2)}`:** Generate the indices of the 3x3 square centered at the current '5'.
3. **`O = fill(I, ONE, shifted)`:** Fill the input grid `I` with '1's at all the calculated square indices.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    fives = colorfilter(objs, FIVE)
    squares = mfilter(lambda obj: backdrop(obj), apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (-1, -1)), fives))
    O = fill(I, ONE, squares)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is very similar to Version 1, but uses `mfilter` and `apply` instead of `mapply`.

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` & `fives = colorfilter(objs, FIVE)`:** Same as Version 1.
2. **`squares = mfilter(lambda obj: backdrop(obj), apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (-1, -1)), fives))`:**
    * **`apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (-1, -1)), fives)`:** Shifts each '5' object up and left.
    * **`mfilter(lambda obj: backdrop(obj), ...)`:** For each shifted object, calculate its bounding box and merge them.
3. **`O = fill(I, ONE, squares)`:** Same as Version 1.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    squares = set()
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val == FIVE:
                for di in range(-1, 2):
                    for dj in range(-1, 2):
                        new_i, new_j = i + di, j + dj
                        if 0 <= new_i < len(I) and 0 <= new_j < len(row):
                            squares.add((new_i, new_j))
    O = fill(I, ONE, frozenset(squares))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through the grid and directly calculates the indices of the 3x3 squares without using higher-level functions like `objects` or `mapply`.

1. **Iterate through every cell `(i, j)` of the grid:**
   * **`if val == FIVE:`:** If the cell contains a '5':
     * **Iterate through a 3x3 neighborhood around `(i, j)`:**
       * **Calculate `new_i` and `new_j` for the neighbor:**
       * **`if 0 <= new_i < len(I) and 0 <= new_j < len(row):`:** Check if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries.
         * **`squares.add((new_i, new_j))`:** Add the neighbor's coordinates to the `squares` set.
2. **`O = fill(I, ONE, frozenset(squares))`:** Fill the input grid `I` with '1's at all the collected `squares` indices.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches and function combinations within the DSL to achieve the same output, illustrating the flexibility and diversity possible within the DSL framework.
