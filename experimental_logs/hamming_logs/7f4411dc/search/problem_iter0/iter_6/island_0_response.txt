## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on relocating objects within the grid, specifically moving them upwards. 

* **Input_0 to Output_0:** The '7' objects are moved upwards until they reach the top of the grid or encounter another '7' object.
* **Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the previous transformation, the '6' objects are moved upwards. 
* **Input_2 to Output_2:** The '5' objects are moved upwards, leaving two empty rows at the bottom.


## Program Version 1

**Code:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, T, F, F)
  moved_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    upper = uppermost(obj)
    while upper > 0 and index(grid, (upper - 1, leftmost(obj))) == 0:
      obj = shift(obj, (-1, 0))
      upper -= 1
    moved_objs = insert(obj, moved_objs)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), moved_objs) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(grid, T, F, F)` identifies all connected objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Move:** The code iterates through each object (`obj`). 
   - `uppermost(obj)` finds the topmost row of the object.
   - The `while` loop moves the object upwards (`shift(obj, (-1, 0))`) as long as:
      - It's not at the top row (`upper > 0`).
      - The cell above is empty (`index(grid, (upper - 1, leftmost(obj))) == 0`).
3. **Paint Moved Objects:** After repositioning, the objects are painted (`paint()`) onto a blank canvas (`canvas(0, shape(grid))`) of the same size as the input grid.


## Program Version 2

**Code:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  h, w = shape(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for j in range(w):
    column = tuple(grid[i][j] for i in range(h))
    non_zeros = tuple(v for v in column if v != 0)
    new_column = (0,) * (h - len(non_zeros)) + non_zeros
    for i in range(h):
      new_grid = fill(new_grid, new_column[i], {(i, j)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Columns:** This version iterates through each column (`j`) of the grid.
2. **Process Column:** For each column:
   - It extracts the column values into `column`.
   - `non_zeros` stores the non-zero values of the column.
   - `new_column` is constructed by padding zeros at the beginning to align the non-zero values to the top.
3. **Fill New Grid:** The `new_grid` is filled cell by cell using values from `new_column`.

## Program Version 3

**Code:**

```python
def solve(grid):
    objs = objects(grid, T, F, F)
    new_grid = canvas(0, shape(grid))
    for obj in objs:
        obj_height = height(obj)
        obj_width = width(obj)
        top_left_corner = ulcorner(obj)
        new_top_left_corner = (top_left_corner[0] - obj_height + 1, top_left_corner[1])
        shifted_obj = shift(obj, subtract(new_top_left_corner, top_left_corner))
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, shifted_obj)
    return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(grid, T, F, F)` identifies connected objects.
2. **Calculate New Position:** For each object:
   - Calculate the height and width.
   - Determine the top-left corner's new position by subtracting the object's height from the original top-left corner's row index. 
3. **Shift and Paint:** Shift the object to its new position and paint it onto the `new_grid`.

## Program Version 4

**Code:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  h, w = shape(grid)
  new_grid = list(list(row) for row in grid)
  for j in range(w):
    for i in range(1, h):
      if new_grid[i][j] != 0 and new_grid[i-1][j] == 0:
        k = i
        while k > 0 and new_grid[k-1][j] == 0:
          new_grid[k-1][j] = new_grid[k][j]
          new_grid[k][j] = 0
          k -= 1
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **In-place Modification:** This version directly modifies the `grid` using nested loops.
2. **Move Upwards:** It iterates through each cell, and if a cell is non-zero and the cell above is zero, it moves the value upwards until it reaches the top or encounters a non-zero value.


## Program Version 5

**Code:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  return dmirror(compress(dmirror(grid)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transpose and Compress:** Uses `dmirror` to transpose the grid, then `compress` to remove empty rows (which are now columns after transposing), effectively moving objects upwards.
2. **Transpose Back:**  Applies `dmirror` again to return the grid to its original orientation.
