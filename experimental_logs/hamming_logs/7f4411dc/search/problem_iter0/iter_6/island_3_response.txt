## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to remove single-cell objects that are not the background color and shift all remaining objects to the left, effectively removing any vertical gaps. 

**Input 0:** Single-cell '7's are removed. The remaining '7' objects are shifted left to eliminate the gaps.

**Input 1:**  Single-cell '6's are removed.  The larger '6' objects are shifted left to eliminate the gaps.

**Input 2:**  The single '5' at the top right is removed. The remaining '5' object is shifted left. 


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions for achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Identify single-cell non-background objects
  x1 = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda obj: size(obj) == 1 and color(obj) != mostcommon(I))

  # 2. Determine the leftmost occupied column
  occupied_columns = mfilter(x1, lambda obj: {j for i, j in toindices(obj)})
  leftmost_column = minimum(occupied_columns)

  # 3. Shift remaining objects left
  shifted_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (0, -leftmost_column)) for obj in x1 if obj not in x2)

  # 4. Paint shifted objects onto a blank canvas
  O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(shifted_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify single-cell objects:**  We identify all objects and filter for those that have a size of 1 and a color different from the background.
2. **Determine leftmost column:** We find the minimum column index occupied by any object. This tells us how far to shift the objects.
3. **Shift remaining objects:** We shift all objects except the single-cell objects to the left by the calculated offset.
4. **Paint shifted objects:** Finally, we paint the shifted objects onto a canvas filled with the background color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Find the leftmost non-background column
  for j in range(width(I)):
    if any(I[i][j] != mostcommon(I) for i in range(height(I))):
      leftmost_column = j
      break
  else:  # No non-background columns found
    return I

  # 2. Crop the grid from the leftmost column
  O = crop(I, (0, leftmost_column), (height(I), width(I) - leftmost_column))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find leftmost non-background column:** We iterate through each column and check if it contains any non-background cells. 
2. **Crop the grid:** We crop the grid, starting from the leftmost non-background column, effectively removing the empty columns on the left.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Identify all objects
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)

  # 2. Filter out single-cell non-background objects
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: not (size(obj) == 1 and color(obj) != mostcommon(I)))

  # 3. Find minimum column index for each remaining object
  min_cols = apply(lambda obj: minimum({j for i, j in toindices(obj)}), filtered_objs)

  # 4. Sort objects based on their minimum column index
  sorted_objs = order(filtered_objs, lambda obj: minimum({j for i, j in toindices(obj)}))

  # 5.  Paint objects onto a blank canvas, shifting based on minimum column
  canvas_width = sum(width(obj) for obj in sorted_objs)
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), (height(I), canvas_width))
  current_column = 0
  for obj in sorted_objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, current_column - minimum({j for i, j in toindices(obj)}))))
    current_column += width(obj)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and filter objects:** Similar to version 1, we identify and filter the objects.
2. **Find minimum column:** We determine the minimum column index for each remaining object.
3. **Sort objects:** Objects are sorted based on their minimum column index.
4. **Paint objects sequentially:** We paint the sorted objects onto the canvas, shifting each object to the left based on its minimum column index, eliminating the gaps.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Create a list to store the shifted columns
  shifted_grid = []

  # 2. Iterate through the columns 
  for j in range(width(I)):
    # 3. Check if the column is empty (all background color)
    if any(I[i][j] != mostcommon(I) for i in range(height(I))):
      # 4. If not empty, append the column to the shifted grid
      shifted_grid.append([I[i][j] for i in range(height(I))])

  # 5. Convert the shifted columns back to a tuple (grid)
  O = tuple(tuple(row) for row in shifted_grid)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create shifted grid list:**  Initialize an empty list to store shifted columns.
2. **Iterate through columns:** Go through each column of the input grid.
3. **Check for empty columns:** Determine if the column is entirely filled with the background color.
4. **Append non-empty columns:** Add the column to the `shifted_grid` if it contains at least one non-background cell.
5. **Convert to tuple:** Transform the `shifted_grid` back into a tuple to represent the output grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Transpose the grid
  transposed = dmirror(I) 

  # 2. Apply Program_B on the transposed grid
  x1 = objects(transposed, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda obj: (size(obj) == 1 and index(transposed, first(toindices(obj))) != mostcommon(transposed)) or (vline(obj) and len(obj) < height(transposed)))
  x3 = merge(apply(toindices, x2))
  x4 = shape(transposed)
  x5 = crop(transposed, (0, 0), (x4[0], x4[1] - 1))
  intermediate = fill(x5, mostcommon(transposed), x3) 

  # 3. Transpose the result back 
  O = dmirror(intermediate)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transpose:**  We transpose the grid, effectively swapping rows and columns.
2. **Apply Program_B:** We apply Program_B on the transposed grid. Program_B removes single-cell non-background objects and shifts remaining objects in one direction (originally designed for horizontal shifting).
3. **Transpose Back:**  We transpose the result back to obtain the final output grid where single-cell non-background objects are removed and remaining objects are shifted left.

These five program versions demonstrate distinct approaches to solving the given transformation problem, utilizing different combinations of functions from the provided DSL.
