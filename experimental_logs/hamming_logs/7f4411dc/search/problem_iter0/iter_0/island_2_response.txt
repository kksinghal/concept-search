## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation removes all single-pixel objects from the grid, effectively performing noise reduction.

**Input_0:**  The single pixel '7's are removed, leaving only the larger '7' object.
**Input_1:**  All single pixel '6's are removed, leaving only the larger '6' object.
**Input_2:**  The single pixel '5's are removed, leaving only the larger '5' object. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_noise_reduction(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Find all objects, including diagonals, without background
  filtered_objs = frozenset(obj for obj in objs if size(obj) > 1) # Filter out single-pixel objects
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(filtered_objs))  # Paint remaining objects onto a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all connected objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Filter Objects:** `sizefilter(x1, ONE)` keeps only the objects that have a size greater than one.
3. **Paint to Canvas:** `paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(filtered_objs))` first creates a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input. Then, it paints the remaining objects onto this canvas.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_noise_reduction(I):
    return cellwise(I, fill(I, -1, merge(sizefilter(objects(I, T, T, T), 1))), I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Mark Single Pixels:** Creates a copy of the input grid and fills all single-pixel objects with a temporary value (-1).
2. **Cellwise Comparison:** Compares the original grid with the modified grid cell by cell. If the values match, the original value is kept; otherwise, the original value is retained (effectively removing the temporary value).

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_noise_reduction(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if size(obj) == 1:
      O = cover(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Remove:** Iterates through each object, and if it's a single-pixel object, it covers it with the background color on the output grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_noise_reduction(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates a blank canvas with the same background color and dimensions as the input.
2. **Paint Larger Objects:** Iterates through each object, and if it has a size greater than one, it paints it onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_noise_reduction(I):
  single_pixels = merge(sizefilter(objects(I, T, T, T), 1))
  O = I
  for i, j in asindices(I):
    if (i, j) in single_pixels:
      O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(i, j)})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Single Pixels:** Finds all single-pixel objects and merges their indices.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** Iterates through all grid indices and, if an index is part of the single-pixel set, fills it with the background color.
