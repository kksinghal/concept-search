## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to remove any vertical frontier objects from the input grid while leaving the rest of the objects untouched. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** The vertical line of 7s on the right side of the grid is removed.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:** The two single-column lines of 6s on the right side of the grid are removed.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:** The single-column line of 5s on the right side of the grid is removed.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = frontiers(I)  # Identify all frontier objects
  x2 = sfilter(x1, vline)  # Filter for vertical line frontiers
  x3 = apply(toindices, x2)  # Get indices of vertical frontiers
  x4 = merge(x3)  # Merge indices into a single set
  x5 = mostcolor(I)  # Find the background color
  O = fill(I, x5, x4)  # Fill the frontier indices with background color
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version directly identifies vertical frontiers using `frontiers` and `vline`, then removes them by filling their indices with the background color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = dmirror(I)  # Mirror the grid diagonally
  x2 = frontiers(x1)  # Find frontiers in the mirrored grid
  x3 = sfilter(x2, hline)  # Filter for horizontal lines (originally vertical)
  x4 = apply(toindices, x3)  # Get indices
  x5 = merge(x4)  # Merge indices
  x6 = dmirror(x5)  # Mirror indices back to original orientation
  x7 = mostcolor(I)  # Get background color
  O = fill(I, x7, x6)  # Fill frontier indices
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version cleverly utilizes diagonal mirroring to treat vertical lines as horizontal lines, simplifying the filtering process.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, False, False, False)  # Get all objects in the grid
  x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda obj: vline(obj) and bordering(obj, I))  # Filter for bordering vertical lines
  x3 = apply(toindices, x2)  # Get indices of the lines
  x4 = merge(x3)  # Merge indices
  x5 = mostcolor(I)  # Find background color
  O = fill(I, x5, x4)  # Fill the indices with background
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version focuses on identifying vertical lines that are directly bordering the grid boundaries.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = width(I)  # Get the width of the grid
  x2 = decrement(x1)  # Get the index of the last column
  x3 = tojvec(x2)  # Create a vector pointing to the last column
  x4 = vfrontier(x3)  # Create a vertical frontier at the last column
  x5 = toobject(x4, I)  # Get the object at the last column
  x6 = color(x5)  # Get the color of the potential frontier
  x7 = colorcount(I, x6)  # Count occurrences of that color in the grid
  x8 = multiply(height(I), width(x5))  # Calculate the expected count if it's a frontier
  x9 = branch(equality(x7, x8), x4, initset((-1, -1)))  # Check if it's a frontier
  x10 = mostcolor(I)  # Get background color
  O = fill(I, x10, x9)  # Fill the frontier if found, otherwise do nothing
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version uses a different approach by analyzing the last column to determine if it's a vertical frontier.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = compress(I)  # Compress the grid, removing all frontiers
  x2 = shape(I)  # Get the original shape
  x3 = shape(x1)  # Get the shape after compression
  x4 = subtract(x2, x3)  # Calculate the difference in dimensions
  x5 = astuple(ZERO, x4[1])  # Create an offset for the remaining grid
  x6 = canvas(mostcolor(I), x2)  # Create a canvas with the original size and background color
  O = paint(x6, shift(asobject(x1), x5))  # Paint the compressed grid onto the canvas with the correct offset
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version cleverly utilizes the `compress` function to remove all frontiers and then reconstructs the grid with the remaining objects.

These five versions provide diverse solutions by employing different logic and function combinations to achieve the same goal of removing vertical frontier objects. Each version demonstrates a unique approach to solving the transformation, showcasing the flexibility and power of the provided DSL.
