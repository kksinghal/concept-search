## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** Remove any standalone cells of the secondary color (in this case, the digit '7') that are not part of the main connected shapes. The main connected shapes remain unchanged.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**  Similar to the first transformation, remove standalone cells of the secondary color ('6') while preserving the connected shapes. 

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**  Again, remove any standalone cells of the secondary color ('5') while keeping the connected shape intact.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the `Program_to_be_generated` function using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=False) # Identify all objects
    x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1) # Filter for objects larger than one cell
    x3 = merge(x2) # Merge the filtered objects
    x4 = toindices(x3) # Get indices of remaining objects
    x5 = mostcolor(I) # Identify the background color
    O = fill(I, x5, difference(asindices(I), x4)) # Fill non-object cells with background
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=False)`: Finds all connected objects in the input grid, allowing for different colors within an object and considering diagonal connections. 
2. `sfilter(x1, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)`: Filters the objects, keeping only those with more than one cell.
3. `merge(x2)`: Merges the filtered objects back into a single object.
4. `toindices(x3)`: Extracts the indices of the cells belonging to the remaining objects.
5. `mostcolor(I)`: Determines the background color.
6. `fill(I, x5, difference(asindices(I), x4))`: Fills all cells in the grid that are not part of the remaining objects (i.e., standalone cells) with the background color.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = partition(I)  # Partition the grid into objects based on color
    x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)  # Keep objects with more than one cell
    x3 = toindices(merge(x2)) # Merge and extract indices
    O = underfill(I, mostcolor(I), difference(asindices(I), x3)) # Underfill with background
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `partition(I)`: Divides the grid into objects, grouping cells with the same color.
2. `sfilter(x1, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)`: Keeps only objects consisting of more than one cell.
3. `toindices(merge(x2))`: Merges the remaining objects and extracts the indices of their cells.
4. `underfill(I, mostcolor(I), difference(asindices(I), x3))`: Fills all cells that are not part of the remaining objects with the background color, effectively removing standalone cells.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False) # Find all objects
    x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda obj: size(toindices(obj)) != 1) # Filter out single-cell objects
    O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(x2)) # Paint filtered objects onto a blank canvas
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)`:  Identifies all connected objects in the grid.
2. `sfilter(x1, lambda obj: size(toindices(obj)) != 1)`:  Selects objects that are not composed of a single cell.
3. `paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(x2))`: Creates a new grid filled with the background color and paints the filtered objects onto this canvas.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True) # Identify objects without background
  x2 = apply(toindices, x1) # Extract indices of each object
  x3 = mfilter(x2, lambda indices: size(indices) > 1) # Keep indices of objects larger than one
  O = underfill(I, mostcolor(I), difference(asindices(I), x3)) # Underfill with background
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True)`:  Identifies connected objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. `apply(toindices, x1)`: Extracts the cell indices for each identified object.
3. `mfilter(x2, lambda indices: size(indices) > 1)`: Filters and merges the indices, keeping only those belonging to objects with more than one cell.
4. `underfill(I, mostcolor(I), difference(asindices(I), x3))`: Fills the cells not belonging to the larger objects with the background color.


**Program Version 5**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
    filtered_objs = frozenset(obj for obj in objs if len(obj) > 1)
    O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(filtered_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)`: Finds all connected objects in the grid, considering each color as a separate object.
2. `filtered_objs = frozenset(obj for obj in objs if len(obj) > 1)`: Filters the objects, keeping only those that have more than one cell.
3. `paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(filtered_objs))`: Creates a new grid filled with the background color and then paints the filtered objects onto it. This effectively removes all standalone cells from the original grid.

These program versions utilize different combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same goal. They demonstrate various approaches to identifying and preserving connected shapes while removing standalone cells in a grid.
