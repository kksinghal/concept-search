## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied in all input-output pairs can be described as **removing vertical lines of the input grid**. 

Let's break down the transformation for each pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:** All vertical lines formed by the digit '7' are removed, leaving only horizontal lines of '7's.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**  Vertical lines formed by the digit '6' are removed. Notice that isolated '6's are not considered part of a line and are left untouched.

**Input_2 - Output_2:** The vertical line of '5's on the left side of the grid is removed. 

## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = dmirror(I)  # Mirror the grid diagonally
  x2 = frontiers(x1)  # Find frontiers in the mirrored grid
  x3 = sfilter(x2, hline)  # Filter for horizontal lines (originally vertical)
  x4 = apply(toindices, x3)  # Get indices
  x5 = merge(x4)  # Merge indices
  x6 = dmirror(x5)  # Mirror indices back to original orientation
  x7 = mostcolor(I)  # Get background color
  O = fill(I, x7, x6)  # Fill frontier indices with background color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Mirror:** Diagonally mirror the grid (`x1`) to transform vertical lines into horizontal lines.
2. **Find Frontiers:** Identify all frontiers in the mirrored grid (`x2`).
3. **Filter Horizontal Lines:** Select only the frontiers representing horizontal lines (`x3`).
4. **Extract Indices:** Obtain the indices of the cells forming the horizontal lines (`x4`, `x5`).
5. **Mirror Back:** Mirror the indices back to their original orientation (`x6`).
6. **Fill with Background:** Fill the cells at the obtained indices with the background color (`x7`, `O`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)  # Find all objects
    x2 = sfilter(x1, vline)  # Keep only vertical line objects
    x3 = apply(toindices, x2)  # Extract indices of vertical lines
    x4 = merge(x3)  # Merge all indices
    x5 = mostcolor(I)  # Get the background color
    O = fill(I, x5, x4)  # Fill vertical line indices with background
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find all connected objects within the grid (`x1`).
2. **Filter Vertical Lines:** Isolate objects that represent vertical lines (`x2`).
3. **Extract Indices:** Get the indices of cells belonging to vertical lines (`x3`, `x4`).
4. **Fill with Background:**  Replace the values at the obtained indices with the background color (`x5`, `O`).

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = mostcolor(I)  # Find the background color
    x2 = canvas(x1, shape(I))  # Create a canvas filled with the background color
    x3 = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)  # Get all objects
    x4 = sfilter(x3, lambda obj: not vline(obj))  # Keep objects that are not vertical lines
    O = paint(x2, merge(apply(toobject, x4, repeat(I, size(x4)))))  # Paint the remaining objects onto the canvas
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Prepare Canvas:**  Create a new grid (`x2`) with the same size as the input, filled with the background color (`x1`).
2. **Identify and Filter:** Extract all objects from the input (`x3`) and discard those representing vertical lines (`x4`).
3. **Paint Remaining Objects:**  Paint the remaining objects onto the prepared canvas (`O`).

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = dmirror(I)  # Mirror the input diagonally
  x2 = apply(set, x1)  # Convert each row to a set 
  x3 = sfilter(x2, lambda row: len(row) > 1)  # Keep rows with more than one unique value
  x4 = astuple(*x3)  # Convert back to a tuple of tuples (grid format)
  O = dmirror(x4)  # Mirror back to original orientation
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Diagonal Mirroring:**  Mirror the input grid diagonally (`x1`).
2. **Identify Vertical Lines:** Convert each row to a set (`x2`). Vertical lines will become rows with only one unique element. 
3. **Filter Out Lines:** Retain rows containing more than one unique element (`x3`).
4. **Reconstruction and Mirroring:**  Convert the filtered rows back into a grid format (`x4`) and mirror diagonally to obtain the final output (`O`).

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)  # Get all objects
  x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda obj: width(obj) > 1 or height(obj) == 1)  # Keep objects that are wider than one cell or are horizontal lines
  x3 = mostcolor(I)  # Get the background color
  x4 = canvas(x3, shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas filled with background color
  O = paint(x4, merge(apply(toobject, x2, repeat(I, size(x2)))))  # Paint the kept objects onto the blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:**  Identify all connected objects in the input grid (`x1`).
2. **Filter for Non-Vertical Lines:** Select objects that are either wider than one cell or represent horizontal lines (`x2`).
3. **Canvas Preparation:** Create a new grid (`x4`) of the same size as the input and fill it with the background color (`x3`).
4. **Paint Filtered Objects:** Paint the filtered objects onto the prepared canvas (`O`). 

These five distinct programs showcase different approaches to achieve the same objective of removing vertical lines, highlighting the flexibility and power of the provided DSL.
