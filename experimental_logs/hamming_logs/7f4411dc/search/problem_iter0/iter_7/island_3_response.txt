## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves removing single-pixel objects that don't share color with the most common color (background) and then shifting all remaining objects to the left, eliminating any empty columns on the left side.

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 
- Single-pixel '7's at (0,1), (8,1), (9,1) are removed.
- The remaining '7' objects are shifted left, removing the first two empty columns.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- Single-pixel '6's at (1,12), (3,12), (9,12), (15,12) are removed.
- All remaining '6' objects are shifted left, removing the first three empty columns.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** 
-  The single-pixel '5's at (1,6), (6,6) are removed.
- The remaining '5' object is shifted left, removing the first column.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Identify single-cell objects not matching the background color
  single_cell_objs = sfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: size(obj) == 1 and color(obj) != mostcommon(I))
  
  # 2. Remove single-cell objects from the input grid
  I = cover(I, merge(apply(toindices, single_cell_objs)))
  
  # 3. Identify remaining objects
  remaining_objs = objects(I, True, False, False)

  # 4. Find the leftmost occupied column
  leftmost_column = minimum(merge(apply(lambda obj: {j for i, j in toindices(obj)}, remaining_objs)))
  
  # 5. Shift remaining objects left
  shifted_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (0, -leftmost_column)) for obj in remaining_objs)
  
  # 6. Paint shifted objects onto a blank canvas
  O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(shifted_objs))
  return O
```
**Explanation:** 
1.  Identifies and removes single-cell objects that don't match the background color.
2. Covers the positions of these objects on the input grid with the background color.
3. Identifies the remaining objects on the modified grid.
4. Finds the leftmost occupied column index.
5. Shifts each remaining object to the left by `leftmost_column`.
6. Paints these shifted objects onto a new canvas filled with the background color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Get background color
  bg = mostcommon(I)
  
  # 2. Create a mask of single-pixel non-background objects
  mask = apply(toindices, sfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: size(obj) == 1 and color(obj) != bg))

  # 3. Shift all columns left based on the mask
  O = tuple(
      tuple(
          I[i][j] if (i, j) not in mask else bg 
          for j in range(width(I))
      )
      for i in range(height(I))
  )
  for j in range(width(I)):
      if any(O[i][j] != bg for i in range(height(I))):
          break
  O = tuple(tuple(v for k, v in enumerate(row) if k >= j) for row in O)
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1.  Determines the background color.
2.  Creates a mask of indices where single-pixel non-background objects are located.
3. Iterates through the grid, replacing pixels marked in the mask with the background color. Then, it iterates through columns to find the first non-empty one and slices the grid from that point onwards.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Identify objects, excluding single-pixel non-background ones
  objs = sfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: not (size(obj) == 1 and color(obj) != mostcommon(I)))
  
  # 2. Calculate the total width of the remaining objects
  total_width = sum(width(obj) for obj in objs)
  
  # 3. Create a blank canvas with the calculated width
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), (height(I), total_width))
  
  # 4. Paint objects onto the canvas, aligning them from the left
  current_column = 0
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, current_column - leftmost(obj))))
    current_column += width(obj)
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. Filters out single-pixel objects not matching the background.
2. Calculates the total width required to accommodate the remaining objects.
3. Creates a blank canvas with the correct dimensions.
4. Iterates through each object, placing it on the canvas and updating the current column position.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Identify and remove single-pixel non-background objects (same as V1)
  single_cell_objs = sfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: size(obj) == 1 and color(obj) != mostcommon(I))
  I = cover(I, merge(apply(toindices, single_cell_objs)))
  
  # 2. Get indices of non-background cells
  non_bg_indices = ofcolor(I, other(palette(I), mostcommon(I)))
  
  # 3. Find leftmost column and shift indices
  leftmost_column = minimum({j for _, j in non_bg_indices})
  shifted_indices = frozenset((i, j - leftmost_column) for i, j in non_bg_indices)
  
  # 4. Paint onto a new canvas
  O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), (height(I), len(shifted_indices))), recolor(other(palette(I), mostcommon(I)), shifted_indices))
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. Removes single-pixel non-background objects like in version 1.
2. Finds the indices of all remaining cells that are not the background color.
3. Determines the leftmost column and shifts these indices accordingly.
4. Creates a canvas with appropriate dimensions and paints the shifted indices with their respective color. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Identify all objects 
  all_objs = objects(I, True, False, False)

  # 2. Identify single-cell non-background objects and get their indices
  single_cell_indices = merge(apply(toindices, sfilter(all_objs, lambda obj: size(obj) == 1 and color(obj) != mostcommon(I))))
  
  # 3. Find the leftmost occupied column (excluding single-cell objects)
  occupied_columns = {j for obj in all_objs for i, j in toindices(obj) if (i, j) not in single_cell_indices}
  leftmost_column = minimum(occupied_columns) if occupied_columns else 0

  # 4. Shift and paint objects onto a new canvas
  O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(shift(obj, (0, -leftmost_column)) for obj in all_objs if toindices(obj) - single_cell_indices))
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. Identifies all objects within the input grid.
2.  Finds the indices of all single-pixel objects that don't match the background color.
3.  Determines the leftmost column occupied by the remaining objects.
4.  Shifts all objects except the identified single-cell ones to the left and paints them on a new canvas.

These five versions offer diverse implementations, leveraging various DSL functions and strategies to achieve the desired transformation. Each version handles potential edge cases and aims for efficient execution within the constraints of the provided DSL.
