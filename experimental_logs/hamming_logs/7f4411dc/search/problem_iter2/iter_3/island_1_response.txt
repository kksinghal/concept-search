## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on identifying and manipulating the smallest object in the input grid. Here's a breakdown for each pair:

**Pair 0:** The smallest object (a single '7') is replicated to the right of the larger '7' object. 

**Pair 1:** Similar to Pair 0, the smallest object (again a single '6') is duplicated. This time, it's placed to the left of the main '6' object.

**Pair 2:** The pattern continues. The smallest '5' object (a single digit) is copied and positioned to the left of the primary '5' object.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct programs that achieve the desired transformation, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  smallest = argmin(objs, size)
  color = lambda x: next(iter(x))[0]
  shifted = shift(smallest, (0, width(smallest)))
  return paint(I, shifted)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all distinct objects in the grid `I`. 
2. **Find Smallest:** `argmin(objs, size)` finds the smallest object based on its size.
3. **Get Color:** `color(smallest)` retrieves the color of the smallest object.
4. **Shift Right:** `shift(smallest, (0, width(smallest)))` shifts the smallest object to the right by its width, effectively duplicating it.
5. **Paint:** `paint(I, shifted)` paints the shifted object onto the original grid, creating the output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  min_size = size(argmin(objs, size))
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) == min_size)
  return paint(I, shift(first(filtered_objs), (0, width(first(filtered_objs)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Same as Version 1.
2. **Find Minimum Size:** `min_size = size(argmin(objs, size))` determines the size of the smallest object.
3. **Filter by Size:** `filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) == min_size)` filters the objects, keeping only those with the minimum size.
4. **Shift and Paint:** Similar to Version 1, it takes the first object in the filtered set, shifts it right, and paints it onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  smallest = argmin(objs, size)
  c = color(smallest)
  return paint(I, {(c, (i, j + width(smallest))) for c, (i, j) in smallest}) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects & Smallest:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Extract Color:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Shift During Painting:** Instead of a separate shift function, this version directly modifies the indices of the smallest object during the painting process, effectively shifting it right.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  smallest_idx = argmin(range(len(objs)), lambda i: size(totuple(objs)[i]))
  smallest = totuple(objs)[smallest_idx] 
  return paint(I, shift(smallest, (0, width(smallest))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Find Smallest Index:** This version finds the index of the smallest object within the `objs` tuple.
3. **Extract Smallest:**  `smallest = totuple(objs)[smallest_idx]` retrieves the smallest object using the index.
4. **Shift and Paint:** Same as Version 1.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  smallest = min(objs, key=len) 
  offset = (0, width(smallest))
  return paint(I, {(v, add(ij, offset)) for v, ij in smallest})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Find Smallest:** `smallest = min(objs, key=len)` utilizes Python's built-in `min` function to find the smallest object by length.
3. **Define Offset:** Explicitly defines the offset for the shift.
4. **Shift and Paint:**  Shifts the object during painting using the `add` function for index manipulation. 

## Conclusion:

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same outcome, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.  Each version uses a unique combination of functions, showcasing alternative logic flows and coding styles while maintaining the core transformation logic.
