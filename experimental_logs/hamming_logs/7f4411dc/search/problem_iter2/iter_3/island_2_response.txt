## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding a column to the right of the input grid, filled with the most common color (background color) of the grid.

**Input 0:** A column of zeros (background color) is added to the right of the input grid.

**Input 1:** A column of zeros (background color) is added to the right of the input grid.

**Input 2:** A column of zeros (background color) is added to the right of the input grid.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL functions provided:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  return hconcat(grid, canvas(bg, (height(grid), 1))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(grid)`:** Determine the background color of the input grid.
2. **`canvas(bg, (height(grid), 1))`:** Create a new grid with the same height as the input grid and a width of 1, filled with the background color.
3. **`hconcat(grid, ...)`:** Concatenate the input grid with the newly created grid containing only the background color, effectively adding a column to the right.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return hconcat(grid, apply(lambda row: (row + (mostcolor(grid),)), grid))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`apply(lambda row: (row + (mostcolor(grid),)), grid)`:** For each row in the input grid, add a tuple containing the background color to the end of the row.
2. **`hconcat(grid, ...)`:** Concatenate the input grid with the modified grid containing the added background color column.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  return tuple(tuple(v for v in row) + (bg,) for row in grid) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(grid)`:** Determine the background color of the input grid.
2. **`tuple(tuple(v for v in row) + (bg,) for row in grid)`:** Iterate through each row in the grid and create a new tuple where each element is the original row element followed by the background color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(row + tuple(repeat(mostcolor(grid), 1)) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`repeat(mostcolor(grid), 1)`:** Create a tuple with one element which is the background color.
2. **`tuple(row + ... for row in grid)`:** For each row in the input grid, concatenate the row with the newly created background color tuple.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return hconcat(grid, tuple((mostcolor(grid),) for _ in range(height(grid))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`tuple((mostcolor(grid),) for _ in range(height(grid)))`:** Create a grid with the same height as the input grid and a width of 1, where each element is a tuple containing the background color.
2. **`hconcat(grid, ...)`:** Concatenate the input grid with the newly created background color grid.

Each of these program versions effectively adds a column of background color to the right of the input grid, achieving the desired transformation for all three input-output pairs.
