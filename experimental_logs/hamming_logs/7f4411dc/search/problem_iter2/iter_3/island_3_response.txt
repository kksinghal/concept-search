## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves adding a column of zeros to the right edge of the grid, effectively widening the grid by one column.

**Input 0:**  A new column of zeros is added to the right of the rightmost column of 7s.

**Input 1:** Similarly, a new column of zeros is added to the right edge of the grid.

**Input 2:**  The pattern repeats, with a new column of zeros added to the rightmost column.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Get the shape (height, width) of the input grid.
  h, w = shape(I)
  # 2. Create a canvas of zeros with the desired output dimensions (height, width + 1).
  O = canvas(0, (h, w + 1))
  # 3. Paint the input grid onto the canvas, effectively shifting it one position to the left.
  O = paint(O, asobject(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  We determine the height and width of the input grid.
2.  A new canvas is created with an extra column compared to the input grid, filled with zeros.
3.  The input grid is "painted" onto this canvas, resulting in the desired right-shifted output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Split the input grid into a list of its columns.
  cols = hsplit(I, width(I))
  # 2. Create a column of zeros with the same height as the input.
  zero_col = tuple(repeat(0, height(I)))
  # 3. Add the zero column to the end of the list of columns.
  cols = (*cols, zero_col)
  # 4. Concatenate the columns horizontally to create the output grid.
  O = hconcat(*cols)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  The input grid is decomposed into a list of its columns.
2.  A column of zeros is created, matching the height of the input grid.
3.  This zero column is appended to the list of columns.
4.  Finally, all columns are horizontally concatenated to form the output grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Create a canvas of zeros with dimensions one column wider than the input.
  O = canvas(0, add(shape(I), (0, 1)))
  # 2. Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
  for i in range(height(I)):
      for j in range(width(I)):
          # 3. Paint the value of the current input cell to the corresponding cell in the output canvas, shifted one position to the left.
          O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), (i, j))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  An output grid filled with zeros and one column wider than the input is created.
2.  The program iterates through every cell of the input grid.
3.  For each cell, the corresponding cell in the output grid (shifted one position to the left) is filled with the value from the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # 1. Get the object representation of the input grid.
    obj = asobject(I)
    # 2. Shift all the cells in the object one position to the left.
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, (0, 1))
    # 3. Create a canvas of zeros with the same dimensions as the input grid, plus an additional column.
    canvas_grid = canvas(0, (height(I), width(I) + 1))
    # 4. Paint the shifted object onto the canvas.
    O = paint(canvas_grid, shifted_obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  The input grid is converted into its object representation.
2.  All cells within the object are then shifted one position to the left.
3.  A new canvas is created with an extra column compared to the input grid, filled with zeros.
4.  The shifted object is "painted" onto this canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Horizontally concatenate the input grid with a single-column grid of zeros.
  O = hconcat(I, tuple((0,) * height(I),))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  A new grid containing a single column of zeros is created, with the same height as the input grid.
2.  This zero-column grid is horizontally concatenated with the input grid, directly producing the desired output.
