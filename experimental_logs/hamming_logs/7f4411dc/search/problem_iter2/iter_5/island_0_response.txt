## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently adds a column of zeros to the right of each input grid. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** The output grid is the same as the input grid but with an extra column of zeros on the right.

**Pair 1:**  Similar to Pair 0, a column of zeros is added to the right of the input grid.

**Pair 2:** The pattern continues, extending the input grid with a column of zeros. 


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return hconcat(I, tuple(((0,) * len(I[0])),))
```

**Explanation:**

- `len(I[0])`: Calculates the width (number of columns) of the input grid `I`.
- `(0,) * len(I[0])`: Creates a tuple containing a sequence of zeros equal to the width of the input grid.
- `tuple(((0,) * len(I[0])),)`: Encloses the tuple of zeros within another tuple to make it a valid argument for `hconcat`.
- `hconcat(I, tuple(((0,) * len(I[0])),))`: Concatenates the input grid `I` with the newly created column of zeros horizontally, effectively adding a column of zeros to the right.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(len(I[0])):
    O = paint(O, {(0, (j, len(I[0])))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- `len(I[0])`: Determines the width of the input grid `I`.
- `for j in range(len(I[0])):`: Iterates over each column index `j` of the input grid.
- `paint(O, {(0, (j, len(I[0])))})`: For each column, paints a cell with value `0` at the end of that column (row `j`, column `len(I[0])` which is one position beyond the last column) on the grid `O`, effectively adding a zero to the right of each row.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(row + (0,) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

- This program directly uses tuple comprehension to achieve the desired transformation. 
- `row + (0,)`:  For each row in the input grid, it concatenates a tuple containing a single zero to the end of the row. 
- `tuple(...)`: This constructs a new tuple from the modified rows, effectively adding a column of zeros to the right.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (len(I), len(I[0]) + 1))
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

- `canvas(0, (len(I), len(I[0]) + 1))`: Creates a new canvas filled with zeros. The canvas has the same number of rows as the input but one extra column.
- `for i in range(len(I))`:  Iterates through each row of the input grid.
- `for j in range(len(I[0]))`: Iterates through each column of the input grid.
- `paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))})`:  Paints the corresponding value from the input grid onto the canvas at the same (i, j) location.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return hconcat(I, crop(canvas(0, (len(I), 1)), (0, 0), (len(I), 1))) 
```

**Explanation:**

- `canvas(0, (len(I), 1))`: Creates a canvas filled with zeros, having the same number of rows as the input and a single column.
- `crop(..., (0, 0), (len(I), 1))`: Crops the canvas to have the same dimensions as a single-column grid with the same height as the input.
- `hconcat(I, ...)`: Concatenates the input grid with this column of zeros, effectively adding a column of zeros to the right.

Each of these programs effectively adds a column of zeros to the right of the input grid, achieving the observed transformation.
