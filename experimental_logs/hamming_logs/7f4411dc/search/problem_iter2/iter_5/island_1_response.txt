## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding a new column to the right of the input grid. This new column is filled with the background color (most common color) of the input grid.

**Input 0:** A new column of zeros is added to the right of the input grid.

**Input 1:** A new column of zeros is added to the right of the input grid.

**Input 2:** A new column of zeros is added to the right of the input grid.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return hconcat(I, tuple((mostcolor(I),) * len(I) for _ in range(1)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mostcolor(I)`:** Determines the background color of the input grid `I`.
2. **`(mostcolor(I),) * len(I)`:** Creates a tuple representing a single column filled with the background color, with the same height as the input grid.
3. **`tuple(...) for _ in range(1))`:** Encloses the column tuple within another tuple, effectively creating a grid with a single column. 
4. **`hconcat(I, ...)`:** Concatenates the input grid `I` with the newly created single-column grid, effectively adding a new column to the right.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(row + (mostcolor(I),) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mostcolor(I)`:** Determines the background color of the input grid `I`.
2. **`row + (mostcolor(I),)`:** For each row in the input grid, this adds a new element containing the background color to the end of the row.
3. **`tuple(... for row in I)`:** Iterates through each row of the input grid and applies the row extension, creating a new grid with the added column.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(v if j < len(I[0]) else mostcolor(I) for j, v in enumerate(r)) for r in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mostcolor(I)`:** Determines the background color of the input grid `I`.
2. **`j < len(I[0])`:**  For each cell, checks if the column index `j` is within the original width of the grid.
3. **`v if ... else mostcolor(I)`:** If the cell is within the original grid, keeps its value `v`; otherwise, assigns the background color.
4. **`tuple(...) for j, v in enumerate(r))`:**  Applies this logic to each cell within a row.
5. **`tuple(... for r in I)`:** Applies the same logic to each row, creating the final output grid.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (len(I), len(I[0])+1))
  return tuple(tuple(I[i][j] if j < len(I[0]) else O[i][j] for j in range(len(O[0]))) for i in range(len(I))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), (len(I), len(I[0])+1))`:** Creates a canvas filled with the background color, with one extra column than the input grid.
2. **`I[i][j] if j < len(I[0]) else O[i][j]`:** Fills the canvas with values from the input grid for the original columns and retains the background color for the new column.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return hconcat(I,  vupscale(((mostcolor(I)),), len(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`(mostcolor(I)),)`:** Creates a tuple containing only the background color, representing a 1x1 grid.
2.  **`vupscale(..., len(I))`:**  Vertically scales the 1x1 grid to match the height of the input grid.
3. **`hconcat(I, ...)`:** Concatenates the input grid with the newly created single-column grid, adding a new column to the right.
