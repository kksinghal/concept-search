## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently adds a column of zeros to the right side of the input grid. 

**Example Breakdown:**

- **Input_0:** A 13x12 grid is transformed into a 13x13 grid with an additional column of zeros on the right.
- **Input_1:** A 17x16 grid is transformed into a 17x17 grid with an additional column of zeros on the right.
- **Input_2:** A 7x6 grid is transformed into a 7x7 grid with an additional column of zeros on the right.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Adds a column of zeros to the right of the input grid.
  """
  h = height(I)  # Get the height of the grid.
  w = width(I)  # Get the width of the grid.
  O = canvas(0, (h, w + 1))  # Create a canvas of zeros with an extra column.
  O = paint(O, asobject(I))  # Paint the original grid onto the canvas.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get dimensions:** `height(I)` and `width(I)` retrieve the grid's height and width.
2. **Create canvas:** `canvas(0, (h, w + 1))` generates a grid of zeros with dimensions (height, width + 1).
3. **Paint original grid:** `paint(O, asobject(I))` copies the input grid onto the canvas, leaving the extra column as zeros.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Appends a column of zeros to the input grid.
  """
  return hconcat(I, tuple((0,) * height(I))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create zero column:** `tuple((0,) * height(I))` generates a tuple representing a column of zeros with the same height as the input grid.
2. **Concatenate:** `hconcat(I, ...)` appends the zero column to the right of the input grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Extends the input grid with a zero column.
  """
  return tuple(row + (0,) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate rows:** The code iterates through each row of the input grid.
2. **Append zero:** For each `row`, a zero (`(0,)`) is appended to the end.
3. **Return as grid:** The modified rows are returned as a new grid.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Inserts a column of zeros at the last index of each row.
  """
  return tuple(tuple(v if j < len(row) else 0 for j, v in enumerate(row)) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate rows and cells:** The code iterates through each row and then each cell within the row.
2. **Conditional insertion:** If the cell index (`j`) is less than the row length, the original value (`v`) is kept. Otherwise, a zero is inserted.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Combines the input grid with a zero-filled grid shifted to the right.
  """
  h, w = shape(I)
  zeros = canvas(0, (h, w + 1))
  shifted_input = paint(zeros, shift(asobject(I), (0, 1)))
  return tuple(tuple(i if i != 0 else j for i, j in zip(row1, row2)) for row1, row2 in zip(shifted_input, zeros))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create grids:** Two grids are created - `zeros` (filled with zeros and one column wider) and `shifted_input` (input grid shifted one column to the right on the `zeros` grid).
2. **Combine grids:** The code iterates through both grids simultaneously, selecting the non-zero value from `shifted_input` or the zero value from `zeros`. 

These five program versions offer diverse approaches to achieve the same grid transformation, demonstrating flexibility in utilizing the DSL functions.
