## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding a column of zeros to the right of the input grid. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:** A column of zeros is added to the right side of the grid, effectively widening it by one column.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  The same transformation is applied - a column of zeros is added to the right side.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** Again, a new rightmost column of zeros is added to the grid.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Let's explore five distinct ways to implement this transformation using the provided DSL:

**Version 1:  Leveraging 'heccaehheddhedhajdbdbicdcbcabdcf'  and 'adgcdbfhhfbeebeejdfecfabiaihcaji'**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Get the grid's height.
  x1 = height(I)
  # 2. Create a column vector filled with zeros.
  x2 = tuple((0,) for row in range(x1))
  # 3. Concatenate the input grid with the zero column vector.
  O = hconcat(I, x2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. We extract the height of the input grid (`x1`).
2. We generate a column vector (`x2`) with the same height as the input grid, filled with zeros.
3. We utilize `hconcat` to horizontally combine the input grid and the zero column, effectively adding a column of zeros to the right. 

**Version 2: Inspired by 'bhjdecddaabbeiacajbecdgedjabfjbe' **

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Create a single-column grid of zeros with the same height as the input.
  zero_column = tuple((0,) for _ in range(height(I)))
  # 2. Horizontally concatenate the input grid with the zero column.
  O = hconcat(I, zero_column)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version directly constructs the zero-filled column (`zero_column`) using a tuple comprehension. 
2. It then uses `hconcat` to join the input grid and the zero column.

**Version 3:  A Canvas-Based Approach**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Create a canvas of zeros one column wider than the input.
  O = canvas(0, (height(I), width(I) + 1)) 
  # 2. Paint the input grid onto the canvas.
  O = paint(O, asobject(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. We create a canvas (`O`) filled with zeros, with the width being one more than the input grid's width.
2. We use `paint` and `asobject` to directly overlay the input grid onto this canvas, leaving the rightmost column as zeros.

**Version 4: Using 'Shift' and a Zero-Filled Canvas**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Create a canvas of zeros one column wider than the input grid.
  canvas_grid = canvas(0, (height(I), width(I) + 1))
  # 2. Shift the input grid one position to the left on the canvas.
  shifted_grid = shift(asobject(I), (0,-1))
  # 3. Paint the shifted grid onto the canvas.
  O = paint(canvas_grid, shifted_grid)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  We generate a zero-filled canvas (`canvas_grid`) with an extra column compared to the input.
2.  We shift the input grid one position to the left (`shifted_grid`) within the canvas.
3.  Finally, we paint this shifted grid onto the canvas, resulting in a rightmost column of zeros.

**Version 5: Direct Grid Manipulation**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Iterate through each row of the input grid.
  O = tuple()
  for row in I:
      # 2. Append a zero to the end of each row.
      new_row = row + (0,)
      # 3. Add the modified row to the output grid.
      O = O + (new_row,)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version iterates through each row of the input grid.
2. For each row, it appends a zero to the end.
3. The modified row is added to a new tuple, forming the output grid with the added column of zeros. 

Each of these versions offers a different approach to adding a column of zeros, showcasing the versatility of the provided DSL.
