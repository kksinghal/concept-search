## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding a column to the right of the input grid. This column replicates the color of the top-left corner cell in each respective row.

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 
- A new column is added to the right of the grid.
- Each cell in the new column takes the value '0', which is the color of the top-left corner cell of Input_0. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- A new column is added to the right of the grid.
- Each cell in the new column takes the value '0', which is the color of the top-left corner cell of Input_1.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- A new column is added to the right of the grid.
- Each cell in the new column takes the value '0', which is the color of the top-left corner cell of Input_2.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return hconcat(I, canvas(index(I, (0, 0)), (height(I), 1)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`index(I, (0, 0))`**: Extracts the color of the cell at location (0, 0) in the input grid `I`.
2. **`canvas(index(I, (0, 0)), (height(I), 1))`**: Creates a new grid of dimensions (height of `I`, 1) filled with the extracted color.
3. **`hconcat(I, ...)`**: Concatenates the input grid `I` with the newly created single-column grid, effectively adding the new column to the right.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(row + (index(I, (0, 0)),) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`(index(I, (0, 0)),)`**: Creates a tuple containing the color of the cell at location (0, 0) in the input grid `I`.
2. **`row + ...`**:  For each row in the input grid `I`, it concatenates the row with the tuple containing the top-left corner color, effectively adding a new cell to the right of each row.
3. **`tuple(...)`**: Converts the result back into a tuple to represent the final grid. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(v if j < width(I) else index(I, (0,0)) for j, v in enumerate(r)) for i, r in enumerate(I)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`enumerate(I)`**: Iterates over the rows of the input grid `I` with their indices.
2.  **`enumerate(r)`**: For each row `r`, iterates over its values `v` with their column indices `j`.
3.  **`j < width(I)`**: Checks if the current column index `j` is within the original width of the grid.
4.  **`v if j < width(I) else index(I, (0,0))`**: If the condition is true, keeps the original value `v`. Otherwise, replaces it with the color at location (0, 0) of the input grid. 
5.  **`tuple(...)`**: Converts the result back into a tuple of tuples to represent the final grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return hconcat(I, transpose(repeat((index(I, (0,0)),), height(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`index(I, (0,0))`**: Extracts the color of the cell at (0,0).
2. **`repeat((...), height(I))`**: Creates a list by repeating a tuple containing the extracted color `height(I)` times.
3. **`transpose(...)`**: Transposes the list, effectively creating a single-column grid.
4. **`hconcat(I, ...)`**: Concatenates the input grid `I` with the newly created single-column grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(r + tuple(v for v in canvas(index(I, (0,0)), (1,1))[0]) for r in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(index(I, (0,0)), (1,1))`**: Creates a 1x1 grid with the top-left corner color.
2. **`tuple(v for v in ...[0])`**:  Extracts the values from the 1x1 grid as a tuple.
3. **`r + ...`**: For each row `r` in the input grid, concatenates it with the tuple containing the corner color.
4. **`tuple(...)`**: Converts the result back into a tuple of tuples to represent the final grid.
