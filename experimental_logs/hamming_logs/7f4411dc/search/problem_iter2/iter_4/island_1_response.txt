## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves identifying the unique non-background objects and removing the rightmost column from each of these objects.

* **Input_0 to Output_0:** The input grid has a single 7-valued object. The output grid is identical to the input grid except the rightmost column of the 7-valued object is removed.

* **Input_1 to Output_1:** The input grid has a single 6-valued object. The output grid is identical to the input grid except the rightmost column of the 6-valued object is removed.

* **Input_2 to Output_2:** The input grid has a single 5-valued object. The output grid is identical to the input grid except the rightmost column of the 5-valued object is removed.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, each with a different approach:

**### Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  trimmed_objs = frozenset(frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < rightmost(obj)) for obj in objs)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(trimmed_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  `objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies all non-background objects in the input grid.
2. **Trim objects:** For each object, `frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < rightmost(obj))` removes the rightmost column by filtering out cells where the column index (`j`) is equal to the rightmost column index of the object.
3. **Create a blank canvas:**  `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates a grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color.
4. **Paint trimmed objects:** `paint(..., merge(trimmed_objs))` combines all trimmed objects and paints them onto the blank canvas.
5. **Return the output grid:** The resulting grid (`O`) is returned as the output.


**### Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = tuple(tuple(v for k, v in enumerate(r) if k != rightmost(ofcolor(I, v))) for r in I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** The code iterates through each row (`r`) of the input grid (`I`).
2. **Find the rightmost column for each color:**  `rightmost(ofcolor(I, v))` identifies the rightmost column index for each color (`v`) present in the grid.
3. **Remove the rightmost cell of each color:**  For each row and color, the code filters out the cell at the identified rightmost column index.
4. **Construct the output grid:** The filtered cells are used to construct the output grid (`O`).


**### Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
    trimmed_objs = frozenset(crop(I, ulcorner(obj), (height(obj), width(obj)-1)) for obj in objs)
    O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(asobject, trimmed_objs)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  `objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies all non-background objects.
2. **Crop objects:** For each object, `crop(I, ulcorner(obj), (height(obj), width(obj)-1))` extracts a subgrid representing the object without the rightmost column.
3. **Convert subgrids to objects:** `asobject` converts each cropped subgrid back into an object representation.
4. **Paint objects onto a blank canvas:** Similar to Version 1, the code creates a blank canvas and paints the trimmed objects onto it.


**### Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = tuple(tuple(v for j, v in enumerate(r) if any(k != j for _, (k, _) in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))) for r in I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** The code iterates through each cell (`v`) at index `j` in each row (`r`).
2. **Check for rightmost column in any object:** `any(k != j for _, (k, _) in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))` checks if the current column index (`j`) is not the rightmost column index for any object in the grid.
3. **Filter cells:** Only cells that are not in the rightmost column of any object are included in the output grid.


**### Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
        for i, j in toindices(obj):
            if j == rightmost(obj):
                O = paint(O, recolor(mostcolor(I), {(i, j)}))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** The code iterates through each non-background object in the grid.
2. **Identify rightmost column cells:** For each object, it finds the cells that belong to the rightmost column.
3. **Paint over rightmost column cells:**  `paint(O, recolor(mostcolor(I), {(i, j)}))` paints over the identified rightmost column cells with the background color, effectively removing them.
4. **Return the modified grid:** The modified grid (`O`), with the rightmost columns of each object removed, is returned as the output.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version utilizes a unique combination of functions and logic, offering distinct solutions to the problem.
