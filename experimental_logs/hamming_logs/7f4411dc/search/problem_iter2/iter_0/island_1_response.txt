## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding a new column to the right of the input grid.  The new column takes on the value of the most frequent color in the row.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The most frequent color in each row is 0.  Therefore, a new column of 0s is added to the right of the grid.
* **Input_1:** Similarly, the most frequent color is 0 for every row. Hence, a column of 0s is added to the right.
* **Input_2:**  The transformation adds a new column of 0s (the most frequent color in each row) to the right.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  return tuple(row + (mostcommon(row),) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** The code iterates through each row in the input grid `I`.
2. **Find the most common color:** For each row, `mostcommon(row)` finds the most frequent color.
3. **Append to row:** The most common color is added as a new element to the end of each row using `row + (mostcommon(row),)`.
4. **Return the transformed grid:** The modified grid is returned as a tuple of tuples.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  return hconcat(I, tuple((mostcommon(row),) * len(I) for row in I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find most common colors:** The code iterates through each row of the input grid `I` and calculates the most common color using `mostcommon(row)`.
2. **Create a grid of common colors:**  A new grid is created where each row consists of the most common color of the corresponding row in the input grid, repeated to match the height of the input grid using `(mostcommon(row),) * len(I)`.
3. **Concatenate grids:** The original input grid `I` and the newly created grid are concatenated horizontally using `hconcat`. 


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  return tuple(row + tuple(repeat(mostcommon(row), 1)) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and find most common color:** The code iterates through each row (`row`) of the input grid (`I`) and determines the most common color in that row using `mostcommon(row)`.
2. **Create a single-element tuple:** The most common color is then used to create a single-element tuple using `tuple(repeat(mostcommon(row), 1))`.
3. **Concatenate with original row:** This single-element tuple is appended to the original row using `row + ...`, effectively adding the most common color as a new column to the right of each row.
4. **Return the modified grid:** The resulting grid, with the added column representing the most frequent colors, is returned.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  return tuple(tuple(v if j < len(I[0]) else mostcommon(row) for j, v in enumerate(row)) for row in I) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows and cells:** The code iterates through each row and within each row, it iterates through the cells using `enumerate(row)`.
2. **Conditional replacement:** For each cell, it checks if the cell index `j` is less than the original width of the grid (`len(I[0])`). If true, it keeps the original cell value `v`. If false, it replaces the cell value with the most common color in the row using `mostcommon(row)`. This effectively adds a new column to the right where each cell takes the value of the most common color in that row.
3. **Return the modified grid:** The transformed grid is returned.


**Program Version 5:** 

```python
def solve(I):
  h = height(I)
  return hconcat(I, tuple((mostcolor(I[i]),) for i in range(h))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get grid height:** Calculates the height `h` of the input grid `I`.
2. **Extract most frequent color per row:** Iterates through each row index `i` from 0 to `h` and determines the most frequent color in that specific row of the grid using `mostcolor(I[i])`. 
3. **Create a new column:**  Forms a new column as a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple contains only the most frequent color of the corresponding row from step 2.
4. **Concatenate horizontally:** The input grid `I` and the newly constructed column are concatenated horizontally using `hconcat`.
5. **Return combined grid:**  The resulting grid, representing the horizontally concatenated input and the new column, is returned as the output. 

These five versions demonstrate diverse ways of achieving the same outcome, highlighting the flexibility and expressive power of the DSL.
