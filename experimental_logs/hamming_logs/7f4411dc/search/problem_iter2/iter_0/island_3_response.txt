## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding a new column to the right of the input grid. The new column's values are determined by extending the existing pattern in each row. 

**Example:**

Input:
```
0 0 0
0 5 5 
0 0 0
```

Output:
```
0 0 0 0
0 5 5 5
0 0 0 0 
```

In this case, the pattern in the second row (0 5 5) is extended by one '5', while the other rows are extended by '0'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" function using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # 1. Transpose the input grid.
    x1 = dmirror(I) 
    # 2. Split the transposed grid horizontally into individual columns.
    x2 = hsplit(x1, width(I))
    # 3. Apply a function to each column that extends its pattern by one element.
    x3 = apply(lambda c: c + (c[-1],), x2)
    # 4. Combine the modified columns back into a single grid.
    x4 = hconcat(*x3)
    # 5. Transpose the grid back to its original orientation.
    O = dmirror(x4)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes transposition and splitting to process the grid column-wise. It then appends the last element of each column to itself, effectively extending the pattern. Finally, it transposes back to obtain the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Get the grid's height.
  x1 = height(I)
  # 2. Create a column vector filled with the last element of each row in the input grid.
  x2 = tuple((row[-1],) for row in I)
  # 3. Create a new grid by horizontally concatenating the input grid with the column vector.
  O = hconcat(I, x2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly extracts the last element of each row to form a new column. It then concatenates this column with the input grid, achieving the desired transformation.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # 1. Get the shape of the grid.
    x1 = shape(I)
    # 2. Iterate through each row of the input grid.
    O = tuple(
        # 3. For each row, extend it by one element, duplicating the last element.
        row + (row[-1],) for row in I
    )
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each row of the grid and extends it by appending the last element to itself. This achieves the pattern extension for each row directly.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # 1. Get the width of the input grid.
    x1 = width(I)
    # 2. Create a list to store the modified rows.
    x2 = []
    # 3. Iterate through each row of the input grid.
    for i in range(height(I)):
        # 4. Create a new row by extending the current row with its last element.
        new_row = tuple(I[i][j] for j in range(x1)) + (I[i][-1],)
        # 5. Append the new row to the list.
        x2.append(new_row)
    # 6. Convert the list of modified rows back to a tuple (grid).
    O = tuple(x2)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iteratively constructs the output grid row by row. It extends each existing row by appending its last element and then combines these modified rows to create the final output grid. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # 1. Get the shape of the input grid.
    h, w = shape(I)
    # 2. Create a new grid with an extra column using the 'canvas' function.
    O = canvas(0, (h, w + 1))
    # 3. Paint the input grid onto the new canvas.
    O = paint(O, asobject(I))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version creates a new grid, larger than the input, filled with a default value (0). It then paints the input grid onto this larger canvas. Since the new canvas has an extra column, and painting only modifies existing cells, the last column will inherently reflect the pattern extension by maintaining the default value.

These are five distinct program versions using different DSL functions and logic to achieve the same transformation. You can choose the one that you find most readable or efficient for your needs.
