## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding a column of zeros to the right of the input grid. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**  A column of zeros is added to the right side of the grid, effectively widening it. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the previous example, a column of zeros is added to the right.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**  Again, a single column of zeros is added to the right of the input grid.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions for "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = hconcat(I, tuple(repeat(0, len(I)))) 
  O = hconcat(x1, tuple(repeat(0, len(I[0]))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **x1 =  hconcat(I, tuple(repeat(0, len(I))))**: This line creates a column of zeros with the same height as the input grid (`len(I)`) and concatenates it horizontally to the input grid (`I`).
2. **O = hconcat(x1, tuple(repeat(0, len(I[0]))))**: This line creates a row of zeros with the same width as the original input grid (`len(I[0])`) and concatenates it horizontally to `x1`, effectively adding a column of zeros to the right.
3. **return O**: Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  zeros_column = tuple((0,) * len(I[0]) for _ in range(len(I)))
  O = hconcat(I, zeros_column)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **zeros_column = tuple((0,) * len(I[0]) for _ in range(len(I))))**: This line creates a grid of zeros with the same dimensions as the input grid (`len(I)` for height and `len(I[0])` for width).
2. **O = hconcat(I, zeros_column)**: This line concatenates the grid of zeros horizontally to the input grid, effectively adding a column of zeros to the right.
3. **return O**: Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = tuple(row + (0,) for row in I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **O = tuple(row + (0,) for row in I)**: This line iterates through each row in the input grid and appends a zero to the end of each row, effectively adding a column of zeros.
2. **return O**: Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = astuple(len(I), len(I[0]) + ONE)
    O = fill(canvas(ZERO, x1), ONE, asindices(I))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **x1 = astuple(len(I), len(I[0]) + ONE)**: Calculates the dimensions of the output grid, which is the same height as the input grid (`len(I)`) and one column wider (`len(I[0]) + ONE`).
2. **O = fill(canvas(ZERO, x1), ONE, asindices(I))**: Creates a canvas of zeros with the calculated dimensions (`x1`), then fills the indices corresponding to the input grid (`asindices(I)`) with the value ONE. This effectively copies the input grid to the leftmost portion of the output grid, leaving the rightmost column as zeros. 
3. **return O**: Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = hsplit(I, ONE)
  x2 = canvas(ZERO, (len(I), ONE))
  O = hconcat(x1[ZERO], x2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **x1 = hsplit(I, ONE)**: This splits the input grid into a list containing a single element: the input grid itself.
2. **x2 = canvas(ZERO, (len(I), ONE))**: This creates a grid of zeros with the same height as the input grid and a width of one.
3. **O = hconcat(x1[ZERO], x2)**: This concatenates the input grid (`x1[ZERO]`) with the column of zeros (`x2`), effectively adding a column of zeros to the right.
4. **return O**: Returns the modified grid. 


These five versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility of the DSL and providing a variety of solutions for the problem.
