## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves adding a column of the background color to the right side of the grid.

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 
- A column of zeros (background color) is added to the right side of the grid, expanding its width from 12 to 13.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- A column of zeros (background color) is added to the right side of the grid, expanding its width from 16 to 17.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- A column of zeros (background color) is added to the right side of the grid, expanding its width from 6 to 7.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  h = height(grid)
  w = width(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(bg, (h, w + 1))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      new_grid = fill(new_grid, grid[i][j], {(i, j)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Determine background color:**  `bg = mostcolor(grid)` identifies the most frequent color in the grid, assumed to be the background.
2. **Get grid dimensions:** `h = height(grid)` and `w = width(grid)` extract the height and width of the input grid.
3. **Create expanded canvas:** `new_grid = canvas(bg, (h, w + 1))` generates a new grid with the background color and an extra column (width + 1).
4. **Copy existing cells:** The nested loop iterates through the original grid, copying each cell's value to the corresponding position in the new grid using `fill(new_grid, grid[i][j], {(i, j)})`.
5. **Return the expanded grid:** `return new_grid` returns the modified grid with the added background column.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  return hconcat(grid, tuple((bg,) * len(grid) for _ in range(1)))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Get background color:** `bg = mostcolor(grid)` determines the background color.
2. **Construct and append column:**  The code directly constructs a tuple representing the new background column using `tuple((bg,) * len(grid) for _ in range(1))`. This creates a tuple of tuples, each containing the background color repeated for the grid's height.
3. **Concatenate and return:** `hconcat(grid, ...)` horizontally concatenates the original grid with the new column and returns the result.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return hconcat(grid, canvas(mostcolor(grid), (height(grid), 1)))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Get background color:**  `mostcolor(grid)` finds the background color.
2. **Create background column:** `canvas(mostcolor(grid), (height(grid), 1))` generates a grid representing a single column filled with the background color and having the same height as the input grid.
3. **Concatenate and return:** `hconcat(grid, ...)` joins the original grid and the background column horizontally and returns the combined grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  new_grid = list(list(row) for row in grid)
  for row in new_grid:
    row.append(bg)
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Get background color:** `bg = mostcolor(grid)` identifies the background color.
2. **Convert to mutable list:** `new_grid = list(list(row) for row in grid)` converts the input grid into a list of lists for mutability.
3. **Append background to each row:** The loop iterates through each row (list) in `new_grid` and appends the background color using `row.append(bg)`.
4. **Convert back to tuple and return:**  The modified list of lists is converted back into a tuple of tuples using `tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)` and returned.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(tuple(v for v in row) + (mostcolor(grid),) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate and append:** The code uses a generator expression to iterate through each row in the grid and creates a new tuple by concatenating the original row (`tuple(v for v in row)`) with a tuple containing the background color (`(mostcolor(grid),)`).
2. **Return expanded grid:** The generator expression creates a new grid with the expanded rows, which is then returned as a tuple of tuples.

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to adding a background column to a grid using the provided DSL functions. Each version achieves the same outcome through different logic and function combinations.
