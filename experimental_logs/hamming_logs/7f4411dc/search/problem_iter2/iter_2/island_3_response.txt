## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation being applied appears to be **adding a column of zeros to the right of the input grid**. 

Let's break it down by input-output pair:

* **Input_0 -> Output_0**: A single column of zeros is added to the right side of the grid, increasing its width by 1.
* **Input_1 -> Output_1**:  Similarly, a column of zeros is added to the right side, expanding the grid's width by 1.
* **Input_2 -> Output_2**: Again, the transformation adds a single column of zeros to the right.

## Code Generation:

Since you request utilizing functions from prior examples, I'll assume functions like `hsplit`, `hconcat`, `width`, `height`, `tuple`, `repeat`, and `canvas` are available.

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:** (Inspired by Program_A's splitting approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Split the input grid into a list of its columns.
  cols = hsplit(I, width(I)) 
  # 2. Create a column of zeros with the same height as the input.
  zero_col = tuple(repeat(0, height(I)))
  # 3. Add the zero column to the end of the list of columns.
  cols = cols + (zero_col,)
  # 4. Concatenate the columns horizontally to create the output grid.
  O = hconcat(*cols) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. We split the grid into columns.
2. We generate a column of zeros matching the grid's height.
3. We append this zero column to the list of columns.
4. We horizontally join all columns back into a grid.


**Program Version 2:** (Using canvas and direct manipulation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Create a canvas of zeros one column wider than the input.
  O = canvas(0, (height(I), width(I) + 1))
  # 2. Paint the input onto the canvas, leaving the rightmost column as zeros.
  O = paint(O, asobject(I))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  A canvas filled with zeros is created, sized to accommodate the extra column.
2.  The input grid is painted onto this canvas, leaving the added column blank (filled with zeros by default).


**Program Version 3:** (Shifting and filling)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Shift the input grid one position to the left.
  shifted_grid = shift(asobject(I), (0, 1))
  # 2. Create a canvas of the original size filled with zeros.
  canvas_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))
  # 3. Paint the shifted grid onto the canvas.
  O = paint(canvas_grid, shifted_grid)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. We shift the entire input grid one position to the left.
2. A zero-filled canvas of the original grid's dimensions is made.
3. We paint the shifted grid onto this canvas. The rightmost column, originally filled with zeros, remains untouched.

**Program Version 4:** (Iterative column addition)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Create an empty grid.
  O = tuple()
  # 2. Iterate over the rows of the input grid.
  for row in I:
    # 3. Add each row with an additional 0 at the end to the output grid.
    O = O + (row + (0,),)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. We initialize an empty tuple to store the output.
2. We iterate through each row of the input grid.
3. For each row, we append a zero to the end and add this modified row to our output grid.

**Program Version 5:** (List comprehension for conciseness)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Construct the output grid by adding a zero to the end of each row.
  O = tuple(row + (0,) for row in I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages Python's list comprehension for a more concise solution. It iterates through each row (`row`) in the input grid (`I`) and creates a new tuple where each row is the original row with a zero appended to its end.
