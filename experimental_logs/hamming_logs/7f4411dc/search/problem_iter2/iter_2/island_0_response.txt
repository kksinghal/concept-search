## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves adding a column of zeros to the right of the grid. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- A single column of zeros is added to the right side of the grid, effectively increasing its width by 1.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- A single column of zeros is added to the right side of the grid, effectively increasing its width by 1.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- A single column of zeros is added to the right side of the grid, effectively increasing its width by 1.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = hconcat(I, tuple((0 for _ in range(len(I[0]))),))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`hconcat(I, tuple((0 for _ in range(len(I[0]))),))`:** This line performs the core transformation. 
   - `tuple((0 for _ in range(len(I[0]))),)` creates a tuple containing a single tuple of zeros. The length of this inner tuple is equal to the width of the input grid `I`.
   - `hconcat(I, ...)` concatenates the input grid `I` with the generated tuple of zeros horizontally, effectively adding a column of zeros to the right of the input grid. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  zeros_column = tuple((0,) * len(I[0]) for _ in range(len(I)))
  O = hconcat(I, zeros_column)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`zeros_column = tuple((0,) * len(I[0]) for _ in range(len(I)))`:** This line creates a grid of zeros with the same height as the input grid `I` and a width of 1 (a single column).
2. **`O = hconcat(I, zeros_column)`:** This line horizontally concatenates the input grid `I` with the `zeros_column`, effectively adding a column of zeros to the right.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for _ in range(len(I)):
    O = hconcat(O, ((0,) * len(I[0]),))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **`for _ in range(len(I))`:** Iterates through each row of the grid (although we only add one column, this loop ensures it works for any size grid).
3. **`O = hconcat(O, ((0,) * len(I[0]),))`:** Concatenates the current `O` with a tuple containing a tuple of zeros. This adds a column of zeros to the right of the grid in each iteration.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(row + (0,) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`tuple(row + (0,) for row in I)`:** This line iterates through each row (`row`) in the input grid `I`. For each row, it creates a new tuple by adding a `(0,)` to the end, effectively adding a zero to the right of each row. The outer `tuple()` function then combines these modified rows back into a grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = tuple(list(row) for row in I)  
  for row in O:
    row.append(0)
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = tuple(list(row) for row in I)`:** Converts the input grid `I` (which is a tuple of tuples) into a tuple of lists to allow modification.
2. **`for row in O: row.append(0)`:** Iterates through each list in `O` (representing a row) and appends a `0` to the end, effectively adding a column of zeros to the right.
3. **`return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)`:** Converts the modified `O` back into a tuple of tuples to match the required grid format.
