## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding a column to the right of the input grid. This new column contains the most common color (digit) within each row. 

**Input_0:**  The most common color in each row is 0, so a column of 0s is added to the right.

**Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0, the most common color is 0 for most rows. However, some rows have 6 as the most common color. The added column reflects this.

**Input_2:** Most common color is 0 for most rows, except the middle ones where it's 5. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using different DSL functions and logic:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  return tuple(tuple(v for v in row) + (mostcommon(row),) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

- **`(mostcommon(row),)`**: Calculates the most common color in the current row (`row`) and creates a single-element tuple containing it.
- **`tuple(v for v in row) + ...`**:  Iterates through each element (`v`) in the current row (`row`) and combines them with the previously calculated most common color tuple, effectively adding it as a new column.
- **`tuple(... for row in I)`**:  Iterates through each row in the input grid (`I`) and applies the inner logic to construct the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
    return tuple(row + (max(set(row), key=row.count),) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

- **`(max(set(row), key=row.count),)`:** Similar to `mostcommon(row)`, this finds the element with maximum count in the `row` and packs it into a tuple to be added as a column.
- **`row + ...`:** Appends the most common color tuple to the current row. 
- **`tuple(... for row in I)`:**  Applies this logic to each row in the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
  return hconcat(I, tuple((mostcommon(row),) for row in I))
```

**Explanation:**

- **`tuple((mostcommon(row),) for row in I)`:** Creates a new grid (a tuple of tuples), where each row is a single-element tuple containing the most common color of the corresponding row in the input grid.
- **`hconcat(I, ...)`:**  Horizontally concatenates the original input grid (`I`) with the newly created grid of most common colors.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
  return tuple(tuple(v if j < width(I) else mostcommon(I[i]) for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(I))
```

**Explanation:**
- **`width(I)`:**  Gets the width (number of columns) of the input grid.
- **`... if j < width(I) else ...`:** Conditionally includes the original cell value (`v`) if the current column index (`j`) is within the original grid width; otherwise, it inserts the most common color of the current row (`mostcommon(I[i])`).
- **`... for j, v in enumerate(row)`:**  Iterates over each cell value (`v`) and its index (`j`) in the current row.
- **`... for i, row in enumerate(I)`:**  Iterates over each row in the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
    return apply(lambda row: row + (mostcommon(row),), I)
```

**Explanation:**
- **`lambda row: row + (mostcommon(row),)`:** Defines an anonymous function that takes a row as input, calculates its most common color, and returns the row with the most common color appended as a new element.
- **`apply(..., I)`:** Applies this anonymous function to each row in the input grid `I`.


Each program version utilizes different DSL functions and approaches to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
