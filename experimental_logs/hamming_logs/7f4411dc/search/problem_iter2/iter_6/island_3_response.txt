## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding a column of zeros to the right edge of the input grid.

**Example:**

Input:
```
0 0 0
0 5 5
0 0 0 
```

Output:
```
0 0 0 0
0 5 5 0
0 0 0 0
```


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:** (Inspired by Program A's cropping and Program B's column insertion)

```python
def program_v1(I):
  """
  Appends a column of zeros to the right of the input grid.
  """
  h = height(I)  # Get the height of the grid
  modified_rows = tuple(row + (0,) for row in I)  # Add a zero to each row
  return modified_rows

```
**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate Height:**  `height(I)` determines the number of rows in the grid.
2. **Append Zero Column:**  Iterate through each `row` in the grid `I`. For each row, create a new tuple by concatenating the original `row` with a tuple containing a single zero: `row + (0,)`.
3. **Return Modified Grid:**  Return the modified grid as a tuple of tuples.

**Version 2:** (Inspired by Program A's shape calculation and hconcat)

```python
def program_v2(I):
  """
  Appends a column of zeros to the right of the input grid.
  """
  zeros_column = tuple((0,) * height(I))  # Create a column of zeros
  return hconcat(I, zeros_column)  # Concatenate the grid and the zeros column

```
**Explanation:**

1. **Create Zeros Column:**  Generate a tuple representing a column of zeros using `(0,) * height(I)`.
2. **Concatenate:** Utilize the `hconcat` function to append the `zeros_column` to the right side of the input grid `I`.

**Version 3:** (Inspired by Program B's enumeration and conditional insertion)

```python
def program_v3(I):
  """
  Appends a column of zeros to the right of the input grid.
  """
  return tuple(tuple(v if j < width(I) else 0 for j, v in enumerate(row)) for row in I)

```
**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Conditionally Insert:** For each `row` in the input grid `I`, iterate through its elements `v` along with their indices `j` using `enumerate(row)`. 
2. **Conditional Zero:** If the current index `j` is less than the width of the grid (`width(I)`), keep the original value `v`. Otherwise (meaning we're at the new column position), insert a `0`.

**Version 4:** (Inspired by Program A's shape and grid manipulation)

```python
def program_v4(I):
  """
  Appends a column of zeros to the right of the input grid.
  """
  new_grid = canvas(0, (height(I), width(I) + 1))  # Create a canvas of zeros with an extra column
  return tuple(tuple(I[i][j] if j < width(I) else 0 for j in range(width(I) + 1)) for i in range(height(I)))

```
**Explanation:**

1. **Create Zero Canvas:** Generate a grid filled with zeros using `canvas(0, (height(I), width(I) + 1))`, where the width is one greater than the input grid.
2. **Populate with Input:**  Iterate through each cell of the new grid. If the column index `j` is within the bounds of the input grid, copy the corresponding value from `I`. Otherwise, retain the zero from the canvas.

**Version 5:** (Inspired by Program B's row modification and tuple manipulation)
```python
def program_v5(I):
    """
    Appends a column of zeros to the right of the input grid.
    """
    return tuple(row + (0,) for row in I)
```
**Explanation:** 

1. **Iterate and Append:**  Iterate through each `row` in the input grid `I`.
2. **Append Zero:**  For each `row`,  concatenate it with a tuple containing a single zero: `row + (0,)`, effectively adding a zero to the end of each row.
3. **Return as Grid:** Return the result as a tuple of tuples, representing the modified grid.
