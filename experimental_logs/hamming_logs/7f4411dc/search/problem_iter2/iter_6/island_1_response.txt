## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding a column of the most common color to the right side of the input grid. 

**Input 0:** 
- A column of '0's (the most common color) is added to the right of the input grid.

**Input 1:** 
- A column of '0's (the most common color) is added to the right of the input grid.

**Input 2:** 
- A column of '0's (the most common color) is added to the right of the input grid.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") using only functions from the DSL to achieve the described transformation.

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return hconcat(I,  ((mostcolor(I)),) * len(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mostcolor(I)`:** Finds the most frequent color in the input grid `I`.
2. **`((mostcolor(I)),) * len(I)`:**  Creates a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains only the most frequent color, repeated for the number of rows in the input grid. This effectively creates a column of the most frequent color.
3. **`hconcat(I, ...)`:** Concatenates the input grid `I` with the generated column of the most frequent color, effectively adding the column to the right of the input grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return hconcat(I,  tuple((mostcolor(I),) for _ in range(len(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mostcolor(I)`:**  Determines the most common color within the input grid.
2. **`(mostcolor(I),)`:**  Creates a tuple containing the most common color.
3. **`tuple((mostcolor(I),) for _ in range(len(I)))`:**  Generates a tuple of tuples.  Each inner tuple is identical, containing just the most common color, and the number of inner tuples matches the number of rows in the input grid. This effectively builds a single-color column.
4. **`hconcat(I, ...)`:**  Combines the input grid (`I`) with the created single-color column, placing the column on the right side of the input grid. 

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_col = tuple(repeat(mostcolor(I), len(I[0])))
  return tuple(row + new_col for row in I) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mostcolor(I)`:**  Identifies the most frequent color present in the input grid.
2. **`repeat(mostcolor(I), len(I[0]))`:**  Creates a tuple by repeating the most frequent color a number of times equal to the width of the input grid. 
3. **`tuple(row + new_col for row in I)`:**  Iterates through each row in the input grid. For each row, it concatenates the row with the `new_col`  and creates a new tuple representing the modified row. The result is a new grid with the added column on the right.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(row + (mostcolor(I),) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mostcolor(I)`:** Identifies the most common color in the input grid `I`.
2. **`(mostcolor(I),)`:** Creates a tuple containing only the most common color.
3. **`row + (mostcolor(I),)`:** For each row in the input grid, this expression concatenates the row with the tuple containing the most common color, effectively adding a cell with the most common color to the end of each row.
4. **`tuple(...)`:**  Constructs a new grid (tuple of tuples) by iterating through the modified rows.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
 return hconcat(I, vupscale(((mostcolor(I)),), len(I))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mostcolor(I)`:**  Finds the most frequent color in the grid `I`.
2. **`((mostcolor(I)),)`:**  Creates a 1x1 grid containing the most frequent color. 
3. **`vupscale(..., len(I))`:**  Vertically scales the 1x1 grid to match the height of the input grid, resulting in a single-column grid with the most frequent color.
4. **`hconcat(I, ...)`:**  Horizontally concatenates the input grid `I` with the generated single-column grid, effectively adding it to the right of the input grid.
