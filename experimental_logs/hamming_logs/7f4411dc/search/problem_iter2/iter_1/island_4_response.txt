## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding a column to the right of the smallest object in the input grid. 

* **Input 0:** The smallest object is the group of '7's. A column of '7's is added to its right.
* **Input 1:** The smallest object is the group of '6's. A column of '0's (background color) is added to its right.
* **Input 2:** The smallest object is the group of '5's. A column of '0's (background color) is added to its right. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" along with their explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the smallest object
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  smallest_obj = argmin(objs, size)

  # Calculate the position to add the column
  rightmost_col = rightmost(smallest_obj) 
  insert_pos = (uppermost(smallest_obj), rightmost_col + 1)

  # Create a column of the background color with the object's height
  bg_color = mostcolor(I)
  new_column = frozenset({(bg_color, (i, insert_pos[1])) for i in range(uppermost(smallest_obj), lowermost(smallest_obj) + 1)})

  # Combine the object with the new column
  modified_obj = combine(smallest_obj, new_column)

  # Paint the modified object back onto the original grid
  O = paint(cover(I, smallest_obj), modified_obj) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the smallest object:** This is done using `objects` to get all objects and then `argmin` to find the smallest based on size.
2. **Calculate the position:**  The column is added to the right of the rightmost column of the smallest object.
3. **Create a column:**  A column of the background color with the same height as the object is created.
4. **Combine:** The new column is combined with the original object.
5. **Paint:** The original object is covered with the background color, and the modified object is painted back onto the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Get all objects and their rightmost column index
  objs_with_rightmost = ((obj, rightmost(obj)) for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=False))

  # Find the object with the smallest size and its rightmost column index
  smallest_obj, rightmost_col = argmin(objs_with_rightmost, lambda x: size(x[0]))

  # Add 1 to the rightmost column index to find the insertion point
  insert_pos = (uppermost(smallest_obj), rightmost_col + 1)

  # Fill a column starting from the insertion point with the background color
  O = fill(I, mostcolor(I), connect(insert_pos, (lowermost(smallest_obj), insert_pos[1])))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find smallest object and rightmost column:** This version efficiently iterates through objects and their rightmost columns in one go.
2. **Calculate insertion point:** Similar to version 1.
3. **Fill column:**  This version uses `fill` and `connect` to directly draw a vertical line of the background color at the desired position. This avoids the need to explicitly create a new object.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Extract objects from the input grid
    objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)

    # Find the smallest object based on its size
    smallest_obj = argmin(objs, size)

    # Determine the width of the input grid
    grid_width = width(I)

    # Shift the smallest object one position to the right
    shifted_obj = shift(smallest_obj, (0, 1))

    # Combine the original and shifted objects to create the output
    combined_obj = combine(smallest_obj, shifted_obj)

    # Create a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid
    canvas_grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), (height(I), grid_width + 1))

    # Paint the combined object onto the blank canvas
    O = paint(canvas_grid, combined_obj)
    
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** This step identifies all distinct objects present in the input grid.
2. **Identify Smallest Object:**  Among the extracted objects, it pinpoints the one with the smallest area.
3. **Determine Grid Width:** It calculates the width (number of columns) of the input grid.
4. **Shift Object:** The smallest object is shifted one position to the right, effectively creating a duplicate adjacent to it.
5. **Combine Objects:** The original and shifted objects are merged into a single entity.
6. **Create Blank Canvas:**  A new grid, initially filled with the background color, is generated. Its dimensions match the input grid's height and a width incremented by one to accommodate the added column.
7. **Paint Combined Object:** The merged object from step 5 is then drawn onto the blank canvas.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the smallest object 
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  smallest_obj = argmin(objs, size)

  # Create a mask by shifting the object one position to the right 
  shifted_obj = shift(smallest_obj, (0, 1))
  mask = toindices(combine(smallest_obj, shifted_obj))

  # Extend the grid by one column filled with the background color
  extended_grid = hconcat(I, tuple((mostcolor(I),) for _ in range(height(I))))

  # Apply the mask to paint the extended grid
  O = tuple(tuple(extended_grid[i][j] if (i,j) in mask else mostcolor(I) for j in range(len(extended_grid[0]))) for i in range(len(extended_grid))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find smallest object:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Create a mask:**  A mask representing the area to be filled is created. It's formed by combining the original object and its shifted version.
3. **Extend the grid:**  The original grid is expanded by one column to the right. The new column is filled with the background color.
4. **Apply the mask:** The mask is applied to the extended grid. Cells within the mask retain their values from the extended grid, while those outside are set to the background color. 

**Program Version 5:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Identify all objects within the input grid
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)

  # Determine the object with the smallest width
  target_obj = argmin(objs, width) 

  # Extract the upper-left corner coordinates of the target object
  i, j = ulcorner(target_obj)

  # Calculate the width of the target object
  obj_width = width(target_obj)

  # Duplicate the identified object horizontally, effectively adding a column to its right
  O = hconcat(I, tuple(tuple(I[row][col] for col in range(j, j + obj_width)) for row in range(i, i + height(target_obj))))

  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** This step involves recognizing all distinct objects present within the input grid.
2. **Find Narrowest Object:** Among the identified objects, the algorithm pinpoints the one with the smallest width (number of columns).
3. **Locate Upper-Left Corner:** The coordinates of the top-leftmost cell belonging to the narrowest object are determined.
4. **Calculate Object Width:** The width (number of columns) of the narrowest object is computed.
5. **Horizontal Duplication:** The object identified as the narrowest is then duplicated horizontally. This duplication effectively adds a new column immediately to the right of the original object, with the new column mirroring the content of the original. 

These five distinct versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version employs unique logic or DSL function combinations, highlighting the potential for diverse solutions within the defined domain.
