## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding a column to the right of the input grid. This new column is filled with the most common color (digit) present in each corresponding row of the input grid. 

**Example:**

**Input Grid:**

```
0 0 1
1 1 0
```

**Output Grid:**

```
0 0 1 0
1 1 0 1 
```

Here, the most frequent color in the first row of the input is '0' and in the second row is '1'. Hence, these are added as the last elements in the respective rows of the output grid.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL provided:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return hconcat(I, tuple((mostcommon(row),) for row in I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mostcommon(row)`:** For each row in the input grid `I`, this function identifies the most common color (digit).
2. **`(mostcommon(row),)`:**  The most common color is then converted into a tuple with a single element.
3. **`tuple((mostcommon(row),) for row in I)`:** This generates a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple represents the most common color of the corresponding row in the input grid.
4. **`hconcat(I, ...)`:** Finally, the `hconcat` function horizontally concatenates the input grid `I` with the generated tuple of most common colors, effectively adding the new column to the right.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(row + (mostcommon(row),) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mostcommon(row)`:** This function identifies the most common color (digit) within each row.
2. **`(mostcommon(row),)`:**  Creates a single-element tuple containing the most common color.
3. **`row + (mostcommon(row),)`:** Concatenates each row of the input grid with the tuple containing its most common color, effectively adding the new column element.
4. **`tuple(...)`:**  Converts the resulting list of rows back into a tuple, forming the final output grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  return tuple(tuple(v if j < len(I[0]) else mostcommon(I[i]) for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h = height(I)`:** Obtains the height (number of rows) of the input grid.
2.  **`for i, row in enumerate(I)`:** Iterates through each row (`row`) and its index (`i`) in the input grid.
3. **`for j, v in enumerate(row)`:** Iterates through each element (`v`) and its index (`j`) within the current row.
4. **`v if j < len(I[0]) else mostcommon(I[i])`:**  If the element index `j` is less than the width of the input (meaning it's within the original grid), keeps the original value `v`. Otherwise (for the new column), it replaces the value with the most common color of the current row `i`. 
5. **`tuple(tuple(...))`:** Constructs the final output grid tuple.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(v for j, v in enumerate(row)) + (mostcommon(row),) if i < height(I) else () for i, row in enumerate(I + ((0,),)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`I + ((0,),)`:** Appends a dummy row with a single element (0) to the input grid `I`. This is to handle cases where the input grid might have zero rows.
2. **`for i, row in enumerate(...)`:**  Iterates through each row and its index in the modified grid (input + dummy row).
3. **`if i < height(I)`:**  Checks if the current row index is within the original input grid.
4. **`tuple(v for j, v in enumerate(row)) + (mostcommon(row),)`:** If within the original grid, creates a new row by taking all elements from the current row and appending the most common color of that row.
5. **`else ()`:** If the current row is the dummy row, it adds an empty tuple, effectively doing nothing.
6. **`tuple(...)`:**  Constructs the output grid tuple.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    new_column = tuple((mostcommon(row),) for row in I)
    return tuple(row + new_column[i] for i, row in enumerate(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`new_column = tuple((mostcommon(row),) for row in I)`:** First, calculates the most common color for each row in the input grid `I` and stores these values as single-element tuples within the `new_column` tuple. 
2. **`tuple(row + new_column[i] for i, row in enumerate(I))`:**  Iterates through each row (`row`) and its index (`i`) in the input grid and concatenates each row with the corresponding most common color tuple from the `new_column` tuple using the row index `i`. This creates the final output grid with the added column.
