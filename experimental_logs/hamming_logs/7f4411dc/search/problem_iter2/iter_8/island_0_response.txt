## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding a column of zeros to the right of the input grid.

**Input 0:** A column of zeros is added to the right of the input grid.

**Input 1:** A column of zeros is added to the right of the input grid.

**Input 2:** A column of zeros is added to the right of the input grid.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return hconcat(I, ((0,) * len(I),))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`hconcat(I, ((0,) * len(I),))`**: This line concatenates the input grid `I` with a new grid consisting of a single column of zeros. 
    -  `((0,) * len(I))`: Creates a tuple containing a single row of zeros. The length of this row is equal to the number of rows in the input grid `I` (which is the desired height of the new column).

This effectively adds a column of zeros to the right of the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(row + (0,) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`tuple(row + (0,) for row in I)`**: This line iterates over each row (`row`) in the input grid `I`. For each row, it concatenates a zero `(0,)` at the end and includes the modified row in a new tuple, effectively creating a new grid with an added column of zeros on the right.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = ()
  for row in I:
    O += (row + (0,),)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = ()`**: Initializes an empty tuple `O` to store the output grid.
2. **`for row in I:`**: Iterates over each row (`row`) in the input grid `I`.
3. **`O += (row + (0,),)`**: Concatenates a tuple containing the current row with an appended zero `(0,)` to the output grid `O`. 
4. **`return O`**: Returns the modified grid `O` with the added column of zeros.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(v if j < len(I[0]) else 0 for j, v in enumerate(row)) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`tuple( ... for row in I)`**: This part iterates over each row in the input grid `I`.
2. **`tuple(v if j < len(I[0]) else 0 for j, v in enumerate(row))`**: This nested loop iterates through each element (`v`) and its index (`j`) in the current row (`row`).
     -  If the index `j` is within the bounds of the original row's length (`j < len(I[0])`), it keeps the original value (`v`).
     - If `j` is at the new column position, it inserts a zero (`0`).

This effectively adds a new column of zeros to the right side of the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return hconcat(I, canvas(0, (len(I), 1))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(0, (len(I), 1))`**: This creates a new grid filled with zeros (`0`). The dimensions of the canvas are specified as `(len(I), 1)`, which means it will have the same number of rows as the input grid `I` and only one column.
2. **`hconcat(I, ...)`**: This takes the input grid `I` and horizontally concatenates it with the newly created canvas of zeros. 

This efficiently adds a single column of zeros to the right of the input grid.
