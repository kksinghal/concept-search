## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation adds a column to the right of the input grid. This new column is filled with zeros.

**Input_0 to Output_0:** A column of zeros is added to the right of the input grid, preserving the positions of the '7's.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** A column of zeros is added to the right of the input grid, preserving the positions of the '6's.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** A column of zeros is added to the right of the input grid, preserving the positions of the '5's.

## Program to be Generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Create a canvas of zeros with the same height as the input grid and width one greater.
  canvas_grid = canvas(0, (height(I), width(I) + 1))
  # 2. Paint the input grid onto the canvas.
  O = paint(canvas_grid, asobject(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create canvas:** This creates a grid of zeros with the desired dimensions for the output (same height as input, width increased by 1).
2. **Paint input:** This paints the content of the input grid onto the canvas, leaving the added column on the right filled with zeros. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Get the height of the input grid.
  h = height(I)
  # 2. Horizontally concatenate the input grid with a column vector of zeros with the same height.
  O = hconcat(I, tuple(((0,) for _ in range(h))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get height:**  Determines the number of rows needed for the column vector.
2. **Concatenate:** Combines the input grid with a column of zeros, effectively adding the column to the right.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Apply a function to each row of the input grid that adds a zero to the end.
  O = tuple(bjcgchbaabfbecbaibadcbjaeedcbaac(row) for row in I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Row-wise addition:**  Iterates through each row of the input grid and uses the helper function `bjcgchbaabfbecbaibadcbjaeedcbaac` (defined in your DSL) to append a zero.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Create a new grid with an extra column filled with the background color.
  O = fill(canvas((0,)*(height(I), width(I)+1)), mostcolor(I),  {(i, width(I))  for i in range(height(I))})
  # 2. Paint the input objects onto the new grid.
  O = paint(O, asobject(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create background:** Generates a grid with the correct dimensions filled with the background color, effectively adding a column of the background color.
2. **Paint objects:** Overlays the input objects onto the new grid, preserving their original positions.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1.  Shift all objects one position to the right.
  shifted_obj = shift(asobject(I), (0, 1))
  # 2.  Create a canvas of zeros with the same dimensions as the input grid, plus an additional column.
  canvas_grid = canvas(0, (height(I), width(I) + 1))
  # 3. Paint the shifted objects onto the canvas.
  O = paint(canvas_grid, shifted_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift objects:** Moves all objects in the input one position to the right.
2. **Create canvas:** Generates a grid of zeros with the desired dimensions (same height, width increased by 1).
3. **Paint objects:** Places the shifted objects onto the canvas, resulting in the original objects shifted one position to the right with a new column of zeros on the left.
