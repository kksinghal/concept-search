## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves adding a column of zeros to the right of the input grid.

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 
A column of zeros is added to the right of the input grid, effectively shifting all columns right by one position. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
Similar to the previous transformation, a column of zeros is added to the right side of the input grid.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
Again, a column of zeros is added to the rightmost side of the input grid.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1** (Inspired by `hdjeebcacahgecgcjbhbdffdjcjgeefe`):

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(row + (0,) for row in I) 
```

**Explanation:** This code iterates through each row (`row`) in the input grid (`I`) and appends a zero (`(0,)`) to the end of each row using tuple concatenation. This effectively adds a column of zeros to the right of the grid.

**Version 2** (Inspired by `aehafbcdajeheccdjfjcdajdddceebhj`):

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return hconcat(I, tuple(((0,) * len(I[0])) for _ in range(len(I))))
```

**Explanation:** 
- `(0,) * len(I[0])`: Creates a tuple containing a number of zeros equal to the width of the input grid.
- `tuple(... for _ in range(len(I)))`: Repeats the previous step to create a column of zeros with a height equal to the input grid.
- `hconcat(I, ...)`: Concatenates the input grid `I` with the created column of zeros, placing the zeros on the right side.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (len(I), len(I[0]) + 1))
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
- `O = canvas(0, (len(I), len(I[0]) + 1))`: Creates a canvas filled with zeros with dimensions one column wider than the input grid.
- The nested loop iterates over each cell of the input grid.
- `O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, j)})`: Fills the corresponding cell in the output canvas with the value from the input grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(row + (I[i][len(row)] if len(row) < len(I[0]) + 1 else 0,) for i, row in enumerate(I))
```

**Explanation:** 
- This version uses a slightly more complex list comprehension.
- It iterates through the rows (`row`) and their indices (`i`) in the input grid (`I`).
- For each row, it checks if the row's length is less than the desired output width (`len(I[0]) + 1`). 
  - If true, it appends the last element of the row (simulating extending the existing grid with its last column) to handle cases where the input grid already has a zero column at the end.
  - If false, it appends a zero, effectively adding the new column.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return hconcat(I, tuple((0,) for _ in range(len(I))))
```

**Explanation:**
- `(0,) for _ in range(len(I))`: Creates a generator expression that yields a tuple containing a single zero `len(I)` times, effectively creating a column of zeros with the same height as the input grid.
- `tuple(...)`: Converts the generator expression to a tuple.
- `hconcat(I, ...)`: Concatenates the input grid `I` with the newly created column of zeros on the right. 


These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic.
