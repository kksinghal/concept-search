## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation adds a column of zeros to the right of the input grid, effectively increasing the width of the grid by one. 

**Example:**

Input Grid:
```
0 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 0 
```

Output Grid:
```
0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0
```


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:** (Inspired by Program_B's cropping and the need to add a column)

```python
def ccigfddebgcaedcaafaadcfdcabfbbba(I):
  """
  Appends a column of zeros to the right of the input grid.
  """
  return hconcat(I, canvas(0, (height(I), 1)))  # Concatenate with a 1-column grid of zeros
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`hconcat(I, canvas(0, (height(I), 1)))`**: This line performs the core transformation.
   - `canvas(0, (height(I), 1))`: Creates a new grid filled with zeros. The dimensions of this grid are `height(I)` (same height as input) and `1` (representing a single column).
   - `hconcat(I, ...)`: Concatenates the input grid `I` with the newly created column of zeros horizontally, resulting in the desired output.


**Program Version 2:** (Inspired by Program_A's use of `paint` and `hfrontier`)

```python
def ccigfddebgcaedcaafaadcfdcabfbbba(I):
  """
  Appends a column of zeros to the right of the input grid.
  """
  O = paint(I, recolor(0, hfrontier((0, width(I)))))  # Paints a zero-column at the right edge
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = paint(I, recolor(0, hfrontier((0, width(I))))))`**: 
   - `hfrontier((0, width(I))))`:  Identifies the indices of the rightmost column (the frontier) of the input grid.
   - `recolor(0, ...)`:  Creates a new object (in this case, just indices) where all elements from the frontier are assigned the color `0`.
   - `paint(I, ...)`:  Paints this new object (a column of zeros) onto the input grid `I` at the specified frontier, effectively adding a column of zeros.


**Program Version 3:** (Focusing on direct grid manipulation)

```python
def ccigfddebgcaedcaafaadcfdcabfbbba(I):
  """
  Appends a column of zeros to the right of the input grid.
  """
  return tuple(row + (0,) for row in I) # Adds a zero to the end of each row
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`return tuple(row + (0,) for row in I)`**:  This line iterates through each row in the input grid `I`. For every `row`, it appends a `(0,)` (representing a single-element tuple containing a zero) to the end of the row. The outer `tuple(...)` converts the result back to a tuple, forming the output grid. 


**Program Version 4:** (Using explicit loop and list comprehension for clarity)

```python
def ccigfddebgcaedcaafaadcfdcabfbbba(I):
  """
  Appends a column of zeros to the right of the input grid.
  """
  new_grid = [] 
  for row in I:
    new_row = row + (0,)  # Add a zero to the end of each row
    new_grid.append(new_row)
  return tuple(new_grid)  # Convert to a tuple
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization**:  An empty list `new_grid` is created to store the modified rows.
2. **Looping**: The code iterates through each `row` in the input grid `I`.
3. **Adding Zero**: For each `row`, it creates a `new_row` by appending a single-element tuple `(0,)` to the end.
4. **Appending**: The `new_row` is then appended to the `new_grid`.
5. **Returning Tuple**: Finally, the `new_grid` (which is a list of tuples) is converted into a tuple itself using `tuple(new_grid)` and returned as the final output.


**Program Version 5:** (Using functional approach with `apply`)

```python
def add_zero_column(row):
  """Adds a zero to the end of a row."""
  return row + (0,) 

def ccigfddebgcaedcaafaadcfdcabfbbba(I):
  """
  Appends a column of zeros to the right of the input grid.
  """
  return tuple(apply(add_zero_column, I)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`add_zero_column` Function**:  A helper function `add_zero_column` is defined to encapsulate the logic of adding a zero to the end of a row.
2. **Applying to Each Row**: The main function uses `apply(add_zero_column, I)` to apply the `add_zero_column` function to each row in the input grid `I`. This results in a new grid where each row has an extra zero at the end. 
3. **Converting to Tuple**: The result from `apply` is converted to a tuple using `tuple(...)` and returned as the final output grid.
