## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation adds a column to the right of the input grid. This new column is filled with the most common color in the input grid (in this case, '0').

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the previous transformation, a new column filled with the most common color ('0') is added to the right of the input grid.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** Again, a new column filled with the most common color ('0') is added to the right of the input grid. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

### Program Version 1: 
**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return hconcat(I, ((mostcolor(I)),) * len(I)) 
```
**Explanation:**
1. **`mostcolor(I)`:** This function identifies the most common color within the input grid `I`.
2. **`((mostcolor(I)),) * len(I)`:** This creates a tuple representing a single column. It repeats the most common color for the entire height ( `len(I)` ) of the input grid.
3. **`hconcat(I, ...)`:**  Finally, this function horizontally concatenates the input grid `I` with the newly created column, effectively adding the column to the right of the input.

### Program Version 2:
**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(row + (mostcolor(I),) for row in I)
```
**Explanation:**
1. **`(mostcolor(I),)`:** Creates a tuple containing the most common color.
2. **`row + (mostcolor(I),)`:** Iterates through each row (`row`) of the input grid `I` and adds the most common color as a new element at the end of the row.
3. **`tuple(...)`:** Converts the result back into a tuple, effectively adding a new column to the right of the grid.

### Program Version 3:
**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_column = canvas(mostcolor(I), (len(I), 1))
  return hconcat(I, new_column)
```
**Explanation:**
1. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), (len(I), 1))`:** Creates a new grid (`new_column`) of height `len(I)` and width 1, filled with the most common color of the input grid.
2. **`hconcat(I, new_column)`:** Horizontally concatenates the input grid `I` with the newly created `new_column`.

### Program Version 4:
**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(v if j < len(I[0]) else mostcolor(I) for j, v in enumerate(r)) for r in I)
```
**Explanation:**
1. **`enumerate(r)`:** Iterates over each row (`r`) in the input grid `I` and provides the index (`j`) and value (`v`) for each cell.
2. **`v if j < len(I[0]) else mostcolor(I)`:**  Keeps the original cell value (`v`) if the column index (`j`) is within the original grid's width (`len(I[0])`). Otherwise, it replaces the cell with the most common color, effectively adding a new column.

### Program Version 5:
**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), (len(I), len(I[0]) + 1)), asobject(I))
```
**Explanation:**
1. **`asobject(I)`:** Converts the input grid `I` into an object representation.
2. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), (len(I), len(I[0]) + 1))`:**  Creates a new canvas filled with the most common color, with a width one cell larger than the input grid.
3. **`paint(... , asobject(I))`:** "Paints" the object representation of the input grid onto the new canvas, leaving the rightmost column filled with the background color.
