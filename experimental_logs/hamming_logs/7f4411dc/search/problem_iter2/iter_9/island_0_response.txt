## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding a column of zeros to the right of the input grid. 

**Input 0:** A column of zeros is added to the right side of the grid.

**Input 1:**  A column of zeros is added to the right side of the grid.

**Input 2:**  A column of zeros is added to the right side of the grid.

## Program Version 1

**Code:**
```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = hconcat(I, ((0,) * len(I[0]),)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 
This program directly uses `hconcat` to add a column of zeros to the right of the input grid.
* `((0,) * len(I[0]),)` creates a single-column grid of zeros with the same height as the input grid.
* `hconcat(I, ...)` concatenates this column of zeros to the right of the input grid `I`.

## Program Version 2

**Code:**
```python
def program_v2(I):
  zeros_column = tuple((0,) for _ in range(len(I)))
  O = hconcat(I, zeros_column)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
This program constructs the column of zeros by iterating over the rows of the input grid.
* `zeros_column = tuple((0,) for _ in range(len(I)))` creates the column of zeros by iterating through the rows of input `I` and adding a `(0,)` tuple for each row. 
*  Similar to version 1, `hconcat` is then used to combine the input grid and the column of zeros.

## Program Version 3

**Code:**
```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = I
  for _ in range(len(I[0])):
    O = rot90(O)
  for _ in range(len(I)):
    O = vconcat(((0,) * len(O[0]),), O)
  for _ in range(len(I[0])):
    O = rot90(O)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
This version utilizes rotations and vertical concatenation to achieve the transformation.
* It first rotates the grid 90 degrees clockwise for each column in the original grid using `rot90(O)`.
* Then, a row of zeros is added to the top of the rotated grid using `vconcat`.
* Finally, the grid is rotated back to its original orientation.

## Program Version 4

**Code:**
```python
def program_v4(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = tuple(tuple(I[i][j] if j < w else 0 for j in range(w + 1)) for i in range(h))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
This version constructs the output grid directly by iterating through each cell.
* `h, w = len(I), len(I[0])` gets the height and width of the input grid.
* The code then iterates through all cells of a grid with the same height as the input and width increased by one.
* For each cell, it checks if the cell index is within the bounds of the original grid. If it is, the original value is used; otherwise, it is filled with a zero. 

## Program Version 5

**Code:**
```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = tuple(row + (0,) for row in I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
This version uses a concise approach with tuple comprehension to add a zero to the end of each row in the input grid.
* `O = tuple(row + (0,) for row in I)` iterates through each row of the input grid `I` and adds a `(0,)` tuple to the end of each row using tuple concatenation.
