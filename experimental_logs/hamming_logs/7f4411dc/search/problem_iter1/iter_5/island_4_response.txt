## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation removes objects that touch either the top or bottom edge of the input grid.

**Input 0:** The top and bottom rows are cleared, removing the single-cell '7' objects and parts of the larger '7' objects that extended to the edges.

**Input 1:**  The top and bottom rows are cleared, as well as the single-cell '6' objects in the second row and the bottom-most row of the largest '6' object.

**Input 2:** The top and bottom rows are cleared, removing parts of the '5' objects that touched those edges.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
    frozenset(
      obj for obj in objects(I, T, T, T)
      if uppermost(obj) != 0 and lowermost(obj) != height(I) - 1
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Identifies all distinct objects within the input grid (`I`).
2. **`frozenset(...)`:** Filters the objects, keeping only those where:
    - **`uppermost(obj) != 0`:** The object's top row is not the grid's top row (index 0).
    - **`lowermost(obj) != height(I) - 1`:** The object's bottom row is not the grid's bottom row (index `height(I) - 1`).
3. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates an empty canvas with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the most frequent color (background).
4. **`paint(..., ...)`:**  Paints the filtered objects onto the empty canvas.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def not_touching_border(obj):
    return uppermost(obj) != 0 and lowermost(obj) != height(I) - 1
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
      sfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), not_touching_border)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`not_touching_border(obj)`:** Defines a helper function to check if an object touches the top or bottom border.
2. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Identifies all distinct objects within the input grid (`I`).
3. **`sfilter(..., not_touching_border)`:** Filters the objects using the helper function to keep only those not touching the top or bottom borders.
4. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates an empty canvas with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the most frequent color (background).
5. **`paint(..., ...)`:** Paints the filtered objects onto the empty canvas.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  border_rows = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(width(I)) if i == 0 or i == height(I) - 1)
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
      frozenset(obj for obj in objects(I, T, T, T) if not any(index in border_rows for _, index in obj))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`border_rows`:** Creates a set of all cell indices that belong to the top or bottom row.
2. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Identifies all distinct objects within the input grid (`I`).
3. **`frozenset(...)`:** Filters the objects, keeping only those where none of their cell indices are present in the `border_rows` set.
4. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates an empty canvas with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the most frequent color (background).
5. **`paint(..., ...)`:**  Paints the filtered objects onto the empty canvas.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
    frozenset(
      obj 
      for obj in objects(I, T, T, T) 
      if all(0 < i < height(I) - 1 for i, _ in toindices(obj))
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Identifies all distinct objects within the input grid (`I`).
2. **`frozenset(...)`:** Filters the objects, keeping only those where:
    - **`all(0 < i < height(I) - 1 for i, _ in toindices(obj))`:** Checks if all row indices (`i`) of the object's cells are strictly within the bounds of the grid (excluding the top and bottom rows). 
3. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates an empty canvas with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the most frequent color (background).
4. **`paint(..., ...)`:**  Paints the filtered objects onto the empty canvas.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  return paint(
    canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
    frozenset(
      obj 
      for obj in objects(I, T, T, T) 
      if all(i not in {0, h-1} for i, _ in toindices(obj))
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h = height(I)`:**  Stores the height of the input grid for convenience.
2. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Identifies all distinct objects within the input grid (`I`).
3. **`frozenset(...)`:** Filters the objects, keeping only those where:
    - **`all(i not in {0, h-1} for i, _ in toindices(obj))`:** Checks if none of the row indices (`i`) of the object's cells are equal to 0 (top row) or `h-1` (bottom row).
4. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates an empty canvas with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the most frequent color (background).
5. **`paint(..., ...)`:**  Paints the filtered objects onto the empty canvas.
