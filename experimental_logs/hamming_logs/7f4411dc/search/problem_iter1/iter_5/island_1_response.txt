## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied in these examples appears to be: 

**Remove all objects consisting of a single cell.**

Let's break down how this applies to each example:

* **Input_0:** The output grid removes all individual "7" cells while preserving the larger "7" object.
* **Input_1:** All individual "6" cells are removed, leaving only the larger "6" object intact.
* **Input_2:**  Similarly, only the large "5" object remains, with individual "5" cells eliminated. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions leveraging DSL functions to achieve the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
               frozenset(obj for obj in objects(I, T, F, F) if len(obj) > 1))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:**  Identifies all connected objects in the input grid `I`. `T, F, F` specify parameters for univalued, diagonal connectivity, and background exclusion respectively. 
2. **`frozenset(obj for obj in ... if len(obj) > 1)`:** Filters the identified objects, keeping only those with more than one cell.
3. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates a blank canvas the same size as the input grid, filled with the most common color in the input.
4. **`paint(..., ...)`:**  Paints the filtered objects onto the blank canvas, resulting in the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
               difference(objects(I, T, F, F), sizefilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 1))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Identifies all objects in the input.
2. **`sizefilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 1)`:**  Extracts only the objects consisting of a single cell.
3. **`difference(..., ...)`:**  Computes the difference between all objects and the single-cell objects, effectively removing single-cell objects.
4. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:**  Creates a blank canvas.
5. **`paint(..., ...)`:** Paints the remaining (multi-cell) objects onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), mfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, F)`:**  Get all objects in the grid.
2. **`lambda obj: size(obj) > 1`:** Define a function to check if an object's size (number of cells) is greater than 1.
3. **`mfilter(objs, ...)`:**  Filters the objects based on the lambda function, keeping only multi-cell objects.
4. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates a blank canvas.
5. **`paint(..., ...)`:** Paints the filtered objects onto the blank canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
               frozenset(obj for obj in objects(I, T, F, F) if not hline(obj) and not vline(obj) and not square(obj) and size(obj) > 1))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:**  Identifies all connected objects in the grid.
2. **`... if not hline(obj) and not vline(obj) and not square(obj) and size(obj) > 1`**: Filters objects, ensuring they are not horizontal lines (`hline`), vertical lines (`vline`), single squares (`square`), and have a size greater than 1. This assumes single-celled objects will be covered by these checks.
3. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:**  Creates a blank canvas.
4. **`paint(..., ...)`:**  Paints the remaining objects onto the canvas. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
               mapply(lambda obj: obj if len(obj) > 1 else frozenset(), objects(I, T, F, F)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:**  Identifies all objects in the input.
2. **`lambda obj: obj if len(obj) > 1 else frozenset()`:** This function checks the size of each object. If it's larger than one cell, it returns the object; otherwise, it returns an empty set.
3. **`mapply(..., ...)`:** Applies the function to each object and merges the results. This effectively removes single-cell objects.
4. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:**  Creates a blank canvas.
5. **`paint(..., ...)`:** Paints the filtered objects onto the canvas. 

Each version provides a slightly different approach to achieve the same goal, demonstrating the flexibility of the DSL and offering potentially different performance characteristics depending on the input data.
