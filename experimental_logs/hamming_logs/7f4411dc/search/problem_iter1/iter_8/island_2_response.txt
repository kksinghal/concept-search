## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be summarized as follows:

**For each object in the grid:**

1. **Identify rows and columns fully occupied by the background color.** 
2. **Remove these rows and columns from the object.**

This essentially "trims" the objects by removing any background rows or columns touching them.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program_v1(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  objs = objects(grid, False, False, False)
  new_grid = canvas(bg, (h, w))
  for obj in objs:
    rows = {i for i, j in toindices(obj)}
    cols = {j for i, j in toindices(obj)}
    keep_rows = {i for i in rows if any(grid[i][j] != bg for j in range(w))}
    keep_cols = {j for j in cols if any(grid[i][j] != bg for i in range(h))}
    new_obj = {(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if i in keep_rows and j in keep_cols}
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, new_obj)
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background color and grid dimensions:**  This part is straightforward.
2. **Extract all objects:** Using `objects`, we get all distinct objects in the grid.
3. **Create a blank canvas:**  We initialize a new grid filled with the background color.
4. **Iterate through objects:**
   - **Find rows and columns to keep:** For each object, we identify rows and columns that are not entirely background.
   - **Construct the trimmed object:** Only cells at the intersection of kept rows and columns are included.
   - **Paint the trimmed object onto the canvas:** This ensures the correct placement of the transformed object.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program_v2(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  new_grid = canvas(bg, (h, w))
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != bg:
        up, down = any(grid[k][j] != bg for k in range(i)), any(grid[k][j] != bg for k in range(i + 1, h))
        left, right = any(grid[i][k] != bg for k in range(j)), any(grid[i][k] != bg for k in range(j + 1, w))
        if (up or down) and (left or right):
          new_grid = fill(new_grid, val, {(i, j)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Iterate through grid cells:** 
   - **Check for non-background cells:** If a cell isn't the background:
     - **Check for adjacent non-background cells:**  We check if there are non-background cells above, below, left, or right of the current cell.
     - **Fill the cell in the new grid:** If there are adjacent non-background cells in both directions (horizontal and vertical), the cell is part of the trimmed object and is added to the new grid.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program_v3(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  transposed = dmirror(grid)
  trimmed_rows = tuple(r for r in grid if any(v != bg for v in r))
  trimmed_cols = tuple(c for c in transposed if any(v != bg for v in c))
  return dmirror(tuple(trimmed_cols for _ in range(len(trimmed_rows))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get background color and transpose:** This version leverages the transpose property for column-wise operations.
2. **Trim rows and columns:**  Iterate through rows and transposed columns, keeping only those containing non-background cells.
3. **Reconstruct and return:**  Transpose the trimmed columns back and repeat them to match the trimmed row count, effectively reconstructing the trimmed grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def program_v4(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  rows_to_keep = {i for i in range(h) if any(grid[i][j] != bg for j in range(w))}
  cols_to_keep = {j for j in range(w) if any(grid[i][j] != bg for i in range(h))}
  return tuple(tuple(grid[i][j] if i in rows_to_keep and j in cols_to_keep else bg for j in range(w)) for i in range(h))

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background and dimensions:**  Similar to previous versions.
2. **Find rows and columns to keep:** Similar to Version 1, we determine which rows and columns contain at least one non-background cell.
3. **Reconstruct the grid:**  We iterate through all cell indices and include the original cell value only if both its row and column indices are marked for keeping. Otherwise, we fill with the background color.

**Program Version 5**
```python
def program_v5(grid):
    bg = mostcolor(grid)
    objs = objects(grid, False, False, False)
    trimmed_objs = frozenset({(v, (i - uppermost(obj), j - leftmost(obj))) 
                               for v, (i, j) in obj} 
                              for obj in objs)
    trimmed_grid = canvas(bg, shape(grid))
    for obj in trimmed_objs:
        trimmed_grid = paint(trimmed_grid, obj)
    return trimmed_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get background color and objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Normalize each object:** For each object, shift it such that its upper-left corner aligns with the origin (0, 0).
3. **Create a blank canvas:**  Initialize a new grid filled with the background color and having the same dimensions as the input grid.
4. **Paint the normalized objects onto the canvas:** Iterate over the normalized objects and paint them onto the canvas. This effectively removes the background rows and columns surrounding the objects.


Each of these programs utilizes different aspects of the DSL to achieve the same outcome. They demonstrate the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for this specific task.
