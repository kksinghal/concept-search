## Transformation Analysis:

The task is to remove objects touching the top and bottom edges of the input grid. Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The 7-valued objects touching the top and bottom edges are removed. 
* The remaining 7-valued object in the center is preserved.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* The 6-valued objects touching the top and bottom edges are removed.
* The remaining 6-valued objects in the center are preserved.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* The 5-valued objects touching the top and bottom edges are removed. 
* No other objects are present.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Removes objects touching the top or bottom edge of the grid.
  """
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), # Create a blank canvas
      frozenset(
          obj 
          for obj in objects(I, T, T, T) # Get all objects
          if uppermost(obj) != 0 and lowermost(obj) != height(I) - 1 # Filter objects touching top or bottom
      )
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`**: Creates a blank canvas with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid.
2. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`**: Extracts all connected objects from the input grid.
3. **`uppermost(obj) != 0 and lowermost(obj) != height(I) - 1`**: Filters objects, keeping only those that don't touch the top (row 0) and bottom (row height-1) edges.
4. **`frozenset(...)`**: Creates a frozenset of the filtered objects.
5. **`paint(...)`**:  Paints the filtered objects onto the blank canvas, resulting in the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Removes objects touching the top or bottom edge of the grid.
  """
  return fill(
      I,
      mostcolor(I),
      frozenset(
          index
          for obj in objects(I, T, T, T)
          for index in toindices(obj)
          if uppermost(obj) == 0 or lowermost(obj) == height(I) - 1
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`**: Extracts all connected objects from the input grid.
2. **`uppermost(obj) == 0 or lowermost(obj) == height(I) - 1`**:  Filters objects, keeping only those that touch the top or bottom edge.
3. **`toindices(obj)`**:  Extracts the indices of each filtered object.
4. **`frozenset(...)`**:  Creates a frozenset of all indices belonging to objects touching the top or bottom edge.
5. **`fill(I, mostcolor(I), ...)`**:  Fills the input grid `I` at the specified indices with the background color, effectively removing the unwanted objects.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    """
    Removes objects touching the top or bottom edge of the grid.
    """
    h = height(I)
    return paint(
        canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
        frozenset(
            obj
            for obj in objects(I, T, T, T)
            if all(0 < i < h - 1 for i, _ in toindices(obj))
        )
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h = height(I)`**:  Gets the height of the input grid for convenience.
2. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`**: Creates a blank canvas.
3. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`**: Extracts all objects.
4. **`all(0 < i < h - 1 for i, _ in toindices(obj))`**: Filters objects, keeping only those where all cell indices are within the inner rows of the grid (not touching the top or bottom).
5. **`frozenset(...)`**: Creates a frozenset of the filtered objects.
6. **`paint(...)`**: Paints the filtered objects onto the blank canvas.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Removes objects touching the top or bottom edge of the grid.
  """
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
      sfilter(
          objects(I, T, T, T),
          lambda obj: uppermost(obj) != 0 and lowermost(obj) != height(I) - 1
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`**:  Creates a blank canvas.
2. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`**: Extracts all objects.
3. **`lambda obj: uppermost(obj) != 0 and lowermost(obj) != height(I) - 1`**: Defines a lambda function to filter objects based on whether they touch the top or bottom edge.
4. **`sfilter(...)`**: Filters the objects using the lambda function, keeping only those not touching the top or bottom.
5. **`paint(...)`**: Paints the filtered objects onto the blank canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    """
    Removes objects touching the top or bottom edge of the grid.
    """
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
    return paint(
        canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
        frozenset(
            obj
            for obj in objs
            if all((i, j) not in  (frozenset(toindices(obj)) & (outbox(I)))
                   for i, j in toindices(obj))
        )
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, T, T)`**: Extracts all objects from the input grid and stores them in the `objs` variable.
2. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`**: Creates a blank canvas with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid.
3. **`frozenset(obj for obj in objs if all((i, j) not in  (frozenset(toindices(obj)) & (outbox(I))) for i, j in toindices(obj)))`**: This line filters the objects and keeps only those that do not touch the outer boundary of the grid. It does this by:
   - Iterating over each object `obj` in `objs`.
   - Using a generator expression with `all` to check if all cells of an object satisfy a condition.
   - For each cell `(i, j)` in the `obj`, it checks if the cell is NOT present in the intersection of:
     - The set of indices of the object (`frozenset(toindices(obj))`) 
     - The set of indices forming the outer boundary of the grid (`outbox(I)`).
4. **`paint(...)`**:  Paints the filtered objects (those not touching the outer boundary) onto the blank canvas, resulting in the output grid.

This program effectively removes any object that touches the edges of the grid, keeping only the objects fully contained within the inner part of the input grid.
