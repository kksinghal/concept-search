## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids seems to involve removing any isolated objects (objects composed of a single cell) while preserving all other objects. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**  All single '7' digits are removed from the input grid, while the larger '7' objects remain.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Single instances of '6' are removed, leaving only the connected '6' objects.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** Similar to the previous examples, the isolated '5' digits are removed.

## Code Generation:

**Program_to_be_generated:** 

```python
def remove_isolated_cells(I):
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
               merge(apply(lambda obj: toobject(toindices(obj), I), 
                     sizefilter(objects(I, F, F, F), 2, greater))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, F, F, F)`:** This function identifies all connected objects within the input grid `I`, considering diagonal connections and excluding the background.
2. **`sizefilter(objects(I, F, F, F), 2, greater)`:**  This filters the identified objects, keeping only those with a size greater than 1 (not isolated cells).
3. **`apply(lambda obj: toobject(toindices(obj), I), ...)`:** This part iterates through the filtered objects and converts them back from indices to objects using the `toobject` function.
4. **`merge(...)`:** This merges all the remaining objects into a single set of cells.
5. **`paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), ...)`:** Finally, this paints the merged objects onto a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the original input grid.

This code effectively removes isolated cells from the input grid while preserving larger connected objects, achieving the desired transformation. 

## Alternative Implementations:

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def remove_isolated_cells(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
               merge([obj for obj in objects(I, F, F, F) if size(obj) > 1]))
```

**Explanation:** This version uses list comprehension for filtering objects based on size, offering a slightly different approach to achieve the same result.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def remove_isolated_cells(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, F)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
               merge(filter(lambda obj: size(obj) > 1, objs)))
```

**Explanation:**  This version first identifies all objects and then uses the `filter` function with a lambda expression to select objects with size greater than one before merging and painting them.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def remove_isolated_cells(I):
    non_isolated_cells = set()
    for obj in objects(I, F, F, F):
        if size(obj) > 1:
            non_isolated_cells.update(obj)
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), non_isolated_cells)
```

**Explanation:** This version iterates through the identified objects and adds the cells of non-isolated objects to a new set, which is then painted onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def remove_isolated_cells(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
               merge(sfilter(objects(I, F, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)))
```

**Explanation:** This version utilizes the `sfilter` function to filter the objects based on size before merging and painting them onto the canvas.
