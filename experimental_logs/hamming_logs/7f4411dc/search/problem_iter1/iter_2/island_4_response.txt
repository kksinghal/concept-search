## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation removes all occurrences of the least common color (0) from the input grid, except for those connected to the top border. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:** The transformation removes all occurrences of the least common color (0) from the input grid, except for those connected to the top or bottom borders.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**  The transformation removes all occurrences of the least common color (0) from the input grid, except for those connected to the top or bottom borders.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  non_top_objs = sfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda obj: uppermost(obj) != 0)
  non_bottom_objs = sfilter(non_top_objs, lambda obj: lowermost(obj) != len(I)-1)
  least_color_objs = sfilter(non_bottom_objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == leastcolor(I))
  indices_to_remove = merge(apply(toindices, least_color_objs))
  return fill(I, mostcolor(I), indices_to_remove)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects not connected to the top or bottom:** `non_top_objs` filters objects not touching the top border, and `non_bottom_objs` filters out those not touching the bottom either.
2. **Isolate least common color objects:**  `least_color_objs` selects objects from the previously filtered set that have the least common color.
3. **Get indices of cells to remove:**  `indices_to_remove` merges the indices of all cells belonging to the selected objects.
4. **Fill with the most common color:**  The final step fills the cells specified by `indices_to_remove` with the most common color in the grid.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  border_cells =  combine(
      toindices(objects(crop(I, (0,0), (1, width(I))), T, T, F)),
      toindices(objects(crop(I, (height(I)-1, 0), (1, width(I))), T, T, F))
  )
  to_keep = merge(apply(lambda obj: toindices(obj) if intersection(toindices(obj), border_cells) else {}, objects(I, T, T, T)))
  to_remove = difference(asindices(I), to_keep)
  return fill(I, mostcolor(I), to_remove)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify cells connected to top/bottom borders:**  `border_cells` gets the indices of cells in the top and bottom rows that are part of any object.
2. **Find objects intersecting with border cells:**  `to_keep` identifies and merges the indices of objects that have at least one cell overlapping with `border_cells`.
3. **Determine cells to remove:**  `to_remove` calculates the set difference between all indices in the grid and the indices to be kept.
4. **Fill with the most common color:**  Finally, the program fills the cells in `to_remove` with the most common color of the input grid.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
              merge(apply(lambda obj: obj if intersection(toindices(obj),
              combine(vfrontier((0,0)), vfrontier((0, width(I)-1)))) else {}, objects(I, T, T, T)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a blank canvas:** A canvas filled with the background color and the same dimensions as the input grid is created.
2. **Identify objects connected to the left/right borders:** Two vertical frontiers are defined, one for the leftmost column and one for the rightmost. Then, objects intersecting with either frontier are selected.
3. **Paint the selected objects onto the canvas:** The selected objects are painted onto the blank canvas, effectively removing objects not connected to the left/right borders.
4. **Return the painted canvas:** The modified canvas, now representing the desired output, is returned.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, mostcolor(I),
              merge(apply(lambda obj: toindices(obj) if (uppermost(obj) != 0 and lowermost(obj) != height(I)-1) else {},
                          objects(I, T, T, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects not connected to top/bottom borders:** The code iterates through each object and checks if its uppermost and lowermost indices match the top and bottom row indices of the grid. If neither condition is met, the object is considered not connected to those borders.
2. **Get indices of cells to remove:** The indices of all cells belonging to the identified objects are collected.
3. **Fill with the most common color:**  The program fills the cells corresponding to the collected indices with the most common color of the input grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  keep = []
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    if uppermost(obj) == 0 or lowermost(obj) == height(I)-1:
      keep.append(obj)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(keep))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects connected to top/bottom borders:** The code iterates over all objects in the grid and adds those that have their uppermost index at the top border or their lowermost index at the bottom border to a list called `keep`.
2. **Create a blank canvas:** A canvas filled with the most common color and having the same dimensions as the input grid is created.
3. **Paint kept objects onto the canvas:** All objects stored in the `keep` list are painted onto the blank canvas.
4. **Return the painted canvas:** The modified canvas, now containing only the objects connected to the top or bottom borders, is returned as the final output. 

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
