## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** Remove the single-cell '7' objects from the grid. All other objects remain unchanged.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Remove the single-cell '6' objects from the grid. All other objects remain unchanged.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** Remove the single-cell '5' objects from the grid. All other objects remain unchanged.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Find all objects
  x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda o: size(o) > 1)  # Keep only objects with more than one cell
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(x2))  # Paint the remaining objects onto a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, F)` finds all connected objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Filter by Size:**  `sfilter(x1, lambda o: size(o) > 1)` keeps only the objects that have a size greater than 1 (more than one cell).
3. **Create Blank Canvas:** `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates a blank grid of the same size as the input, filled with the most frequent color (background).
4. **Paint Remaining Objects:** `paint(..., merge(x2))` combines all remaining objects and paints them onto the blank canvas.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I  # Start with the input grid
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if len(objects(crop(I, (i, j), (1, 1)), T, F, F)) == 1:  # Check if cell is a single-cell object
        O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(i, j)})  # Fill with background color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:** This version iterates over each cell in the input grid.
2. **Check for Single-Cell Object:** For each cell, it checks if the cell is a single-cell object using `objects` on a 1x1 cropped area.
3. **Fill with Background:** If it's a single-cell object, it fills that cell with the background color using `fill`.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Find all objects
  x2 = mfilter(x1, lambda o: toindices(o))  # Get indices of all objects
  x3 = sfilter(asindices(I), lambda ij: not contained(ij, x2))  # Find indices not part of any object
  O = fill(I, mostcolor(I), x3)  # Fill those indices with the background color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Objects and Indices:** Similar to Version 1, this version finds all objects and extracts their indices.
2. **Find Unassigned Indices:** It then finds the indices of the grid that are not part of any object, which represent the single-cell objects.
3. **Fill Unassigned Indices:** Finally, it fills those indices with the background color.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = palette(I)  # Get all colors in the grid
  x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda c: colorcount(I, c) == 1)  # Find colors used only once
  O = I  # Start with the input grid
  for c in x2:
    O = replace(O, c, mostcolor(I))  # Replace single-occurrence colors with the background color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Unique Colors:** This version finds colors that appear only once in the grid, indicating a single-cell object.
2. **Replace Unique Colors:** It then iterates through the unique colors and replaces them with the background color.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Find all objects
  x2 = extract(x1, lambda o: size(o) == minimum(apply(size, x1)))  # Find the smallest object
  x3 = sfilter(x1, lambda o: not equality(o, x2))  # Remove the smallest object from the set
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(x3))  # Paint the remaining objects on a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Smallest Object:** This version identifies the smallest object in the grid. 
2. **Remove Smallest Object:** It then removes this smallest object from the set of objects.
3. **Paint Remaining Objects:** Finally, it paints the remaining objects onto a blank canvas, effectively removing the smallest object (which, in these cases, are the single-cell objects).


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same goal: identifying and removing single-cell objects from the input grid. They showcase the flexibility and expressive power of the provided DSL.
