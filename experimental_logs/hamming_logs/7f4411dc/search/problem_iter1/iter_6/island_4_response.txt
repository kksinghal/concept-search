## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves removing objects that touch the top or bottom border of the grid.

**Input 0:** The objects with values '0' and '7' touching the top or bottom border are removed. 

**Input 1:** The objects with value '6' touching the top or bottom border are removed. 

**Input 2:** The objects with value '5' touching the top or bottom border are removed.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
      frozenset(
          obj for obj in objects(I, T, T, T) 
          if uppermost(obj) != 0 and lowermost(obj) != height(I) - 1
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`uppermost(obj) != 0 and lowermost(obj) != height(I) - 1`:**  Filters out objects that touch the top or bottom border.
3. **`frozenset(...)`:** Creates a new set of objects containing only the non-border-touching objects.
4. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates a blank canvas with the same dimensions and background color as the input.
5. **`paint(..., ...)`:**  Paints the filtered objects onto the blank canvas.


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def not_touching_border(obj):
        return uppermost(obj) != 0 and lowermost(obj) != height(I) - 1
    return paint(
        canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
        sfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), not_touching_border)
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`not_touching_border(obj)`:** Defines a helper function that checks if an object touches the top or bottom border.
2. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
3. **`sfilter(..., not_touching_border)`:** Filters the objects, keeping only those that don't touch the border.
4. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:**  Creates a blank canvas with the same dimensions and background color as the input.
5. **`paint(..., ...)`:** Paints the filtered objects onto the blank canvas.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h = height(I)
    w = width(I)
    return paint(
        canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w)),
        frozenset(
            obj
            for obj in objects(I, T, T, T)
            if all(0 < i < h - 1 for i, _ in toindices(obj))
        )
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h = height(I)` and `w = width(I)`**:  Gets the height and width of the input grid.
2. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
3. **`all(0 < i < h - 1 for i, _ in toindices(obj))`:** Checks if all row indices of an object are within the grid excluding the first and last rows.
4. **`frozenset(...)`:** Creates a new set of objects containing only the objects entirely within the grid.
5. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))`:** Creates a blank canvas with the same dimensions and background color as the input.
6. **`paint(..., ...)`:**  Paints the filtered objects onto the blank canvas.


### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(
        canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
        frozenset(
            toobject(
                difference(
                    asindices(I), 
                    frozenset((i, j) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(width(I)) if i == 0 or i == height(I)-1)
                ),
                I
            ) for obj in objects(I, T, T, T)
        )
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`frozenset((i, j) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(width(I)) if i == 0 or i == height(I)-1)`:** Creates a set of indices representing the top and bottom borders.
3. **`asindices(I)`:** Gets all indices of the grid.
4. **`difference(..., ...)`:** Removes the border indices from the grid indices.
5. **`toobject(..., I)`:** Creates an object from the remaining indices, using the corresponding values from the grid.
6. **`frozenset(...)`:** Creates a new set containing only the object within the grid, excluding the borders.
7. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates a blank canvas.
8. **`paint(..., ...)`:** Paints the filtered object onto the blank canvas.


### Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  h = height(I)
  border_objs = frozenset(obj for obj in objs if uppermost(obj) == 0 or lowermost(obj) == h - 1)
  non_border_objs = difference(objs, border_objs)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), non_border_objs) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`h = height(I)`:**  Gets the height of the input grid.
3. **`border_objs = frozenset(obj for obj in objs if uppermost(obj) == 0 or lowermost(obj) == h - 1)`:**  Creates a set of objects that touch either the top or bottom border.
4. **`non_border_objs = difference(objs, border_objs)`:** Creates a new set of objects containing only the objects that don't touch the top or bottom border.
5. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates a blank canvas with the same dimensions and background color as the input.
6. **`paint(..., ...)`:** Paints the filtered objects onto the blank canvas. 

These five versions utilize different DSL functions and logic while achieving the same goal. They demonstrate the flexibility of the DSL and provide a diverse set of solutions to the problem.
