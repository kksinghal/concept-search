## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation removes all instances of the most common color in the input grid which are not part of a continuous horizontal or vertical line.

**Input 0:** The isolated '7's are removed while the horizontal and vertical lines of '7's remain.

**Input 1:** Similar to Input 0, isolated '6's are removed.

**Input 2:**  Isolated '5's are removed.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, False)
  filtered_objs = frozenset(obj for obj in objs if hline(obj) or vline(obj))
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(grid)), merge(filtered_objs)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background color:** `bg = mostcolor(grid)` finds the most frequent color.
2. **Find continuous objects:** `objs = objects(grid, True, False, False)` identifies all continuous objects of the same color, excluding diagonals.
3. **Filter for lines:** `filtered_objs = frozenset(obj for obj in objs if hline(obj) or vline(obj))` keeps only objects forming horizontal or vertical lines.
4. **Reconstruct grid:** `return paint(canvas(bg, shape(grid)), merge(filtered_objs))` creates a blank canvas filled with the background color and paints the remaining line objects onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  return cellwise(
      grid,
      paint(canvas(bg, shape(grid)), 
            merge(
              sfilter(objects(grid, True, False, False), 
                      lambda obj: hline(obj) or vline(obj))
            )
      ),
      bg
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses `cellwise` to directly compare the original grid with a reconstructed grid containing only the lines. 

1. **Steps 1-3 are the same as in Version 1.**
2. **Cellwise comparison:**  
    - `paint(canvas(bg, shape(grid)), merge(...))` reconstructs the grid with only lines.
    - `cellwise(grid, ..., bg)` compares each cell of the original grid with the reconstructed one. If they match, the original value is kept; otherwise, the background color is used.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      bg if (i, j) in delta(merge(
        sfilter(objects(grid, True, False, False), 
                lambda obj: hline(obj) or vline(obj)))) else grid[i][j]
      for j in range(len(grid[0]))) 
    for i in range(len(grid)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates over each cell and checks if it belongs to the delta (surrounding area excluding the object itself) of any line object.

1. **Steps 1-2 are the same as in Version 1.**
2. **Find delta of lines:** `delta(merge(...))` identifies all cells within the bounding box of line objects but not part of the lines themselves.
3. **Replace delta cells:** The nested loops iterate over each cell and replace it with the background color if it belongs to the delta of any line object.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  line_indices = merge(apply(toindices, 
                          sfilter(objects(grid, True, False, False), 
                                  lambda obj: hline(obj) or vline(obj))))
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      bg if (i, j) not in line_indices else grid[i][j]
      for j in range(len(grid[0]))) 
    for i in range(len(grid)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly identifies the indices of cells belonging to the line objects and uses them for comparison.

1. **Steps 1-2 are the same as in Version 1.**
2. **Extract line indices:** `line_indices = merge(apply(toindices, ...))` extracts all indices belonging to the line objects.
3. **Replace non-line cells:** The nested loops iterate over each cell and replace it with the background color if its index is not present in `line_indices`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(bg, shape(grid))
  for obj in objects(grid, True, False, False):
    if hline(obj) or vline(obj):
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, obj)
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version simplifies the logic by directly painting the line objects onto a canvas filled with the background color.

1. **Identify background color:** `bg = mostcolor(grid)` finds the most frequent color.
2. **Create blank canvas:** `new_grid = canvas(bg, shape(grid))` generates a grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
3. **Find continuous objects:** `for obj in objects(grid, True, False, False):` iterates over all continuous objects.
4. **Paint line objects:** If an object is a horizontal or vertical line (`if hline(obj) or vline(obj):`), it is painted onto the `new_grid`.
5. **Return modified grid:** The `new_grid`, now containing only the line objects, is returned.
