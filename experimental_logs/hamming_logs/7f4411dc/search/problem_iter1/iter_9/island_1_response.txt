## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids seems to involve these steps:

1. **Identify Non-Single Cell Objects:** The transformation focuses on objects formed by connecting adjacent cells with the same value (excluding single-cell objects). 
2. **Remove Single-Cell Objects:** All single-cell objects are removed from the grid.
3. **Maintain Object Positions and Shapes:** The remaining objects retain their original shapes and positions within the grid.
4. **Background Fill:** The remaining area of the grid, where single-cell objects were removed, is filled with the background color (most frequent color in the original grid).


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = mostcolor(I)  # Identify background color
  x2 = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Extract all objects (4-connected)
  x3 = sfilter(x2, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)  # Filter for objects larger than one cell
  O = paint(canvas(x1, shape(I)), x3)  # Paint filtered objects onto a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`x1 = mostcolor(I)`:**  Identifies the background color.
2. **`x2 = objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid, considering 4-connectivity.
3. **`x3 = sfilter(x2, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)`:** Filters the objects, keeping only those with more than one cell.
4. **`O = paint(canvas(x1, shape(I)), x3)`:** Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (`x1`), and paints the filtered objects (`x3`) onto it. 

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects, excluding background (4-connected)
  x2 = sizefilter(x1, 1)  # Filter for single-cell objects
  x3 = difference(x1, x2)  # Remove single-cell objects from the object list
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), x3)  # Paint remaining objects on a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts objects from the input, excluding the background color, using 4-connectivity.
2. **`x2 = sizefilter(x1, 1)`:**  Identifies all single-cell objects.
3. **`x3 = difference(x1, x2)`:** Removes the single-cell objects from the complete object list.
4. **`O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), x3)`:** Creates a canvas with the background color and paints the remaining (non-single-cell) objects onto it.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = palette(I) # Get all unique colors in the input
  x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda c: colorcount(I, c) > 1) # Filter colors with more than one cell
  x3 = partition(I)  # Partition the grid into objects based on color
  x4 = mfilter(x3, lambda obj: color(obj) in x2) # Keep only objects with filtered colors
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), x4) # Paint the remaining objects on a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`x1 = palette(I)`:** Extracts all unique colors present in the input grid.
2. **`x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda c: colorcount(I, c) > 1)`:** Filters the colors, keeping only those appearing in more than one cell.
3. **`x3 = partition(I)`:** Partitions the input grid into objects based on color.
4. **`x4 = mfilter(x3, lambda obj: color(obj) in x2)`:**  Filters the objects, keeping those whose color is present in the filtered color list (`x2`).
5. **`O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), x4)`:** Creates a blank canvas with the background color and paints the remaining objects onto it.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, F) # Extract all objects (4-connected)
  x2 = apply(lambda obj: size(obj) > 1, x1)  # Check if each object is larger than one cell
  x3 = pair(totuple(x1), totuple(x2)) # Pair objects with their size check result
  x4 = apply(lambda x: x[0] if x[1] else {}, x3) # Keep only objects larger than one cell
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(x4)) # Paint remaining objects on a blank canvas
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`x1 = objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid.
2. **`x2 = apply(lambda obj: size(obj) > 1, x1)`:** Checks if each object has a size greater than one cell.
3. **`x3 = pair(totuple(x1), totuple(x2))`:** Pairs each object with its corresponding size check result (True/False).
4. **`x4 = apply(lambda x: x[0] if x[1] else {}, x3)`:** Filters the paired list, keeping only the objects where the size check was True.
5. **`O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(x4))`:**  Creates a canvas and paints the remaining objects (larger than one cell) onto it. 


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, F) # Get all objects (4-connected)
  x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda obj: not square(obj) and size(obj)>1) #Filter objects not squares and size > 1
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), x2) # Paint the filtered objects on a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`x1 = objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Extracts all objects from the grid, using 4-connectivity.
2. **`x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda obj: not square(obj) and size(obj)>1)`:** Filters the objects, keeping only those that are not squares and have a size greater than one cell.
3. **`O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), x2)`:** Creates a blank canvas filled with the background color and paints the filtered objects onto it. 

These five program versions provide diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformation, each utilizing different DSL function combinations and logic.
