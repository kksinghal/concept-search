## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation removes isolated pixels from the input grid. This means that only pixels connected to at least one other pixel with the same color remain in the output.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The isolated "7" pixels at positions (0,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1) and (12,2) are removed. The remaining connected "7" structures remain unchanged.
* **Input_1:** All isolated "6" pixels are removed, leaving only the connected "6" structures.
* **Input_2:** The isolated "5" pixels at (0,1), (1,6), and (6,5) are removed. 


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in filtered_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The `objects` function identifies connected groups of pixels with the same color. The `univalued=True` argument ensures that only pixels of the same color are considered connected.
2. **Filter Objects:** The `sfilter` function filters out objects containing only a single pixel. 
3. **Create Canvas:** A blank canvas with the same size and background color as the input grid is created.
4. **Paint Objects:** The remaining connected objects are painted back onto the canvas.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if any((i > 0 and I[i][j] == I[i-1][j], 
              i < len(I)-1 and I[i][j] == I[i+1][j],
              j > 0 and I[i][j] == I[i][j-1],
              j < len(I[0])-1 and I[i][j] == I[i][j+1])):
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** A blank canvas with the same size and background color as the input is created.
2. **Iterate and Check Neighbors:** The code iterates through each cell and checks if it has a neighbor (up, down, left, or right) with the same color.
3. **Paint Connected Cells:** If a cell has at least one matching neighbor, it is painted onto the canvas.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(1, len(I)-1):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0])-1):
      if I[i][j] == I[i-1][j] or I[i][j] == I[i+1][j] or I[i][j] == I[i][j-1] or I[i][j] == I[i][j+1]:
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Program Version 2 but iterates only over the inner cells of the grid (excluding the border). This optimization assumes that border pixels cannot be isolated, which is true for the given examples.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
                 merge(apply(lambda obj: obj if size(obj) > 1 else {}, 
                             objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages a more functional approach:

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1, it identifies connected objects.
2. **Conditional Replacement:** For each object, it applies a lambda function that returns the object if its size is greater than 1 (connected) and an empty set otherwise.
3. **Merge and Paint:** The resulting filtered objects are merged and painted onto a blank canvas.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    indices_to_remove = mfilter(asindices(I), 
                                   lambda idx: all(I[idx[0]][idx[1]] != I[n[0]][n[1]] for n in dneighbors(idx) if 0 <= n[0] < len(I) and 0 <= n[1] < len(I[0])))
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
                 toobject(difference(asindices(I), indices_to_remove), I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Indices to Remove:** It identifies indices of isolated pixels by checking if all their direct neighbors have different colors.
2. **Calculate Remaining Indices:** It computes the difference between all grid indices and the identified isolated indices.
3. **Paint Remaining Cells:** It paints the cells corresponding to the remaining indices onto a blank canvas.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformation, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.
