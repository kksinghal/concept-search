## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently removes single-cell objects from the input grid while preserving all other objects and the background color. 

* **Input 0:** The lone '7's scattered throughout the grid are removed, leaving only the larger '7' object intact.
* **Input 1:**  All individual '6's are removed, while the connected '6' objects remain.
* **Input 2:** Similar to the previous examples, the isolated '5's disappear.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def cfaffdaedadbefdbideaegfggbhgefai(I):
  """
  Identifies and removes single-cell objects from the grid.
  """
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Find all objects
  single_cell_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) == 1)  # Filter for single-cell objects
  indices_to_remove = mapply(lambda obj: first(toindices(obj)), single_cell_objs)  # Get indices of single-cell objects
  O = fill(I, mostcolor(I), indices_to_remove)  # Fill those indices with background color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Filter Single-Cell Objects:** `sfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) == 1)` filters the object list to retain only those objects containing a single cell.
3. **Extract Indices:** `mapply(lambda obj: first(toindices(obj)), single_cell_objs)` extracts the indices of these single-cell objects.
4. **Fill with Background:** `fill(I, mostcolor(I), indices_to_remove)` overwrites the single-cell object indices with the background color, effectively removing them.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def cfaffdaedadbefdbideaegfggbhgefai(I):
  """
  Iterates through the grid, removing cells that are not part of larger objects. 
  """
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create an empty canvas with the background color
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if size(objects(crop(I, (i,j), (1,1)), T, F, T)) > 1:  # Check if the cell is part of a larger object
        O[i][j] = I[i][j]  # If part of a larger object, copy the cell
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** `O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates a blank grid filled with the background color of the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Check:** The program iterates through every cell of the input grid. For each cell, it creates a 1x1 subgrid using `crop(I, (i,j), (1,1))` and uses the `objects` function to check if this cell belongs to an object larger than a single cell. 
3. **Conditional Copying:** If the cell is part of a larger object, `O[i][j] = I[i][j]` copies the cell value to the output grid. Otherwise, the cell on the output grid remains the background color, effectively removing the single-cell object.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def cfaffdaedadbefdbideaegfggbhgefai(I):
  """
  Constructs the output grid by selectively adding back non-single-cell objects from the input grid.
  """
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Find all objects
  multi_cell_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1) # Keep objects with more than one cell
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create empty canvas
  for obj in multi_cell_objs:
      O = paint(O, obj)  # Paint multi-cell objects onto the canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all distinct objects in the input grid.
2. **Filter Objects:** `sfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)` filters the objects, retaining only those with more than one cell.
3. **Create Empty Canvas:**  `O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` generates a blank grid filled with the input grid's background color.
4. **Paint Objects:** The program iterates through the `multi_cell_objs` and uses `paint(O, obj)` to draw each object onto the canvas. This effectively reconstructs the grid without the single-cell objects.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def cfaffdaedadbefdbideaegfggbhgefai(I):
  """
  Utilizes a difference operation to exclude single-cell object indices from the grid's indices.
  """
  all_indices = asindices(I)  # Get indices of all cells in the grid
  single_cell_indices = mapply(lambda obj: first(toindices(obj)), sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) == 1))  # Get indices of single-cell objects
  remaining_indices = difference(all_indices, single_cell_indices)  # Find the difference
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create an empty canvas
  for i, j in remaining_indices:
      O[i][j] = I[i][j]  # Copy values from input to output grid at remaining indices
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get All Indices:** `all_indices = asindices(I)` creates a set of all cell indices in the input grid.
2. **Get Single-Cell Indices:**  Similar to previous versions, this line identifies and extracts the indices of all single-cell objects.
3. **Difference Operation:** `remaining_indices = difference(all_indices, single_cell_indices)`  calculates the set difference, leaving only the indices that are not part of single-cell objects.
4. **Fill Output Grid:**  The code iterates through `remaining_indices`, copying the corresponding cell values from the input to the output grid. The output grid is pre-filled with the background color.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def cfaffdaedadbefdbideaegfggbhgefai(I):
  """
  Applies a mask to the input grid, effectively filtering out single-cell objects.
  """
  mask = canvas(1, shape(I))  # Create a mask filled with 1s
  single_cell_indices = mapply(lambda obj: first(toindices(obj)), sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) == 1))  # Get indices of single-cell objects
  for i, j in single_cell_indices:
      mask[i][j] = 0  # Set mask values to 0 at single-cell object indices
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create an empty canvas 
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if mask[i][j]:
        O[i][j] = I[i][j]  # Copy cell value only if the corresponding mask value is 1
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Mask:** `mask = canvas(1, shape(I))` creates a grid of the same size as the input, initially filled with '1's. This grid acts as a mask.
2. **Mark Single-Cell Objects:**  The code identifies single-cell object indices and sets the corresponding mask values to '0'. 
3. **Apply Mask:** The program iterates through the input grid.  If the corresponding mask value is '1', it copies the cell value to the output grid.  Since the mask has '0's where single-cell objects are located, those cells are skipped, effectively removing them from the output.


Each of these five program versions presents a distinct approach to achieving the same goal: removing single-cell objects while maintaining other objects and the background color. This demonstrates the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
