## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation removes single-pixel objects from the input grid while preserving the larger objects and their original positions. The background color remains unchanged.

**Output_0 (from Input_0):** All single-pixel '7's are removed, leaving only the larger '7' object intact.

**Output_1 (from Input_1):**  Similar to Output_0, all single-pixel '6's are removed, preserving only the larger '6' objects.

**Output_2 (from Input_2):**  The isolated '5's at the corners are removed, while the larger '5' object remains.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
               merge(sfilter(objects(I, F, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, F, F, F)`:**  Identifies all connected objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`sfilter(objects(...), lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)`:** Filters the objects, keeping only those with a size greater than 1 (not single pixels).
3. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the remaining objects into a single set of cells.
4. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates a blank canvas with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid.
5. **`paint(canvas(...), merge(...))`:**  Paints the merged objects onto the blank canvas, resulting in the final output.


**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
               mfilter(objects(I, F, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) > 1))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, F, F, F)`:**  Identifies all connected objects in the input grid.
2. **`lambda obj: size(obj) > 1`:** Defines an anonymous function to check if an object's size is greater than 1.
3. **`mfilter(objects(...), lambda obj: ...)`:** Filters the objects based on the lambda function and directly merges them, combining the filtering and merging steps.
4. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:**  Creates a blank canvas with the same background and dimensions as the input.
5. **`paint(canvas(...), mfilter(...))`:** Paints the merged, filtered objects onto the canvas, producing the output.


**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, F)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
               merge(obj for obj in objs if size(obj) != 1)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, F, F, F)`:** Stores the identified objects in the variable `objs`.
2. **`merge(obj for obj in objs if size(obj) != 1)`:**  Iterates through each object in `objs` and merges those that don't have a size of 1.
3. **`paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(...))`:** Paints the merged objects onto a blank canvas of the same background and dimensions as the input.


**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
                 frozenset.union(*[obj for obj in objects(I, F, F, F) if size(obj) > 1]))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`[obj for obj in objects(I, F, F, F) if size(obj) > 1]`:**  Creates a list comprehension that filters objects from the input grid, keeping only those with sizes greater than one.
2.  **`frozenset.union(*...)`:** This applies the `frozenset.union` function to the elements of the previously created list. The `*` operator unpacks the list, effectively merging all the objects in the list into a single `frozenset`.
3. **`paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), ...)`:**  This takes the merged `frozenset` of objects and paints them onto a canvas of the same background and dimensions as the input grid. 


**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, F)
  large_objs = frozenset(obj for obj in objs if size(obj) > 1)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(large_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, F, F, F)`:**  Identifies all connected objects in the grid.
2. **`large_objs = frozenset(obj for obj in objs if size(obj) > 1)`:**  Creates a new `frozenset` called `large_objs` containing only objects larger than one pixel. 
3. **`merge(large_objs)`:** Merges the `large_objs` into a single set of cells. 
4. **`paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), ...)`:** Paints the merged objects onto a new canvas with the same background and dimensions as the input.
