## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves identifying the primary object (determined by the least frequent color) and its occurrences within the grid. Then, it creates a new grid where each occurrence of the primary object is shifted diagonally by one cell in a specific direction (down-right in these examples). The remaining cells in the output grid are filled with the background color (most frequent color in the input).

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- The primary object is the digit '4'.
- The occurrences are shifted down-right by one cell.
- Background color '0' fills the rest of the grid.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- The primary object is the digit '6'.
- The occurrences are shifted down-right by one cell.
- Background color '0' fills the rest of the grid.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

- The primary object is the digit '9'.
- The occurrences are shifted down-right by one cell.
- Background color '0' fills the rest of the grid.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  obj = leastcommon(merge(I))
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  target_obj = extract(objs, lambda o: color(o) == obj)
  shifted_obj = shift(target_obj, (1, 1))
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), shifted_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background color and primary object:** `bg` is set to the most common color, and `obj` is set to the least common color in the input grid.
2. **Find occurrences of the primary object:** `objs` stores all objects, and `target_obj` extracts the object with the `obj` color.
3. **Shift the object:** `shifted_obj` is created by shifting the `target_obj` down-right by one cell using `(1, 1)` offset.
4. **Create output grid:** A new grid `O` is created with the `bg` color and the same shape as the input, and then the `shifted_obj` is painted onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  fg = leastcolor(I)
  locs = ofcolor(I, fg)
  shifted_locs = shift(locs, (1, 1))
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), recolor(fg, shifted_locs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background and foreground colors:** `bg` and `fg` are assigned the most and least common colors in the input, respectively.
2. **Find locations of the foreground color:** `locs` stores the indices of cells containing the `fg` color.
3. **Shift the locations:** `shifted_locs` is created by shifting all indices in `locs` down-right by one cell.
4. **Create output grid:** A blank canvas `O` is filled with `bg` color. Then, the `shifted_locs` are painted with the `fg` color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  obj = leastcommon(merge(I))
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == obj:
        ni, nj = i + 1, j + 1
        if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(row):
          O = fill(O, obj, {(ni, nj)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background color and primary object:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Iterate through the input grid:**  The code iterates over each cell in the input grid `I`.
3. **Check for primary object and fill output:** If the cell value matches the `obj`, it calculates the shifted indices (`ni`, `nj`). If the shifted indices are within the grid boundaries, it fills the corresponding cell in the output grid `O` with the `obj` color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  obj = leastcommon(merge(I))
  shifted_obj = {(obj, (i + 1, j + 1)) for i, r in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(r) if v == obj}
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), frozenset(shifted_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background color and primary object:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Calculate shifted object:** `shifted_obj` is created directly by iterating through the input grid and adding the shifted coordinates of cells containing the `obj` color.
3. **Create output grid:** A blank canvas `O` is filled with `bg` color. Then, the `shifted_obj` is painted onto it.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  obj = leastcommon(merge(I))
  shifted_indices = mapply(lambda ij: (ij[0] + 1, ij[1] + 1), ofcolor(I, obj))
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), recolor(obj, shifted_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background color and primary object:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Find and shift locations:** `shifted_indices` stores the shifted indices of cells containing the `obj` color by applying a lambda function to shift each index in the output of `ofcolor`.
3. **Create output grid:** A blank canvas `O` is filled with `bg` color. Then, the `shifted_indices` are painted with the `obj` color.


Each of these program versions provides a distinct approach to achieve the desired transformation while utilizing different DSL function combinations and logic.
