## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on highlighting a specific shape within the grid, treating all other values as background. 

* **Shape:** The shape appears to be a cross (a plus sign '+'), formed by connecting the midpoints of each side of the grid.
* **Color:** The cross retains its original color from the input grid.
* **Background:**  All other cells, not part of the cross, become 0.

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**
* The cross is formed by the digit '4'.
* All other cells are replaced with '0'.

**Input_1:**
* The cross is formed by the digit '6'.
* All other cells are replaced with '0'.

**Input_2:**
* The cross is formed by the digit '9'.
* All other cells are replaced with '0'.


## Program_to_be_generated (Five Versions)

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Identifies the cross shape and paints it back onto a blank canvas.
  """
  cross_color = mostcommon(I)  # Assuming the cross color is the most frequent
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas of 0s
  h, w = shape(I)
  
  # Draw the horizontal line
  O = fill(O, cross_color, hfrontier((h // 2, 0)))
  # Draw the vertical line
  O = fill(O, cross_color, vfrontier((0, w // 2)))
  
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`cross_color = mostcommon(I)`:**  Identifies the color of the cross, assuming it is the most frequent digit in the grid.
2. **`O = canvas(0, shape(I))`:** Creates a blank canvas (grid) filled with 0s, having the same dimensions as the input grid.
3. **`h, w = shape(I)`:**  Extracts the height and width of the input grid for calculations.
4. **`O = fill(O, cross_color, hfrontier((h // 2, 0)))`:**  Draws the horizontal line of the cross using `hfrontier` to get the indices and fills them with the `cross_color`.
5. **`O = fill(O, cross_color, vfrontier((0, w // 2)))`:** Draws the vertical line of the cross using `vfrontier`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Directly modifies the input grid, replacing non-cross values with 0.
  """
  cross_color = mostcommon(I)
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if i != h // 2 and j != w // 2:
        I = fill(I, 0, {(i, j)})
        
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`cross_color = mostcommon(I)`:**  Identifies the likely cross color.
2. **`h, w = len(I), len(I[0])`:**  Gets the grid dimensions.
3. **`for i in range(h): ...`:** Iterates through each cell of the grid.
4. **`if i != h // 2 and j != w // 2:`:** If the cell is not on the central row or column (not part of the cross).
5. **`I = fill(I, 0, {(i, j)})`:** Replace the cell's value with '0'.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Creates the cross shape as an object and paints it onto a blank canvas.
  """
  h, w = shape(I)
  cross_indices = hfrontier((h // 2, 0)) | vfrontier((0, w // 2)) 
  cross = toobject(cross_indices, I)  # Extract the cross as an object
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  O = paint(O, cross)  # Paint the cross object onto the blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h, w = shape(I)`:**  Gets the dimensions of the grid.
2. **`cross_indices = hfrontier((h // 2, 0)) | vfrontier((0, w // 2))`:**  Calculates the indices of the cells that form the cross.
3. **`cross = toobject(cross_indices, I)`:**  Extracts the cross shape as an object with color information.
4. **`O = canvas(0, shape(I))`:**  Creates a blank canvas of 0s.
5. **`O = paint(O, cross)`:** Paints the extracted cross object onto the blank canvas.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Uses set operations to identify and keep only the cross cells.
  """
  h, w = shape(I)
  all_indices = asindices(I) 
  cross_indices = hfrontier((h // 2, 0)) | vfrontier((0, w // 2))
  non_cross_indices = all_indices - cross_indices  # Find indices not part of the cross
  O = fill(I, 0, non_cross_indices)  # Fill non-cross areas with 0s
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h, w = shape(I)`:**  Gets the dimensions of the grid.
2. **`all_indices = asindices(I)`:** Gets the indices of all cells in the grid.
3. **`cross_indices = hfrontier(...) | vfrontier(...)`:** Calculates the indices forming the cross.
4. **`non_cross_indices = all_indices - cross_indices`:**  Uses set difference to find indices not belonging to the cross.
5. **`O = fill(I, 0, non_cross_indices)`:** Fills the cells at  `non_cross_indices` with '0'.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Leverages symmetry to create the cross by mirroring a single line.
  """
  h, w = shape(I)
  half_vline = vfrontier((0, w // 2))[:h // 2 + 1]  # Get half the vertical line
  cross_indices = half_vline | hmirror(half_vline)  # Mirror to get the full cross
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  O = fill(O, mostcommon(I), cross_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h, w = shape(I)`:**  Gets the grid dimensions.
2. **`half_vline = vfrontier((0, w // 2))[:h // 2 + 1]`:** Creates half of the vertical line of the cross.
3. **`cross_indices = half_vline | hmirror(half_vline)`:**  Mirrors the half line horizontally to generate the full cross indices. 
4. **`O = canvas(0, shape(I))`:**  Creates a blank canvas of 0s.
5. **`O = fill(O, mostcommon(I), cross_indices)`:**  Fills the `cross_indices` with the most common color (assumed to be the cross color).


These five versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
