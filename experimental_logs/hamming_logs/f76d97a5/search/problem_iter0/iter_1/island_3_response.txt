## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to isolate the core of each object, pushing its borders outwards to create a frame of the background color. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**
- The central '5' of the object expands outwards, replacing the surrounding '4's. 
- The outermost layer of '4's remains unchanged.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**
-  The central '5's of the diamond expand, replacing the '6's adjacent to them. 
- The '6's on the outer edges are maintained.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**
- The core '5's expand, replacing adjacent '9's.
-  Notice how the expansion favors vertical and horizontal directions, leaving diagonally touching '9's intact.

## Code Improvement:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL functions. Each version implements the transformation logic described above with different approaches:

### Program Version 1:

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), objs)  # Initialize with background and paint objects
  for obj in objs:
    O = underpaint(O, shift(obj, (1, 0))) # Expand object downwards
    O = underpaint(O, shift(obj, (-1, 0))) # Expand object upwards
    O = underpaint(O, shift(obj, (0, 1))) # Expand object rightwards
    O = underpaint(O, shift(obj, (0, -1))) # Expand object leftwards
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Obtain background color (`bg`) and identify individual objects (`objs`).  A blank canvas filled with the background color is created and objects are painted onto it.
2. **Expansion:** For each object, it is shifted one unit in each of the four cardinal directions and painted onto the canvas, overwriting only background cells due to `underpaint`.

### Program Version 2:

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  dilated_objs = mapply(lambda obj: merge(apply(lambda d: shift(obj, d), ((0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)))), objs)
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), dilated_objs) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1, we obtain background color and identify objects.
2. **Dilation:**  We use `mapply` to apply a lambda function to each object. This function shifts the object in all four directions using `apply`, then merges the shifted copies using `merge`. This effectively dilates the object by one unit.
3. **Painting:**  Finally, we paint the dilated objects onto a blank canvas filled with the background color.


### Program Version 3:

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  shifted_objs = mfilter(lambda obj: apply(lambda d: shift(obj, d), ((0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0))), objs)
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), shifted_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1, we obtain background color and identify objects.
2. **Shifting:**  We use `mfilter` to apply a lambda function to each object. This function shifts the object in all four directions using `apply`. 
3. **Painting:**  Finally, we paint the shifted objects onto a blank canvas filled with the background color.

### Program Version 4:

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
    for x in range(2):
        for obj in objs:
            O = underpaint(O, shift(obj, (1 - 2*x, 0)))
            O = underpaint(O, shift(obj, (0, 1 - 2*x)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1, we obtain background color and identify objects. A blank canvas filled with the background color is created.
2. **Expansion:** We loop twice, switching the direction of expansion in each iteration. This ensures objects expand in all four directions.

### Program Version 5:

```python
def solve(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
    for obj in objs:
        for dx in range(-1, 2):
            for dy in range(-1, 2):
                if abs(dx) != abs(dy): # Avoid diagonal expansion
                    O = underpaint(O, shift(obj, (dx, dy)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1, we obtain background color and identify objects. A blank canvas filled with the background color is created.
2. **Controlled Expansion:**  We iterate through each object and use nested loops to shift it one unit in all directions except diagonally, achieving the desired expansion pattern.

These five versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL. Each version utilizes different functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL and providing diverse solutions.
