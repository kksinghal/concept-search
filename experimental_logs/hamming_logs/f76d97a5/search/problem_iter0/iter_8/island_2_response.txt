## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the least common color in the grid, "framing" objects of that color with the most common color. 

**Input_0:**

- The least common color is 4.
- A single object of 4s exists.
- The most common color is 5, used to "frame" the object:

 ```
 0 4 0
 4 4 4
 0 4 0
 ```

**Input_1:**

- The least common color is 6.
- Several objects of 6s exist.
- The most common color is 5, used to frame each object individually.

 ```
 6 6 0 0 0
 0 6 6 0 0
 0 0 6 6 0
 0 0 0 6 6
 6 0 0 0 6
 ```

**Input_2:**

-  The least common color is 9.
- Several objects of 9s exist.
- The most common color is 5, used to frame each object.

 ```
 0 9 0 0 0
 0 0 9 9 0
 0 9 0 0 0
 0 0 9 0 0
 0 0 0 9 9
 ```


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" along with explanations:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
    mc = mostcolor(I) 
    lc = leastcolor(I)
    objs = objects(I, False, False, False)
    filtered_objs = colorfilter(objs, lc)
    framed_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(lc, box(toindices(obj))), filtered_objs)
    O = paint(fill(canvas(mc, shape(I)), mc, asindices(I)), merge(framed_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Key Colors:**  Find the most common color (`mc`) and least common color (`lc`) in the input grid (`I`).
2. **Isolate Target Objects:** Extract all objects from the grid (`objs`) and filter them to only include objects with the least common color (`filtered_objs`).
3. **Frame the Objects:**  For each object in `filtered_objs`, create a frame by applying the `box` function to get the object's outline indices. Then recolor the outline indices with the least common color (`lc`) creating `framed_objs`. 
4. **Construct Output:** Create a canvas filled with the most common color (`mc`), then paint the merged `framed_objs` onto it.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
    mc = mostcolor(I)
    lc = leastcolor(I)
    objs = partition(I) 
    filtered_objs = colorfilter(objs, lc)
    framed_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(lc, delta(toindices(obj))), filtered_objs)
    O = paint(fill(canvas(mc, shape(I)), mc, asindices(I)), merge(framed_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Key Colors:** Find the most common color (`mc`) and least common color (`lc`).
2. **Partition by Color:**  Divide the grid into objects based on color using `partition`.
3. **Isolate and Frame:** Filter objects to keep only those with the least common color. Then, for each, get the `delta` (indices in bounding box but not in the object) and recolor those with `lc`.
4. **Combine on Canvas:**  Create a canvas of `mc` and paint the merged `framed_objs` onto it.


### Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
    mc = mostcolor(I)
    lc = leastcolor(I)
    objs = objects(I, False, False, False)
    filtered_objs = colorfilter(objs, lc)
    framed_objs = apply(lambda obj: toobject(outbox(toindices(obj)), fill(canvas(lc, shape(I)), lc, box(toindices(obj)))), filtered_objs) 
    O = paint(fill(canvas(mc, shape(I)), mc, asindices(I)), merge(framed_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Key Colors and Objects:** Same as in previous versions.
2. **Framing Logic:** For each object:
    - Create a temporary canvas filled with `lc`.
    - Draw the object's `box` (outline) on this canvas.
    - Extract the `outbox` indices from this temporary canvas, which now represent the frame.
    - Convert the `outbox` indices to an object using `toobject`, inheriting color values from the temporary canvas.
3. **Final Output:** Similar to previous versions, paint the merged `framed_objs` onto a canvas of `mc`.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
    mc = mostcolor(I)
    lc = leastcolor(I)
    objs = objects(I, False, False, False)
    filtered_objs = colorfilter(objs, lc) 
    inner_boxes = apply(lambda obj: inbox(toindices(obj)), filtered_objs)
    O = fill(canvas(mc, shape(I)), lc, merge(apply(box, inner_boxes)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Key Colors and Objects:**  Similar to previous versions.
2. **Calculate Inner Boxes:** Find the `inbox` (inner outline) for each filtered object.
3. **Direct Framing:** Create a canvas filled with `mc`. Directly fill the  `box`  (outline) of each `inner_box` with `lc`, effectively creating the frame.

### Program Version 5:
**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
    mc = mostcolor(I)
    lc = leastcolor(I)
    return paint(canvas(mc, shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(lc, box(toindices(obj))), colorfilter(objects(I, False, False, False), lc))))
```

**Explanation:**
This version condenses the steps for a more compact solution.

1. **One-liner Logic:** It combines color filtering, frame generation, and canvas painting into a single line of code. 
2. **Efficiency:** It efficiently utilizes the `apply` function and nested lambdas to achieve the transformation with fewer intermediate variables.


## Conclusion

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation in the given DSL. They showcase the flexibility and expressive power of the provided functions, allowing for multiple valid solutions with varying levels of complexity and abstraction.
