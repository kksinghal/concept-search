## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify and modify boundary cells within objects formed by connected identical digits. The modification involves replacing boundary cell values with '0' while retaining the original value for interior cells. Here's a breakdown for each example:

**Input 0:**

- **Input:** A single object formed by the digit '5' with surrounding '4's.
- **Output:** The '4's bordering the '5' object are replaced by '0's, while the internal '5's remain unchanged.

**Input 1:**
- **Input:** Two intertwined objects, one of '5's and another of '6's.
- **Output:** '0's replace the digits bordering the interface between the two objects.  Internal digits of each object stay the same.

**Input 2:**
- **Input:** Similar to Input 1, but with '9's and '5's forming the objects.
- **Output:**  Again, '0's mark the boundary between the two objects, leaving interior digits untouched.


## Program to Be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the code implementing the transformation:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Identifies and modifies boundary cells using set operations.

  - Employs set difference to efficiently pinpoint boundary cells.
  - Utilizes list comprehension for concise grid traversal. 
  """
  O = [[0 if any(index(I, n) != I[i][j] and n in asindices(I) for n in dneighbors((i, j))) 
        else I[i][j] for j in range(len(I[0]))] 
       for i in range(len(I))]
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** The code uses nested list comprehension to visit each cell (i, j) in the input grid 'I.'
2. **Check for different neighbors:** For every cell, it examines its directly adjacent neighbors using `dneighbors`. If a neighbor has a different value and is within the grid boundaries (`n in asindices(I)`), the cell is considered a boundary cell.
3. **Conditional replacement:** If a cell is identified as a boundary, it's replaced with '0'; otherwise, its original value is retained. 
4. **Output generation:** The modified grid is returned as a tuple of tuples.


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Utilizes object-based processing for boundary cell identification.
  
  - Leverages `objects` function to separate objects in the grid.
  - Applies set operations for efficient boundary detection.
  """
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False) 
  boundary_cells = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for c, (i, j) in obj:
      if any(index(I, n) != c for n in dneighbors((i, j)) if n in asindices(I)):
        boundary_cells.add((i, j))
  O = fill(I, 0, frozenset(boundary_cells))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object identification:** The `objects` function isolates connected areas of identical digits within the grid.
2. **Iterate through objects and cells:** The code iterates through each object and its constituent cells.
3. **Neighbor value comparison:** For each cell, it checks if any of its directly adjacent neighbors have a different value. If a different value is found, the cell is marked as a boundary cell.
4. **Boundary filling:** Finally, the `fill` function replaces the values at the identified boundary cell indices with '0'.


### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Identifies boundary cells by comparing values with shifted grids.
  
  - Uses grid shifting and cell-wise comparison for boundary detection.
  """
  shifted_grids = [shift(asobject(I), d) for d in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]]
  boundary_cells = set()
  for shifted_grid in shifted_grids:
    for v, (i, j) in shifted_grid:
      if (i, j) in asindices(I) and index(I, (i, j)) != v:
        boundary_cells.add((i, j))
  O = fill(I, 0, frozenset(boundary_cells))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Generate shifted grids:** The input grid is converted to an object (`asobject`) and shifted in four directions (up, down, left, right) to create four new objects.
2. **Compare values with original grid:** Each shifted grid's cells are compared with the corresponding cell in the original grid. 
3. **Mark boundary cells:** If a difference in value is found between the shifted grid and the original grid, the cell in the original grid is marked as a boundary cell.
4. **Fill boundaries:**  The `fill` function is used to replace the values at the boundary cell indices with '0'.


### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Leverages direct neighbor comparison for boundary cell detection.
  
  - Employs nested loops for cell-by-cell traversal.
  - Simplifies boundary checks by using direct neighbor access. 
  """
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = [[0] * w for _ in range(h)]
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if (i > 0 and I[i - 1][j] != I[i][j]) or \
         (i < h - 1 and I[i + 1][j] != I[i][j]) or \
         (j > 0 and I[i][j - 1] != I[i][j]) or \
         (j < w - 1 and I[i][j + 1] != I[i][j]):
        O[i][j] = 0 
      else:
        O[i][j] = I[i][j]
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:**  The code uses nested loops to visit every cell in the grid.
2. **Direct neighbor comparison:** For each cell, it directly compares its value with its up, down, left, and right neighbors. 
3. **Boundary identification:** If any neighbor has a different value, the cell is considered a boundary cell.
4. **Output grid modification:** Boundary cells are assigned a value of '0' in the output grid, while interior cells retain their original values.


### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Employs `papply` for efficient boundary cell identification.

  - Utilizes `papply` for parallel comparison of grid indices and values.
  """
  indices = asindices(I)
  check_boundary = lambda i, j: any(n != index(I, (i, j)) and n in asindices(I) for n in dneighbors((i, j)))
  boundary_indices =  frozenset((i, j) for i, j in indices if check_boundary(i, j))
  O = fill(I, 0, boundary_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define a boundary check function:** `check_boundary` determines if a given cell is a boundary cell by comparing its value with its directly adjacent neighbors within the grid bounds.
2. **Apply boundary check to indices:**  The `papply` function applies the `check_boundary` function to all cell indices in the grid.
3. **Identify boundary indices:** The code filters the results to collect indices where the `check_boundary` function returns True, indicating a boundary cell.
4. **Fill boundary cells:**  The `fill` function sets the values at the identified boundary indices to '0'. 

These five versions provide diverse solutions to the problem, leveraging various functions from the provided DSL to efficiently identify and modify boundary cells within objects formed by connected digits in the input grids.
