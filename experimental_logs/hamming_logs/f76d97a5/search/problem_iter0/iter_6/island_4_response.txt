## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the boundary cells of each distinct object in the grid and setting their values to 0. An object boundary cell is defined as a cell that shares at least one edge with a cell of a different color. 

**Input 0:**
* The input has a single object (value 5) with a boundary formed by cells with value 4.
* The transformation sets the boundary cells (value 4) to 0.

**Input 1 & 2:**
* These inputs showcase the transformation on grids with multiple objects.
* The boundary cells of each object, regardless of their initial value, are identified and set to 0.

## Code Generation:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify all foreground objects
  x2 = mapply(lambda obj: toindices(obj) - sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda i: all(n in toindices(obj) for n in dneighbors(i))), x1) 
  # Find cells on the boundary of each object by subtracting the indices of inner cells from all cell indices.
  O = fill(I, 0, merge(x2))  # Fill boundary cells with 0
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all foreground objects in the grid.
2. **Find boundary cells:** For each object, the code identifies boundary cells as those with at least one direct neighbor outside the object. It achieves this by:
    * `toindices(obj)`: Getting the indices of all cells in the object.
    * `sfilter(...)`: Filtering the indices, keeping those where all direct neighbors belong to the same object.
    * Subtracting the filtered indices from the original indices, resulting in boundary cell indices.
3. **Fill boundary cells:** `fill(I, 0, merge(x2))` fills the identified boundary cells with 0.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = partition(I) # Partition the grid into objects
  x2 = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(obj, lambda c: any(index(I, add(n, c[1])) != c[0] for n in dneighbors(ORIGIN) if 0 <= add(n, c[1])[0] < len(I) and 0 <= add(n, c[1])[1] < len(I[0]))), x1)
  # Filter object cells, keeping boundary cells
  O = paint(cover(I, mostcolor(I)), merge(x2)) # Paint boundary cells onto a cleared grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Partition grid:** `partition(I)` partitions the grid into objects based on color.
2. **Filter for boundary cells:** For each object, it filters cells, keeping only those with a different-colored valid neighbor:
    * `sfilter(...)`: Iterates through object cells.
    * `lambda c: ...`:  Checks if any direct neighbor within grid boundaries has a different color.
3. **Paint boundary cells:** 
    * `cover(I, mostcolor(I))`: Creates a blank canvas by filling the input grid with the most common color.
    * `paint(..., merge(x2))`:  Paints the extracted boundary cells onto the blank canvas. 

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T) # Identify foreground objects
  x2 = mapply(lambda obj: toindices(obj), x1) # Get indices for each object
  x3 = mapply(lambda indices: sfilter(indices, lambda i: any(n not in indices for n in dneighbors(i))), x2) 
  # Filter for boundary indices
  O = fill(I, 0, merge(x3)) # Fill boundary cells with 0
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify objects & get indices:**  Similar to previous versions, this code identifies objects and extracts their indices.
2. **Filter for boundary indices:** For each object:
   *  `sfilter(...)`: Filters the indices.
   *  `lambda i: ...`: Keeps indices where at least one direct neighbor is not part of the object, indicating a boundary.
3. **Fill boundary cells:** Fills the cells at the identified boundary indices with 0.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = cellwise(I, paint(cover(I, mostcolor(I)), merge(mapply(lambda obj: toobject(sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda i: any(index(I, n) != index(I, i) for n in dneighbors(i) if 0 <= n[0] < len(I) and 0 <= n[1] < len(I[0]))), I), objects(I, T, F, T)))), 0)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
This version condenses the logic into a single line using nested function calls:

1. **Identify Objects and Boundaries:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies foreground objects. For each object:
    * `toindices(obj)` retrieves cell indices.
    * `sfilter(...)` filters for boundary cells - those with differently colored neighbors within grid boundaries.
    * `toobject(...)` converts boundary indices back to object representation.
2. **Paint Boundaries on a Cleared Grid:** 
    * `cover(I, mostcolor(I))`: Creates a blank canvas.
    * `paint(..., ...)`:  Paints merged boundary objects onto the canvas. 
3. **Combine with Original Grid:** `cellwise(I, ..., 0)` combines the original grid with the painted boundaries, using 0 as the fallback value where they differ.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  x2 = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda i: len(sfilter(dneighbors(i), lambda n: 0 <= n[0] < len(I) and 0 <= n[1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, n) != index(I, i))) > 0), x1)
  # Find boundary cells by checking if they have at least one differently colored valid neighbor
  O = fill(I, 0, merge(x2))
  return O
```
**Explanation:**

1. **Object and Boundary Detection:** Identifies foreground objects and then, for each object:
    *  Extracts cell indices.
    *  Filters for boundary cells by checking if they have at least one differently colored valid neighbor within the grid.
2. **Boundary Filling:**  Fills the detected boundary cells with the value 0. 

## Conclusion:

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation. By leveraging various DSL functions and strategies for object identification, boundary detection, and grid manipulation, each version provides a unique solution to the problem.
