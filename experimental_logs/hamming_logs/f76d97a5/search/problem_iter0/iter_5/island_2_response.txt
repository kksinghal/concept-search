## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the central object (the object with the least common color) in the input grid and then "framing" it within a canvas of the most common color. The framing leaves a one-cell border of the most common color around the central object.


## Program Version 1: 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  mc = mostcolor(I) 
  lc = leastcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  central_obj = extract(objs, matcher(color, lc))
  shifted_obj = shift(central_obj, (1,1))
  canvas_dims = (height(I) + 2, width(I) + 2)
  O = paint(fill(canvas(mc, canvas_dims), lc, toindices(shifted_obj)), {(lc, (0, 0))}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify key colors:** Find the most common color (`mc`) and the least common color (`lc`) in the input grid (`I`).
2. **Isolate the central object:** Extract the object with the least common color (`central_obj`).
3. **Shift the central object:** Shift the `central_obj` one unit down and one unit right (`shifted_obj`).
4. **Create a canvas:** Create a canvas (`canvas_dims`) with dimensions two units larger than the input grid, filled with the most common color (`mc`).
5. **Paint the shifted object:** Paint the `shifted_obj` onto the canvas using its original color (`lc`).
6. **Fill the top-left corner:** Paint the top-left corner of the canvas with the least common color (`lc`) to maintain the color presence.


## Program Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  mc = mostcolor(I)
  lc = leastcolor(I)
  O = paint(fill(canvas(mc, add(shape(I), (2,2))), lc, backdrop(shift(ofcolor(I, lc), (1,1)))), {(lc, (0, 0))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify key colors:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Create the frame:** Directly create a canvas filled with `mc`, two units larger in each dimension than the input.
3. **Find and shift relevant indices:** Identify indices of cells with `lc`, shift them, and calculate their bounding box.
4. **Paint the shifted area:** Fill the calculated bounding box on the canvas with `lc`.
5. **Fill the top-left corner:**  Similar to version 1.


## Program Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  mc = mostcolor(I)
  lc = leastcolor(I)
  shifted_grid = cellwise(I, shift(fill(I, lc, asindices(I)), (1, 1)), mc) 
  O = paint(fill(canvas(mc, (height(I) + 2, width(I) + 2)), lc, asindices(shifted_grid)), {(lc, (0, 0))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify key colors:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Shift the grid:** Shift a copy of the input grid one unit down and right, filling the vacated cells with `mc`.
3. **Create and fill the canvas:** Create a canvas like in previous versions.
4. **Paint based on the shifted grid:** Use the `shifted_grid` as a guide to paint cells on the canvas with `lc` where the color matches the original input grid.
5. **Fill the top-left corner:**  Similar to previous versions.


## Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  mc = mostcolor(I)
  lc = leastcolor(I)
  obj_indices = toindices(extract(objects(I, T, F, T), matcher(color, lc)))
  framed_indices =  backdrop(shift(obj_indices, (1,1)))
  O = paint(fill(canvas(mc, add(shape(I), (2, 2))), lc, framed_indices), {(lc, (0, 0))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify key colors:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Get indices of the central object:** Directly obtain the indices of the central object.
3. **Calculate the frame's indices:** Shift the object indices, then compute the bounding box of the shifted indices.
4. **Create and paint the canvas:** Similar to previous versions, filling the `framed_indices` with `lc`.
5. **Fill the top-left corner:** Similar to previous versions.


## Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  mc = mostcolor(I)
  lc = leastcolor(I)
  frame = lambda p: backdrop(shift(p, (1,1)))
  framed_obj =  frame(toindices(extract(objects(I, T, F, T), matcher(color, lc))))
  O =  paint(fill(canvas(mc, add(shape(I), (2, 2))), lc, framed_obj), {(lc, (0, 0))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify key colors:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Define a framing function:** Define a lambda function `frame` to encapsulate shifting and bounding box calculation.
3. **Apply framing to the central object:** Find the central object, convert it to indices, and apply the `frame` function.
4. **Create and paint the canvas:** Similar to previous versions, using the output of the `frame` function.
5. **Fill the top-left corner:** Similar to previous versions.
