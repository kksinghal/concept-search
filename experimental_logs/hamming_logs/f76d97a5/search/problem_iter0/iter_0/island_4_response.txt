## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a grid of digits and essentially "outlines" the objects within it, replacing the inner cells with a '0'. An object is defined as a group of connected cells with the same digit. Connectivity seems to be defined only horizontally and vertically, not diagonally.

**Example:**

Input: 
```
4 5 4
5 5 5
4 5 4
```

Output:
```
0 4 0
4 4 4
0 4 0
```

Here, the '4's form a single object, and the transformation outlines this object. The inner '5' is replaced with a '0'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects, no diagonals, without background
  x2 = apply(box, x1)       # Get the bounding box indices for each object
  x3 = merge(x2)             # Merge all bounding box indices
  x4 = toobject(x3, I)       # Create an object from the bounding box indices and grid values
  x5 = cover(I, x4)         # Cover the original grid with background color at bounding box locations
  O = paint(x5, x4)         # Paint the bounding box object onto the covered grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** Identify all distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Get bounding boxes:** Calculate the bounding box indices for each object.
3. **Merge indices:** Combine all bounding box indices into a single set.
4. **Create bounding box object:** Form a new object representing the merged bounding boxes.
5. **Cover with background:** Replace the original object cells with the background color.
6. **Paint bounding box:**  Draw the bounding box object onto the modified grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T) 
  x2 = apply(delta, x1)    # Get indices inside the bounding box but not part of the object 
  x3 = merge(x2)            
  O = fill(I, 0, x3)        # Directly fill the delta indices with '0'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** Identify distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Get inner indices:** Calculate the indices inside each object's bounding box but not part of the object itself.
3. **Merge indices:** Combine all inner indices into a single set.
4. **Fill with '0':** Directly replace the cells at the merged indices with '0'.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = partition(I)        # Partition the grid based on cell values
  x2 = apply(inbox, x1)     # Get the inbox indices for each object
  x3 = merge(x2)          
  x4 = toobject(x3, I)      
  x5 = cover(I, x4)        
  O = paint(x5, x4)        
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is very similar to Version 1, but it uses 'inbox' instead of 'box' to identify the cells to keep. The 'inbox' function excludes the outermost layer of the object, effectively creating the outline.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  x2 = apply(lambda p: toindices(p) - corners(p), x1) # Remove corner indices from each object
  x3 = merge(x2)
  O = fill(I, 0, x3)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** Identify distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Remove corners:**  For each object, remove its corner indices.
3. **Merge indices:** Combine all remaining indices into a single set.
4. **Fill with '0':** Fill the cells at the merged indices with '0'.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
    x2 = apply(toindices, x1) # Get indices of all objects
    x3 = apply(dneighbors, x2) # Get direct neighbors of all object indices
    x4 = merge(x3)
    x5 = intersection(x4, asindices(I)) # Intersect with valid grid indices to handle edges
    x6 = difference(x5, merge(x2)) # Remove original object indices, leaving the outline
    O = fill(I, 0, x6)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** Identify distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Get object indices:** Extract the indices of all cells belonging to objects.
3. **Get neighbor indices:**  Find the direct neighbors of all object indices.
4. **Merge neighbor indices:**  Combine all neighbor indices into a single set.
5. **Intersect with grid indices:** Keep only neighbor indices that fall within the grid boundaries.
6. **Remove object indices:** Subtract the original object indices, leaving only the outline indices.
7. **Fill with '0':** Replace the cells at the outline indices with '0'.


These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL. They showcase the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL in solving spatial reasoning tasks.
