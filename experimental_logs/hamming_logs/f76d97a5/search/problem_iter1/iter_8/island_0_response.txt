## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently applies the following logic:

1. **Identify the dominant color (background).**
2. **Identify the secondary color (object).**
3. **Create a new grid filled with the dominant color.**
4. **Overlay the object onto the new grid, leaving the dominant color untouched.**

This effectively extracts the object from the input grid and places it on a canvas of the background color.


## Program Version 1

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    obj_color = leastcolor(I)
    O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
    obj = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), obj_color)
    O = paint(O, merge(obj))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `bg = mostcolor(I)`: Identifies the dominant color in the input grid.
2. `obj_color = leastcolor(I)`: Identifies the secondary color (object).
3. `O = canvas(bg, shape(I))`: Creates a new grid (`O`) of the same dimensions as the input, filled with the dominant color (`bg`).
4. `obj = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), obj_color)`: Extracts the object from the input grid by:
    - Identifying all objects (`objects(I, T, F, F)`).
    - Filtering for the object with the secondary color (`colorfilter`).
5. `O = paint(O, merge(obj))`:  Paints the extracted object onto the new canvas (`O`).


## Program Version 2

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    obj = asobject(replace(I, bg, 0))
    O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
    O = underpaint(O, obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `bg = mostcolor(I)`: Determines the dominant (background) color.
2. `obj = asobject(replace(I, bg, 0))`: Extracts the object by:
    - Replacing the background color with 0 (`replace`).
    - Converting the resulting grid into an object representation (`asobject`).
3. `O = canvas(bg, shape(I))`: Creates a new grid filled with the background color.
4. `O = underpaint(O, obj)`: Overlays the object onto the new grid, only painting over cells with the background color.


## Program Version 3

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if value != bg:
                O = paint(O, {(value, (i, j))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `bg = mostcolor(I)`: Identifies the dominant color.
2. `O = canvas(bg, shape(I))`: Creates a new grid filled with the dominant color.
3. Iterates through each cell of the input grid:
    - If the cell color is not the background color, it's considered part of the object and painted onto the new grid.


## Program Version 4

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    obj_indices = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, bg))
    O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
    O = paint(O, recolor(leastcolor(I), obj_indices))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `bg = mostcolor(I)`: Identifies the dominant color.
2. `obj_indices = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, bg))`:  Finds the indices of the object by:
    - Getting all indices of the grid (`asindices`).
    - Getting indices of background color cells (`ofcolor`).
    - Taking the difference to find non-background indices (object indices).
3. `O = canvas(bg, shape(I))`: Creates a new grid filled with the dominant color.
4. `O = paint(O, recolor(leastcolor(I), obj_indices))`: Paints the object onto the new grid by:
    - Recoloring the object indices with the secondary color (`recolor`).
    - Painting the resulting object onto the canvas.


## Program Version 5

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
    for obj in objs:
        O = paint(O, obj)
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. `bg = mostcolor(I)`: Finds the dominant color.
2. `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`: Extracts all objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
3. `O = canvas(bg, shape(I))`: Creates a new grid filled with the background color.
4. Iterates through each extracted object (`objs`) and paints it onto the new canvas (`O`).
