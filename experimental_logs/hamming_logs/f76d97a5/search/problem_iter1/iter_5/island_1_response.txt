## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently identifies the dominant color in the input grid and reshapes it into a specific "hollow plus" pattern centered around the dominant color's center of mass. All other cells are filled with zeros.

**Input 0:**

* Dominant color: 4
* Center of Mass: (1, 1)
* Transformation: The central 3x3 area is filled with 4s, forming a "hollow plus" shape, while the remaining cells become 0.

**Input 1:**

* Dominant color: 6
* Center of Mass: (2, 2)
* Transformation: The central 5x5 area forms a "hollow plus" with 6s.  

**Input 2:**

* Dominant color: 9
* Center of Mass: (2, 2) 
* Transformation:  Similar to Input 1, a "hollow plus" of 9s is centered in the grid.

## Program to be Generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the most common color
  x1 = mostcommon(I)
  # Get indices of the dominant color
  x2 = ofcolor(I, x1)
  # Calculate the center of mass of the dominant color area
  x3 = centerofmass(x2)
  # Create a canvas of zeros with the same shape as the input
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) 
  # Fill the "hollow plus" shape with the dominant color
  O = fill(O, x1, {(x3[0]-1, x3[1]), (x3[0]+1, x3[1]), (x3[0], x3[1]-1), (x3[0], x3[1]+1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Dominant Color (x1):** `mostcommon(I)` finds the most frequent color in the grid.
2. **Locate Dominant Color Cells (x2):** `ofcolor(I, x1)` returns the indices of all cells containing the dominant color.
3. **Calculate Center of Mass (x3):** `centerofmass(x2)` determines the average row and column indices of the dominant color cells.
4. **Create Empty Canvas (O):**  `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))` generates a grid of zeros with the same dimensions as the input.
5. **Fill "Hollow Plus" (O):**  `fill(O, x1, ...)` inserts the dominant color (x1) at the four locations surrounding the center of mass, effectively drawing the "hollow plus".

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Extract objects from the input grid, considering only directly connected cells
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  # Find the most common color in the input grid
  dom_color = mostcommon(I)
  # Define a function to check if an object is a horizontal or vertical line of length 3 with the dominant color
  def is_line(obj):
    return color(obj) == dom_color and size(obj) == 3 and (hline(obj) or vline(obj)) 
  # Find the line object
  line_obj = extract(objs, is_line)
  # If a line object is found
  if line_obj:
    # Find the center of mass of the line object
    center_i, center_j = centerofmass(line_obj)
    # Create a canvas of zeros with the same shape as the input
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    # Fill the "hollow plus" shape with the dominant color
    O = fill(O, dom_color, {(center_i-1, center_j), (center_i+1, center_j), (center_i, center_j-1), (center_i, center_j+1)})
  else:
    # If no line object is found, return the original input grid
    O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, False)` extracts connected components (objects) from the grid. `True` signifies that an object consists of cells with the same color, `False` indicates that diagonal connections are not considered, and the last `False` means that the background color is not excluded.
2. **Define Line Criteria (`is_line`):** This helper function checks if an object:
    * Has the dominant color (`color(obj) == dom_color`)
    * Contains three cells (`size(obj) == 3`)
    * Forms a horizontal or vertical line (`hline(obj) or vline(obj)`)
3. **Extract Line Object:** `extract(objs, is_line)` finds the first object matching the `is_line` criteria.
4. **Process Line Object (if found):** 
   - **Center of Mass:** Similar to Version 1, the center of the line is calculated.
   - **Create Canvas:** An empty canvas is prepared.
   - **Fill "Hollow Plus":** The "hollow plus" is drawn around the line's center. 
5. **Handle Missing Line (else):** If no matching line is found, the original grid is returned.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the most common color in the input grid
  x1 = mostcommon(I)
  # Get the indices of all cells in the input grid
  x2 = asindices(I)
  # Find the center of mass of the most common color in the input grid
  x3 = centerofmass(ofcolor(I, x1))
  # Define the indices of the "hollow plus" shape
  plus_indices = {(x3[0]-1, x3[1]), (x3[0]+1, x3[1]), (x3[0], x3[1]-1), (x3[0], x3[1]+1)}
  # Create a new grid by filling the "hollow plus" indices with the most common color and the rest with zeros
  O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), x1, plus_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Dominant Color (x1):**  Finds the most frequent color.
2. **All Indices (x2):**  Gets the coordinates of all cells in the grid.
3. **Center of Mass (x3):**  Calculates the center of mass for the dominant color.
4. **"Hollow Plus" Indices:** Directly defines the four cells that make up the "hollow plus" relative to the center of mass.
5. **Create and Fill:** Generates a zero-filled canvas and inserts the dominant color only at the "hollow plus" locations.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the most common color
  dom_color = mostcommon(I)
  # Get the shape (height and width) of the input grid
  h, w = shape(I)
  # Calculate the center indices of the grid
  center_i, center_j = h // 2, w // 2
  # Create a new grid filled with zeros, having the same shape as the input grid
  output = canvas(0, (h, w))
  # Iterate through each cell of the grid
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      # Check if the current cell is part of the "hollow plus" shape
      if (i == center_i and abs(j - center_j) == 1) or (j == center_j and abs(i - center_i) == 1):
        # If the cell is part of the "hollow plus", fill it with the dominant color
        output = fill(output, dom_color, {(i, j)})
  # Return the modified grid
  return output

```
**Explanation:**

1. **Dominant Color:**  Identifies the most frequent color.
2. **Grid Dimensions:** Determines the height and width of the input grid.
3. **Grid Center:** Calculates the center indices.
4. **Zero-Filled Canvas:** Creates an empty grid.
5. **Iterate and Fill:** Loops through every cell, checking if its coordinates match the "hollow plus" pattern relative to the center. If a match is found, the cell is filled with the dominant color.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the dominant color in the input grid
  c = mostcommon(I)
  # Create a new grid filled with zeros, having the same shape as the input grid
  g = canvas(0, shape(I))
  # Extract objects from the input grid, considering only directly connected cells
  o = objects(I, True, False, False)
  # Define a lambda function to check if an object is a square of size 4 and has the dominant color
  is_square = lambda x: color(x) == c and size(x) == 4 and square(x)
  # Extract the square object from the list of objects
  p = extract(o, is_square)
  # If a square object is found
  if p:
    # Calculate the center of mass of the square object
    center_i, center_j = centerofmass(p)
    # Fill the "hollow plus" shape within the new grid with the dominant color
    g = fill(g, c, {(center_i-1, center_j), (center_i+1, center_j), (center_i, center_j-1), (center_i, center_j+1)})
  # Return the modified grid
  return g
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Dominant Color:**  Identifies the most frequent color.
2. **Zero-Filled Canvas:**  Creates an empty grid of the same size.
3. **Object Extraction:** Extracts connected components (objects).
4. **Square Check (`is_square`):** This function identifies square objects of size 4 with the dominant color.
5. **Extract Square (p):**  Finds the first square object that matches.
6. **Process Square (if found):** If a square is found:
   - **Center of Mass:**  The center of the square is determined.
   - **"Hollow Plus" Filling:**  The "hollow plus" is drawn around the square's center.
7. **Return Grid:** Returns the modified grid.
