## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all input-output pairs follows a consistent pattern:

- **Identify the dominant color:** The most frequently occurring color in the input grid becomes the target color.
- **Form a "hollow plus" shape:**  Using the dominant color, create a "plus" shape centered around the dominant color's center of mass. The "plus" shape has empty cells in its center and arms.
- **Fill the rest with zeros:**  All remaining cells in the grid are filled with the digit '0'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" achieving the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the most common color
  x1 = mostcommon(I)
  # Get indices of the dominant color
  x2 = ofcolor(I, x1)
  # Calculate the center of mass of the dominant color area
  x3 = centerofmass(x2)
  # Define a function to check if a location is part of the "hollow plus" shape
  def is_hollow_plus_part(loc):
    i, j = loc
    ci, cj = x3
    return ((i == ci and abs(j - cj) == 1) or (j == cj and abs(i - ci) == 1)) and I[i][j] == x1
  # Get indices of all cells
  x4 = asindices(I)
  # Filter indices to keep only those forming the "hollow plus" shape
  x5 = sfilter(x4, is_hollow_plus_part)
  # Fill all cells outside the "hollow plus" shape with 0
  O = fill(I, ZERO, difference(x4, x5))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`x1 = mostcommon(I)`:**  Finds the most common color in the grid 'I'.
2. **`x2 = ofcolor(I, x1)`:**  Gets the indices of all cells containing the dominant color 'x1'.
3. **`x3 = centerofmass(x2)`:**  Calculates the center of mass for the dominant color's area.
4. **`is_hollow_plus_part(loc)`:**  This function checks if a given location 'loc' is part of the "hollow plus" shape. It ensures the location is one cell away from the center of mass (horizontally or vertically) and contains the dominant color.
5. **`x4 = asindices(I)`:**  Gets the indices of all cells in the grid.
6. **`x5 = sfilter(x4, is_hollow_plus_part)`:** Filters all cell indices, keeping only those belonging to the "hollow plus" shape.
7. **`O = fill(I, ZERO, difference(x4, x5))`:**  Fills all cells outside the "hollow plus" with '0' and returns the resulting grid 'O'.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the most common color
  x1 = mostcommon(I)
  # Get all objects
  x2 = objects(I, True, False, False)
  # Define a function to check for a "hollow plus" shape with the dominant color
  def is_hollow_plus(obj):
    c = centerofmass(obj)
    return color(obj) == x1 and len(obj) == 4 and {(c[0]-1, c[1]), (c[0]+1, c[1]), (c[0], c[1]-1), (c[0], c[1]+1)} == toindices(obj)
  # Extract the "hollow plus" object
  x3 = extract(x2, is_hollow_plus) if x2 else {}
  # Get indices of all cells
  x4 = asindices(I)
  # Get indices of the "hollow plus" object
  x5 = toindices(x3)
  # Fill all cells outside the "hollow plus" with 0
  O = fill(I, ZERO, difference(x4, x5))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Dominant Color and Objects:**  Similar to version 1, the code first identifies the most common color (`x1`) and all objects in the grid (`x2`). 
2. **Define 'is_hollow_plus' Function:**  This function checks if an object is a "hollow plus" formed by the dominant color. It verifies:
    - The object's color matches the dominant color.
    - The object has exactly four cells (arms of the plus).
    - The cell indices precisely match the expected positions relative to the object's center of mass.
3. **Extract the "Hollow Plus":** Using `extract`, the code finds the "hollow plus" object within the set of all objects.
4. **Fill Outside the "Hollow Plus":** The code obtains indices of all cells and the extracted "hollow plus". Finally, it fills cells outside the "hollow plus" with zeros, producing the output grid 'O'.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  c = mostcommon(I)
  g = canvas(0, shape(I))
  o = objects(I, True, False, False)
  p = extract(o, lambda x: color(x) == c and size(x) == 4 and square(x))
  if p:
    center_i, center_j = centerofmass(p)
    g = fill(g, c, {(center_i-1, center_j), (center_i+1, center_j), (center_i, center_j-1), (center_i, center_j+1)})
  return g
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Dominant Color and Blank Canvas:**  The code identifies the most common color (`c`) and creates a blank canvas (`g`) of the same size as the input.
2. **Extract the "Plus" Object:** It extracts objects from the input and finds the one representing a "plus" shape formed by the dominant color. The "plus" shape is identified by having four cells (`size(x) == 4`) and forming a square (`square(x)`), which in this context ensures the arms are only one cell long.
3. **Draw the "Hollow Plus":** If a "plus" object is found, the code calculates its center and fills the corresponding cells on the initially blank canvas `g` with the dominant color, effectively drawing the "hollow plus". 


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = mostcommon(I)
    x2 = asindices(I)
    x3 = centerofmass(ofcolor(I, x1))
    O = fill(I, 0, difference(x2, {(x3[0] - 1, x3[1]), (x3[0] + 1, x3[1]), (x3[0], x3[1] - 1), (x3[0], x3[1] + 1)}))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Dominant Color and Center:** It determines the most common color (`x1`) and calculates the center of mass (`x3`) of the dominant color cells.
2. **Directly Fill the "Hollow Plus":**  Instead of extracting objects or filtering indices, this version directly creates a set of indices representing the "hollow plus" shape based on the calculated center (`x3`). It then fills these specific cells on the input grid `I` with the dominant color.
3. **Fill the Rest with Zeros:**  Finally, it fills all other cells with zeros (`0`) using set difference, achieving the desired output `O`.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  dom_color = mostcommon(I)
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  center_i, center_j = h // 2, w // 2
  output = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if (i == center_i and abs(j - center_j) == 1) or (j == center_j and abs(i - center_i) == 1):
        output = fill(output, dom_color, {(i, j)})
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Dominant Color and Grid Dimensions:**  Similar to previous versions, it identifies the dominant color (`dom_color`).  It also determines the height (`h`) and width (`w`) of the input grid.
2. **Center and Blank Canvas:** It calculates the grid's center (`center_i`, `center_j`) and creates a blank canvas (`output`) of the same dimensions.
3. **Iterative "Hollow Plus" Drawing:** The code iterates through each cell of the canvas. If a cell's coordinates match the "hollow plus" pattern relative to the calculated center, it fills that cell on the `output` canvas with the dominant color.
