## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the outline of each distinct object within the input grid and then "pushing" these outlines one step outwards. The original object cells are then replaced with the background color (most common color), while the expanded outlines retain their original colors.

**Input 0:**

* **Original objects:** A single object formed by the digit '5'.
* **Transformation:** The outline of the '5' object is expanded outwards. The original '5' cells become '4' (background color), and the expanded outline remains '5'.

**Input 1 & 2:**

* **Original objects:** Multiple objects formed by digits different from the background color.
* **Transformation:** The outlines of all objects are expanded outwards. Original object cells are replaced with the background color, while the expanded outlines retain their original colors.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expanded_outlines = mpapply(lambda obj: delta(inflate(toindices(obj),1)), objs)
  O = fill(I, bg, expanded_outlines)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background and objects:** `bg = mostcolor(I)` and `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` find the background color and the distinct objects in the grid, respectively.
2. **Expand outlines:** For each object, `inflate(toindices(obj),1)` expands its indices by 1 in all directions. Then, `delta(...)` identifies the newly added outline cells. This is applied to all objects using `mpapply`.
3. **Fill outlines:** `fill(I, bg, expanded_outlines)` fills the expanded outline cells with the original object colors.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    outline = outbox(toindices(obj))
    O = fill(O, bg, toindices(obj))
    O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), outline))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background and objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Iterate and transform:** For each object:
    * `outline = outbox(toindices(obj))` calculates the outer box surrounding the object.
    * `O = fill(O, bg, toindices(obj))` fills the original object cells with the background color.
    * `O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), outline))` paints the calculated outline with the object's color.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (1, 0)), objs) | mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (-1, 0)), objs) | mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, 1)), objs) | mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, -1)), objs)
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), shifted_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background and objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Shift objects:**  Creates four shifted copies of each object (up, down, left, right) using `shift` and combines them using `mapply` and set union (`|`).
3. **Paint shifted objects:**  Creates a canvas filled with the background color and paints the shifted objects onto it.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if any(index(I, (i + di, j + dj)) != bg for di, dj in [(1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)]):
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background color:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Iterate and check neighbors:** For each cell in the grid, check if any neighbor has a different color than the background.
3. **Paint if condition met:** If a neighbor has a different color, paint the current cell with its original color on a new canvas initialized with the background color.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = underpaint(fill(O, bg, toindices(obj)), recolor(color(obj), outbox(toindices(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background color and objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Iterate and transform:** For each object in the grid:
   * `fill(O, bg, toindices(obj))` replaces the object with the background color.
   * `recolor(color(obj), outbox(toindices(obj)))` creates an outline of the object using `outbox` and fills it with the object's color.
   * `underpaint(...)` combines the two by painting the outline on the modified grid only where the background color is present. 


These five versions utilize different DSL functions and logic to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing diverse solutions within the given DSL.
