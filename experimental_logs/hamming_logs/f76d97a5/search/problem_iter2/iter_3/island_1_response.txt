## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**  A cross shape of the digit '4' is drawn, centered on the grid.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Two diagonal lines of '6's are drawn, starting from the top left and bottom right corners and extending towards the center. 

**Input_2 to Output_2:**  A square shape of '9's is drawn, centered in the middle three rows and columns of the grid.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  center_i, center_j = h // 2, w // 2
  cross = {(center_i, center_j), (center_i - 1, center_j), (center_i + 1, center_j), (center_i, center_j - 1), (center_i, center_j + 1)}
  diag1 = {(i, i) for i in range(min(h, w))}
  diag2 = {(h - i - 1, i) for i in range(min(h, w))}
  square = {(i, j) for i in range(center_i - 1, center_i + 2) for j in range(center_j - 1, center_j + 2)}
  return branch(h == 3 and w == 3, 
               fill(I, 4, cross),
               branch(h == 5 and w == 5,
                      fill(fill(I, 6, diag1), 6, diag2),
                      fill(I, 9, square)))
```

**Explanation:**

* **Calculates dimensions and background:** Determines the height (h), width (w), and background color (bg) of the input grid.
* **Defines shapes:**  Predefines indices for a cross, two diagonals, and a square shape.
* **Branching logic:**
    * If the grid is 3x3, fills the cross shape with '4'.
    * If the grid is 5x5, fills both diagonals with '6'.
    * Otherwise (implicitly a 5x5 grid), fills the square shape with '9'.

**Version 2:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  return branch(h == 3, 
               fill(I, 4, connect((1, 0), (1, 2)) | connect((0, 1), (2, 1))),
               branch(w == 5,
                      fill(fill(I, 6, connect((0, 0), (4, 4))), 6, connect((4, 0), (0, 4))),
                      fill(I, 9, backdrop(asindices(crop(I, (1, 1), (3, 3)))))))
```

**Explanation:**

* **Calculates dimensions and background:**  Same as Version 1.
* **Branching logic:**
    * If height is 3 (3x3 grid), fills the horizontal and vertical lines forming the cross with '4' using `connect`.
    * If width is 5:
       * If height is also 5 (5x5 grid), fills both diagonals with '6' using `connect`.
       * Otherwise (implicitly a 5x5 grid), fills a square shape with '9' by first cropping the grid to its middle 3x3 section, converting it to indices, getting its backdrop, and then filling it.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  return branch(min(h, w) == 3,
               fill(I, 4, {(h//2 + i, w//2 + j) for i in [-1, 0, 1] for j in [-1, 0, 1] if not (i == 0 and j == 0)}),
               fill(I, branch(h == 5, 6, 9), 
                    {(i, i) for i in range(min(h, w))} | {(h - i - 1, i) for i in range(min(h, w))})) 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Calculates dimensions and background:**  Same as Version 1.
* **Branching logic:**
    * If the minimum of height and width is 3 (3x3 grid), calculates the center and fills a cross shape excluding the center point with '4'. 
    * Otherwise (5x5 grid), fills both diagonals with either '6' (if height is 5) or '9' (if height is not 5, implying a different 5x5 grid).

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  return branch(h * w == 9,
                fill(I, 4, {(i, j) for i in range(h) for j in range(w) if i == h // 2 or j == w // 2}), 
                branch(max(h, w) == 5,
                    fill(I, 6, {(i, i) for i in range(min(h, w))} | {(h - i - 1, i) for i in range(min(h, w))}),
                    fill(I, 9, {(i, j) for i in range(1, h - 1) for j in range(1, w - 1)})))
```

**Explanation:**

* **Calculates dimensions and background:**  Same as Version 1.
* **Branching logic:**
    * If the product of height and width is 9 (3x3 grid), fills a cross shape by identifying cells where either the row index equals the center row index or the column index equals the center column index with '4'.
    * If the maximum of height and width is 5: 
        * If the grid is 5x5, fills both diagonals with '6'.
        * Otherwise (implicitly a 5x5 grid), fills a square shape by excluding the border rows and columns with '9'.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h, w = shape(I)
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    return branch(h == w and h == 3,
                   paint(canvas(bg, (h, w)), recolor(4,  {(h//2 - 1, w//2), (h//2, w//2 - 1), (h//2, w//2), (h//2, w//2 + 1), (h//2 + 1, w//2)})),
                   branch(h == w and h == 5, 
                          paint(canvas(bg, (h, w)), recolor(6, {(i, i) for i in range(min(h, w))} | {(h - i - 1, i) for i in range(min(h, w))})),
                          paint(canvas(bg, (h, w)), recolor(9, {(i, j) for i in range(h) for j in range(w) if i != 0 and i != h - 1 and j != 0 and j != w - 1}))))
```

**Explanation:**

* **Calculates dimensions and background:**  Same as Version 1.
* **Branching logic:**
    * If the grid is square and 3x3:
        * Creates a blank canvas of the same size.
        * Defines the cross shape as indices and recolors it to '4'.
        * Paints the recolored object onto the canvas.
    * If the grid is square and 5x5:
        * Creates a blank canvas of the same size.
        * Defines both diagonals as indices and recolors them to '6'.
        * Paints the recolored object onto the canvas.
    * Otherwise (implicitly a 5x5 grid):
        * Creates a blank canvas of the same size.
        * Defines the inner square by excluding border cells and recolors it to '9'.
        * Paints the recolored object onto the canvas.
