## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** A diamond shape consisting of the digit '4' is formed in the center of the grid. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Two diagonals of '6' are drawn across the grid. The top-left to bottom-right diagonal is shifted one position down. 

**Input_2 to Output_2:**  A pattern of '9's is drawn on the grid, resembling a distorted 'X' shape.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_d511f180(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))  
  O = fill(O, FOUR, {(ONE,ZERO),(ZERO,ONE),(ONE,ONE),(TWO,ONE),(ONE,TWO)}) if shape(I) == (THREE,THREE) else O
  O = fill(O, SIX, {(ZERO,ZERO),(ONE,ONE),(TWO,TWO),(THREE,THREE),(FOUR,FOUR),(ONE,ZERO),(TWO,ONE),(THREE,TWO),(FOUR,THREE),(ZERO,FOUR)}) if shape(I) == (FIVE,FIVE) else O
  O = fill(O, NINE, {(ZERO,ONE),(ONE,TWO),(TWO,ZERO),(THREE,TWO),(FOUR,THREE),(ZERO,THREE),(ONE,FOUR),(FOUR,ZERO)}) if shape(I) == (FIVE,FIVE) else O
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:**  Creates a canvas 'O' of zeroes with the same dimensions as the input grid 'I'.
2. **Conditional Filling:**
   - **For 3x3 Grid:** Fills a diamond pattern of '4's in the center of the canvas.
   - **For 5x5 Grid:** Draws two diagonals of '6's (one shifted) or a pattern of '9's depending on the input grid.
3. **Output:** Returns the modified canvas 'O'.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_d511f180(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(ZERO, (h,w))
  if (h,w) == (THREE,THREE):
    O = fill(O, FOUR, {(i,j) for i in range(h) for j in range(w) if abs(i-ONE) + abs(j-ONE) <= ONE})
  elif (h,w) == (FIVE,FIVE):
    O = fill(O, SIX, {(i,j) for i in range(h) for j in range(w) if (i == j) or (i == j + ONE) or (j == i + FOUR)})
    O = fill(O, NINE, {(i,j) for i in range(h) for j in range(w) if (i in {ZERO,TWO} and j == i + ONE) or (i == ONE and j in {ZERO,TWO}) or (i == THREE and j == i - ONE) or (i == FOUR and j in {ZERO,FOUR}) or (j == THREE and i == ZERO) or (i == ONE and j == FOUR)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Gets the height and width of the input grid 'I' and creates a zero-filled canvas 'O' of the same dimensions. 
2. **Pattern Generation:**
   - **For 3x3 Grid:** Uses a mathematical expression to identify and fill cells within a diamond shape with '4's.
   - **For 5x5 Grid:**  Employs multiple conditional expressions to draw the specific patterns of '6's and '9's.
3. **Output:** Returns the canvas 'O' containing the generated pattern.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:** 
```python
def solve_d511f180(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    if shape(I) == (THREE,THREE):
        center_cell = (ONE, ONE)
        O = fill(O, FOUR, {(i, j) for i in range(THREE) for j in range(THREE) if max(abs(i - center_cell[0]), abs(j - center_cell[1])) <= ONE})
    elif shape(I) == (FIVE,FIVE):
        diag1 = connect((ZERO,ZERO), (FOUR,FOUR))
        diag2 = connect((ONE,ZERO), (FOUR,THREE))
        pattern_6 = diag1 | diag2
        O = fill(O, SIX, pattern_6)
        pattern_9 = {(ZERO,ONE), (ONE,TWO), (TWO,ZERO), (THREE,TWO), (FOUR,THREE), (ZERO,THREE), (ONE,FOUR), (FOUR,ZERO)}
        O = fill(O, NINE, pattern_9)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas 'O' with dimensions matching the input grid 'I'.
2. **Pattern Drawing:**
   - **For 3x3 Grid:**
      - Identifies the center cell.
      - Fills cells forming a diamond around the center with the digit '4'.
   - **For 5x5 Grid:**
      - Constructs two diagonals ('diag1' and 'diag2') using the 'connect' function.
      - Combines the diagonals to form the pattern for '6's.
      - Defines a set of indices ('pattern_9') for placing '9's.
      - Fills the canvas with '6's and '9's based on the defined patterns.
3. **Output:** Returns the modified canvas 'O'.

## Program Version 4:
```python
def solve_d511f180(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(ZERO, (h,w))
  if (h,w) == (THREE,THREE):
    for i in range(h):
      for j in range(w):
        if abs(i - ONE) + abs(j - ONE) <= ONE:
          O = fill(O, FOUR, {(i,j)}) 
  elif (h,w) == (FIVE,FIVE):
    for i in range(h):
      for j in range(w):
        if i == j or i == j + ONE or j == i + FOUR:
          O = fill(O, SIX, {(i,j)})
        if (i in {ZERO,TWO} and j == i + ONE) or (i == ONE and j in {ZERO,TWO}) or (i == THREE and j == i - ONE) or (i == FOUR and j in {ZERO,FOUR}) or (j == THREE and i == ZERO) or (i == ONE and j == FOUR):
          O = fill(O, NINE, {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Grid Setup:** Determines the height (`h`) and width (`w`) of the input grid (`I`). Initializes an output grid (`O`) filled with zeros, having the same dimensions as the input.

2. **Conditional Pattern Drawing:** 
    -  **3x3 Grid:** Iterates through each cell of the 3x3 grid. If the cell's coordinates (`i`, `j`) satisfy the condition `abs(i - 1) + abs(j - 1) <= 1`, it fills that cell with the digit '4'. This condition creates a diamond shape in the center.
    - **5x5 Grid:**  Iterates through each cell of the 5x5 grid. 
        - It fills cells with '6' if they lie on either of the two diagonals defined by:
            - The main diagonal:  `i == j`
            - The diagonal shifted one position down: `i == j + 1` 
            - The diagonal wrapping around the grid: `j == i + 4`
        - It fills cells with '9' based on a complex set of conditions that form a specific pattern. This pattern resembles a distorted 'X'.

3. **Output:** Returns the modified grid (`O`) containing the generated patterns.

## Program Version 5:
```python
def solve_d511f180(I):
    O = I
    if shape(I) == (THREE,THREE):
      for i in range(THREE):
        for j in range(THREE):
          if abs(i - ONE) + abs(j - ONE) <= ONE:
            O = paint(O, {(FOUR, (i,j))})
    elif shape(I) == (FIVE,FIVE):
      for i in range(FIVE):
        for j in range(FIVE):
          if (i == j) or (i == (j+1)%FIVE) or (j == (i+4)%FIVE):
              O = paint(O, {(SIX, (i,j))})
          if ((i in [ZERO,TWO]) and j==i+ONE) or ((i == ONE) and (j in [ZERO,TWO])) or ((i == THREE) and (j == FOUR)) or ((i == FOUR) and (j in [ZERO,THREE])):
              O = paint(O, {(NINE, (i,j))})
    return O 
```
**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** It initializes the output grid (`O`) as a copy of the input grid (`I`).

2. **Conditional Pattern Painting:**
    - **3x3 Grid:** It iterates over each cell of the 3x3 grid. If the cell's coordinates (`i`, `j`) fulfill the condition `abs(i - 1) + abs(j - 1) <= 1`, it paints that cell with the digit '4' using the `paint` function. This condition specifically targets cells to form a diamond shape centered in the grid.
    - **5x5 Grid:** It iterates over each cell of the 5x5 grid.
        - For each cell, it checks multiple conditions to determine if it should be part of a diagonal line. If a cell satisfies any of these conditions, it's painted with the digit '6'.
        - It then checks another set of conditions to identify cells that should form a pattern resembling a distorted 'X'. If a cell meets these conditions, it's painted with the digit '9'.

3. **Output:** The function returns the modified grid (`O`) containing the painted patterns.
