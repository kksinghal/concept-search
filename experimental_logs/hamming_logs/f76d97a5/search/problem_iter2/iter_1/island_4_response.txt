## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (areas of the same color) and drawing a distinct color border around each object. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 

- The entire grid is considered a single object.
- A border of '4's is drawn around the perimeter of the grid.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- The grid represents a single object.
- A border of '6's is drawn around the perimeter of the grid.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

- The grid represents a single object.
- A border of '9's is drawn around the perimeter of the grid.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I) 
  new_color = len(I) + len(I[0]) # determine the new border color 
  bordered = paint(canvas(new_color, shape(I)), I) # paint the input onto a canvas of the new color
  return trim(bordered) # trim the outer border to reveal the original shape with a new border
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background:**  Determine the background color using `mostcolor(I)`. This isn't strictly necessary for these examples as the background is always '0', but it's good practice.
2. **Determine Border Color:** Calculate a distinct border color. Here, we use the sum of the grid dimensions (`len(I) + len(I[0])`) to ensure a unique color.
3. **Create Bordered Grid:** Create a new grid filled with the border color using `canvas(new_color, shape(I))`. Then, paint the original grid onto this canvas using `paint`. This effectively draws the border.
4. **Trim Border:** Remove the outermost layer of the bordered grid using `trim(bordered)` to reveal the final output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  new_color = len(I) + len(I[0]) 
  return paint(canvas(new_color, add(shape(I), (2, 2))), shift(I, (1, 1)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Determine Border Color:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Create Larger Canvas:** Create a canvas filled with the border color, but make it two cells larger in width and height (`add(shape(I), (2, 2))`). 
3. **Shift and Paint:**  Shift the input grid one cell down and right using `shift(I, (1, 1))`. Paint this shifted grid onto the larger canvas. This places the input grid in the center of the border.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  new_color = len(I) + len(I[0])
  objs = partition(I) 
  bordered_objs = mapply(lambda obj: toobject(outbox(obj), canvas(new_color, shape(I))), objs) # create borders by converting the outbox indices to objects with the new color
  return paint(I, bordered_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Determine Border Color:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Identify Objects:** Use `partition(I)` to identify objects (areas of the same color) within the grid.
3. **Draw Borders:** For each object, find its `outbox` (indices surrounding the object) and convert these indices into a new object with the desired border color using `toobject(outbox(obj), canvas(new_color, shape(I)))`. Merge all bordered objects.
4. **Paint Borders:** Paint the bordered objects onto the original grid using `paint`.

**Program Version 4:** 

```python
def solve(I):
  new_color = len(I) + len(I[0])
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=False) 
  return paint(canvas(new_color, shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda obj: toindices(obj), objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Determine Border Color:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Identify Objects:** Use `objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=False)` to identify all objects in the grid, considering diagonals.
3. **Extract Indices:** Extract the indices of each object using `toindices(obj)`.
4. **Paint:**  Paint the extracted indices onto a new canvas filled with the border color. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  new_color = len(I) + len(I[0])
  return cellwise(I, canvas(new_color, shape(I)), new_color) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Determine Border Color:**  Same as previous versions.
2. **Cellwise Comparison:** Compare each cell of the input grid with a canvas filled with the border color using `cellwise`.  If the values match (which they won't), keep the input grid's value; otherwise, use the border color. This effectively fills the background with the border color and leaves the original grid content intact.
