## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The input grid is entirely filled with zeros. The output replaces the center cell and its four directly adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right) with the digit '4'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  The output fills the grid with a pattern where every cell with the sum of its row and column index being even is filled with '6'. Additionally, the main diagonal and the counter-diagonal are also filled with '6'.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The output creates a pattern resembling a diamond shape. The center column is filled with '9' at every row.  From the second row onwards,  '9' is also placed in positions diagonally up and down from the center column, shifting outwards by one cell with each increasing row.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  if h == 3:  # Input_0 transformation
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
    if objs: # Check if any objects exist
        obj = first(objs)
        center_cell = center(obj)
        neighbors = dneighbors(center_cell)
        indices_to_fill = combine(neighbors, {center_cell})
        O = fill(I, FOUR, indices_to_fill)
    else:
        O = I # Return the input if no objects found
  elif h == 5:  # Input_1 transformation
    O = canvas(ZERO, (h, w))
    for i in range(h):
      for j in range(w):
        if (i + j) % 2 == 0:
          O = fill(O, SIX, {(i, j)})
        if i == j or i + j == h - 1:
          O = fill(O, SIX, {(i, j)})
  else:  # Input_2 transformation
    O = canvas(ZERO, (h, w))
    for i in range(h):
      O = fill(O, NINE, {(i, w // 2)})
      if i > 0:
        O = fill(O, NINE, {(i, w // 2 - i)})
        O = fill(O, NINE, {(i, w // 2 + i)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version uses conditional statements (`if`/`elif`/`else`) to handle different input sizes, implying unique transformations for each.
* For Input_0, it identifies objects, finds their center, and fills the center and its neighbors with '4'. The 'if objs:' check handles cases when no objects are found in the input, returning the input itself in such cases.
* For Input_1, it constructs a canvas and applies a pattern-based filling using modulo operation and diagonal conditions.
* For Input_2, it constructs a canvas and iteratively fills it to create the diamond pattern.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h, w = shape(I)
    O = canvas(ZERO, (h, w))
    if h == 3:
        center_cell = (h // 2, w // 2)
        neighbors = dneighbors(center_cell)
        indices_to_fill = combine(neighbors, {center_cell})
        O = fill(O, FOUR, indices_to_fill)
    elif h == 5:
        for i in range(h):
            for j in range(w):
                if (i + j) % 2 == 0 or i == j or i + j == h - 1:
                    O = fill(O, SIX, {(i, j)})
    else:
        for i in range(h):
            O = fill(O, NINE, {(i, w // 2)})
            if i > 0:
                O = fill(O, NINE, {(i, max(0, w // 2 - i))})
                O = fill(O, NINE, {(i, min(w - 1, w // 2 + i))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version initializes an empty canvas and fills it based on input size.
* It simplifies Input_0 by directly calculating the center and its neighbors without object detection.
* It consolidates filling logic for Input_1 and handles edge cases in Input_2 for diagonal filling.
