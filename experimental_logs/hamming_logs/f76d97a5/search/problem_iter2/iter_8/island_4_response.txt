## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a grid of a single color and adds a different colored border around each object in the grid. The border color seems to be determined by the dimensions of the input grid, specifically twice the width plus two.

**Input 0:**

* A single object fills the 3x3 grid.
* The border color is 2 * 3 + 2 = 8, but since the maximum digit is 9, it wraps around to 4 (8 % 10).
* The output has a 4-colored border around the central object.

**Input 1:**

* A single object fills the 5x5 grid.
* The border color is 2 * 5 + 2 = 12, which wraps around to 6 (12 % 10).
* The output has a 6-colored border around the central object.

**Input 2:**

* Three 2x2 objects are present on a 5x5 grid.
* The border color is 2 * 5 + 2 = 12, which wraps around to 9 (12 % 10).
* The output has a 9-colored border around each of the three objects.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" function, each with a different approach to achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fill_value = (2 * width(I) + 2) % 10
  return paint(
    canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
    recolor(fill_value, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda idx: len(dneighbors(idx) - toindices(extract(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: idx in toindices(obj)))) > 0))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_value = (2 * width(I) + 2) % 10`**: Calculates the border color based on the input grid's width and ensures it stays within 0-9.
2. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`**: Creates a new grid with the same dimensions and background color as the input.
3. **`fgpartition(I)`**:  Identifies all objects within the input grid, excluding the background.
4. **`lambda idx: len(dneighbors(idx) - toindices(extract(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: idx in toindices(obj)))) > 0)`**: For each index, checks if it's on the border of an object by seeing if any of its direct neighbors are not part of the same object.
5. **`mfilter(asindices(I), ...)`**: Applies the border check to all indices in the grid and merges the results, effectively extracting all border indices.
6. **`recolor(fill_value, ...)`**:  Colors the extracted border indices with the calculated `fill_value`.
7. **`paint(..., ...)`**:  Paints the border object onto the canvas created earlier.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fill_value = (2 * width(I) + 2) % 10
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(fill_value, delta(toindices(obj))), objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_value = (2 * width(I) + 2) % 10`**: Calculates the border color.
2. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`**:  Identifies all objects in the grid.
3. **`lambda obj: recolor(fill_value, delta(toindices(obj)))`**: For each object, it recolors the delta (the surrounding cells) with the border color.
4. **`apply(..., objs)`**: Applies the recoloring to all objects.
5. **`merge(...)`**: Merges the recolored boundaries of all objects.
6. **`paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), ...)`**:  Paints the merged boundaries onto a blank canvas of the input's background color and dimensions.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fill_value = (2 * width(I) + 2) % 10
  return cellwise(
    I,
    paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(fill_value, box(toindices(obj))), fgpartition(I)))),
    fill_value
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_value = (2 * width(I) + 2) % 10`**:  Calculates the border color.
2. **`fgpartition(I)`**: Extracts all objects from the input grid.
3. **`lambda obj: recolor(fill_value, box(toindices(obj)))`**:  Creates a border around each object using the `box` function and colors it with `fill_value`.
4. **`apply(..., fgpartition(I))`**:  Applies the border creation to every object in the grid.
5. **`merge(...)`**: Combines all the borders into a single object.
6. **`paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), ...)`**: Paints the merged borders onto a blank canvas of the input's background color and dimensions.
7. **`cellwise(I, ..., fill_value)`**: Compares the input grid with the painted border grid. If a cell in the border grid has the border color, it keeps that color; otherwise, it uses the corresponding cell's color from the input grid.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fill_value = (2 * width(I) + 2) % 10
  return paint(
    canvas(fill_value, shape(I)),
    recolor(mostcolor(I),  mfilter(asindices(I), lambda idx: len(dneighbors(idx) & toindices(extract(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: idx in toindices(obj)))) == 4))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_value = (2 * width(I) + 2) % 10`**: Calculates the border color.
2. **`canvas(fill_value, shape(I))`**: Creates a canvas filled with the border color and having the same shape as the input.
3. **`fgpartition(I)`**: Extracts all objects from the input grid.
4. **`lambda idx: len(dneighbors(idx) & toindices(extract(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: idx in toindices(obj)))) == 4`**:  For each index, it checks if it belongs to the inner area of an object. It does so by verifying if all four direct neighbors are also part of the same object.
5. **`mfilter(asindices(I), ...)`**: Applies the inner area check to all indices and merges the results, creating a set of indices representing the inner areas of all objects.
6. **`recolor(mostcolor(I), ...)`**:  Colors the identified inner area indices with the background color of the input grid.
7. **`paint(..., ...)`**:  Paints the recolored inner areas onto the canvas filled with the border color.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fill_value = (2 * width(I) + 2) % 10
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  dilated_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(fill_value, toindices(obj) | delta(toindices(obj))), objs)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), dilated_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_value = (2 * width(I) + 2) % 10`**:  Calculates the border color.
2. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`**:  Identifies all objects in the grid.
3. **`lambda obj: recolor(fill_value, toindices(obj) | delta(toindices(obj)))`**:  For each object, combines the object itself with its delta (the surrounding cells) and recolors the entire set with the border color.
4. **`mapply(..., objs)`**: Applies the recoloring to all objects and merges them.
5. **`paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), ...)`**: Paints the merged, recolored objects (including their borders) onto a canvas of the input's background color and dimensions.

These five programs demonstrate diverse approaches to solving the border-adding transformation, leveraging various DSL functions to achieve the desired result.
