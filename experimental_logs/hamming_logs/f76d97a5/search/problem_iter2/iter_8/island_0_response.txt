## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be applying different patterns based on the size of the input grid:

**Input_0 (3x3):** A plus sign (+) shape of the digit '4' is drawn at the center of the grid. 

**Input_1 (5x5):** Two diagonal lines of the digit '6' are drawn, one starting from the top-left corner and moving down-right, and the other starting from the bottom-left corner moving up-right. 

**Input_2 (5x5):**  The digit '9' is placed in a checkered pattern. Every other row has two '9's placed two positions apart.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  h, w = shape(I)
  if (h, w) == (THREE, THREE): # For 3x3 grid
    center_idx = (h // 2, w // 2) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(FOUR, {center_idx})) # Paint the center
    for direction in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]: # Paint in each direction
      O = paint(O, recolor(FOUR, {add(center_idx, direction)})) 
  elif (h, w) == (FIVE, FIVE):
    for i in range(h):
      if i % 2 == 0:  # For even rows
        O = paint(O, recolor(NINE, {(i, 1)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(NINE, {(i, 3)}))
      else:  # For odd rows
        O = paint(O, recolor(SIX, {(i, i)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(SIX, {(h - i - 1, i)})) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **3x3 Grid:** This version calculates the center index and paints it with '4'. Then, it iterates through four directions (up, down, left, right) and paints the adjacent cells with '4' to form the plus sign.
- **5x5 Grid:** This version iterates through rows, differentiating between even and odd rows. For even rows, it places two '9's at specific columns. For odd rows, it places '6's diagonally, mirroring the placement to create two diagonal lines.


**Version 2**

```python
def program(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) # Initialize with zeros
  h, w = shape(I)
  if (h, w) == (THREE, THREE):
    O = fill(O, FOUR, {(i, j) for i in range(h) for j in range(w) if abs(i - 1) == abs(j - 1) or (i, j) == (1, 1)}) 
    # Fills '4' where i-1 equals j-1 or at the center
  elif (h, w) == (FIVE, FIVE):
    for i in range(h):
      for j in range(w):
        if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1: # For every other row and column
          O = paint(O, recolor(NINE, {(i, j)}))
        elif i % 2 == 1: # For every other row
          O = paint(O, recolor(SIX, {(i, (i + 2) % h)})) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **3x3 Grid:** This version uses a more concise approach to draw the plus sign by filling '4' in cells where the absolute difference between row and column indices (after subtracting 1) is equal, effectively targeting the diagonals and the center.
- **5x5 Grid:** This version uses modulo operation to identify every other row and column for placing '9's and every other row for placing '6's diagonally.


**Version 3**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  h, w = shape(I)
  if (h, w) == (THREE, THREE):
    O = paint(O, recolor(FOUR, {(i, j) for i in range(h) for j in range(w) if i == 1 or j == 1})) 
    # Paint '4' on the center row and column
  elif (h, w) == (FIVE, FIVE):
    for i in range(h):
      if i % 2 == 0:
        O = paint(O, recolor(NINE, {(i, j) for j in range(1, w, 2)})) # For even rows, paint every other column with '9'
      else:
        O = paint(O, recolor(SIX, {(i, (i + j * 2) % h) for j in range(2)})) 
        # For odd rows, paint two '6's diagonally with an offset
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **3x3 Grid:** This version simplifies drawing the plus by painting '4' on the center row and column directly.
- **5x5 Grid:** This version uses range with a step argument to paint '9's in every other column for even rows. It also uses a more compact expression for calculating diagonal positions for '6's in odd rows.


**Version 4**

```python
def program(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) # Start with a blank canvas of zeros
  h, w = shape(I)
  if (h, w) == (THREE, THREE):
    O = paint(O, recolor(FOUR, {(h // 2, w // 2)})) # Paint the center with '4'
    O = paint(O, recolor(FOUR, {(h // 2 + i, w // 2) for i in [-1, 1]}))  
    # Paint '4' above and below the center
    O = paint(O, recolor(FOUR, {(h // 2, w // 2 + j) for j in [-1, 1]})) 
    # Paint '4' to the left and right of the center
  elif (h, w) == (FIVE, FIVE):
    for i in range(h):
      if even(i):
        O = paint(O, recolor(NINE, {(i, 1 + 2 * j) for j in range(w // 2)})) # Paint '9's on even rows with spacing
      else:
        O = paint(O, recolor(SIX, {(i, (i + 2) % h)})) # Paint '6' diagonally
        O = paint(O, recolor(SIX, {(h - 1 - i, (i + 2) % h)})) # Paint the mirroring '6' diagonally 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **3x3 Grid:** This version breaks down the plus sign painting into painting the center and then individually painting the cells above, below, to the left, and to the right of the center. 
- **5x5 Grid:** This version calculates positions of '9's on even rows by iterating through half the columns and multiplying by 2 to get the correct spacing. For '6's, it calculates one diagonal position and then mirrors it for the other diagonal.


**Version 5**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  h, w = shape(I)
  if (h, w) == (THREE, THREE):
    O = paint(O, recolor(FOUR, {(i, j) for i in range(h) for j in range(w) if (i == j) or (i + j == h - 1) or (i, j) == (h // 2, w // 2)}))
    # Fills '4' for diagonals, anti-diagonals, and the center
  elif (h, w) == (FIVE, FIVE):
    for i in range(h):
      O = paint(O, recolor(branch(even(i), NINE, SIX), {(i, (i + 2 * (i % 2)) % h)}))
      # Uses branch to choose between '9' and '6' based on row index
      O = paint(O, recolor(branch(even(i), NINE, SIX), {(i, (h - i - 1 + 2 * (i % 2)) % h)}))
      # Similar logic for the mirroring diagonal with '9' or '6' 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **3x3 Grid:** This version uses a single condition within `recolor` to paint '4's for cells that satisfy conditions for diagonals, anti-diagonals, and the center.
- **5x5 Grid:** This version uses the `branch` function to choose between painting '9' or '6' based on the row index (even or odd) for both diagonal lines. It calculates the positions for both diagonals using modulo and row index manipulation.

These five versions demonstrate distinct ways to achieve the same output, using different combinations of DSL functions and logical structures. Each version offers a different perspective on how to approach the problem.
