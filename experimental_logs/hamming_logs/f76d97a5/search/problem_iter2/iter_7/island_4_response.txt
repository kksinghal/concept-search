## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place in these input-output pairs can be described as follows:

- **Identify the boundary cells** of the input grid. Boundary cells are defined as cells that are located on the outermost row or column of the grid.
- **Calculate a fill value** This value is determined by the formula `2 * width(input_grid) + 2`.
- **Create a new grid** with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with the most common color in the input grid.
- **Overwrite the boundary cells** in the new grid with the calculated fill value.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code in the provided DSL, along with explanations for each version:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fill_value = 2 * width(I) + 2
  boundary_cells = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(width(I)) if i == 0 or i == height(I) - 1 or j == 0 or j == width(I) - 1)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(fill_value, boundary_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_value = 2 * width(I) + 2`**: Calculates the fill value based on the input grid's width.
2. **`boundary_cells = ...`**: Generates a set of tuples representing the indices of boundary cells. It iterates through all cell indices and checks if the cell is on the first/last row or first/last column.
3. **`paint(canvas(...), recolor(...))`**: Creates a new grid filled with the most common color and then overwrites the boundary cells with the `fill_value`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fill_value = 2 * width(I) + 2
  h, w = shape(I)
  top_bottom = frozenset((i, j) for i in (0, h - 1) for j in range(w))
  left_right = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(h) for j in (0, w - 1))
  boundary_cells = top_bottom | left_right
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(fill_value, boundary_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_value = ...`**: Calculates the fill value.
2. **`h, w = shape(I)`**: Extracts height and width for cleaner code.
3. **`top_bottom = ...`**: Generates indices for top and bottom rows.
4. **`left_right = ...`**: Generates indices for left and right columns.
5. **`boundary_cells = ...`**: Combines the indices for all boundary cells.
6. **`paint(canvas(...), recolor(...))`**: Creates the final grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fill_value = 2 * width(I) + 2
  h, w = shape(I)
  boundary_cells = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda idx: bordering(initset(idx), I))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w)), recolor(fill_value, boundary_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_value = ...`**:  Calculates the fill value.
2. **`h, w = shape(I)`**: Extracts height and width.
3. **`boundary_cells = ...`**:  Uses `mfilter` to efficiently identify boundary cells by checking if a single-element set containing the current index is bordering the grid.
4. **`paint(canvas(...), recolor(...))`**: Creates the output grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    fill_value = 2 * width(I) + 2
    h, w = shape(I)
    boundary_indices = combine(interval(0, w, 1), interval(h - 1, h, 1))
    boundary_cells_top_bottom = mapply(lambda i: product({i}, interval(0, w, 1)), boundary_indices)
    boundary_indices = combine(interval(0, h, 1), interval(w - 1, w, 1))
    boundary_cells_left_right = mapply(lambda j: product(interval(0, h, 1), {j}), boundary_indices)
    boundary_cells = combine(boundary_cells_top_bottom, boundary_cells_left_right)
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w)), recolor(fill_value, boundary_cells)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_value = ...`**:  Calculates the fill value.
2. **`h, w = shape(I)`**: Extracts height and width.
3. **`boundary_indices = ...`**:  Creates sets of indices for the top/bottom and left/right boundaries using intervals and combine.
4. **`boundary_cells_top_bottom = ... & boundary_cells_left_right = ... `**: Utilizes mapply and product to efficiently generate all boundary cell indices from the boundary_indices.
5. **`boundary_cells = ...`**: Combines the indices for all boundary cells.
6. **`paint(canvas(...), recolor(...))`**: Creates the output grid. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fill_value = add(multiply(2, width(I)), 2) 
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(fill_value,  frozenset((i, j) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(width(I)) if i == 0 or j == 0 or i == height(I)-1 or j == width(I)-1)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_value = ...`**: Calculates the fill value using more basic arithmetic functions like add and multiply.
2. **`return paint(...)`**:  Combines the canvas creation, boundary cell identification, recoloring and painting into a single line for a more concise solution.
