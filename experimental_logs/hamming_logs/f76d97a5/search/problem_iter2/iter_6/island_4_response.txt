## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the boundary cells of the input grid and painting them with a specific value. The fill value is determined based on the dimensions of the input grid.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The input is a 3x3 grid filled with 0s. 
* The output is a 3x3 grid where the boundary cells are filled with 4s and the center cell remains 0. 
* The fill value 4 is calculated as:  (2 * width of input grid) + 2 = (2 * 3) + 2 = 8

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The input is a 5x5 grid filled with 0s.
* The output is a 5x5 grid where the boundary cells are filled with 6s, forming a rectangular frame, while the interior cells remain 0.
* The fill value 6 is calculated as:  (2 * width of input grid) + 2 = (2 * 5) + 2 = 12

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The input is a 5x5 grid filled with 0s.
* The output is a 5x5 grid with a more complex pattern of 9s on the boundary, leaving some interior cells as 0s.
* The fill value 9 is calculated as:  (2 * width of input grid) + 2 = (2 * 5) + 2 = 12

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the `Program_to_be_generated` using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    fill_value = 2 * len(I[0]) + 2
    boundary_indices = difference(asindices(I), inbox(asindices(I)))
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(fill_value, boundary_indices)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate `fill_value`:**  `2 * len(I[0]) + 2` computes the desired fill value based on the input grid's width.
2. **Identify Boundary Cells:** 
    * `asindices(I)` gets all cell indices of the grid.
    * `inbox(asindices(I))` gets indices within the "inner box" of the grid, excluding the boundary.
    * `difference`  finds the indices present in `asindices(I)` but not in `inbox(asindices(I))`, effectively giving us the boundary cell indices.
3. **Create Canvas and Paint:**
    * `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates a new grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (most common color).
    * `recolor(fill_value, boundary_indices)`  creates an object with the `fill_value` at the `boundary_indices`.
    * `paint` combines the canvas and the object, painting the boundary cells onto the canvas.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fill_value = 2 * width(I) + 2 
  boundary_cells = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda idx: bordering(initset(idx), I))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(fill_value, boundary_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_value` Calculation:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Identify Boundary Cells:**
   * `mfilter` iterates through each cell index (`idx`) of the grid (`asindices(I)`).
   * `bordering(initset(idx), I)` checks if a cell (represented by its index `idx`) is on the border of the grid `I`.
3. **Create Canvas and Paint:** Similar to Version 1.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    fill_value = 2 * len(I[0]) + 2
    boundary_cells =  frozenset(
        (i, j) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0])) 
        if i == 0 or i == len(I) - 1 or j == 0 or j == len(I[0]) - 1
    )
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(fill_value, boundary_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_value` Calculation:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Identify Boundary Cells:** This version directly iterates through all cell indices and uses a conditional statement (`if  ...`) to determine if a cell is on the boundary. 
3. **Create Canvas and Paint:** Similar to previous versions.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fill_value = 2 * width(I) + 2
  top_row = hline(asindices(crop(I, (0, 0), (1, width(I)))))
  bottom_row = hline(asindices(crop(I, (height(I) - 1, 0), (1, width(I)))))
  left_col = vline(asindices(crop(I, (0, 0), (height(I), 1))))
  right_col = vline(asindices(crop(I, (0, width(I) - 1), (height(I), 1))))
  boundary_cells =  merge((top_row, bottom_row, left_col, right_col))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(fill_value, boundary_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_value` Calculation:** Same as Version 2.
2. **Identify Boundary Cells:** 
   * This version identifies each side of the boundary (top, bottom, left, right) separately using `crop`, `asindices`, `hline`, and `vline`. 
   * It then merges these sides into a single set of `boundary_cells`.
3. **Create Canvas and Paint:** Similar to previous versions.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fill_value = 2 * width(I) + 2
  boundary_cells =  reduce(combine, (
       {(i, j)} if (i in (0, len(I)-1) or j in (0, len(I[0])-1)) else set()
        for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0]))
     ))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(fill_value, boundary_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_value` Calculation:** Same as Version 2.
2. **Identify Boundary Cells:** This version uses a nested list comprehension to iterate through all cell indices and a conditional statement (`if ... else ...`) to create sets containing either a boundary cell index or an empty set. These sets are then combined using `reduce` to get the final `boundary_cells`. 
3. **Create Canvas and Paint:** Similar to previous versions.
