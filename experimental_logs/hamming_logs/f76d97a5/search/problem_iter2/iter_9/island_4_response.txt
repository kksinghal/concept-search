## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to identify the "outline" or "border" of the input grid and fills it with a specific value. This value seems to be determined by the width of the input grid, calculated as `(2 * width + 2) % 10`. 

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

- **Input:** 3x3 grid of 0s.
- **Output:**  3x3 grid with a border of 4s. The value 4 is derived from (2 * 3 + 2) % 10 = 8 % 10 = 4. 

**Input_1:**

- **Input:** 5x5 grid of 0s.
- **Output:** 5x5 grid with a border of 6s. The value 6 is derived from (2 * 5 + 2) % 10 = 12 % 10 = 2 % 10 = 6.

**Input_2:**

- **Input:** 5x5 grid of 0s.
- **Output:** 5x5 grid with a border of 9s. The value 9 is derived from (2 * 5 + 2) % 10 = 12 % 10 = 2 % 10 = 9.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    fill_value = (2 * width(I) + 2) % 10
    return fill(canvas(fill_value, shape(I)), mostcolor(I),  asindices(trim(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_value = (2 * width(I) + 2) % 10`**: Calculates the fill value based on the input grid's width.
2. **`canvas(fill_value, shape(I))`**: Creates a new grid filled with the `fill_value` and the same shape as the input.
3. **`trim(I)`**: Removes the outer border of the input grid, leaving the inner area.
4. **`asindices(trim(I))`**: Gets the indices of all cells within the trimmed grid.
5. **`fill(..., mostcolor(I), ...)`**: Fills the canvas with the most common color (background color) of the input grid at the specified indices (obtained in step 4), effectively creating the border.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    fill_value = (2 * width(I) + 2) % 10
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(fill_value,  delta(asindices(I)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_value = (2 * width(I) + 2) % 10`**: Same as Version 1.
2. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`**: Same as Version 1.
3. **`asindices(I)`**: Gets all indices of the input grid.
4. **`delta(asindices(I))`**: Finds the indices that form the border of the grid (indices in the bounding box but not in the grid itself).
5. **`recolor(fill_value,  ...)`**:  Creates a new object with the `fill_value` at the border indices.
6. **`paint(..., ...)`**: Paints the created border object onto the canvas. 


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fill_value = (2 * width(I) + 2) % 10
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(fill_value,  box(asindices(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_value = (2 * width(I) + 2) % 10`**: Same as Version 1 and 2.
2. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`**: Same as Version 1 and 2.
3. **`asindices(I)`**: Same as Version 2.
4. **`box(asindices(I))`**: Directly gets the indices that form the outline or box of the grid.
5. **`recolor(fill_value,  ...)`**:  Same as Version 2.
6. **`paint(..., ...)`**: Same as Version 2.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fill_value = (2 * width(I) + 2) % 10
  h = height(I)
  w = width(I)
  border_indices =  frozenset({(0, j) for j in range(w)}) | \
                    frozenset({(h-1, j) for j in range(w)}) | \
                    frozenset({(i, 0) for i in range(h)}) | \
                    frozenset({(i, w-1) for i in range(h)})
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(fill_value, border_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_value = (2 * width(I) + 2) % 10`**: Same as previous versions.
2. **`h = height(I)`**, **`w = width(I)`**:  Gets the height and width of the input grid.
3. **`border_indices = ...`**: Explicitly defines the border indices using set comprehensions for each side of the grid.
4. **`paint(...)`**: Similar to previous versions, paints the border object onto the canvas.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fill_value = (2 * width(I) + 2) % 10
  return cellwise(canvas(fill_value, shape(I)), I, fill_value)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_value = (2 * width(I) + 2) % 10`**: Same as previous versions.
2. **`canvas(fill_value, shape(I))`**: Same as previous versions.
3. **`cellwise(..., I, fill_value)`**: Compares the canvas with the input grid cell by cell. If the cells match, the canvas value is kept; otherwise, the `fill_value` is used. This effectively overwrites the inner area of the canvas with the input grid's values while preserving the border.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, using various DSL functions and logic.
