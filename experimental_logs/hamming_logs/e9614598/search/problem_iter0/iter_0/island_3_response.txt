## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '1' and drawing a horizontal and a vertical line of '3's' that intersect at the center of the object. 

**Input_0:**

* Two '1's' form a single object.
* A horizontal line and a vertical line of '3's' are drawn, intersecting at the center of the object formed by the '1's'. 

**Input_1:**

* Two '1's' are present, but they are not connected and hence form two separate objects.
* For each '1', a horizontal and vertical line of '3's' are drawn, centered at the respective '1'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Find all objects formed by non-zero digits
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    center_i, center_j = centerofmass(obj) # Calculate the center of mass of each object
    for i in range(len(I)):
      O = fill(O, 3, {(i, center_j)})  # Draw a vertical line of '3's'
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      O = fill(O, 3, {(center_i, j)})  # Draw a horizontal line of '3's'
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies all connected components of non-zero digits in the input grid (`I`) as individual objects.
2. **Iterate and draw:** The code iterates through each object (`obj`) found. 
3. **Calculate center:** For each object, `centerofmass(obj)` determines the center point.
4. **Draw lines:** Using the calculated center, vertical and horizontal lines of '3's' are drawn on the grid using the `fill` function.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)  # Find indices of all '1's
  O = I
  for i, j in ones:
    h_line = {(i, k) for k in range(len(I[0]))}  # Generate indices for the horizontal line
    v_line = {(k, j) for k in range(len(I))}  # Generate indices for the vertical line
    O = fill(O, 3, h_line)  # Draw the horizontal line
    O = fill(O, 3, v_line)  # Draw the vertical line
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1's:**  `ofcolor(I, 1)` finds the indices of all cells containing the digit '1'.
2. **Iterate and draw:**  The code iterates through each index `(i, j)` where a '1' is located.
3. **Generate line indices:** For each '1', indices for a complete horizontal line (`h_line`) and a complete vertical line (`v_line`) intersecting at the '1' are generated.
4. **Draw lines:** The `fill` function draws the lines using the generated indices and the value '3'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))  # Create an empty canvas of the same size as input
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 1:  # Check if the current cell is '1'
        for k in range(len(I[0])):
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, k)}) # Draw horizontal line 
        for k in range(len(I)):
          O = fill(O, 3, {(k, j)}) # Draw vertical line
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create canvas:** `canvas(0, shape(I))` creates an empty grid (`O`) of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with '0's. 
2. **Iterate and check:** The program iterates through each cell of the input grid.
3. **Conditional drawing:** If a cell contains '1', horizontal and vertical lines of '3's' are drawn on the output grid (`O`) intersecting at the '1' location.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Find all objects
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    center_i = (uppermost(obj) + lowermost(obj)) // 2 # Calculate center row index
    center_j = (leftmost(obj) + rightmost(obj)) // 2 # Calculate center column index
    O = fill(O, 3, {(center_i, j) for j in range(len(I[0]))})  # Draw horizontal line
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, center_j) for i in range(len(I))})  # Draw vertical line
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find objects:** Similar to Version 1, it identifies all connected components of non-zero digits.
2. **Calculate center:** Instead of using `centerofmass`, this version calculates the center row and column indices using `uppermost`, `lowermost`, `leftmost`, and `rightmost` functions.
3. **Draw lines:**  Similar to previous versions, it draws the lines using the calculated center indices.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h = len(I)
  w = len(I[0])
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))  # Create an empty canvas
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
          O = paint(O, recolor(3, hfrontier((i, j)))) # Paint horizontal line
          O = paint(O, recolor(3, vfrontier((i, j)))) # Paint vertical line
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create canvas:** Creates an empty canvas `O` of the same size as the input.
2. **Iterate and check:**  Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
3. **Paint lines:** If a cell contains '1', it uses `hfrontier` and `vfrontier` to generate horizontal and vertical lines extending across the grid. These lines are then recolored to '3' using `recolor` and painted onto the output canvas `O` using the `paint` function.

These are five different ways to achieve the desired transformation using the DSL. Each version utilizes different functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL in solving spatial reasoning tasks.
