## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on highlighting the area around the digits '1' in the input grid. It appears to follow these rules:

1. **Identification:**  Identify the locations of the digit '1' in the input grid.
2. **Expansion:** Expand around each identified location by one cell in all directions (up, down, left, right).
3. **Color Change:**  Change the color of the expanded area to the digit '3'.

**Example:**

In both Input_0 and Input_1, the digit '1' acts as a seed. The transformation creates a 3x3 square of '3's centered around each '1', effectively highlighting its position. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Identify locations of '1'
  x1 = ofcolor(I, ONE)  
  # Generate the surrounding area for each '1'
  x2 = mapply(neighbors, x1)
  # Combine the surrounding areas
  x3 = merge(x2)
  # Fill the combined areas with '3'
  O = fill(I, THREE, x3) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `ofcolor(I, ONE)`: Identifies the indices of all cells in the input grid `I` that contain the value `ONE` (which is 1).
2. `mapply(neighbors, x1)`: Applies the `neighbors` function to each index in `x1`. The `neighbors` function returns the indices surrounding a given index. This step effectively creates a set of indices surrounding each '1'.
3. `merge(x2)`: Combines all the sets of surrounding indices into a single set, representing the complete area to be highlighted.
4. `fill(I, THREE, x3)`: Fills the input grid `I` with the value `THREE` (which is 3) at all indices present in `x3`, resulting in the final highlighted grid.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find all objects
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  # Select the object containing '1'
  obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE)
  # Expand the object by one layer in each direction
  expanded_obj =  toindices(shift(obj, UP) | shift(obj, DOWN) | shift(obj, LEFT) | shift(obj, RIGHT) | obj)
  # Fill the expanded area with '3'
  O = fill(I, THREE, expanded_obj) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, T, F, F)`:  Identifies all connected objects within the grid `I`.
2. `extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE)`: Finds the specific object within the set of `objs` where the `color` of the object is equal to `ONE` (1). 
3. `shift(obj, UP) | shift(obj, DOWN) | shift(obj, LEFT) | shift(obj, RIGHT) | obj`: This line calculates the expanded area by shifting the object `obj` one unit in each direction (up, down, left, right) and taking the union of the results, including the original `obj`.
4. `toindices( ... )`: Converts the expanded object (which is a set of cells) to a set of indices.
5. `fill(I, THREE, expanded_obj)`: Fills the input grid `I` with the value `THREE` (3) at the indices within `expanded_obj`, resulting in the highlighted output grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Create a canvas filled with the background color
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  # Find all occurrences of the '1' object
  occurrences = occurrences(I, {(ONE, (0, 0))}) 
  # Iterate through occurrences and paint the highlighted area
  for i, j in occurrences:
    O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, backdrop({(0, 0)})) | {(ONE, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`: Creates a new grid `O` of the same size and filled with the background color as the input grid `I`.
2. `occurrences(I, {(ONE, (0, 0))})`: This finds all occurrences of a single-cell object with the value '1' within the input grid `I`.
3. The `for` loop iterates through each occurrence of '1' found in the previous step:
   -  `recolor(THREE, backdrop({(0, 0)})) | {(ONE, (i, j))}`: This creates an object representing the 3x3 highlighted area centered at the current occurrence of '1'. It does this by: 
     - Creating a 3x3 backdrop centered at (0, 0) using `backdrop({(0, 0)})`.
     - Recoloring this backdrop to '3' using `recolor(THREE, ...)`.
     - Adding the current '1' cell at position (i, j) using `| {(ONE, (i, j))}`.
   -  `paint(O, ...)`: This paints the created highlighted area onto the canvas `O` at the correct position. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Get indices of cells containing '1'
  indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Create a set to store indices to be filled with '3'
  fill_indices = set()
  # Iterate through each index containing '1'
  for i, j in indices:
    # Add the index itself and its neighbors to the set
    fill_indices.add((i, j))
    fill_indices.update(dneighbors((i, j))) 
  # Fill the specified indices with '3' in the input grid
  O = fill(I, THREE, frozenset(fill_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `ofcolor(I, ONE)`: Identifies the indices of cells in the input grid `I` that contain the value `ONE` (1).
2. `fill_indices = set()`: Initializes an empty set to store the indices that will be filled with '3'.
3. The `for` loop iterates over each `(i, j)` index in `indices`:
   - `fill_indices.add((i, j))`: Adds the current index itself to the `fill_indices` set.
   - `fill_indices.update(dneighbors((i, j)))`: Calculates the directly adjacent neighbors of the current index using `dneighbors` and adds them to the `fill_indices` set.
4. `fill(I, THREE, frozenset(fill_indices))`: Fills the input grid `I` with the value `THREE` (3) at all indices present in the `fill_indices` set, resulting in the final highlighted grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Directly construct and paint a 3x3 object centered at each '1'
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == ONE: 
        O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, {(i-1, j-1), (i-1, j), (i-1, j+1), (i, j-1), (i, j), (i, j+1), (i+1, j-1), (i+1, j), (i+1, j+1)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `O = I`: Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. The nested `for` loops iterate through each cell in the input grid `I`:
   -  `if val == ONE:`: Checks if the current cell value (`val`) is equal to `ONE` (1). 
   -  If the value is '1':
      - `recolor(THREE, {(i-1, j-1), ..., (i+1, j+1)})`:  Creates a 3x3 object filled with `THREE` (3) centered at the current '1's location `(i, j)`.
      - `paint(O, ...)`:  Paints this 3x3 object onto the output grid `O`, effectively highlighting the area around the '1'.
3. `return O`: Returns the modified output grid `O`, which now includes the highlighting.
