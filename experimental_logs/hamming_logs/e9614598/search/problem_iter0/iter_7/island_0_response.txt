## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects composed of the digit "1" and then drawing a border around these objects using the digit "3". The border is one cell thick and surrounds the object completely. 

**Input_0:**

- Two single-cell objects with the value "1" are present.
- The output creates a 3x3 square border of "3"s around each "1".

**Input_1:**

- Two single-cell objects with the value "1" are present, vertically aligned.
- The output creates a 3x5 rectangular border of "3"s around the two "1"s, effectively connecting them.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct programs to achieve the desired transformation:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  bordered = frozenset(inbox(obj) for obj in objs)
  return fill(I, 3, merge(bordered))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Identifies objects made up of "1"s in the input grid (`I`). `True, False, True` signifies that we are looking for univalued objects, not considering diagonal connections, and excluding the background.
2. **`bordered = frozenset(inbox(obj) for obj in objs)`:**  For each identified object, it calculates the indices of its surrounding "inbox" â€“ the area one cell outside the object's boundary.
3. **`return fill(I, 3, merge(bordered))`:** Merges all the "inbox" indices and fills them with the value "3" on the original input grid, effectively creating the border.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_locs = ofcolor(I, 1)
  shifted_locs = mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0]-1, loc[1]), (loc[0]+1, loc[1]), (loc[0], loc[1]-1), (loc[0], loc[1]+1), loc}, one_locs)
  return fill(I, 3, shifted_locs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`one_locs = ofcolor(I, 1)`:** Extracts the indices of all cells containing "1".
2. **`shifted_locs = mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0]-1, loc[1]), (loc[0]+1, loc[1]), (loc[0], loc[1]-1), (loc[0], loc[1]+1), loc}, one_locs)`:** For each "1" location, creates a set of indices representing the cell itself and its four direct neighbors. The `mapply` function then merges all these sets.
3. **`return fill(I, 3, shifted_locs)`:** Fills the collected indices with the value "3" on the original input grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, 3, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: any(index(I, l) == 1 for l in dneighbors(loc))))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`asindices(I)`:** Generates all possible indices within the grid.
2.  **`lambda loc: any(index(I, l) == 1 for l in dneighbors(loc))`:**  This lambda function checks if any direct neighbor of a given location `loc` contains the value "1".
3.  **`mfilter(...)`:** Filters the indices, keeping only those where the lambda function returns True (i.e., having a neighboring "1").
4.  **`fill(I, 3, ...)`:** Fills the filtered indices with the value "3".


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  border_cells = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: any(manhattan({loc}, obj) == 1 for obj in objs))
  return fill(I, 3, border_cells)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`objs = objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Identifies "1" objects as in previous versions.
2.  **`border_cells = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: any(manhattan({loc}, obj) == 1 for obj in objs))`:** Iterates through all grid indices and uses `manhattan` to check if an index is exactly one unit away from any of the identified objects, marking it as a border cell.
3.  **`return fill(I, 3, border_cells)`:**  Fills the border cells with "3".


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_cells = toindices(recolor(1, ofcolor(I, 1))) 
  border =  mapply(lambda cell: neighbors(cell), one_cells)
  return fill(I, 3, border)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`one_cells = toindices(recolor(1, ofcolor(I, 1)))`:** Obtains indices of cells containing "1".
2. **`border = mapply(lambda cell: neighbors(cell), one_cells)`:** For each cell containing "1", it identifies all neighboring cells using `neighbors` and merges them into a single set.
3. **`return fill(I, 3, border)`:**  Fills the identified border cells with "3".


These five programs showcase different approaches and combinations of DSL functions to solve the given transformation task. Each version achieves the same result while employing distinct logic, demonstrating the flexibility and power of the DSL.
