## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to draw a horizontal line of '3's centered on the '1's in the input grid. 

**Input_0:**

* Two '1's are present on the same row.
* The output has a horizontal line of '3's extending three cells wide, centered on the '1's.

**Input_1:**

* Two '1's are present in the same column, but on different rows.
* The output has two separate horizontal lines of '3's, each three cells wide, centered on their respective '1's.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find all '1' cells
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Define a function to get horizontal neighbors
  h_neighbors = lambda idx: {(idx[0], idx[1] - 1), idx, (idx[0], idx[1] + 1)}
  # Apply the function to each '1' index and merge
  three_indices = merge(apply(h_neighbors, ones))
  # Fill the grid with '3's at the calculated indices
  return fill(I, THREE, three_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' cells:**  `ofcolor(I, ONE)` identifies the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **Get horizontal neighbors:**  `h_neighbors` takes an index and returns a set containing the index itself and its immediate left and right neighbors.
3. **Apply and merge:** `apply(h_neighbors, ones)` applies `h_neighbors` to each '1' index and `merge` combines the resulting sets into `three_indices`.
4. **Fill with '3's:** `fill(I, THREE, three_indices)` places '3's at all indices in `three_indices`, effectively drawing the horizontal lines.


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find objects formed by '1's
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  # Define a function to create a horizontal line around an object
  create_line = lambda obj: frozenset((i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for j in range(leftmost(obj) - 1, rightmost(obj) + 2))
  # Apply the function to each object and merge
  lines = merge(apply(create_line, objs))
  # Fill the grid with '3's at the line indices
  return fill(I, THREE, lines)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find objects:**  `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies objects formed by adjacent '1's (non-diagonal, excluding background).
2. **Create horizontal line:** `create_line` takes an object and generates indices for a horizontal line spanning its width + 2 (one extra cell on each side).
3. **Apply and merge:**  `apply(create_line, objs)` applies `create_line` to each object and `merge` combines the resulting sets into `lines`.
4. **Fill with '3's:** `fill(I, THREE, lines)` places '3's at the `lines` indices, drawing the horizontal lines.


### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Iterate through each cell in the grid
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          THREE if any(I[i][max(0, j-1):min(len(I[0]), j+2)]) == ONE else I[i][j] 
          for j in range(len(I[0]))
      ) 
      for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** The code directly iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check for '1' in the neighborhood:** For each cell, it examines its immediate horizontal neighbors (handling edge cases). If any neighbor is '1', the cell becomes '3'.
3. **Construct new grid:** The iterators construct a new grid with the applied transformation.


### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Horizontally upscale the grid
  upscaled = hupscale(I, 3)
  # Replace '1's with '3's in the upscaled grid
  replaced = replace(upscaled, ONE, THREE)
  # Downscale the grid back to its original size
  return downscale(replaced, 3)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscale:** `hupscale(I, 3)` triples the grid's width, replicating each cell horizontally.
2. **Replace '1's with '3's:** `replace(upscaled, ONE, THREE)`  replaces all '1's in the upscaled grid with '3's, effectively expanding them horizontally.
3. **Downscale:** `downscale(replaced, 3)` downsamples the grid back to its original size, merging the expanded '3's into a single horizontal line.


### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find indices of '1's
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Define function to get left and right neighbors
  neighbors = lambda idx: {(idx[0], idx[1] - 1), (idx[0], idx[1] + 1)}
  # Get the neighboring indices and combine
  all_indices = combine(ones, merge(apply(neighbors, ones)))
  # Fill the grid with '3's at the combined indices
  return fill(I, THREE, all_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' indices:** Similar to previous versions, `ofcolor(I, ONE)` finds the indices of all '1' cells.
2. **Get neighbors:**  `neighbors` takes an index and returns a set containing its immediate left and right neighbors.
3. **Combine indices:** `apply(neighbors, ones)` applies `neighbors` to each '1' index. `merge` combines the neighbor sets, and `combine` further adds the original '1' indices to create `all_indices`.
4. **Fill with '3's:**  `fill(I, THREE, all_indices)` places '3's at all indices in `all_indices`, generating the horizontal lines.
