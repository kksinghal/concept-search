## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (clusters of the same digit) and drawing a cross-shaped pattern centered on each object with the digit '3'.  The cross extends only to directly adjacent cells and does not overwrite the original object.

**Input_0:**

* Two single-cell objects with value '1'.
* Output places '3' in the four cells directly adjacent to each '1'.

**Input_1:**

* Two single-cell objects with value '1'.
* Output places '3' in the four cells directly adjacent to each '1'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find all '1' indices
  x1 = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Generate neighboring indices for each '1' and merge
  x2 = mapply(dneighbors, x1)
  # Combine '1' indices and neighbor indices 
  x3 = combine(x1, x2)
  # Fill the combined indices with '3'
  O = fill(I, THREE, x3)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. `ofcolor(I, ONE)` identifies the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. `mapply(dneighbors, x1)` applies the `dneighbors` function to each '1' index, generating a set of indices representing their direct neighbors. These sets are then merged.
3. `combine(x1, x2)` combines the '1' indices with their neighbor indices.
4. `fill(I, THREE, x3)` fills the grid `I` with the value '3' at the combined indices.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find all objects
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  # Generate cross indices for each object and merge
  cross_indices = mapply(lambda o: dneighbors(centerofmass(o)), objs)
  # Fill cross indices with '3'
  O = fill(I, THREE, cross_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects in the grid, considering only direct neighbors and excluding the background.
2. `mapply(lambda o: dneighbors(centerofmass(o)), objs)` calculates the center of mass for each object and then finds its direct neighbors. The resulting sets of neighbor indices are merged.
3. `fill(I, THREE, cross_indices)` fills the grid `I` with '3' at the identified cross indices.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Iterate through grid cells
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = [[I[i][j] for j in range(w)] for i in range(h)]
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      # If cell is '1', fill direct neighbors with '3'
      if I[i][j] == ONE:
        for di, dj in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
          ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
          if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w:
            O[ni][nj] = THREE 
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version iterates directly through each cell of the grid.
2. If a cell contains '1', it iterates through its four direct neighbors.
3. For each valid neighbor within the grid bounds, it sets the corresponding cell in the output grid to '3'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find object indices
  object_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Create a set of cross indices
  cross_indices = set()
  for i, j in object_indices:
    cross_indices.update({(i + 1, j), (i - 1, j), (i, j + 1), (i, j - 1)})
  # Intersect cross indices with valid grid indices
  valid_cross_indices = {(i, j) for i, j in cross_indices if 0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0])}
  # Fill valid cross indices with '3'
  O = fill(I, THREE, valid_cross_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `ofcolor(I, ONE)` identifies the indices of all '1' cells.
2. It iterates through each '1' index, adding its four direct neighbors to the `cross_indices` set.
3. The code then filters the `cross_indices` to keep only valid indices within the grid boundaries.
4. Finally, it fills the grid with '3' at the valid cross indices.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Define a lambda function to find cross indices
  find_cross = lambda i, j: {(i + 1, j), (i - 1, j), (i, j + 1), (i, j - 1)}
  # Apply the lambda function to each '1' cell and merge results
  cross_indices = mapply(lambda c: find_cross(*c[1]), asobject(I))
  # Intersect with valid grid indices
  valid_cross_indices = {(i, j) for i, j in cross_indices if 0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0])}
  # Fill valid cross indices with '3'
  O = fill(I, THREE, valid_cross_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. A lambda function `find_cross` is defined to calculate the cross indices for a given cell.
2. `asobject(I)` converts the input grid to an object representation.
3. `mapply` applies the `find_cross` lambda function to each cell in the object representation if the cell value is '1', merging the resulting sets of cross indices.
4. It then filters the `cross_indices` to retain only valid indices within the grid boundaries.
5. Finally, the grid is filled with '3' at the valid cross indices.
