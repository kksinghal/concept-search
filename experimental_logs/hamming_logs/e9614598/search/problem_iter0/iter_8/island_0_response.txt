## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify '1' digits in the input grid and replace a specific pattern around them with the digit '3'. 

* **Horizontal '1's:** If a '1' is present, its directly adjacent left, right, and top neighbors are replaced with '3'.
* **Vertical '1's:**  Similar to horizontal, but the top and bottom neighbors are replaced with '3' along with the adjacent left and right.

This effectively "outlines" the '1' digits with '3's, leaving the original '1' digit untouched.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1) # Find all locations of '1'
  shifted_indices = mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0]-1, loc[1]), (loc[0]+1, loc[1]), (loc[0], loc[1]-1), (loc[0], loc[1]+1)}, one_indices) # Get adjacent locations 
  filtered_indices = intersection(shifted_indices, asindices(I)) # Keep only valid indices within grid boundaries
  return fill(I, 3, filtered_indices) # Fill those locations with '3'
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1's:** `ofcolor(I, 1)` locates all indices containing '1'.
2. **Find Adjacent Cells:** `mapply` applies a lambda function to each '1' location to obtain indices of its four neighbors (up, down, left, right).
3. **Filter Invalid Indices:** `intersection` ensures only valid indices within the grid boundaries are retained.
4. **Fill with '3's:** `fill(I, 3, filtered_indices)` replaces the values at the filtered indices with '3'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_objects = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Extract objects with '1'
  three_patch = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: any(manhattan({loc}, obj) <= 1 for obj in one_objects)) # Find cells within 1 Manhattan distance from '1' objects
  return fill(I, 3, three_patch)  # Fill those cells with '3' 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '1' Objects:**  `objects` function identifies connected regions of '1's.
2. **Find Nearby Cells:**  For each cell in the grid, calculate Manhattan distance to each '1' object.  If the distance is 1 or less, mark the cell for replacement.
3. **Fill with '3's:** Replace marked cells with '3'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, upsale(downscale(replace(I, 1, 3), 2), 2), 3)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Replace '1's:**  Replace all occurrences of '1' with '3' using `replace`.
2. **Downscale and Upscale:**  Downscale the grid by a factor of 2, then upscale it back. This effectively removes isolated '3's (originally '1's) leaving only the surrounding pattern.
3. **Combine with Original:**  Use `cellwise` to compare the original grid with the processed grid. For matching cells, keep the original value; otherwise, use '3'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def helper(loc):
    i, j = loc
    return {(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)} # Define neighbors function within the main function

  one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  neighbor_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: any(n in one_indices for n in helper(loc))) 
  return fill(I, 3, neighbor_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `helper` Function:** A nested function `helper` is defined to get neighboring indices of a given location.
2. **Identify '1's and Neighbors:** Similar to version 1, locate '1's and their neighbors using `ofcolor` and `mfilter` with the `helper` function.
3. **Fill with '3's:**  Fill identified neighbor indices with '3'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  new_grid = [[0 for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(h)] # Initialize a new grid

  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]: # Iterate through neighbors
          ni, nj = i+di, j+dj
          if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w:
            new_grid[ni][nj] = 3

  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize New Grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input, initially filled with '0's.
2. **Iterate and Check Neighbors:** Iterate through each cell, if it's '1', set its valid neighbors to '3' in the new grid.
3. **Return New Grid:**  Return the new grid with the applied transformation.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to solving the given transformation task using the provided DSL. Each version leverages different function combinations and logic, showcasing diverse solutions to the problem.
