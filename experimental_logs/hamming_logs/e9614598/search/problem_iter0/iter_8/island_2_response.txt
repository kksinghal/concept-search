## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify '1's in the input grid and draw a horizontal line of '3's extending three cells wide, centered on each '1'. 

**Input_0:**

- Two '1's are present, each requiring a three-cell horizontal line of '3's centered on them.

**Input_1:**

- Similar to Input_0, two '1's are present, each necessitating a three-cell horizontal line of '3's centered on them.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find indices of '1's
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Define function for horizontal neighbors including self
  h_neighbors_self = lambda idx: {(idx[0], idx[1] - 1), idx, (idx[0], idx[1] + 1)}
  # Apply function to each '1' index and merge into a frozenset
  three_indices = frozenset(merge(apply(h_neighbors_self, ones)))
  # Fill the grid with '3's at the calculated indices
  return fill(I, THREE, three_indices) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' indices:**  Similar to Program_B, we find the indices of cells containing '1' using `ofcolor(I, ONE)`.
2. **Define horizontal neighbors (including self):** A lambda function `h_neighbors_self` is defined to get the left and right neighbors of an index *and the index itself*. 
3. **Get and merge neighboring indices:** `apply` applies the `h_neighbors_self` function to each '1' index, and `merge` combines the resulting sets into a single frozenset.
4. **Fill with '3's:** `fill` replaces the values at the calculated indices with '3' in the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find indices of '1's
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Define a function to generate a three-cell horizontal line 
  three_line = lambda idx: {(idx[0], idx[1]-1), idx, (idx[0], idx[1]+1)}
  # Apply the function to each '1' index
  lines = apply(three_line, ones)
  # Merge the lines and fill with '3'
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(lines))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1' cells:** We find the indices of cells with '1' using `ofcolor(I, ONE)`.
2. **Create horizontal line function:** A function `three_line` is defined to generate a set of indices representing a three-cell horizontal line centered at the given index.
3. **Generate lines for each '1':** `apply` applies the `three_line` function to each '1' index, generating a set of lines.
4. **Merge and fill:** `merge` combines all the generated lines into a single set, and `fill` is used to fill these indices in the grid with '3'. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find '1' cells and convert to object format
  one_objects = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  # Define function to create horizontal line object
  make_line = lambda obj: frozenset((THREE, (i, j)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for j in range(leftmost(obj)-1, rightmost(obj)+2))
  # Generate line objects for each '1' object
  lines = apply(make_line, one_objects)
  # Paint all line objects onto the input grid
  return paint(I, merge(lines))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' objects:** Instead of indices, we identify '1' cells as objects using `objects`.
2. **Define line object creation:** `make_line` generates a horizontal line object covering three cells horizontally, centered on the input object. 
3. **Create lines from objects:** `apply` applies `make_line` to each '1' object, generating a set of line objects. 
4. **Paint lines onto the grid:** `merge` combines all line objects, and `paint` draws these onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find indices of '1's 
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Create a function to expand an index horizontally by one in both directions
  expand_horizontal = lambda idx: {(idx[0], idx[1]-1), idx, (idx[0], idx[1]+1)}
  # Apply the expansion to each '1' index
  expanded_indices = mapply(expand_horizontal, one_indices)
  # Fill the expanded indices with '3'
  return fill(I, THREE, expanded_indices) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' indices:**  Obtain indices of '1's using `ofcolor(I, ONE)`.
2. **Horizontal expansion function:** Define  `expand_horizontal`  to include left, right, and the index itself.
3. **Expand and merge indices:** `mapply` applies `expand_horizontal` to each '1' index and merges the results.
4. **Fill with '3's:** Finally, `fill` populates the expanded indices with '3's.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find '1' objects
  one_objects = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  # Function to create a 3-wide horizontal line object centered at input object
  horizontal_line_obj = lambda obj: frozenset((THREE, (i, j)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for j in range(leftmost(obj) - 1, rightmost(obj) + 2))
  # Generate horizontal line objects for each '1' object
  three_lines = frozenset(merge(apply(horizontal_line_obj, one_objects)))
  # Paint the lines onto the input grid
  return paint(I, three_lines) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' objects:** We use `objects` to locate '1' cells, treating them as separate objects.
2. **Create horizontal line object function:**  `horizontal_line_obj` generates a horizontal line object three cells wide, centered around the given input object.
3. **Generate lines for each '1' object:** `apply` applies `horizontal_line_obj` to each '1' object, and the results are merged using `merge`.
4. **Paint the lines:** `paint` then draws all generated line objects onto the input grid.
