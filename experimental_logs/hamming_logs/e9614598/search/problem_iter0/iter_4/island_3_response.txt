## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions) of the least common color in the input grid. Then, for each of these objects, a horizontal line of a new color (3) is drawn, centered on the object and extending one cell to the left and right.

**Input 0:**

- The least common color is 1.
- There are two objects of color 1.
- For each object, a horizontal line of 3s is drawn, centered on the object.

**Input 1:**

-  The logic is the same as in Input 0.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = leastcolor(I)  # Find the least common color
  x2 = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Get all objects
  x3 = colorfilter(x2, x1)  # Filter objects to get only those with the least common color
  O = I
  for obj in x3:
    x4 = centerofmass(obj)  # Find the center of mass of the object
    i = x4[0]
    j = x4[1]
    O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j-1), (i, j), (i, j+1)})  # Draw a horizontal line of 3s
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify the target color:** `x1 = leastcolor(I)` determines the least frequent color in the grid.
2.  **Extract target objects:** `x2 = objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all distinct objects in the grid, and `x3 = colorfilter(x2, x1)` filters these objects to retain only those composed of the target color.
3.  **Iterate and draw:** The code iterates through each object in `x3`. For each object:
    -   `x4 = centerofmass(obj)` calculates the object's center of mass.
    -   `O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j-1), (i, j), (i, j+1)})` draws a horizontal line of '3's centered at the object's center of mass.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  x1 = leastcolor(I)
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] == x1:  # Check if the cell has the least common color
        for k in range(-1, 2):  # Draw a horizontal line
          if 0 <= j + k < width(I):
            O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j+k)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Initialize output:** `O = I` initializes the output grid as a copy of the input.
2.  **Find the target color:** `x1 = leastcolor(I)` determines the least common color.
3.  **Iterate and modify:** The code iterates through each cell in the grid. If a cell contains the least common color (`x1`):
    -   It draws a horizontal line of '3's, extending one cell to the left and right of the current cell.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = leastcolor(I)  # Find the least common color
  x2 = ofcolor(I, x1)  # Find indices of the least common color
  O = I
  for i, j in x2:
    O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j-1), (i, j), (i, j+1)})  # Draw horizontal lines
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify target color and locations:** `x1 = leastcolor(I)` identifies the least common color, and `x2 = ofcolor(I, x1)` finds all grid indices containing this color.
2.  **Iterate and draw:** The code iterates through the indices in `x2`. For each index:
    -   `O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j-1), (i, j), (i, j+1)})` draws a horizontal line of '3's centered at the current index.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = leastcolor(I)
  x2 = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Get all objects
  x3 = colorfilter(x2, x1)  # Filter objects by color
  x4 = mapply(centerofmass, x3)  # Get centers of all objects
  O = I
  for i, j in x4:
    if 0 <= j - 1 and j + 1 < width(I):  # Check boundaries
      O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j-1), (i, j), (i, j+1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify target objects and centers:** This version mirrors the initial steps of Version 1, determining the least common color (`x1`) and identifying the objects composed of that color (`x3`). Then, `x4 = mapply(centerofmass, x3)` directly computes the centers of mass for all target objects.
2.  **Draw lines at centers:** The code iterates through the calculated centers of mass (`x4`). For each center, it draws a horizontal line of '3's, ensuring to stay within the grid boundaries.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create an empty canvas
  x1 = leastcolor(I)
  x2 = objects(I, T, F, F)
  x3 = colorfilter(x2, x1)
  for obj in x3:
    x4 = toindices(obj)  # Get indices of the object
    for i, j in x4:
      O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})  # Paint the object on the canvas
      for k in range(-1, 2):  # Draw horizontal lines
        if 0 <= j + k < width(I):
          O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j+k)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Create a blank canvas:** `O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` initializes an empty canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the most common color from the input.
2.  **Locate target objects:** This version also identifies the least common color and extracts objects of that color, similar to previous versions.
3.  **Paint and draw:** The code iterates through the target objects (`x3`). For each object:
    -   `x4 = toindices(obj)` retrieves the indices belonging to the object.
    -   It then iterates through these indices. For each index, it paints the corresponding cell on the canvas with the object's color (`ONE`) and draws a horizontal line of '3's centered at that index.

These five versions offer diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL functions. Each version utilizes a unique combination of functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressive power of the DSL.
