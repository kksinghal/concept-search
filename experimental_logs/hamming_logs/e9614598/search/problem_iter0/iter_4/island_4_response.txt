## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying '1's in the input grid and drawing a vertical line of '3's centered on each '1'. The line extends upwards and downwards but stops one cell away from any other non-zero digit.

**Input_0 Example:**

- Two '1's are present at (4, 1) and (4, 7).
- Vertical lines of '3's are drawn centered on these '1's.
- The lines extend upwards and downwards until they are one cell away from the other '1'.

**Input_1 Example:**

- Two '1's are present at (0, 3) and (8, 3).
- Vertical lines of '3's are drawn centered on these '1's.
- The lines extend upwards and downwards but are not obstructed by any other non-zero digit.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the DSL:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)  # Get indices of all '1's
  vlines = mapply(lambda p: frozenset((i, p[1]) for i in range(max(0, p[0] - 2), min(len(I), p[0] + 3))), ones)  # Generate vertical lines of length 5 centered on '1's
  merged_lines = merge(vlines)  # Merge the lines
  filtered_lines = sfilter(merged_lines, lambda p: index(I, p) == 0)  # Keep indices where the grid value is 0
  O = fill(I, 3, filtered_lines)  # Fill the selected indices with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1's:** `ones = ofcolor(I, 1)` identifies the locations of all '1's.
2. **Generate Vertical Lines:**  `vlines = mapply(lambda p: frozenset((i, p[1]) for i in range(max(0, p[0] - 2), min(len(I), p[0] + 3))), ones)` generates vertical lines of length 5 centered on each '1', ensuring they stay within the grid boundaries.
3. **Merge Lines:** `merged_lines = merge(vlines)` combines all generated lines.
4. **Filter for Empty Cells:** `filtered_lines = sfilter(merged_lines, lambda p: index(I, p) == 0)` keeps only those indices within the lines where the original grid value is 0.
5. **Fill with '3's:** `O = fill(I, 3, filtered_lines)` fills the selected indices with '3' to draw the lines.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)  # Get indices of all '1's
  lines = apply(lambda p: connect(subtract(p, (2, 0)), add(p, (2, 0))), ones)  # Generate vertical lines of length 5 centered on each '1'
  trimmed_lines = mapply(lambda line: sfilter(line, lambda p: 0 <= p[0] < len(I) and index(I, p) == 0), lines)  # Trim lines to grid boundaries and keep only empty cells
  O = fill(I, 3, merge(trimmed_lines))  # Merge and fill trimmed lines with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1's:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Generate Vertical Lines:** `lines = apply(lambda p: connect(subtract(p, (2, 0)), add(p, (2, 0))), ones)` generates vertical lines of length 5 centered on each '1' using `connect` and vector arithmetic.
3. **Trim and Filter:** `trimmed_lines = mapply(lambda line: sfilter(line, lambda p: 0 <= p[0] < len(I) and index(I, p) == 0), lines)` trims the lines to stay within the grid boundaries and filters out any indices that don't correspond to empty cells in the original grid.
4. **Merge and Fill:** Similar to Version 1.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_ones_up = apply(lambda p: (p[0] - 2, p[1]), ofcolor(I, 1))  # Shift '1' indices upwards by 2
  shifted_ones_down = apply(lambda p: (p[0] + 2, p[1]), ofcolor(I, 1)) # Shift '1' indices downwards by 2
  vlines_up = mapply(lambda p: shoot(p, UP), shifted_ones_up)  # Generate upwards vertical lines from shifted indices
  vlines_down = mapply(lambda p: shoot(p, DOWN), shifted_ones_down) # Generate downwards vertical lines from shifted indices
  trimmed_lines = mapply(lambda line: sfilter(line, lambda p: 0 <= p[0] < len(I) and 0 <= p[1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, p) == 0), vlines_up | vlines_down)  # Trim lines to grid boundaries and keep only empty cells
  O = fill(I, 3, merge(trimmed_lines)) # Merge and fill trimmed lines with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift '1' Indices:** `shifted_ones_up` and `shifted_ones_down` calculate the positions two steps above and below each '1', respectively.
2. **Generate Upwards and Downwards Lines:** `vlines_up` and `vlines_down` generate upwards and downwards lines starting from the shifted positions using `shoot`.
3. **Trim and Filter:** Similar to Version 2, but combines both upwards and downwards lines before trimming and filtering.
4. **Merge and Fill:** Similar to Version 1.


**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  lines = apply(lambda p: sfilter(hfrontier(p), lambda q: abs(q[0]-p[0]) <= 2 and index(I,q)==0), ones) # Generate horizontal lines around each 1
  O = fill(I, 3, merge(lines))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1's:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Generate Lines:**  `lines = apply(lambda p: sfilter(hfrontier(p), lambda q: abs(q[0]-p[0]) <= 2 and index(I,q)==0), ones)` This part iterates through each '1' and generates a horizontal line using `hfrontier`. Then, it filters the line to keep only points within 2 units of the '1' vertically and where the grid value is 0.
3. **Merge and Fill:** Similar to Version 1.


**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  threes = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda p: any([I[i][p[1]] == 1 and abs(p[0]-i) <= 2 for i in range(len(I))]) and I[p[0]][p[1]]==0) # Find all positions within 2 units vertically of a '1'
  O = fill(I, 3, threes) # Fill those positions with 3s
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find potential positions:**  `threes = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda p: any([I[i][p[1]] == 1 and abs(p[0]-i) <= 2 for i in range(len(I))]) and I[p[0]][p[1]]==0)` This part iterates through all the positions on the grid and selects those positions which are within 2 units vertically of a '1' and the current grid value is 0.
2. **Fill:** Similar to Version 1.



These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
