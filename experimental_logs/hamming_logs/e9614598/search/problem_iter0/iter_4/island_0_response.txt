## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying cells with the value '1' and then drawing a horizontal and a vertical line of '3's centered on these cells. 

**Input_0:** 
- Two '1's are present. 
- For each '1', a horizontal line of three '3's and a vertical line of three '3's are drawn, both centered on the '1'.

**Input_1:**
- Two '1's are present.
-  The same logic as in Input_0 is applied, resulting in two separate horizontal and vertical lines of '3's.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_locs = ofcolor(I, 1) 
  hline = lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + i) for i in range(-1, 2)}
  vline = lambda loc: {(loc[0] + i, loc[1]) for i in range(-1, 2)}
  three_locs = mapply(hline, one_locs) | mapply(vline, one_locs)
  O = fill(I, 3, three_locs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`one_locs = ofcolor(I, 1)`**:  Identifies the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **`hline` & `vline`**: Define lambda functions to generate indices for horizontal and vertical lines of length 3, centered at a given location.
3. **`three_locs = ...`**: Applies `hline` and `vline` to each location in `one_locs` and combines the resulting indices using the union operator (`|`).
4. **`O = fill(I, 3, three_locs)`**:  Fills the input grid 'I' with the value '3' at the indices specified by `three_locs`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 1:
        for k in range(-1, 2):
          if 0 <= i + k < len(I): O = fill(O, 3, {(i + k, j)})
          if 0 <= j + k < len(row): O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j + k)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`**: Initializes the output grid 'O' as a copy of the input grid 'I'.
2. **`for` loops**:  Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
3. **`if val == 1`**: If a cell contains '1', the code proceeds to draw the lines.
4. **Inner `for` loop and `fill`**: Draws horizontal and vertical lines by iterating over the neighboring cells within a distance of 1 and filling them with '3', ensuring it stays within the grid boundaries.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  cross = lambda loc: {(loc[0] + i, loc[1]) for i in range(-1, 2)} | {(loc[0], loc[1] + j) for j in range(-1, 2)}
  three_locs =  mapply(cross, apply(centerofmass, obj))
  O = fill(I, 3, three_locs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = objects(...)`**: Identifies all objects (connected components) within the input grid 'I'. 
2. **`cross = lambda loc: ...`**: Defines a lambda function to generate indices forming a "+" shape centered at a given location.
3. **`three_locs = ...`**:  Calculates the center of mass for each object, applies the `cross` function to each center, and merges the results to obtain all indices where '3' needs to be filled.
4. **`O = fill(I, 3, three_locs)`**: Fills '3' at the determined locations in the input grid to produce the output grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_locs = ofcolor(I, 1)
  shifted_indices = mapply(lambda loc: shift(asindices(canvas(0, (3, 1))), subtract(loc, (1, 0))), one_locs) | \
                    mapply(lambda loc: shift(asindices(canvas(0, (1, 3))), subtract(loc, (0, 1))), one_locs)
  O = fill(I, 3, shifted_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`one_locs = ofcolor(I, 1)`**: Identifies indices of cells containing '1'.
2. **`shifted_indices = ...`**: Creates horizontal and vertical lines of '3's by:
    - Generating a 3x1 and a 1x3 canvas filled with '0's.
    - Shifting these canvases to align with each '1' location minus an offset to center them.
    - Merging the indices of these shifted canvases. 
3. **`O = fill(I, 3, shifted_indices)`**: Fills '3's at the determined indices to produce the output.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  lines = lambda loc: connect((loc[0]-1, loc[1]), (loc[0]+1, loc[1])) | connect((loc[0], loc[1]-1), (loc[0], loc[1]+1))
  three_locs = mapply(lines, ofcolor(I, 1)) 
  O = fill(I, 3, three_locs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`lines = lambda loc: ...`**: Defines a lambda function that generates indices for a horizontal and vertical line of length 3, centered at a given location using the `connect` function.
2. **`three_locs = ... `**:  Applies the `lines` function to each '1' location in the input grid and combines the resulting indices.
3. **`O = fill(I, 3, three_locs)`**:  Fills the input grid with '3's at the specified indices to generate the output grid.
