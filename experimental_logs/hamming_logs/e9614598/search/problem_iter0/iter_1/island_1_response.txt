## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (groups of connected '1's) and extending them downwards and rightwards by filling cells with the value '3'. 

**Input_0:** 
- Two single-cell objects are identified.
- Each object is extended downwards by one cell, creating a vertical line of '3's.
- Starting from the second cell of the downward extension, the line is extended rightwards to match the width of the original object.

**Input_1:**
- Two single-cell objects are identified.
- Each object is extended downwards by three cells, creating a vertical line of '3's.
- Starting from the second cell of the downward extension, the line is extended rightwards by two cells. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

### Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  for obj in objs:
    i, j = ulcorner(toindices(obj))
    I = fill(I, 3, {(i + 1, j)}) 
    for k in range(j, j + width(obj)):
      I = fill(I, 3, {(i + 2, k)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies objects formed by connected '1's.
2. **Iterate Objects:** The code iterates through each identified object.
3. **Downward Extension:**  `I = fill(I, 3, {(i + 1, j)})` fills the cell directly below the object's upper-left corner with '3'.
4. **Rightward Extension:** The nested loop iterates through columns from the object's left edge to its right edge, filling cells two rows below the object with '3's.

### Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 1:
        I = fill(I, 3, {(i+1, j)})
        obj_width = width(extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: (i, j) in toindices(obj)))
        for k in range(j, j + obj_width):
          I = fill(I, 3, {(i + 2, k)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Cells:** The code iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Identify Object Cells:**  If a cell contains '1', it's considered part of an object.
3. **Downward Extension:** `I = fill(I, 3, {(i+1, j)})` fills the cell below the current object cell with '3'.
4. **Object Width:** `obj_width = width(...)` calculates the width of the object the current cell belongs to.
5. **Rightward Extension:**  The nested loop iterates `obj_width` times, filling cells two rows below the object cell with '3's.

### Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  for obj in objs:
    i, j = ulcorner(toindices(obj))
    I = fill(I, 3, connect((i+1, j), (i+1, j + width(obj) - 1)))
    I = fill(I, 3, connect((i+2, j), (i+2, j + width(obj) - 1)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Similar to Version 1, the code identifies objects.
2. **Iterate Objects:** The code iterates through each identified object.
3. **Downward and Rightward Extension (Row 1):** `I = fill(I, 3, connect((i+1, j), (i+1, j + width(obj) - 1)))` draws a horizontal line of '3's one row below the object, spanning its width.
4. **Downward and Rightward Extension (Row 2):**  Similar to step 3, this line fills cells two rows below the object.

### Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    start = add(ulcorner(toindices(obj)), (1, 0))
    end = add(start, (0, width(obj) - 1))
    I = fill(I, 3, connect(start, end))
    I = fill(I, 3, connect(add(start, DOWN), add(end, DOWN)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Calculate Start and End:**  `start` is calculated as one row below the object's upper-left corner. `end` is calculated as the cell horizontally aligned with `start` but at the object's right edge.
3. **Downward and Rightward Extension (Row 1):**  `I = fill(I, 3, connect(start, end))` draws a line of '3's from `start` to `end`. 
4. **Downward and Rightward Extension (Row 2):**  This line is drawn one row below the first line by adding `DOWN` to both `start` and `end`.

### Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val == 1:
                I = fill(I, 3, {(i + 1, j)})
                try:
                    obj_width = next(width(obj) for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if (i, j) in toindices(obj))
                except StopIteration:
                    obj_width = 1 
                I = fill(I, 3, {(i + 2, k) for k in range(j, j + obj_width)})
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Cells:**  Similar to Version 2.
2. **Identify Object Cells:**  Similar to Version 2.
3. **Downward Extension:**  Similar to Version 2.
4. **Object Width (with Error Handling):** This version includes error handling using `try-except` to prevent errors if an object is not found. 
5. **Rightward Extension:** Similar to Version 2. 


These are five different approaches to achieve the desired transformation. Each version leverages different DSL functions and logic while aiming for readability and efficiency.
