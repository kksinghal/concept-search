## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the object formed by the digit '1' and then drawing a filled square with the digit '3' centered around the object. The size of the square is always 3x3.

**Input_0:**

* The object '1' is a horizontal line. 
* A 3x3 square of '3's is drawn with the center aligned to the center of the '1' object.

**Input_1:**

* The object '1' is a vertical line.
* A 3x3 square of '3's is drawn with the center aligned to the center of the '1' object. 

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  # Find indices of the object with color 1
  x1 = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Calculate the center of the object 
  x2 = center(x1) 
  # Shift the center index one unit upwards and one unit to the left 
  x3 = subtract(x2, UNITY)
  # Create a 3x3 grid filled with the digit '3' 
  x4 = canvas(THREE, THREE_BY_THREE) 
  # Shift the 3x3 grid to align with the calculated center 
  x5 = shift(asindices(x4), x3)
  # Fill the input grid with '3's at the calculated positions
  O = fill(I, THREE, x5)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Object:**  `ofcolor(I, ONE)` identifies the indices of all cells containing the digit '1'.
2. **Calculate Center:** `center(x1)` computes the center index of the object.
3. **Offset for Square:** `subtract(x2, UNITY)` adjusts the center index to position the top-left corner of the 3x3 square.
4. **Create Square:**  `canvas(THREE, THREE_BY_THREE)` generates a 3x3 grid filled with '3's.
5. **Shift Square:**  `shift(asindices(x4), x3)` moves the square to the correct position on the grid.
6. **Fill Grid:** `fill(I, THREE, x5)` paints the '3's onto the input grid at the designated locations.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  # Find the object made of '1's 
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  # Extract the object
  x2 = extract(x1, lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE)
  # Calculate the center of the object
  x3 = center(x2)
  # Create a 3x3 square as indices centered at the origin
  x4 = backdrop(asindices(canvas(ZERO, THREE_BY_THREE)))
  # Shift the square indices to the object's center
  x5 = shift(x4, x3)
  # Fill the input grid with '3's at the calculated positions 
  O = fill(I, THREE, x5)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Object:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts all objects from the grid.
2. **Extract Target Object:**  `extract(x1, lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE)` finds the specific object composed of '1's.
3. **Center Calculation:** `center(x2)`  determines the center index of the target object.
4. **Generate Square Indices:** `backdrop(asindices(canvas(ZERO, THREE_BY_THREE)))` creates a set of indices representing a 3x3 square centered at (1,1).
5. **Position Square:** `shift(x4, x3)` moves the square indices to align with the object's center.
6. **Fill Grid:** `fill(I, THREE, x5)` places the digit '3' at the determined indices on the input grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  # Find the object containing the digit '1'
  x1 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: color(o) == ONE) 
  # Determine the upper-left corner of the 3x3 square
  x2 = subtract(center(x1), UNITY) 
  # Create a 3x3 grid filled with '3's
  x3 = canvas(THREE, THREE_BY_THREE) 
  # Overlay the 3x3 grid onto the input grid, aligning it with the calculated corner
  O = paint(I, shift(asobject(x3), x2))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate Object:** `extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: color(o) == ONE)`  isolates the object formed by '1's on the grid.
2. **Find Square Corner:** `subtract(center(x1), UNITY)`  calculates the position of the 3x3 square's top-left corner relative to the object's center.
3. **Create Square Grid:** `canvas(THREE, THREE_BY_THREE)`  generates a 3x3 grid filled with the digit '3'.
4. **Overlay and Align:** `paint(I, shift(asobject(x3), x2))` paints the 3x3 square onto the input grid, starting at the pre-calculated corner position. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  # Extract objects from the input grid
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  # Find the object formed by the digit '1'
  x2 = extract(x1, lambda obj: ONE in palette(obj)) 
  # Get the bounding box indices of the object
  x3 = backdrop(x2) 
  # Calculate the center of the bounding box
  x4 = center(x3)
  # Create a 3x3 square as indices
  x5 = backdrop(asindices(canvas(ZERO, THREE_BY_THREE))) 
  # Shift the square indices to align with the bounding box center
  x6 = shift(x5, subtract(x4, center(x5))) 
  # Fill the input grid with '3's at the designated locations
  O = fill(I, THREE, x6)  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all distinct objects within the input grid.
2. **Target Object Selection:** `extract(x1, lambda obj: ONE in palette(obj))` pinpoints the object containing the digit '1'.
3. **Bounding Box Calculation:** `backdrop(x2)` determines the indices that form a bounding box around the target object.
4. **Bounding Box Center:** `center(x3)` computes the central index of the bounding box.
5. **Square Generation:**  `backdrop(asindices(canvas(ZERO, THREE_BY_THREE)))` constructs a set of indices representing a 3x3 square.
6. **Square Alignment:** `shift(x5, subtract(x4, center(x5)))`  repositions the square to the center of the object's bounding box.
7. **Grid Filling:**  `fill(I, THREE, x6)` inserts the digit '3' into the input grid at the calculated square indices. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  # Identify the object made of '1's 
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  # Select the object containing '1'
  x2 = extract(x1, lambda o: color(o) == ONE)
  # Find the top-left corner of the object
  x3 = ulcorner(x2)
  # Calculate the position of the 3x3 square's top-left corner
  x4 = subtract(x3, (ONE,ZERO))
  # Create a 3x3 grid filled with '3's
  x5 = canvas(THREE, THREE_BY_THREE)
  # Convert the 3x3 grid into an object format
  x6 = asobject(x5)
  # Shift the object to the calculated position
  x7 = shift(x6, x4)
  # Paint the shifted object onto the input grid
  O = paint(I, x7)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` locates all distinct objects within the input grid.
2. **Object Selection:** `extract(x1, lambda o: color(o) == ONE)` singles out the object composed of '1's.
3. **Corner Location:** `ulcorner(x2)` determines the index of the top-left corner of the target object.
4. **Square Corner Calculation:** `subtract(x3, (ONE,ZERO))`  calculates the position of the 3x3 square's top-left corner, offset from the object's corner. 
5. **Square Grid Creation:** `canvas(THREE, THREE_BY_THREE)` generates a 3x3 grid filled with the digit '3'.
6. **Object Conversion:** `asobject(x5)`  transforms the 3x3 grid into an object representation.
7. **Object Shifting:** `shift(x6, x4)` moves the square object to the calculated position.
8. **Grid Painting:** `paint(I, x7)` overlays the shifted square object onto the input grid.
