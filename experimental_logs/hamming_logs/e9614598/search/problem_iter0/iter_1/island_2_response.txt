## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '1' and then drawing a horizontal line of '3's that extends from the left and right edges of the object's bounding box. 

**Example:**

Input:
```
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Output:
```
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find objects with value 1
  obj1 = objects(I, True, False, True)
  obj = extract(obj1, lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE)
  # Determine the bounding box of the object
  upper = uppermost(obj)
  lower = lowermost(obj)
  left = leftmost(obj)
  right = rightmost(obj)
  # Create the horizontal line
  hline = frozenset((upper, j) for j in range(len(I[0])))
  # Fill the line within the bounding box with '3'
  O = fill(I, THREE, frozenset((i, j) for i in range(upper, lower + 1) for j in hline))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the '1' object:**  `objects(I, True, False, True)` finds all connected components of '1's in the input grid. `extract(...)` then selects the object that has the color '1'.
2. **Determine bounding box:** The `uppermost`, `lowermost`, `leftmost`, and `rightmost` functions calculate the boundaries of the '1' object.
3. **Create horizontal line:** A horizontal line of indices spanning the entire width of the grid is created using `frozenset((upper, j) for j in range(len(I[0])))`.
4. **Fill with '3's:**  The `fill` function paints the horizontal line within the bounding box of the object with '3's.


**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the bounding box of all '1' cells
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  top = uppermost(one_indices)
  bottom = lowermost(one_indices)
  # Generate horizontal lines within the bounding box
  hlines = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(top, bottom + 1) for j in range(len(I[0])))
  # Fill the lines with '3'
  O = fill(I, THREE, hlines)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' cells:**  `ofcolor(I, ONE)` identifies all indices of cells containing the value '1'.
2. **Determine bounding box:** The `uppermost` and `lowermost` functions are used to find the top and bottom rows of the bounding box containing all '1's.
3. **Generate horizontal lines:** Horizontal lines of indices are generated within the bounding box using nested loops and `frozenset`.
4. **Fill lines:** The `fill` function paints these generated horizontal lines with the value '3'.


**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Create a canvas of '3's with the same shape as the input
  canvas3 = canvas(THREE, shape(I))
  # Find the object containing '1'
  obj1 = objects(I, True, False, True)
  obj = extract(obj1, lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE)
  # Replace the '1' object with its original values from the input
  O = paint(canvas3, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create '3' canvas:** A canvas filled with '3's and having the same shape as the input is created using `canvas(THREE, shape(I))`.
2. **Identify '1' object:**  Similar to previous versions, this line identifies the object made of '1's.
3. **Paint original values:** The `paint` function is used to overwrite the '3' canvas with the original values from the '1' object in the input grid. 


**Program Version 4**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find all '1' cells and their column indices
  one_cols = frozenset(j for i, r in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(r) if v == ONE)
  # Create a grid filled with '3's for the relevant columns
  O = tuple(tuple(THREE if j in one_cols else v for j, v in enumerate(r)) for r in I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' column indices:** The code iterates through the input grid and collects the column indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **Fill columns with '3's:** The code iterates through the input grid again. If a cell's column index is present in `one_cols`, it's replaced with '3'; otherwise, it retains its original value.


**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the leftmost and rightmost '1' cell indices
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  leftmost_j = leftmost(one_indices)
  rightmost_j = rightmost(one_indices)
  # Fill columns from leftmost to rightmost with '3's
  O = tuple(tuple(THREE if leftmost_j <= j <= rightmost_j else v for j, v in enumerate(r)) for r in I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find leftmost and rightmost '1's:** This identifies the leftmost and rightmost columns containing '1's.
2. **Fill columns within range:** The code iterates through the grid and fills all columns between (and including) the leftmost and rightmost '1' columns with '3's, leaving other cells unchanged.
