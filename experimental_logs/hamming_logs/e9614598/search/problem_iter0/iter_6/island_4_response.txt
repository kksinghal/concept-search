## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place in both examples involves identifying the positions of the digit '1' and then drawing a vertical line of '3's centered on that '1', but only extending into the empty ('0') spaces of the grid.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:**  Two '1's exist.  Vertical lines of '3's are drawn centered on these '1's. The lines stop when they encounter a non-zero value.
* **Input_1:** The same logic applies. Two '1's are present, and vertical lines of '3's are drawn centered on them, extending only into the surrounding '0' spaces.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    ones = ofcolor(I, 1)  # Get indices of '1's
    vlines = mapply(lambda p: frozenset({(i, p[1]) for i in range(p[0] - 1, p[0] + 2)}), ones)  # Generate vertical lines of length 3 centered on '1's
    filtered_lines = mapply(lambda line: sfilter(line, lambda p: 0 <= p[0] < len(I) and 0 <= p[1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, p) == 0),
                           vlines)  # Filter lines to stay within grid and only include cells that were originally 0
    O = fill(I, 3, merge(filtered_lines))  # Fill the filtered line indices with '3'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = ofcolor(I, 1)`:** Identifies the indices of all cells containing the value '1'.
2. **`vlines = ...`:**  For each '1' index, it generates a set containing the indices of a three-cell vertical line centered on that '1'.
3. **`filtered_lines = ...`:** Filters each generated line to ensure it:
    * Stays within the bounds of the grid (`0 <= p[0] < len(I)` and `0 <= p[1] < len(I[0])`).
    * Only includes cells that originally contained a '0' (`index(I, p) == 0`).
4. **`O = fill(I, 3, merge(filtered_lines))`:**  Merges all the filtered lines and fills the corresponding cells in the input grid (`I`) with the value '3' to produce the output grid (`O`). 


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, 3, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda p: any(abs(p[0]-i) <= 1 and I[i][p[1]] == 1 for i in range(len(I))) and I[p[0]][p[1]] == 0))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asindices(I)`:** Creates a set of all cell indices in the input grid.
2. **`mfilter(...)`:** Filters the indices based on two conditions:
    - **`any(abs(p[0]-i) <= 1 and I[i][p[1]] == 1 for i in range(len(I)))`**: Checks if the cell is within 1 row of a cell containing '1'.
    - **`I[p[0]][p[1]] == 0`**: Checks if the cell itself contains a '0'.
3. **`fill(I, 3, ...)`:**  Fills the cells corresponding to the filtered indices with '3', creating the output grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_ones_up = apply(lambda p: (p[0] - 1, p[1]), ofcolor(I, 1))  # Shift '1' indices up by 1
  shifted_ones_down = apply(lambda p: (p[0] + 1, p[1]), ofcolor(I, 1))  # Shift '1' indices down by 1
  vlines = combine(ofcolor(I, 1), combine(shifted_ones_up, shifted_ones_down)) # Combine the sets 
  trimmed_lines = sfilter(vlines, lambda p: 0 <= p[0] < len(I) and 0 <= p[1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, p) == 0)  # Trim lines to grid boundaries and keep only empty cells
  O = fill(I, 3, trimmed_lines)  #  Fill trimmed lines with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_ones_up/down`:**  Calculates the indices one step above and below each '1'.
2. **`vlines = ...`:** Combines the sets of '1' indices, shifted up indices, and shifted down indices into a single set.
3. **`trimmed_lines = ...`:** Filters the combined set to only keep indices within the grid boundaries and corresponding to cells containing '0'.
4. **`O = fill(...)`:** Fills the cells at the filtered indices with '3' in the output grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  lines = mapply(lambda p: frozenset((i, p[1]) for i in range(max(0, p[0]-1), min(len(I), p[0]+2))), ones) # Generate lines ensuring they're within grid boundaries
  filtered_lines = mapply(lambda line: sfilter(line, lambda p: I[p[0]][p[1]] == 0), lines) # Filter to keep only empty cells
  O = fill(I, 3, merge(filtered_lines)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = ofcolor(I, 1)`:** Gets indices of '1's.
2. **`lines = ...`:** Generates lines centered on '1's, ensuring they don't go out of bounds using `max(0, p[0]-1)` and `min(len(I), p[0]+2)`.
3. **`filtered_lines = ...`:** Filters lines to keep only cells containing '0'.
4. **`O = fill(...)`:** Fills the filtered cells with '3'.

**Program Version 5:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
    def make_line(p):
        line = set()
        for i in range(p[0]-1, p[0]+2):
            if 0 <= i < len(I) and I[i][p[1]] == 0:
                line.add((i, p[1]))
        return frozenset(line)
    filtered_lines = mapply(make_line, ones)
    O = fill(I, 3, merge(filtered_lines))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = ofcolor(I, 1)`:** Gets '1' indices.
2. **`make_line(p)`:** Defines a function to generate a line segment centered at `p`, but only within the grid and on '0' cells.
3. **`filtered_lines = ...`:**  Applies `make_line` to each '1' index.
4. **`O = fill(...)`:** Fills the resulting line segments with '3'.

These five versions showcase different strategies and function combinations from the DSL to achieve the same transformation. Each version provides a unique approach to the problem, highlighting the flexibility and expressive power of the provided DSL.
