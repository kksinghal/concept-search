## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation identifies the object formed by the digit '1'. It then fills all cells directly adjacent (horizontally and vertically) to this object with the digit '3', effectively creating a border around it.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the first transformation, this one also targets the object formed by the digit '1'. It then fills the cells directly above, below, left, and right of each '1' cell with the digit '3', creating a cross-shaped pattern around each '1'. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_locs = ofcolor(I, 1)
  plus_shape = lambda loc: {(loc[0]-1, loc[1]), (loc[0]+1, loc[1]), (loc[0], loc[1]-1), (loc[0], loc[1]+1)}
  three_locs = mapply(plus_shape, one_locs)
  O = fill(I, 3, three_locs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`one_locs = ofcolor(I, 1)`:** Identifies the indices of all cells containing the digit '1'.
2. **`plus_shape = lambda loc: {(loc[0]-1, loc[1]), (loc[0]+1, loc[1]), (loc[0], loc[1]-1), (loc[0], loc[1]+1)}`:** Defines an anonymous function that, given a location, returns a set containing the indices of its four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).
3. **`three_locs = mapply(plus_shape, one_locs)`:** Applies the `plus_shape` function to each location in `one_locs` and merges the resulting sets, effectively finding all cells adjacent to the '1' cells.
4. **`O = fill(I, 3, three_locs)`:** Fills the cells at the indices in `three_locs` with the digit '3'.
5. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, True))
  three_patch = dneighbors(first(toindices(obj))) | dneighbors(last(toindices(obj)))
  O = fill(I, 3, three_patch)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = first(objects(I, True, False, True))`:** Extracts the first object (containing '1's) from the input grid.
2. **`three_patch = dneighbors(first(toindices(obj))) | dneighbors(last(toindices(obj)))`:** Gets the direct neighbors of the first and last cells of the object and combines them. This creates a border-like structure in cases where the '1' object is a line.
3. **`O = fill(I, 3, three_patch)`:** Fills the identified cells in `three_patch` with '3'.
4. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_obj = first(objects(I, True, False, True))
  shifted_objs = apply(lambda d: shift(one_obj, d), [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT])
  three_patch =  mapply(toindices, shifted_objs)
  O = fill(I, 3, three_patch)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`one_obj = first(objects(I, True, False, True))`:** Extracts the object formed by the digit '1'.
2. **`shifted_objs = apply(lambda d: shift(one_obj, d), [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT])`:** Creates four copies of the object, each shifted one cell in a different direction (up, down, left, right).
3. **`three_patch =  mapply(toindices, shifted_objs)`:** Extracts the indices from all shifted objects and merges them.
4. **`O = fill(I, 3, three_patch)`:** Fills the identified cells in `three_patch` with '3'.
5. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, True, False, True))
  three_patch = difference(outbox(obj),inbox(obj))
  O = fill(I, 3, three_patch)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = first(objects(I, True, False, True))`:** Extracts the object formed by the digit '1'.
2. **`three_patch = difference(outbox(obj),inbox(obj))`:** Calculates the difference between the outbox and inbox of the object, essentially capturing the directly adjacent cells.
3. **`O = fill(I, 3, three_patch)`:** Fills the identified cells in `three_patch` with '3'.
4. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  three_indices = mfilter(lambda loc: any(n in one_indices for n in dneighbors(loc)), asindices(I))
  O = fill(I, 3, three_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)`:** Retrieves the indices of cells containing '1'.
2. **`three_indices = mfilter(lambda loc: any(n in one_indices for n in dneighbors(loc)), asindices(I))`:**  For each cell in the grid, it checks if any of its direct neighbors are in `one_indices`, and if so, includes that cell's index in `three_indices`. 
3. **`O = fill(I, 3, three_indices)`:** Fills the cells at the identified indices in `three_indices` with '3'.
4. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.


These five programs provide distinct approaches to solving the transformation task, each using a different combination of functions from the provided DSL. They highlight the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for manipulating spatial data within grids.
