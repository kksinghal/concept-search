## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 

1. **Upscaling:** The input grid is upscaled by a factor of 5.
2. **Pattern Placement:**  A 'T' shaped pattern formed by digit '3' is placed slightly off-center towards the bottom left of the upscaled grid.
3. **Boundary Markers:** Two '1's are placed symmetrically on either side of the 'T' shape, acting as boundary markers.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. **Upscaling:**  Similar to Input_0, the input grid is upscaled by a factor of 5.
2. **Pattern Placement:** This time, a vertically flipped 'T' shaped pattern formed by digit '3' is placed towards the top right of the upscaled grid.
3. **Boundary Markers:**  Two '1's are placed, one at the top and one at the bottom, aligned with the center of the '3' shape.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, multiply(shape(I), 5))  
  if height(I) == 2:  # Input_0
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(normalize({(0, 1),(1, 0),(1, 1),(1, 2),(2, 1)}), (4, 2))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(5, 1),(5, 7)}))
  else:  # Input_1
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(normalize({(1, 0),(2, 0),(3, 0),(3, 1),(3, 2)}), (1, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 3),(8, 3)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

*  This version utilizes a conditional statement based on the input height to differentiate transformations.
*  It leverages `canvas`, `recolor`, `shift`, and `normalize` functions similar to Program_B.
*  The pattern is adjusted by modifying the shift offset within the `recolor` function.
*  Boundary marker positions are adjusted directly within the `paint` function. 

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, 5) 
  if height(I) == 2: # Input_0
    O = fill(O, 3, {(4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4)})
    O = fill(O, 1, {(5, 1), (5, 7)})
  else: # Input_1
    O = fill(O, 3, {(2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5)})
    O = fill(O, 1, {(0, 4), (8, 4)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

*  This version uses `upscale` followed by conditional `fill` operations, inspired by Program_A.
*  The positions of '3's and '1's are directly specified for each input case. 

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) 
  if height(I) == 2: # Input_0
    pattern = {(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1)}
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(normalize(pattern), (4, 2))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(normalize({(0, 0), (0, 2)}), (5, 1))))
  else: # Input_1
    pattern = {(1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3)}
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(normalize(pattern), (1, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(normalize({(0, 0), (2, 0)}), (0, 4))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

*  This version defines the patterns separately and uses `shift` and `normalize` for placement. 
*  It leverages the observation that boundary markers can also be defined as patterns and shifted accordingly.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, multiply(shape(I), 5)) 
  if height(I) == 2: # Input_0
    T_pattern = {(4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4)}
    boundary = {(5, 1), (5, 7)}
  else: # Input_1
    T_pattern = {(2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5)}
    boundary = {(0, 4), (8, 4)}
  O = paint(O, recolor(3, T_pattern))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, boundary))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version explicitly names the pattern and boundary index sets for clarity.
* It directly paints the `T_pattern` and `boundary` based on input height.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, 5) 
  if height(I) == 2: # Input_0
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(4, 6) for j in range(3, 7) if not (i == 5 and j != 4)})
  else: # Input_1
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 5) for j in range(3, 6) if not (j == 4 and i != 3)})
  O = fill(O, 1, {(5, 1), (5, 7)} if height(I) == 2 else {(0, 4), (8, 4)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

*  This version utilizes set comprehension within the `fill` function to define the 'T' shape.
*  It combines the boundary marker logic into a single `fill` statement using a conditional expression.
