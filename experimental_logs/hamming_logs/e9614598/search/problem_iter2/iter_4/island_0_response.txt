## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking a 2x2 input grid and embedding it within a larger 10x10 output grid.  The embedded grid is always centered and a specific pattern of '3's is painted around the input. Additionally, two '1's are placed symmetrically relative to the embedded input. The specific position of the '1's and the pattern of '3's change between the two examples.

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

* A 10x10 canvas filled with '0's is created.
* The input grid is centered at (4,4) within the canvas. 
* A cross-shaped pattern of '3's is painted around the center: above, below, left, and right.
* Two '1's are placed horizontally beside the cross pattern, flanking the center.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

* A 10x10 canvas filled with '0's is created.
* The input grid is centered at (4,4) within the canvas.
* A diamond-shaped pattern of '3's is painted around the center: top, bottom, left, and right diagonals.
* Two '1's are placed vertically, one above and one below the diamond pattern.

## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10,10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 4)}))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(4, 3), (4, 5)}))
  O = paint(O, shift(crop(I, ORIGIN, TWO_BY_TWO), (3, 3)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Create a 10x10 canvas of '0's.
2. Paint a cross pattern of '3's at the center.
3. Paint '1's horizontally flanking the center.
4. Crop the input grid to 2x2 and shift it to the center of the canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10,10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(4, 4), (3, 4), (5, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5)}))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(3, 4), (5, 4)}))
  O = paint(O, shift(crop(I, ORIGIN, (2, 2)), (3, 3)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Create a 10x10 canvas of '0's.
2. Paint a plus-shaped pattern of '3's at the center.
3. Paint '1's vertically flanking the center.
4. Crop the input grid and shift it to the center.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(3, 4), (5, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(2, 4), (6, 4)}))
    O = paint(O, shift(crop(I, (0, 0), (2, 2)), (3, 3)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Create a 10x10 canvas of '0's.
2. Paint a 'plus' shape without the center using '3's.
3. Paint '1's further out horizontally from the center.
4. Crop the input and shift it to the center of the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(4, 3), (4, 5), (3, 4), (5, 4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(4, 2), (4, 6)}))
    O = paint(O, shift(crop(I, ORIGIN, (2, 2)), (3, 3)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Create a 10x10 canvas of '0's.
2. Paint a 'plus' shape without the center using '3's.
3. Paint '1's further out vertically from the center.
4. Crop the input and shift it to the center of the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    center_indices = {(3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 4)}
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, center_indices))
    shifted_indices = shift(center_indices, (1, 0))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shifted_indices))
    O = paint(O, shift(crop(I, (0, 0), (2, 2)), (3, 3)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Create a 10x10 canvas of '0's.
2. Calculate indices for the center 'plus' shape and paint them with '3'.
3.  Shift the calculated indices to position '1's and paint them.
4.  Crop the input and shift it to the center.
