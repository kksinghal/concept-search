## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a 2x2 input grid and embeds it into a larger 10x10 output grid. The embedding is done by placing a scaled-up version of the input's elements onto the output grid, surrounded by specific patterns. Let's analyze each output:

**Output_0:**

- The top-left element of the input (0) is not explicitly placed in the output.
- The top-right element of the input (0) is placed at (4,5) and scaled up 1:3 using the color 3.
- The bottom-left element of the input (0) is placed at (3,4) and scaled up 1:1 using the color 1.
- The bottom-right element of the input (0) is placed at (5,6) and scaled up 1:1 using the color 1.

**Output_1:**

- The top-left element of the input (0) is placed at (3,3) and scaled up 1:1 using the color 3.
- The top-right element of the input (0) is placed at (0,3) and scaled up 1:1 using the color 1.
- The bottom-left element of the input (0) is placed at (9,3) and scaled up 1:1 using the color 1.
- The bottom-right element of the input (0) is placed at (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,5), (3,5) and scaled up 1:3 using the color 3.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to generate the desired outputs:

**Program Version 1:** (Using Shifting and Recoloring)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN))
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(index(I, (0, 1)), THREE), (4, 4)))
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(index(I, (1, 0)), ONE), (3, 3)))
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(index(I, (1, 1)), ONE), (5, 5)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** A 10x10 canvas filled with zeros is created.
2. **Element Placement & Scaling:** Each element of the input grid is extracted using `index`. It's then recolored based on its position and shifted to its location in the output grid. The scaling is achieved by using the appropriate color for a 3x3 area.

**Program Version 2:** (Using Upscaling and Cropping)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN))
  element = upscale(recolor(index(I, (0, 1)), THREE), 3)
  O = paint(O, shift(element, (1, 1)))
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(index(I, (1, 0)), ONE), (3, 3)))
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(index(I, (1, 1)), ONE), (5, 5)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** A 10x10 canvas filled with zeros is created.
2. **Upscaling & Placement:** The element at (0,1) is upscaled by a factor of 3 using `upscale` after recoloring. Then it's shifted and painted onto the canvas. Other elements are placed similarly to version 1.

**Program Version 3:** (Combining Objects)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN))
  top_right = shift(recolor(index(I, (0, 1)), THREE), (4, 4))
  bottom_left = shift(recolor(index(I, (1, 0)), ONE), (3, 3))
  bottom_right = shift(recolor(index(I, (1, 1)), ONE), (5, 5))
  combined_object = top_right | bottom_left | bottom_right
  O = paint(O, combined_object)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Creation & Combination:**  This version creates separate objects for each input element after recoloring and shifting. These objects are then combined using the union operation (`|`).
2. **Painting:** The combined object is painted onto the canvas.

**Program Version 4:** (Functional Approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  place_element = lambda pos, color: paint(canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN)), shift(recolor(index(I, pos), color), (pos[0] * 2 + 3, pos[1] * 2 + 3)))
  O = place_element((0, 1), THREE)
  O = place_element((1, 0), ONE)
  O = place_element((1, 1), ONE)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definition:** A lambda function `place_element` is defined to encapsulate the logic of placing an element at a specific position with a given color.
2. **Function Application:** The `place_element` function is called for each input element, abstracting away the repetitive code.

**Program Version 5:** (Iterative Approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN))
  for i in range(2):
    for j in range(2):
      if i == 0 and j == 0:
        continue
      color = THREE if i == 0 and j == 1 else ONE
      O = paint(O, shift(recolor(index(I, (i, j)), color), (i * 2 + 3, j * 2 + 3)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iteration & Conditional Logic:** This version iterates through each cell of the input grid.  It uses conditional statements to determine the color and placement of each element on the output grid.

These five versions showcase different approaches and DSL function combinations to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
