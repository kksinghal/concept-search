## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves creating a 10x10 grid filled with 0s and then painting a specific pattern of the digits 1 and 3 onto it. The pattern is based on the location and values of non-zero digits in the input grid. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** A 10x10 grid filled with 0s is created.
2. **Pattern Generation:** 
    - A '3' is placed in the center of the grid (5,5).
    - Two '3's are placed horizontally adjacent to the center '3'.
    - One '3' is placed directly above the center '3'.
    - Two '1's are placed on the outer edges of the horizontal '3's. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** A 10x10 grid filled with 0s is created.
2. **Pattern Generation:**
    -  Two '1's are placed vertically aligned near the left and right edges of the grid.
    -  Three '3's are placed horizontally, centered below the left '1'. 
    -  A single '3' is placed directly above the central horizontal '3'.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10,10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)}))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(5, 3), (5, 7)}))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

-  `canvas(0, (10, 10))`: Creates a 10x10 grid filled with 0s.
-  `paint(O, recolor(3, {(4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 5), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)}))`:  Paints the '3's onto the canvas at specific indices to form the pattern.
-  `paint(O, recolor(1, {(5, 3), (5, 7)}))`: Paints the '1's onto the canvas.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  center_i = 5 
  center_j = 5
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(center_i-1, center_j-1), (center_i-1, center_j), (center_i-1, center_j+1), (center_i, center_j), (center_i+1, center_j-1), (center_i+1, center_j), (center_i+1, center_j+1)}))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(center_i, center_j-2), (center_i, center_j+2)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Uses variables `center_i` and `center_j` to define the center of the pattern, making the code more adaptable.
- The rest of the logic is similar to Version 1, but utilizes the center coordinates for positioning.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  center = (5, 5)
  O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift( {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)}, (center[0]-1, center[1]-1))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(center[0], center[1]-2), (center[0], center[1]+2)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Defines the pattern relative to the origin (0, 0) and then shifts it to the desired center using the `shift` function.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  for obj in partition(I):
    if color(obj) != 0:
      center = centerofmass(obj)
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift( {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)}, (4, 4))))
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(center[0], center[1]-2), (center[0], center[1]+2)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

-  Iterates through the objects in the input grid (although it doesn't use object information in this specific case). 
-  Calculates the center of mass of each object and uses it to position part of the pattern.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(3, connect((4,4),(4,6)) | connect((6,4), (6,6)) | {(5,5)}))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(5, 3), (5, 7)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

- This version constructs the '3' pattern using the `connect` function to draw horizontal lines and then adds the central '3'. 


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing various functions and logic within the DSL. Each version offers a unique way to generate the desired output grid based on the input grid.
