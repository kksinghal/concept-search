## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves drawing a plus sign (+) shape on a 10x10 canvas and adding two '1' markers strategically based on the sum of the first row in the input grid. 

**Input 0:**
* A 2x2 grid filled with zeros.
* **Transformation:** The output is a 10x10 grid with a plus sign formed by '3' at the center. Additionally, two '1's are placed symmetrically on the vertical midline of the grid, flanking the plus sign. The placement of these '1's is determined by the input grid: as the sum of the first row in the input is zero, the '1's are placed in the 3rd column.

**Input 1:** 
* A 2x2 grid filled with zeros.
* **Transformation:** Similar to Input 0, the output is a 10x10 grid with a centered plus sign. However, this time the two '1' markers are positioned on the horizontal midline, flanking the plus sign in the 3rd row. This placement is because the sum of the first row in the input is again zero.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**
```python
def hdfgbcdefhjgeaedbjigcibaifbcffgb(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))  # Create a 10x10 canvas filled with zeros
    plus_shape = fill(canvas(0, (3, 3)), 3, {(1, 1), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1)})  # Create the plus shape
    O = paint(O, shift(asobject(plus_shape), (4, 4)))  # Paint the plus shape at the center
    one_pos = (3, 1) if sum(I[0]) == 0 else (1, 3)  # Determine '1' marker position based on input
    O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({one_pos, (8 - one_pos[0], one_pos[1])}))  # Place the '1' markers symmetrically
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with zeros.
2. Defines the plus shape using nested fills.
3. Paints the plus shape at the center of the canvas.
4. Calculates the positions of the '1' markers based on the sum of the first row of the input grid.
5. Fills the calculated positions with '1's.

**Program Version 2:**
```python
def hdfgbcdefhjgeaedbjigcibaifbcffgb(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = fill(O, 3, {(4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (3, 4), (5, 4)})  # Directly fill the plus shape
    marker_row = 3 if sum(I[0]) == 0 else 1 
    O = fill(O, 1, {(marker_row, 1), (8 - marker_row, 1)})  # Calculate marker row based on input
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with zeros.
2. Directly fills the positions forming the plus sign with '3'.
3. Determines the row for the '1' markers based on the input.
4. Fills the calculated positions in the determined row with '1's.

**Program Version 3:**
```python
def hdfgbcdefhjgeaedbjigcibaifbcffgb(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  center = (4, 4)
  vert_line = fill(canvas(0, (3, 1)), 3, {(1, 0)})  # Create vertical line
  horiz_line = hmirror(vert_line)  # Create horizontal line using mirroring
  plus_shape = shift(combine(vert_line, horiz_line), center) # Combine and shift to center
  O = paint(O, asobject(plus_shape))
  one_pos = (3, 1) if sum(I[0]) == 0 else (1, 3)  # Determine '1' marker position
  O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({one_pos, (9-one_pos[0], one_pos[1])}))  # Place '1' markers symmetrically
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. Creates a 10x10 canvas.
2. Creates the vertical and horizontal lines of the plus sign separately.
3. Combines them and shifts the resulting shape to the center.
4. Determines the marker position based on the input.
5. Places the markers symmetrically around the plus sign. 

**Program Version 4:**
```python
def hdfgbcdefhjgeaedbjigcibaifbcffgb(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    for i in range(3, 6):
        O = fill(O, 3, {(4, i)})  # Draw vertical line of the plus sign
    for j in range(3, 6):
        O = fill(O, 3, {(j, 4)})  # Draw horizontal line of the plus sign
    marker_row, marker_col = (3, 1) if sum(I[0]) == 0 else (1, 3) # Determine marker position
    O = fill(O, 1, {(marker_row, marker_col), (8 - marker_row, marker_col)}) # Place markers
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. Creates a 10x10 canvas.
2. Uses loops to draw the vertical and horizontal lines of the plus sign.
3. Determines both the row and column for the '1' markers.
4. Places the markers symmetrically.

**Program Version 5:**
```python
def hdfgbcdefhjgeaedbjigcibaifbcffgb(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    plus_indices = connect((4, 3), (4, 5)) | connect((3, 4), (5, 4))  # Create plus shape using connect
    O = fill(O, 3, plus_indices)
    marker_pos = (3, 1) if sum(I[0]) == 0 else (1, 3) # Determine marker position
    O = fill(O, 1, {marker_pos, (8 - marker_pos[0], marker_pos[1])})  # Place markers symmetrically
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**
1. Creates a 10x10 canvas.
2. Utilizes the `connect` function to define the indices for both lines of the plus sign and combines them.
3. Fills the calculated indices with '3' to draw the plus sign.
4. Determines the marker position based on the input.
5. Places the markers symmetrically.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation using various functions and logic within the given DSL. They highlight the flexibility and power of DSLs for expressing spatial transformations.
