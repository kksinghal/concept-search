## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves two key steps:

1. **Upscaling:** The input grid is upscaled by a factor of 5. This means each cell in the input grid is replaced by a 5x5 block of cells with the same value in the output grid. 

2. **Object Placement:** Specific objects are placed at fixed locations in the upscaled grid. 

    * **Output_0:** A horizontal line of '3's is placed in the middle row, with single '1's flanking it.
    * **Output_1:** A vertical line of '3's is placed in the middle column, with single '1's at the top and bottom of the same column.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = upscale(I, 5)
    O = fill(O, 3, {(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8)})
    O = fill(O, 1, {(2, 3), (2, 9)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscale:** `upscale(I, 5)` upscales the input grid `I` by a factor of 5.
2. **Horizontal Line:** `fill(O, 3, {(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8)})` fills a horizontal line of '3's in the middle row of the upscaled grid `O`.
3. **Flanking '1's:** `fill(O, 1, {(2, 3), (2, 9)})` places '1's on either side of the horizontal line of '3's.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(2, 3), (2, 9)}))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** `canvas(0, (10, 10))` creates a 10x10 grid `O` filled with '0's.
2. **Horizontal Line:** `paint(O, recolor(3, {(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8)}))` paints a horizontal line of '3's onto the canvas at the specified indices.
3. **Flanking '1's:** `paint(O, recolor(1, {(2, 3), (2, 9)}))` paints '1's on either side of the horizontal line. 

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = upscale(I, 5)
    center_row = {(2, j) for j in range(10)}
    O = fill(O, 3, center_row - {(2, 3), (2, 9)})
    O = fill(O, 1, {(2, 3), (2, 9)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:** `upscale(I, 5)` upscales the input grid `I`.
2. **Center Row Calculation:** `center_row = {(2, j) for j in range(10)}` calculates the indices of the middle row.
3. **Horizontal Line:** `fill(O, 3, center_row - {(2, 3), (2, 9)})` fills the center row with '3's, excluding the indices for the flanking '1's. 
4. **Flanking '1's:** `fill(O, 1, {(2, 3), (2, 9)})` places '1's at the specified indices.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = upscale(I, 5)
    horizontal_line = connect((2, 4), (2, 8))
    O = fill(O, 3, horizontal_line)
    O = fill(O, 1, {(2, 3), (2, 9)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:**  `upscale(I, 5)` upscales the input grid.
2. **Line Creation:** `horizontal_line = connect((2, 4), (2, 8))` creates a set of indices representing a horizontal line segment. 
3. **Fill Line:** `fill(O, 3, horizontal_line)` fills the horizontal line segment with '3's.
4. **Flanking '1's:** `fill(O, 1, {(2, 3), (2, 9)})` places the '1's.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    for j in range(4, 9):
        O = fill(O, 3, {(2, j)})
    O = fill(O, 1, {(2, 3), (2, 9)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:**  `O = canvas(0, (10, 10))` creates a 10x10 canvas.
2. **Iterative Filling:**  The `for` loop iterates through the columns of the middle row and fills each cell with a '3'.
3. **Flanking '1's:** `fill(O, 1, {(2, 3), (2, 9)})` adds the '1's to the sides.

**Note:** These programs are designed to work for both Output_0 and Output_1. You can modify the indices used in the `fill` functions to control the position and orientation of the '3's and '1's.
