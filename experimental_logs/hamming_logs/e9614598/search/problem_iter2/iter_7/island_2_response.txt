## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve drawing a plus sign ('+') composed of the digit '3' on a 10x10 canvas and adding two '1' digits symmetrically based on the input grid. 

* **Input_0:** The sum of the first row is 0. This results in a horizontally oriented '+' sign with the '1' digits placed symmetrically to the left and right of the plus sign's center.
* **Input_1:** The sum of the first row is not 0. This results in a vertically oriented '+' sign with the '1' digits placed symmetrically above and below the plus sign's center.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject({(3, (1, 1)), (3, (0, 1)), (3, (1, 0)), (3, (1, 2)), (3, (2, 1))}), (3, 3)))
  if sum(I[0]) == 0:
    O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({(4, 1), (4, 7)}))
  else:
    O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({(1, 4), (7, 4)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0's.
2. **Plus Sign:** Directly defines the plus shape and paints it onto the canvas, centered at (4,4).
3. **Symmetric '1's:**
    * If the sum of the first row of the input is 0, places '1's horizontally symmetric to the plus sign's center.
    * Otherwise, places '1's vertically symmetric to the plus sign's center. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  plus_shape = frozenset({(3, (4, 4)), (3, (3, 4)), (3, (5, 4)), (3, (4, 3)), (3, (4, 5))})
  O = paint(O, plus_shape)
  for i in range(2):
    O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({
      (1 if sum(I[0]) else 4, 4 - 3 * (1 - 2 * i)), 
      (7 if sum(I[0]) else 4, 4 + 3 * (1 - 2 * i))
    }))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas & Plus:** Similar to version 1, creates the canvas and paints the plus sign.
2. **Symmetric '1's (Loop):**  Uses a loop to place '1's. The loop iterates twice, placing a pair of '1's in each iteration. The positions are determined based on the input's first row sum, ensuring symmetry.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject({(3, (1, 1)), (3, (0, 1)), (3, (2, 1)), (3, (1, 0)), (3, (1, 2))}), (3, 3)))
  direction = (0, 3) if sum(I[0]) == 0 else (3, 0)
  O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({add((4, 4), direction), subtract((4, 4), direction)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas & Plus:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Direction & '1's:** Determines the direction for placing '1's based on the input. Then, calculates the symmetric positions by adding and subtracting the direction vector from the plus sign's center.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  center = (4, 4)
  O = paint(O, frozenset((3, add(center, d)) for d in {(0, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)}))
  offset = (0, 3) if sum(I[0]) == 0 else (3, 0)
  O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({add(center, offset), subtract(center, offset)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas & Center:** Creates the canvas and defines the center point.
2. **Plus Sign (Dynamic):**  Constructs the plus sign dynamically by adding pre-defined offset vectors to the center point.
3. **Offset & '1's:** Similar to version 3, calculates symmetric positions for '1's based on input and the offset vector.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  base_shape = {(3, (1, 1)), (3, (0, 1)), (3, (1, 0)), (3, (1, 2)), (3, (2, 1))} 
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(base_shape), (3, 3)))
  orientation = (1, 0) if sum(I[0]) == 0 else (0, 1)
  one_positions = {(4 - 3 * orientation[1], 4 + 3 * orientation[0]), (4 + 3 * orientation[1], 4 - 3 * orientation[0])}
  O = fill(O, 1, frozenset(one_positions))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas, Plus & Orientation:** Creates the canvas, paints the plus sign, and determines the orientation based on the input. 
2. **Dynamic '1' Positioning:**  Calculates the positions for '1's dynamically using the determined orientation vector and mathematical operations. This ensures correct placement based on horizontal or vertical orientation.

These are just five examples, and many other possible solutions exist within the DSL. The key is to analyze the transformation logic and leverage the available functions to achieve the desired result.
