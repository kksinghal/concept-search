## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

1. **Upscaling:** The input grid is upscaled by a factor of 5.
2. **'T' Pattern:** A 'T' shaped pattern is drawn on the upscaled grid using color 3. 
3. **Dots:** Two dots of color 1 are placed symmetrically on either side of the 'T' pattern.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

1. **Upscaling:** The input grid is upscaled by a factor of 5.
2. **Vertical 'T' Pattern:** A vertically flipped 'T' shaped pattern is drawn on the upscaled grid using color 3.
3. **Dots:** Two dots of color 1 are placed symmetrically on the top and bottom borders of the upscaled grid, aligned with the central column of the 'T' pattern.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, 5)
  if height(I) == 2:  # Input_0
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(4, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (5, 4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(5, 1), (5, 7)}))
  else:  # Input_1
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 3), (8, 3)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version combines elements from Program_A and Program_B to achieve the desired output. 
- It uses the `upscale` function from Program_A for scaling.
- The 'T' pattern is drawn directly using `recolor` and `paint` functions, similar to Program_B, but with adjusted coordinates to match the required output.
- Dot placement also uses `recolor` and `paint`, borrowing from both previous programs and adjusting coordinates accordingly.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, multiply(shape(I), 5))
  T_pattern = recolor(3, {(1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2)})
  if height(I) == 2:  # Input_0
    O = paint(O, shift(T_pattern, (4, 2)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(5, 1), (5, 7)}))
  else:  # Input_1
    O = paint(O, shift(rot90(T_pattern), (3, 3)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 3), (8, 3)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version improves upon Program_B by abstracting the 'T' pattern.
- It defines the 'T' pattern separately and reuses it for both inputs, using `rot90` to achieve the vertical flip for Input_1.
-  The `canvas`, `shift`, and `recolor` functions are used similarly to Program_B, but with modified coordinates to match the output.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) 
  T_pattern = recolor(3, {(1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2)})
  if height(I) == 2: # Input_0
    O = paint(O, shift(T_pattern, (4, 2)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(5, 1), (5, 7)})) 
  else: # Input_1
    T_pattern = rot90(T_pattern)
    O = paint(O, shift(T_pattern, (3, 3)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 3), (8, 3)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Similar to Version 2, this version also defines the 'T' pattern separately.
-  It explicitly calls `rot90` within the `else` block for Input_1 to rotate the 'T' pattern before painting it. 
- The rest of the code remains similar to Version 2.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, 5) 
  if height(I) == 2: # Input_0
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(normalize({(1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2)}), (4, 2))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(5, 1), (5, 7)})) 
  else: # Input_1
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(normalize({(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1)}), (3, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 3), (8, 3)})) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version combines elements from Program_A and Program_B, but avoids explicitly defining the 'T' pattern.
-  It uses `upscale` from Program_A and directly defines the shifted and normalized coordinates of the 'T' pattern within the `recolor` function, similar to Program_B. 
-  The dot placement remains the same as in Version 2.


**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  T_pattern = {(1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2)} 
  if height(I) == 2: # Input_0
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(T_pattern, (4, 2))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(5, 1), (5, 7)})) 
  else: # Input_1
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(rot90(recolor(1, T_pattern)), (3, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 3), (8, 3)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version defines the 'T' pattern as a set of coordinates and uses nested functions to apply transformations.
- It recolors the 'T' pattern to a temporary color (1 in this case) before rotating it with `rot90`, and then recolors it back to color 3 before painting.
-  This approach highlights the flexibility of DSL in chaining functions and avoids redundant coordinate definitions.
