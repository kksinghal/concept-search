## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently applies these rules:

1. **Central Plus:**  A plus-shaped object formed by the digit '3' is placed at the center of a 10x10 canvas. 

2. **Symmetric '1' Markers:** Two '1' markers are positioned symmetrically on the canvas. Their placement depends on the sum of the digits in the first row of the input grid:
   - If the sum is 0, the markers are placed at (3,1) and its reflection across the plus shape's vertical axis, (8,1).
   - If the sum is not 0, the markers are placed at (1,3) and its reflection across the plus shape's horizontal axis, (1,8). 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the code, each with a different approach:

**Version 1: Building the Plus Shape with `fill`:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))  # Canvas of zeros
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(fill(canvas(0, (3, 3)), 3, {(1, 1), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1)})), (4, 4)))  # Plus shape at the center
  one_pos = (3, 1) if sum(I[0]) == 0 else (1, 3)  # Determine '1' position
  O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({one_pos, (9 - one_pos[0], one_pos[1])}))  # Place '1' markers
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with zeros.
2. Creates a 3x3 grid of zeros and fills the plus shape using `fill` and '3' as the value.
3. Converts it to an object, shifts it to the center (4,4), and paints it on the canvas.
4. Determines the '1' marker position based on the input grid.
5. Uses `fill` to place the '1' markers symmetrically.


**Version 2:  Constructing the Plus with Individual Cells:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = fill(O, 3, frozenset({(4, 4), (3, 4), (5, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5)})) # Place each part of the plus individually
  one_pos = (3, 1) if sum(I[0]) == 0 else (1, 3)  
  O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({one_pos, (9 - one_pos[0], one_pos[1])}))  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a 10x10 canvas of zeros.
2. Directly fills in the cells forming the plus shape with '3' using their indices and `fill`.
3. Determines the '1' marker position based on the input grid.
4. Places the '1' markers symmetrically using `fill`.

**Version 3: Leveraging Symmetry with `hmirror` and `vconcat`:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 5))  # Create half the canvas vertically
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(fill(canvas(0, (3, 1)), 3, {(1, 0)})), (4, 2))) # Create and position half the plus
  O = vconcat(O, hmirror(O)) # Mirror the top half to create the full plus
  one_pos = (3, 1) if sum(I[0]) == 0 else (1, 3)  
  O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({one_pos, (9 - one_pos[0], one_pos[1])})) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates the top half of the canvas (10x5).
2. Creates and positions half of the plus shape (vertical line) using `fill`, converts to an object, shifts, and paints it. 
3. Uses `hmirror` to mirror the top half and `vconcat` to combine, creating the full plus.
4. Determines '1' marker position and places them symmetrically.

**Version 4:  Rotating and Combining Lines with `rot90`:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) 
  line = fill(canvas(0, (3, 1)), 3, {(1, 0)})  # Create a 3x1 line
  plus_shape = combine(line, shift(rot90(line), (1, 1))) # Rotate and combine to form plus
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(plus_shape), (3, 3))) # Paint at center
  one_pos = (3, 1) if sum(I[0]) == 0 else (1, 3) 
  O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({one_pos, (9 - one_pos[0], one_pos[1])}))  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a 10x10 canvas.
2. Creates a 3x1 horizontal line filled with '3'. 
3. Rotates the line 90 degrees using `rot90`, shifts it, and combines it with the original line to form the plus shape. 
4. Converts the plus shape to an object, shifts it to the center, and paints it on the canvas. 
5. Determines the '1' marker positions based on the input and places them.

**Version 5: Combining Horizontal and Vertical Lines Directly:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = fill(O, 3, frozenset({(4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5)}))  # Vertical line of plus
  O = fill(O, 3, frozenset({(3, 4), (5, 4)}))  # Horizontal line of plus
  one_pos = (3, 1) if sum(I[0]) == 0 else (1, 3)
  O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({one_pos, (9 - one_pos[0], one_pos[1])})) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a 10x10 canvas of zeros.
2. Draws the vertical line of the plus shape by filling specific cells with '3'.
3. Draws the horizontal line of the plus shape similarly. 
4. Determines the '1' marker position based on the input grid.
5. Places the '1' markers symmetrically.
