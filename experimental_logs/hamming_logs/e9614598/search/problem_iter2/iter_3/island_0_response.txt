## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on identifying non-background objects and drawing a specific shape with specific colors around their center of mass.

**Input_0 & Output_0:**

* A 1x1 'cross' shape formed by the digit '1' is drawn centered on the input object.
* A larger 'diamond' shape formed by the digit '3' surrounds the cross, also centered on the input object.

**Input_1 & Output_1:**

* The same transformation is applied as in Input_0 & Output_0, demonstrating the program's ability to handle objects in different locations.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using functions from the DSL and inspired by the provided programs:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  for obj in partition(I):
    if color(obj) != 0:
      center = centerofmass(obj)
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift({(0, 0), (1, -1), (1, 1), (2, 0)}, center)))
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift({(0, -2), (0, 2)}, center)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0' using `canvas(0, (10, 10))`.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Iterates through each object in the input grid identified by `partition(I)`.
3. **Filter Background:** Ignores background objects (`color(obj) != 0`).
4. **Calculate Center:**  Finds the center of mass of the object using `centerofmass(obj)`.
5. **Draw Diamond:** Draws a 'diamond' shape using '3' centered at the object's center of mass using `recolor`, `shift`, and `paint`.
6. **Draw Cross:** Draws a 'cross' shape using '1' centered at the object's center of mass using `recolor`, `shift`, and `paint`.
7. **Return Output:** Returns the transformed grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
    center = centerofmass(obj)
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift( {(i, j) for i in range(-2, 3) for j in range(-2, 3) if abs(i) + abs(j) <= 2}, center)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift({(0,-2),(0,2),(-2,0),(2,0)}, center)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates a canvas with the same size as the input grid `I`, filled with '0'.
2. **Find Objects:** Identifies non-background objects using `objects(I, False, False, True)`.
3. **Iterate and Draw:** Similar to version 1, iterates through objects, calculates their center of mass, and draws the 'diamond' and 'cross' shapes using set comprehension for more concise code.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(box(shift(obj, (4,4))), (-1,-1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift({(-2,0),(2,0),(0,-2),(0,2)}, centerofmass(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0'.
2. **Partition Objects:**  Uses `fgpartition(I)` to identify non-background objects.
3. **Draw Shapes:** Utilizes the `box` function to draw the outline of a shifted object as the 'diamond' shape and directly shifts the 'cross' shape using set notation.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
    c = centerofmass(obj)
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(c[0]-2, c[1]), (c[0]+2, c[1]), (c[0], c[1]-2), (c[0], c[1]+2)}))
    O = underpaint(O, recolor(3, shift({(0, 0), (1, -1), (1, 1), (2, 0), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (-2, 0)}, c)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates a canvas with the same size as the input, filled with '0'.
2. **Find Objects:** Identifies non-background objects using `objects`.
3. **Draw Cross First:** This version draws the 'cross' shape first.
4. **Underpaint Diamond:**  Uses `underpaint` to draw the 'diamond' shape, ensuring it only fills in the background '0' and not overwriting the previously drawn 'cross'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  for obj in partition(I):
    if color(obj) != 0:
      c = centerofmass(obj)
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(c[0], c[1] - 2), (c[0], c[1] + 2)}))
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(c[0]-1, c[1]-1), (c[0]-1, c[1]+1), (c[0], c[1]), (c[0]+1, c[1]-1), (c[0]+1, c[1]+1)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0'.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Iterates through all objects in the input grid.
3. **Draw Shapes:** Draws the 'cross' and 'diamond' shapes by explicitly defining their coordinates relative to the object's center of mass, offering a more direct and potentially more efficient approach.

These five versions showcase diverse ways to achieve the target transformation using the provided DSL functions. Each version employs different function combinations and logic, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
