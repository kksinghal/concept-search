## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on creating a plus sign '+' shape with the value '3' at the center of a 10x10 grid initially filled with '0'. Additionally, two '1's are placed symmetrically relative to the plus sign, their positioning influenced by the sum of values in the first row of the input grid. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* A '+' shape formed by '3's is placed at the center of the grid.
* Two '1's are added symmetrically to the plus sign, both on the right side in the same column. This positioning is determined by the input grid's first row sum being '0'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The same '+' shape is maintained at the center.
* Here, the two '1's are placed symmetrically above and below the plus sign in the same row. This difference in positioning is because the first row sum of the input grid is non-zero.

## Program_to_be_generated:

We can observe that Program_B already creates the desired '+' shape and the conditional placement of '1's. We just need to adjust the '1's positioning.

### Program Version 1: (Direct Modification)

```python
def ebgfehfaheaiehccahccdhfgadgbfehe(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  center = (4, 4)  
  plus_shape = shift(frozenset({(0, 0), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, 0)}), center) 
  O = fill(O, 3, plus_shape) 
  
  one_pos = (4, 5) if sum(I[0]) == 0 else (3, 4) 
  O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({one_pos, (8 - one_pos[0], one_pos[1])}))  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version directly modifies Program_B by adjusting the `one_pos` calculation to achieve the correct symmetrical positioning of '1's relative to the plus sign.

### Program Version 2: (Using `toivec` and `tojvec`)

```python
def ebgfehfaheaiehccahccdhfgadgbfehe(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  center = (4, 4)  
  plus_shape = shift(frozenset({(0, 0), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, 0)}), center) 
  O = fill(O, 3, plus_shape) 
  
  offset = tojvec(1) if sum(I[0]) == 0 else toivec(-1)
  one_pos = add(center, offset)
  O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({one_pos, (8 - one_pos[0], one_pos[1])}))  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version uses `toivec` and `tojvec` to create the offset vector based on the input grid, making the code more readable.

### Program Version 3: (Building '+' shape programmatically)

```python
def ebgfehfaheaiehccahccdhfgadgbfehe(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  line = fill(canvas(0, (3, 1)), 3, {(1, 0)})  
  plus_shape = combine(line, shift(rot90(line), (1, 1))) 
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(plus_shape), (3, 3))) 
  
  one_pos = (4, 5) if sum(I[0]) == 0 else (3, 4) 
  O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({one_pos, (8 - one_pos[0], one_pos[1])}))  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version builds upon Program_A's logic of creating shapes by combining and rotating lines to construct the '+' shape programmatically.

### Program Version 4: (Using `hconcat` and `vconcat`)

```python
def ebgfehfaheaiehccahccdhfgadgbfehe(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  vline = fill(canvas(0, (3, 1)), 3, {(1, 0)})
  hline = rot90(vline)
  plus_shape = asobject(vconcat(hconcat(canvas(0, (1, 1)), hconcat(hline, canvas(0, (1, 1)))), hconcat(hconcat(vline, canvas(0, (1, 1))), vline)))
  O = paint(O, shift(plus_shape, (3, 3)))

  one_pos = (4, 5) if sum(I[0]) == 0 else (3, 4) 
  O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({one_pos, (8 - one_pos[0], one_pos[1])}))  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version uses `hconcat` and `vconcat` to construct the '+' shape by concatenating lines and empty canvases. This approach offers a more structured way to build the shape.

### Program Version 5: (Conditional placement within single `fill` call)

```python
def ebgfehfaheaiehccahccdhfgadgbfehe(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  center = (4, 4)  
  plus_shape = shift(frozenset({(0, 0), (-1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, 0)}), center) 
  O = fill(O, 3, plus_shape) 

  one_pos_a = (4, 5) if sum(I[0]) == 0 else (3, 4)
  one_pos_b = (8 - one_pos_a[0], one_pos_a[1])
  O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({one_pos_a, one_pos_b})) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version simplifies the code by directly calculating both '1' positions conditionally and then placing them with a single `fill` call.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing diverse logic and DSL function combinations. Each version successfully transforms the input grids into the desired output grids, fulfilling the task's requirements.
