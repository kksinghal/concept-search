## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves painting a plus-shaped pattern with the color of the top-left input cell and optionally adding two additional cells with the color of the bottom-left and top-right input cells.

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

1. A plus shape is drawn at the center of the canvas using the color '3' (value of I[0][0]).

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

1. A plus shape is drawn at the center-top of the canvas using the color '3' (value of I[0][0]).
2. The cell at (0, 3) is colored with the value of I[1][0], which is '1'.
3. The cell at (8, 0) is colored with the value of I[0][1], which is '1'.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN))
  center_color = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = paint(O, recolor(center_color, {(4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (3, 4), (5, 4)}))
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(index(I, (1, 0)), {(0, 0)}), (-4, 3)))
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(index(I, (0, 1)), {(0, 0)}), (4, -3)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Create a 10x10 canvas filled with zeros.
2. **Center Color:** Extract the color of the top-left input cell.
3. **Plus Shape:** Paint a plus shape at the center using the extracted color.
4. **Bottom-Left Cell:** Extract the color of the bottom-left input cell and paint it at the appropriate location relative to the plus shape.
5. **Top-Right Cell:** Extract the color of the top-right input cell and paint it at the appropriate location relative to the plus shape.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN))
  plus_shape = {(4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (3, 4), (5, 4)}
  O = paint(O, recolor(index(I, (0, 0)), plus_shape))
  for i in range(2):
    for j in range(2):
      if i == j: continue
      O = paint(O, shift(recolor(index(I, (i, j)), {(0, 0)}), (4 * (1 - 2 * i), 3 * (1 - 2 * j))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas & Shape Definition:** Define the canvas and the plus shape directly using coordinates.
2. **Paint Plus:** Paint the plus shape with the color of the top-left input cell.
3. **Paint Corners:** Iterate through the remaining input cells and paint them relative to the center of the plus shape based on their position in the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN))
  O = paint(O, recolor(index(I, (0, 0)), {(i + 3, j + 4) for i in range(3) for j in range(3) if not (i == 1 and j == 1)}))
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(index(I, (1, 0)), {(0, 0)}), (-4, 3)))
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(index(I, (0, 1)), {(0, 0)}), (4, -3)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas & Shape Definition:** Define the canvas and the plus shape using set comprehension, excluding the center cell.
2. **Paint Plus:** Paint the plus shape with the color of the top-left input cell.
3. **Paint Corners:** Similar to version 1, paint the remaining cells based on their positions.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN))
  center = (4, 4)
  O = paint(O, recolor(index(I, (0, 0)), {(center[0] + i - 1, center[1] + j - 1) for i in range(3) for j in range(3) if not (i == 1 and j == 1)}))
  for i in range(2):
    for j in range(2):
      if i == j: continue
      O = paint(O, shift(recolor(index(I, (i, j)), {(0, 0)}), (center[0] - 4 + 4 * i, center[1] - 3 + 6 * j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas & Center Definition:** Define the canvas and the center point of the plus shape.
2. **Paint Plus:** Paint the plus shape relative to the center point.
3. **Paint Corners:** Similar to version 2, iterate and paint the corner cells based on their positions relative to the center.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN))
  O = paint(O, recolor(index(I, (0, 0)), {(3, 4), (5, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5)}))
  O = paint(O, recolor(index(I, (0, 0)), {(4, 4)}))
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(index(I, (1, 0)), {(0, 0)}), (-4, 3)))
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(index(I, (0, 1)), {(0, 0)}), (4, -3)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Create a 10x10 canvas filled with zeros.
2. **Plus Shape (Partial):** Paint the arms of the plus shape.
3. **Plus Shape (Center):** Paint the center of the plus shape.
4. **Paint Corners:** Similar to previous versions, paint the remaining cells based on their positions.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL. Each version utilizes distinct logic and DSL function combinations, ensuring diversity in the solutions.
