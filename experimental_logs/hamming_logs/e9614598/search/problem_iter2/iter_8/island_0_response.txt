## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation centers around a plus-shaped object (the 'core') made of the digit '3', always placed within a 10x10 grid. 

* **Input_0:** The input is a 2x2 grid filled with '0'. 
    * **Output_0:** The output places the '3' core horizontally centered on the 5th row and spanning from the 4th to 6th column. Additionally, two '1's are added, flanking the core on the same row, at the 2nd and 8th columns. 

* **Input_1:** The input is identical to Input_0.
    * **Output_1:** The output places the '3' core vertically centered on the 4th column, spanning from the 4th to 6th row.  Like Output_0, two '1's are added, this time flanking the core vertically at the 1st and 9th rows of the same column.

**Key Observations:**

* The transformation disregards the input grid's content.
* The position of the '1's depends on the orientation of the '3' core (horizontal or vertical).
* The output grid is always 10x10 and filled with '0's by default.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10,10)) # Create a 10x10 canvas of '0's.
  O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(3,4),(4,3),(4,4),(4,5),(5,4)}))  # Paint the '3' core horizontally.
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(4,1),(4,8)})) # Add the flanking '1's horizontally.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `canvas(0, (10,10))`: Creates the base 10x10 grid filled with '0's.
2.  `paint(O, recolor(3, {(3,4),(4,3),(4,4),(4,5),(5,4)}))`: Draws the horizontal '3' core at the specified indices.
3.  `paint(O, recolor(1, {(4,1),(4,8)}))`: Adds the two '1's flanking the core horizontally.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10,10)) # Create a 10x10 canvas of '0's.
  core = recolor(3, {(0,1),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(2,1)}) # Create the '3' core object.
  O = paint(O, shift(core, (3, 3))) # Place the core at the center.
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(3,1),(3,8)})) # Add the flanking '1's horizontally.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `canvas(0, (10,10))`: Creates the 10x10 grid filled with '0's.
2. `core = recolor(3, {(0,1),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2),(2,1)})`: Defines the '3' core object in its normalized position.
3. `paint(O, shift(core, (3, 3)))`:  Shifts the core to the center of the canvas and paints it.
4.  `paint(O, recolor(1, {(3,1),(3,8)}))`: Adds the two '1's flanking the core horizontally. 

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10,10)) # Create a 10x10 canvas of '0's.
  O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(3,3),(4,2),(4,3),(4,4),(5,3)}))  # Paint the '3' core vertically.
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1,3),(8,3)})) # Add the flanking '1's vertically.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `canvas(0, (10,10))`: Creates the base 10x10 grid filled with '0's.
2.  `paint(O, recolor(3, {(3,3),(4,2),(4,3),(4,4),(5,3)}))`: Draws the vertical '3' core at the specified indices.
3.  `paint(O, recolor(1, {(1,3),(8,3)}))`: Adds the two '1's flanking the core vertically.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10,10)) # Create a 10x10 canvas of '0's.
  core = recolor(3, {(1,0),(0,1),(1,1),(2,1),(1,2)}) # Create the '3' core object.
  O = paint(O, shift(core, (3, 2))) # Place the core at the center.
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1,3),(8,3)})) # Add the flanking '1's vertically.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `canvas(0, (10,10))`: Creates the 10x10 grid filled with '0's.
2. `core = recolor(3, {(1,0),(0,1),(1,1),(2,1),(1,2)})`: Defines the '3' core object in its normalized position.
3. `paint(O, shift(core, (3, 2)))`:  Shifts the core to the center of the canvas and paints it.
4.  `paint(O, recolor(1, {(1,3),(8,3)}))`: Adds the two '1's flanking the core vertically.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10,10)) # Create a 10x10 canvas of '0's.
  core = recolor(3, {(1,1),(1,0),(0,1),(1,2),(2,1)}) # Create the '3' core object.
  orientation = (3,3) if index(I,(0,0)) == 0 else (3,2)
  O = paint(O, shift(core, orientation)) # Place the core at the center based on orientation.
  flanking_pos = {(3,1),(3,8)} if orientation[1]==3 else {(1,3),(8,3)}
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, flanking_pos)) # Add the flanking '1's based on orientation.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `canvas(0, (10,10))`: Creates the 10x10 grid filled with '0's.
2. `core = recolor(3, {(1,1),(1,0),(0,1),(1,2),(2,1)})`: Defines the '3' core object in its normalized position.
3. `orientation = (3,3) if index(I,(0,0)) == 0 else (3,2)`: Determine the orientation of the core based on the input grid (horizontal if the top-left corner is 0, vertical otherwise).
4. `paint(O, shift(core, orientation))`:  Shifts the core to the center of the canvas based on the determined orientation and paints it.
5. `flanking_pos = {(3,1),(3,8)} if orientation[1]==3 else {(1,3),(8,3)}`: Determine flanking positions based on orientation
6. `paint(O, recolor(1, flanking_pos))`: Adds the two '1's flanking the core based on the determined orientation.

These five versions offer different approaches to achieve the same outcome, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
