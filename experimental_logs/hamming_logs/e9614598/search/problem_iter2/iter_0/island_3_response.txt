## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking a 2x2 input grid and embedding it into a larger 10x10 output grid. The embedded grid is centered and a specific pattern is drawn around it:

* **Input_0:** The input '0's are treated as background and are preserved in the output.  A '3' shaped pattern is drawn in the center with '1's at specific positions within this pattern.
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the input '0's are preserved. A single vertical line of '3's is drawn with two '1's flanking the line from a distance. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions for the program:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN))
  O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, frozenset({(4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (3, 5), (5, 5)})))
  O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, frozenset({(3, 4), (5, 6)})))
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(index(I, (0, 0)), {(0, 0)}), (FOUR, FOUR)))
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(index(I, (0, 1)), {(0, 0)}), (FOUR, FIVE)))
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(index(I, (1, 0)), {(0, 0)}), (FIVE, FOUR)))
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(index(I, (1, 1)), {(0, 0)}), (FIVE, FIVE)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** A 10x10 canvas filled with '0's is created.
2. **Draw '3' Pattern:**  A '3' shape is drawn using the color '3' at the center of the canvas.
3. **Place '1's:**  Two '1's are placed at specific positions within the '3' pattern.
4. **Embed Input:** Each cell from the input grid is copied to the center of the output grid, preserving the input values. 

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
  center_patch = frozenset({(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)})
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN)), recolor(THREE, shift(frozenset({(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (0, 2), (2, 2)}), (3, 3))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, {(3, 4), (5, 6)}))
  return paint(O, merge({shift(recolor(index(I, (i, j)), {(0, 0)}), (i + 4, j + 4)) for i, j in center_patch}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Center:** The center 2x2 area is defined as `center_patch`.
2. **Create & Paint:** A 10x10 canvas is created and the '3' pattern and '1's are painted as in Version 1.
3. **Embed Input (Efficiently):**  This version uses `merge` and a set comprehension to embed the input grid into the output grid more efficiently.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN))
  three_indices = {(4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (3, 5), (5, 5)}
  one_indices = {(3, 4), (5, 6)}
  for i in range(2):
    for j in range(2):
      O = paint(O, shift(recolor(index(I, (i, j)), {(0, 0)}), (i + 4, j + 4)))
  for i, j in three_indices:
    O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, {(i, j)}))
  for i, j in one_indices:
    O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, {(i, j)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and Indices:** Similar to previous versions, a canvas is created, and the indices for '3' and '1' are defined.
2. **Iterative Painting:** This version uses nested loops to iteratively paint the input grid and the '3' and '1' patterns onto the canvas.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN))
  for i in range(2):
    for j in range(2):
      O = paint(O, recolor(index(I, (i, j)), {(i + 4, j + 4)}))
  O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, {(4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (3, 5), (5, 5)}))
  return paint(O, recolor(ONE, {(3, 4), (5, 6)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and Embedding:** Creates a 10x10 canvas and embeds the 2x2 input grid at its center using nested loops.
2. **Direct Painting:** Directly paints the '3' pattern and '1's onto the canvas using their specific indices.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = upscale(I, 5)
  O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, {(4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (3, 5), (5, 5)}))
  return paint(O, recolor(ONE, {(3, 4), (5, 6)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscale and Paint:**  This version leverages the `upscale` function to enlarge the input grid by a factor of 5 directly. It then paints the '3' pattern and '1's on the upscaled grid.


## Conclusion:

These five program versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation. Each version uses a distinct combination of DSL functions, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
