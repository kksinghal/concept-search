## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a 2x2 input grid and generates a 10x10 output grid. It identifies the location of '1's in the input grid and paints a specific pattern on the output grid based on that location. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The input grid has no '1's.
* The output grid is a 10x10 canvas of '0's with a "T" shape formed by '3's centered at (5,5). Two '1's flank the "T" shape horizontally at (4,4) and (4,6).

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The input grid has a '1' at (0,0).
* The output grid is a 10x10 canvas of '0's with a "T" shape formed by '3's centered at (4,4). Two '1's flank the "T" shape vertically at (0,3) and (8,3).


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def gfgccfefaifeeigaijfjedebcejdbbbg(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN))  # Create 10x10 canvas of '0's
  T_shape = frozenset({(THREE, (di, dj)) for di in range(3) for dj in range(3) if not (di == 1 and dj == 1)}) # Create "T" shape
  if index(I, (0, 0)) == ONE:
    O = paint(O, shift(T_shape, (4, 3)))  # Position "T" for '1' at (0,0)
    O = paint(O, {(ONE, (0, 3)), (ONE, (8, 3))})  # Add vertical flanking '1's
  else:
    O = paint(O, shift(T_shape, (5, 4)))  # Position "T" for no '1's
    O = paint(O, {(ONE, (4, 4)), (ONE, (4, 6))})  # Add horizontal flanking '1's
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Create a 10x10 canvas of '0's.
2. Define a "T" shape using a frozenset of (value, index) pairs.
3. Check the input grid for a '1' at (0, 0).
4. If a '1' is present, paint the "T" shape centered at (4, 4) and add vertical flanking '1's.
5. If no '1' is present, paint the "T" shape centered at (5, 5) and add horizontal flanking '1's.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def gfgccfefaifeeigaijfjedebcejdbbbg(I):
  O = upscale(I, 5)  # Upscale input grid to 10x10
  T_center = (4, 3) if index(I, (0, 0)) == ONE else (5, 4)  # Determine "T" center
  O = paint(O, {(THREE, (T_center[0] + di, T_center[1] + dj)) for di in range(-1, 2) for dj in range(-1, 2) if abs(di) != abs(dj)}) # Generate & paint "T" dynamically
  flanking_one_positions = {(0, 3), (8, 3)} if index(I, (0, 0)) == ONE else {(4, 4), (4, 6)} # Determine flanking '1' positions
  O = paint(O, {(ONE, pos) for pos in flanking_one_positions})  # Paint flanking '1's
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Upscale the input grid to 10x10.
2. Determine the center of the "T" shape based on the presence of '1' at (0,0) in the input.
3. Dynamically generate and paint the "T" shape using set comprehension.
4. Determine the positions of the flanking '1's based on the "T" center.
5. Paint the flanking '1's at the determined positions.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def gfgccfefaifeeigaijfjedebcejdbbbg(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN))  # Create 10x10 canvas of '0's
  T_shape = frozenset({(THREE, (1, 0)), (THREE, (1, 1)), (THREE, (1, 2)), (THREE, (0, 1)), (THREE, (2, 1))}) # Predefined "T" shape
  if index(I, (0, 0)) == ONE:
    O = paint(O, shift(T_shape, (3, 2)))  # Position "T" for '1' at (0,0)
    O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, {(0, 3), (8, 3)}))  # Add vertical flanking '1's
  else:
    O = paint(O, shift(T_shape, (4, 3)))  # Position "T" for no '1's
    O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, {(4, 4), (4, 6)}))  # Add horizontal flanking '1's
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Create a 10x10 canvas of '0's.
2. Define a "T" shape using a frozenset of (value, index) pairs.
3. Check the input grid for a '1' at (0, 0).
4. If a '1' is present, paint the predefined "T" shape at the appropriate position and add vertical flanking '1's using `recolor`.
5. If no '1' is present, paint the "T" shape at a different position and add horizontal flanking '1's using `recolor`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def gfgccfefaifeeigaijfjedebcejdbbbg(I):
  O = upscale(canvas(ZERO, (2, 2)), 5) # Create 10x10 canvas of '0's
  center_pos = (4, 3) if index(I, (0, 0)) == ONE else (5, 4) # Determine center position based on input
  horizontal_arm = {(THREE, (center_pos[0], center_pos[1] + dj)) for dj in range(-1, 2)} # Generate horizontal arm of the "T"
  vertical_arm = {(THREE, (center_pos[0] + di, center_pos[1])) for di in range(-1, 2) if di != 0} # Generate vertical arm of the "T"
  O = paint(O, horizontal_arm | vertical_arm)  # Combine and paint both arms to form "T"
  if index(I, (0, 0)) == ONE:
    O = paint(O, {(ONE, (0, 3)), (ONE, (8, 3))})  # Vertical flanking '1's
  else:
    O = paint(O, {(ONE, (4, 4)), (ONE, (4, 6))})  # Horizontal flanking '1's 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Create a 10x10 canvas of '0's by upscaling a smaller 2x2 canvas.
2. Determine the center position for the "T" shape based on the presence of '1' at (0,0) in the input.
3. Separately generate the horizontal and vertical arms of the "T" shape using set comprehension.
4. Combine both arms using set union and paint them onto the canvas.
5. Add flanking '1's based on the input as in previous versions.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def gfgccfefaifeeigaijfjedebcejdbbbg(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN))  # Create 10x10 canvas of '0's
  T_shape = recolor(THREE, {(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1)}) # Define "T" shape using indices
  flanking_ones = recolor(ONE, {(0, 3), (8, 3)}) if index(I, (0, 0)) == ONE else recolor(ONE, {(4, 4), (4, 6)}) # Define flanking '1's based on input
  O = paint(O, shift(T_shape, (4, 3) if index(I, (0, 0)) == ONE else (5, 4))) # Paint "T" at correct position
  O = paint(O, flanking_ones)  # Paint flanking '1's 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Create a 10x10 canvas of '0's.
2. Define the "T" shape and flanking '1's using `recolor` on index sets for easier manipulation.
3. Paint the "T" shape at the correct position based on the input using a conditional within `shift`.
4. Paint the pre-defined flanking '1's onto the canvas.

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformation using different combinations of DSL functions. They highlight the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for spatial reasoning and image manipulation tasks.
