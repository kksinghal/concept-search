## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '1' and drawing a horizontal line of '3's across the center of each object. 

**Input_0:** 
- Two '1' objects are present. 
- The program draws a horizontal line of '3's across the center row of each object.

**Input_1:**
- Two '1' objects are present.
- The program draws a horizontal line of '3's across the center row of each object.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects formed by '1'.
  O = I  # Initialize output grid.
  for obj in objs:
    center_row = centerofmass(obj)[0]  # Find center row.
    width = len(I[0])  # Get grid width.
    line = connect((center_row, 0), (center_row, width - 1))  # Create horizontal line.
    O = fill(O, THREE, line)  # Fill line with '3'.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** We use `objects(I, T, F, T)` to extract objects formed by the digit '1'.
2. **Iterate and draw lines:**  For each object:
   -  Calculate the center row using `centerofmass(obj)[0]`.
   -  Construct a horizontal line spanning the grid's width using `connect`.
   -  Fill the line with the digit '3' using `fill`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    if ONE in row:  # Check if row contains '1'.
      O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j) for j in range(len(row))})  # Fill entire row with '3'.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** The code iterates through each row of the input grid.
2. **Check for '1' and fill:** If a row contains the digit '1', it fills the entire row with '3's.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in partition(I): # Get all objects in the grid.
    if color(obj) == ONE:  # Check if the object is formed by '1'.
      top_row = uppermost(obj) # Get the top row of the object.
      bottom_row = lowermost(obj) # Get the bottom row of the object.
      center_row = (top_row + bottom_row) // 2  # Calculate the center row.
      O = fill(O, THREE, {(center_row, j) for j in range(len(I[0]))})  # Fill the center row with '3's.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition and iterate:** The code partitions the grid into objects using `partition(I)` and iterates through each object.
2. **Check color and fill:** If the object's color (determined by `color(obj)`) is '1':
   -  It calculates the center row of the object.
   -  It fills the center row with '3's using `fill`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == ONE:  # Check for '1' in each cell.
        O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, k) for k in range(len(I[0]))})  # Fill the row with '3's.
        break  # Move to the next row after filling.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** This version iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Find '1' and fill:** If a cell contains '1':
   - It fills the entire row with '3's.
   - It breaks the inner loop and moves to the next row to avoid unnecessary iterations. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Extract '1' objects.
  O = paint(I, recolor(THREE, mfilter(lambda obj: hline(obj), objs)))  # Recolor horizontal lines to '3'.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '1' objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` extracts objects formed by '1'.
2. **Filter horizontal lines:**  `mfilter(lambda obj: hline(obj), objs)` filters out objects that are horizontal lines.
3. **Recolor and paint:** It recolors the filtered objects (horizontal lines) to '3' using `recolor` and paints them back onto the grid with `paint`.


These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
