## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying cells with the value '1' and then drawing a horizontal line of '3's centered on that '1'. The line's length is determined by the number of adjacent '1's in the same row. 

**Example:**

Input:

```
0 1 1 0
```

Output:

```
0 3 3 0 
```

Here, two adjacent '1's result in a line of two '3's.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  output = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  for one in ones:
    line = {(one[0], one[1] + dx) for dx in range(-colorcount(I[one[0]], 1)//2, colorcount(I[one[0]], 1)//2 + 1)}
    output = fill(output, 3, line)
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create a canvas (`output`) of the same size as the input (`I`), filled with the most common color in the input.
2. **Locate '1's:**  Find the indices of all cells containing '1' and store them in `ones`.
3. **Draw Lines:** Iterate over each '1' location (`one`) in `ones`:
   - Calculate the line length based on the number of '1's in the row using `colorcount`.
   - Generate the indices for the horizontal line (`line`) centered on the current '1'.
   - Fill the `output` canvas with '3's at the calculated `line` indices.
4. **Return Output:** Return the modified `output` grid.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  output = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 1:
        span = sum(1 for v in row[j:] if v == 1)
        output = fill(output, 3, {(i, j + dx) for dx in range(span)})
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Modification:** Directly modify the input grid (`I`) and store it as `output`.
2. **Iterate and Check:** Iterate through each cell in the grid:
   - If a cell contains '1', calculate the `span` (length of consecutive '1's) starting from that cell.
   - Fill the `output` grid with '3's horizontally, starting from the current cell and extending for the calculated `span`. 
3. **Return Output:** Return the modified `output` grid.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  output = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    if color(obj) == 1:
      i, j = centerofmass(obj)
      w = width(obj)
      output = fill(output, 3, {(i, j + dx) for dx in range(-(w-1)//2, w//2 + 1)})
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty canvas (`output`) of the same size as the input (`I`).
2. **Identify Objects:** Identify all connected objects in the input grid using `objects` with parameters set to detect single-color objects without diagonals or background removal.
3. **Process '1' Objects:**  Iterate through each object (`obj`):
   - If the object's color is '1':
     - Find the center of mass (`i`, `j`) of the object.
     - Get the width (`w`) of the object.
     - Draw a horizontal line of '3's centered at (`i`, `j`) with length `w`.
4. **Return Output:** Return the modified `output` grid.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  output = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    start = None
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 1 and start is None:
        start = j
      elif val != 1 and start is not None:
        output = fill(output, 3, {(i, k) for k in range(start, j)})
        start = None
    if start is not None:
      output = fill(output, 3, {(i, k) for k in range(start, len(row))})
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty canvas (`output`) of the same size as the input (`I`).
2. **Iterate and Track:**  Iterate through each row and track the starting index (`start`) of consecutive '1's:
    - If a '1' is encountered and `start` is None, mark the current index as `start`.
    - If a non-'1' is encountered and `start` is not None, draw a horizontal line of '3's from `start` to the current index (exclusive).
    - If a row ends and `start` is not None, draw a horizontal line of '3's from `start` to the end of the row.
3. **Return Output:** Return the modified `output` grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  J = hmirror(I)
  output = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and J[i][len(row)-j-1] == 1:
        output = fill(output, 3, {(i, k) for k in range(j, len(row)-j)})
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Mirroring:** Create a horizontally mirrored copy (`J`) of the input grid (`I`).
2. **Initialization:** Create an empty canvas (`output`) of the same size as the input (`I`).
3. **Simultaneous Iteration:** Iterate through the input grid (`I`) and its mirrored version (`J`) simultaneously:
   - If a cell at index (i, j) in `I` and its corresponding mirrored cell in `J` both contain '1', draw a horizontal line of '3's centered at (i, j) with length equal to the distance between the two '1's (inclusive).
4. **Return Output:** Return the modified `output` grid.
