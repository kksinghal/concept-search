## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation identifies objects (clusters of '1's) in the input grid and draws a vertical line of '3's through the center of each object, extending one cell above and below the object.

**Input 0:** 
- Two single-cell objects are detected. 
- Vertical lines of '3's, three cells high, are drawn centered on each '1'.

**Input 1:** 
- Two single-cell objects are detected.
- Vertical lines of '3's, three cells high, are drawn centered on each '1'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_ff805c23(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    center_row = centerofmass(obj)[0]
    O = fill(O, THREE, {(center_row - 1, centerofmass(obj)[1])})
    O = fill(O, THREE, {(center_row, centerofmass(obj)[1])})
    O = fill(O, THREE, {(center_row + 1, centerofmass(obj)[1])})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects (clusters of '1's) in the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate and Draw:** The code iterates through each object `obj` in `objs`.
3. **Calculate Center:** `centerofmass(obj)[0]` determines the row index of the object's center of mass.
4. **Draw Vertical Line:**  The code draws a vertical line of '3's, three cells high, centered on the object's center of mass.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_ff805c23(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == ONE:
        O = fill(O, THREE, {(i - 1, j), (i, j), (i + 1, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** The code iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`.
2. **Check for '1':** If a cell contains the value '1', it's considered part of an object.
3. **Draw Vertical Line:**  A vertical line of '3's, three cells high, is drawn centered on the current cell (i, j).

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_ff805c23(I):
  objs = partition(I)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == ONE:
      center_row = centerofmass(obj)[0]
      center_col = centerofmass(obj)[1]
      O = fill(O, THREE, {(center_row - 1, center_col), (center_row, center_col), (center_row + 1, center_col)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition Grid:** `objs = partition(I)` divides the grid into objects based on cell values.
2. **Iterate and Check Color:** The code iterates through each object `obj` and checks if its color is '1'.
3. **Calculate Center:** If the color is '1', the center of mass is calculated.
4. **Draw Vertical Line:**  A vertical line of '3's is drawn, centered on the object's center of mass.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_ff805c23(I):
  indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  O = I
  for i, j in indices:
    O = fill(O, THREE, {(i - 1, j), (i, j), (i + 1, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' Indices:** `indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)` identifies the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **Iterate and Draw:**  The code iterates through the `indices` and draws a vertical line of '3's centered on each index.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_ff805c23(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    top_row = uppermost(obj) - 1
    bottom_row = lowermost(obj) + 1
    center_col = centerofmass(obj)[1]
    for i in range(top_row, bottom_row + 1):
      O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, center_col)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects in the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Determine Line Boundaries:** For each object, the code determines the top and bottom row indices for the vertical line.
3. **Draw Vertical Line:**  The code draws a vertical line of '3's from the `top_row` to the `bottom_row` at the object's center column.


Each of these versions provides a distinct approach to achieving the desired transformation, using different DSL functions and logic.
