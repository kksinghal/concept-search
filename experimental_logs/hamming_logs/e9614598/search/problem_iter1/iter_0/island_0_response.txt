## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes the input grids and adds a 3x3 square of the value '3' centered on each occurrence of the value '1'. The original '1' values are preserved. 

**Example:**

Input:
```
0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 
```

Output:
```
0 0 0 1 0
0 0 3 0 0
0 3 3 3 0
```

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  obj = extract(objs, lambda o: color(o) == 1)
  indices = toindices(obj)
  squares = mapply(lambda loc: backdrop(shift(canvas(3, (3,3)), subtract(loc, (1,1)))), indices)
  return paint(I, merge(squares)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify target objects:** `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies distinct objects (connected regions) of the same value in the grid, excluding the background. 
2. **Isolate '1' objects:** `extract(objs, lambda o: color(o) == 1)` finds the object with the color value '1'.
3. **Get object indices:** `toindices(obj)` retrieves the grid coordinates of all cells belonging to the '1' object.
4. **Create squares:** For each index in `indices`, a 3x3 square of '3's is created using `canvas(3, (3,3))` and positioned correctly using `shift` and `subtract`. `mapply` applies this logic to all indices and merges the resulting squares.
5. **Paint squares:** `paint(I, merge(squares))` overlays the merged squares onto the original input grid `I`, resulting in the final output.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    ones = ofcolor(I, 1) 
    shifted_squares = mfilter(ones, lambda loc: shift(canvas(3, THREE_BY_THREE), subtract(loc, UNITY)))
    return fill(I, 3, merge(shifted_squares))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1' cells:** `ofcolor(I, 1)` identifies and returns the indices of all cells in the input grid `I` containing the value '1'.
2. **Generate shifted squares:** For every location `loc` in `ones`, a 3x3 square is generated using `canvas(3, THREE_BY_THREE)` and shifted to be centered around `loc` using `shift` and `subtract`. This process is performed for all locations within the `mfilter` function, which also merges the resulting squares into a single set of indices.
3. **Fill the grid:** `fill(I, 3, merge(shifted_squares))` takes the original input grid `I` and fills the cells at the indices from the merged squares with the value '3', effectively drawing the 3x3 squares around each initial '1' cell.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  output = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        for di in range(-1, 2):
          for dj in range(-1, 2):
            if 0 <= i + di < height(I) and 0 <= j + dj < width(I):
              output = fill(output, 3, {(i + di, j + dj)})
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create blank canvas:** A canvas `output` of the same size and background color as the input grid `I` is initialized.
2. **Iterate through cells:** The program iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`.
3. **Identify '1' cells:** If a cell contains the value '1', it triggers the square drawing process.
4. **Draw the square:** For each '1' cell, the program iterates through a 3x3 neighborhood around it, filling the corresponding cells in the `output` canvas with the value '3'.
5. **Return the output:** Finally, the modified `output` canvas, now containing the 3x3 squares centered on each initial '1' cell, is returned.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    target_value = 1
    replacement_value = 3
    square_size = 3
    output = I
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] == target_value:
                for di in range(-(square_size//2), (square_size//2)+1):
                    for dj in range(-(square_size//2), (square_size//2)+1):
                        new_i = i + di
                        new_j = j + dj
                        if 0 <= new_i < len(I) and 0 <= new_j < len(I[0]):
                            output = fill(output, replacement_value, {(new_i, new_j)})
    return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Define constants for the target value ('1'), replacement value ('3'), and square size (3). The `output` grid is initialized as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iteration:**  The program iterates through each cell of the input grid `I` using nested loops.
3. **Target Detection:**  If a cell's value matches the `target_value`, it triggers the square drawing process.
4. **Square Drawing:**  For each detected target cell, the program iterates through a square region centered around it, determined by `square_size`. It uses `fill` to replace the cell values in the `output` grid with the `replacement_value`.
5. **Boundary Check:**  Before filling a cell, it checks if the new cell indices (`new_i`, `new_j`) are within the bounds of the grid to avoid index errors.
6. **Return:** Finally, the modified `output` grid is returned.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for x, y in prapply(lambda i, j: (i, j), interval(0, height(I), 1), interval(0, width(I), 1)):
    if index(I, (x, y)) == 1:
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, backdrop(shift(canvas(3, (3, 3)), subtract((x, y), UNITY))))
             )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
 
1. **Initialization:**  Initializes an output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate over all cells:**  Uses `prapply`, `interval`, and a lambda function to iterate over all possible cell coordinates `(x, y)` within the input grid.
3. **Check for target value:** For each cell, `index(I, (x, y)) == 1` checks if the cell value at coordinate `(x, y)` in the input grid `I` is equal to 1.
4. **Draw the square (if target found):** If the condition in step 3 is true, it executes the following:
    * **Create a 3x3 square:** `canvas(3, (3, 3))` creates a 3x3 grid filled with the value 3.
    * **Shift the square:**  `shift(..., subtract((x, y), UNITY))` shifts the created square so that its top-left corner is positioned at `(x-1, y-1)`, effectively centering the 3x3 square around the current cell `(x, y)`.
    * **Get backdrop indices:**  `backdrop(...)` takes the shifted square and returns a set of indices representing all cells within its bounding box.
    * **Recolor the backdrop:** `recolor(3, ...)` sets the color of all cells within the backdrop indices to 3.
    * **Paint onto the output:** `paint(O, ...)` merges the recolored backdrop onto the output grid `O`.
5. **Return the modified grid:**  Finally, after iterating through all cells, the function returns the modified output grid `O`.

Each of these programs should successfully perform the described transformation on the input grids, resulting in a similarity distance score of 0. They showcase different approaches to solving the problem, utilizing various DSL functions in unique combinations.
