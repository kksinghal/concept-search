## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid and drawing a square of '3's centered on each object. The size of the square is 3x3.  

**Example:**

Input_0:  A single '1' object. 
Output_0: A 3x3 square of '3's centered on the '1', leaving the '1' unchanged.

Input_1: Two separate '1' objects.
Output_1: Two separate 3x3 squares of '3's, each centered on a '1' object. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T) 
    for obj in objs:
        center_i, center_j = center(toindices(obj))
        square_indices = frozenset(
            (center_i + i, center_j + j) 
            for i in range(-1, 2) for j in range(-1, 2)
        )
        I = fill(I, THREE, square_indices)
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, T, T)` finds all connected objects in the grid `I`.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** The code iterates through each object (`obj`). 
    * **Find Center:**  `center(toindices(obj))` calculates the center coordinates of the object.
    * **Create Square Indices:**  A set of indices (`square_indices`) representing a 3x3 square centered at the object's center is generated.
    * **Fill Square:** The `fill` function places the value '3' at each index within `square_indices` on the grid `I`.
3. **Return Modified Grid:** The modified grid `I` with the filled squares is returned.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
    O = I  # Create a copy of the grid
    for obj in objs:
        ci, cj = center(toindices(obj))
        for i in range(ci - 1, ci + 2):
            for j in range(cj - 1, cj + 2):
                if 0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0]):
                    O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** The code iterates through each object and its center coordinates.
    * **Nested Loops for Square:** It uses nested loops to iterate over the 3x3 area around the object's center.
    * **Boundary Check:** It checks if the current index (i, j) is within the grid boundaries.
    * **Fill Cell:** If within bounds, it uses `fill` to place '3' at that location in the output grid `O`.
3. **Return Output Grid:**  The modified `O` grid is returned.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] != ZERO:
                for di in range(-1, 2):
                    for dj in range(-1, 2):
                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                        if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]):
                            O = fill(O, THREE, {(ni, nj)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over Grid:** This version directly iterates over each cell in the input grid `I`.
2. **Check for Non-Zero:** If a cell's value is not '0' (meaning it's part of an object):
    * **Iterate for Square:** It uses nested loops to go through the 3x3 neighborhood around the cell.
    * **Boundary Check:** It ensures the neighbor indices are within the grid's bounds. 
    * **Fill Cell:** If in bounds, it fills the neighbor cell in the output grid `O` with '3'.
3. **Return Output Grid:** It returns the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
    def draw_square(O, i, j):
        for di in range(-1, 2):
            for dj in range(-1, 2):
                ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]):
                    O = fill(O, THREE, {(ni, nj)})
        return O
    O = I
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] != ZERO:
                O = draw_square(O, i, j)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **`draw_square` Function:** This version introduces a helper function `draw_square` to encapsulate the logic of drawing a 3x3 square of '3's at a given location (i, j).
* **Main Logic:** The main part of the code is similar to Version 3, but it calls the `draw_square` function whenever a non-zero cell is encountered.

**Program Version 5** 

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  squares = mpapply(lambda obj: backdrop(shift(toindices(obj), (1, 1))), objs)
  return fill(I, THREE, squares)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, T, T)` finds all connected objects in the grid `I`.
2. **Create Square Backdrops:** The code iterates through each object (`obj`) and creates a backdrop that represents a 3x3 square centered at the object. 
    *  `backdrop` function is used to get the indices of the bounding box that represents a square.
    *  `shift` function is used to shift the object's indices by (1, 1) so that the backdrop is centered on the object.
3. **Fill Squares:** The `fill` function places the value '3' at each index within the generated backdrops on the grid `I`.
4. **Return Modified Grid:** The modified grid `I` with the filled squares is returned.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation in the given DSL, showcasing flexibility and creativity in problem-solving within the language's constraints.
