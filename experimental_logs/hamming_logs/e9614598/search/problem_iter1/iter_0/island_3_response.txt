## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a grid and an object (formed by the digit '1') as input. It then draws a filled rectangle of a new color ('3') around the object. The rectangle's dimensions and position are determined by the object's bounding box, effectively enclosing the object with a one-cell thick border.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    obj = objects(I, T, F, T).pop()
    O = fill(I, THREE, outbox(toindices(obj)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = objects(I, T, F, T).pop()`**: Identifies the object formed by '1's (assuming only one such object exists).
2. **`outbox(toindices(obj))`**: Calculates the indices representing the rectangle surrounding the object.
3. **`fill(I, THREE, ...)`**: Fills the calculated indices with the new color '3', creating the border.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = next(obj for obj in objects(I, T, F, F) if color(obj) == ONE)
  indices = toindices(obj)
  upper = uppermost(indices) - 1
  lower = lowermost(indices) + 1
  left = leftmost(indices) - 1
  right = rightmost(indices) + 1
  O = I
  for i in range(upper, lower + 1):
    for j in range(left, right + 1):
      if 0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0]):
        if (i, j) not in indices:
          O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = ...`**: Identifies the object formed by '1's.
2. **`indices = ...`**: Gets the indices of the object.
3. **`upper, lower, left, right = ...`**:  Calculates the boundaries of the surrounding rectangle.
4. **`for i in range...`**: Iterates over the rectangle.
5. **`if (i, j) not in indices`**: If a cell is not part of the object, fill it with '3'.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = next(obj for obj in objects(I, T, F, F) if color(obj) == ONE)
  shifted_obj = shift(obj, (-1, -1))
  O = paint(I, recolor(THREE, shifted_obj))
  shifted_obj = shift(obj, (-1, 1))
  O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shifted_obj))
  shifted_obj = shift(obj, (1, -1))
  O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shifted_obj))
  shifted_obj = shift(obj, (1, 1))
  O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shifted_obj))
  shifted_obj = shift(obj, (0, -1))
  O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shifted_obj))
  shifted_obj = shift(obj, (0, 1))
  O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shifted_obj))
  shifted_obj = shift(obj, (-1, 0))
  O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shifted_obj))
  shifted_obj = shift(obj, (1, 0))
  O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shifted_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = ...`**: Identifies the object formed by '1's.
2. **`shifted_obj = ...`**: Shifts the object in all eight directions.
3. **`O = paint(..., recolor(THREE, shifted_obj))`**: For each shifted object, recolor it to '3' and paint it onto the grid.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = objects(I, T, F, T).pop()
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if manhattan({(i, j)}, toindices(obj)) == 1:
        O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = ...`**: Identifies the object.
2. **`for i in range...`**: Iterates over each cell in the grid.
3. **`if manhattan({(i, j)}, toindices(obj)) == 1`**: Checks if the Manhattan distance between the current cell and the object is 1 (meaning it's adjacent).
4. **`O = fill(..., THREE, {(i, j)})`**: If adjacent, fill the cell with '3'.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if any(manhattan({(i, j)}, {idx}) == 1 for idx in one_indices):
        O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`one_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)`**: Finds all indices of cells containing '1'.
2. **`for i in range...`**: Iterates over each cell in the grid.
3. **`if any(...)`**: Checks if the current cell is adjacent to any cell containing '1'.
4. **`O = fill(..., THREE, {(i, j)})`**: If adjacent, fill the cell with '3'.
