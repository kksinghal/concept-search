## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place in these examples can be described as "shadowing". Essentially, the program is identifying any non-zero digits in the input grid and creating a horizontal "shadow" of those digits one row below their original position. The shadow uses the digit '3' and extends across the entire width of the original object.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The '1' digits in the 5th row have a '3' shadow extending horizontally on the 6th row.
* **Input_1:** Both '1' digits in the 1st and 9th rows have a '3' shadow extending across their respective rows on the 2nd and 10th rows. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the code that achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def shadow_v1(I):
  """
  Creates a horizontal shadow of non-zero digits one row below.

  Args:
    I: The input grid.

  Returns:
    The transformed grid with shadows.
  """
  output = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I) - 1):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != ZERO:
        output = fill(output, THREE, {(i + 1, k) for k in range(width(I))})
  return cellwise(I, output, THREE)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize:** Create an empty output grid (`output`) with the same dimensions as the input grid (`I`) filled with zeros.
2. **Iterate:** Loop through each cell in the input grid except the last row.
3. **Detect Non-Zero:** If a cell contains a non-zero value, create a horizontal line filled with '3' on the row below the current cell.
4. **Combine:** Finally, merge the original input grid with the generated shadow grid using `cellwise`, keeping the original values in case of overlap.

**Version 2:**

```python
def shadow_v2(I):
  """
  Creates a horizontal shadow using object detection.

  Args:
    I: The input grid.

  Returns:
    The transformed grid with shadows.
  """
  output = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    if color(obj) != ZERO:
      bottom_row = lowermost(obj) + 1
      shadow = {(bottom_row, j) for j in range(width(I))}
      output = paint(output, recolor(THREE, shadow))
  return cellwise(I, output, THREE)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize:** Create an empty output grid (`output`).
2. **Find Objects:** Identify all distinct objects in the input grid.
3. **Process Non-Zero Objects:** For each non-zero object, determine the row below its lowermost point.
4. **Create Shadow:** Create a horizontal line on that row spanning the entire grid width and filled with '3'.
5. **Combine:** Merge the original input grid with the shadow grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def shadow_v3(I):
  """
  Creates a horizontal shadow using shifted grids.

  Args:
    I: The input grid.

  Returns:
    The transformed grid with shadows.
  """
  shifted = vconcat(canvas(ZERO, (1, width(I))), I[:-1])
  return tuple(tuple(THREE if shifted[i][j] != ZERO else I[i][j] for j in range(width(I))) for i in range(height(I))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Down:** Create a shifted version of the input grid, moving all rows down by one position and adding a row of zeros at the top.
2. **Compare and Fill:**  Iterate through each cell of the original and shifted grids. If a cell in the shifted grid is non-zero, fill the corresponding cell in the output grid with '3'; otherwise, keep the original value.

**Version 4:**

```python
def shadow_v4(I):
  """
  Creates a horizontal shadow using functional programming.

  Args:
    I: The input grid.

  Returns:
    The transformed grid with shadows.
  """
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          THREE if any(I[i-1][j] != ZERO for j in range(width(I))) else I[i][j] 
          for j in range(width(I))) 
      for i in range(1, height(I))) + (I[-1],)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** This version iterates through each row of the input grid except the first and last. For each cell, it checks if any cell in the row above is non-zero. 
2. **Conditional Fill:** If a non-zero cell is found in the row above, the current cell is filled with '3'; otherwise, it keeps the original value.
3. **Concatenate:** The last row of the input grid is added back to the transformed grid.

**Version 5:**

```python
def shadow_v5(I):
  """
  Creates a horizontal shadow with a helper function.

  Args:
    I: The input grid.

  Returns:
    The transformed grid with shadows.
  """
  def has_nonzero_above(i, j):
    return any(I[i-1][k] != ZERO for k in range(width(I)))
  
  output = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for i in range(1, height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      output = fill(output, branch(has_nonzero_above(i, j), THREE, I[i][j]), {(i, j)})
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Helper Function:**  Defines a helper function `has_nonzero_above` to check if a cell has any non-zero values in the row above.
2. **Iterate and Apply:**  Iterates through each cell (excluding the first row) and uses the helper function to decide whether to fill the cell with '3' or the original value.

These five versions showcase different approaches and coding styles to achieve the same shadowing transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of DSL.
