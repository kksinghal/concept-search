## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying digits with value '1' in the input grid and drawing a vertical line of '3's with a length of 3, centered on the identified digit. 

**Example:**

* **Input_0:** A '1' is present at coordinates (4,1) and (4,7). 
    * A vertical line of '3's is drawn centered at (4,1) resulting in '3' at (3,1), (4,1), (5,1).
    * Similarly, a vertical line of '3's is drawn centered at (4,7) resulting in '3' at (3,7), (4,7), (5,7).

* **Input_1:**  A '1' is present at coordinates (0,3) and (8,3).
    * A vertical line of '3's is drawn centered at (0,3) resulting in '3' at (0,3), (1,3), (2,3).
    * Similarly, a vertical line of '3's is drawn centered at (8,3) resulting in '3' at (7,3), (8,3), (9,3).


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  output = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for x, y in prapply(lambda i, j: (i, j), interval(0, height(I), 1), interval(0, width(I), 1)):
    if index(I, (x, y)) == 1:
      for dy in range(-1, 2):
        if 0 <= y + dy < width(I):
          output = fill(output, 3, {(x + 1, y + dy)})
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Create a blank canvas (`output`) of the same size and background color as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate through Cells:** Loop through each cell's coordinates (`x`, `y`) in the grid.
3. **Identify '1's:**  If the cell's value is '1':
    * **Draw Vertical Line:**  For a small vertical offset (`dy`) ranging from -1 to 1 (covering one cell above and below), fill the `output` grid with '3' at the calculated position (`x+1`, `y+dy`).
4. **Return Output:** Return the modified `output` grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  threes = mfilter(
    asindices(I),
    lambda loc: any(
      index(I, add(loc, (1, dy))) == 1 and 0 <= loc[1] + dy < width(I)
      for dy in range(-1, 2)
    )
  )
  return fill(I, 3, threes)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Potential '3' Locations:** Use `mfilter` to find all indices in the input grid (`I`) where placing a '3' would align with the vertical line requirement. 
    * For each location (`loc`), check if there's a '1' one row below (`+1`) and within the grid's width for each vertical offset (`dy`) from -1 to 1.
2. **Fill '3's:** Use `fill` to replace the identified locations (`threes`) in the input grid (`I`) with the value '3'.
3. **Return Output:** Return the modified `I` grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  shifted_lines = mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0] + 1, loc[1] - 1), (loc[0] + 1, loc[1]), (loc[0] + 1, loc[1] + 1)}, ones)
  return fill(I, 3, merge(shifted_lines))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get '1' Locations:**  Find the indices of all cells with the value '1' using `ofcolor`.
2. **Generate Line Indices:** For each '1' location (`loc`), generate a set containing the indices of the three cells forming the vertical line. This is done by adding offsets to the original '1' location.
3. **Merge and Fill:** Merge all the generated line indices (`shifted_lines`) and use `fill` to change the values at these indices in the input grid (`I`) to '3'.
4. **Return Output:** Return the modified `I` grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = extract(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), lambda o: color(o) == 1)
  shifted_lines = mapply(lambda loc: shift({(1, 0), (0, 0), (2, 0)}, loc), toindices(obj))
  return paint(I, recolor(3, merge(shifted_lines)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Target Object:** Find the object formed by the digit '1' in the input grid.
2. **Create Shifted Lines:**  For each cell location (`loc`) in the extracted object, create a vertical line by shifting a predefined line template `{(1, 0), (0, 0), (2, 0)}` to that location. 
3. **Recolor and Paint:** Recolor the merged set of shifted lines to have the value '3' and then 'paint' them onto the input grid (`I`).
4. **Return Output:** Return the modified `I` grid.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  output = I
  for x, y in prapply(lambda i, j: (i, j), interval(0, height(I), 1), interval(0, width(I), 1)):
    if I[x][y] == 1:
      output = paint(output, recolor(3, backdrop(shift(canvas(3, (3, 1)), (x, y - 1))))
             )
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Start with the output grid (`output`) being the same as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate and Identify:**  Loop through every cell (`x`, `y`) in the input grid and check if the value is '1'.
3. **Create and Position Line:** If a '1' is found:
    * Create a vertical line by generating a 3x1 canvas filled with '3's.
    * Shift the line to the correct position relative to the '1's location.
    * Recolor the backdrop of the shifted line to '3' to ensure the line is visible.
    * Paint this recolored line onto the output grid.
4. **Return Output:** Return the modified `output` grid.
