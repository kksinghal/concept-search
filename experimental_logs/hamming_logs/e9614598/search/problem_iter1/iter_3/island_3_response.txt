## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify objects (groups of connected '1's) and draw a horizontal line of '3's through their center of mass, extending one cell to the left and right.

**Input_0:**

- Identifies two single-cell objects of '1'.
- Draws a 3-cell horizontal line centered on each '1', replacing any existing '0's.

**Input_1:**

- Identifies two single-cell objects of '1'.
- Draws a 3-cell horizontal line centered on each '1'.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the `Program_to_be_generated` function:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    center_row, center_col = centerofmass(obj)
    O = fill(O, THREE, {(center_row, center_col - 1), (center_row, center_col), (center_row, center_col + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Uses `objects(I, T, F, T)` to find connected groups of '1's (objects) in the input grid `I`, treating them as univalued, non-diagonal, and excluding the background.
2. **Iterate through objects:** Loops through each identified object `obj`.
3. **Calculate center and draw line:** 
   - Determines the center of mass of the object using `centerofmass(obj)`.
   - Fills a horizontal 3-cell line with '3's centered at the object's center of mass using `fill`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == ONE:
        O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j-1), (i, j), (i, j+1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create empty canvas:** Generates an empty grid `O` of the same size as the input `I`, filled with '0's.
2. **Iterate through cells:** Loops through each cell in the input grid.
3. **Draw line on '1' encounter:** If a cell contains a '1', it fills a 3-cell horizontal line with '3's centered at that cell's location in the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    ones_indices = [j for j, val in enumerate(row) if val == ONE]
    for j in ones_indices:
      O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j - 1), (i, j), (i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** Loops through each row `i` in the input grid `I`.
2. **Find '1' indices:** For each row, it identifies the column indices `j` of all cells containing '1'.
3. **Draw lines:** For each identified '1' index, it fills a horizontal 3-cell line with '3's centered at that location in the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(1, width(I) - 1):
      if I[i][j-1] == ONE or I[i][j] == ONE or I[i][j+1] == ONE:
        O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j-1), (i, j), (i, j+1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells (excluding borders):**  Loops through each cell in the input grid `I`, excluding the first and last columns to avoid out-of-bounds errors.
2. **Check for adjacent '1's:** For each cell, it checks if it or its immediate horizontal neighbors contain a '1'.
3. **Draw line if condition met:** If the condition is met, it fills a 3-cell horizontal line with '3's centered at the current cell's location in the output grid `O`. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    i, j = centerofmass(obj)
    left_edge = max(0, j - 1)
    right_edge = min(width(I), j + 2)
    O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, k) for k in range(left_edge, right_edge)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Iterate through objects:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Calculate center and draw line (with boundary checks):**
   - Determines the center of mass of the object using `centerofmass(obj)`.
   - Calculates `left_edge` and `right_edge` of the line ensuring it stays within the grid boundaries.
   - Fills a horizontal line with '3's from `left_edge` to `right_edge` on the center row `i` of the object.

Each of these versions provides a distinct approach to achieve the required transformation while using different combinations of functions from the DSL.
