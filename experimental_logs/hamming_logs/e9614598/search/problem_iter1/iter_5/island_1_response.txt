## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same color, excluding the background color 0) and drawing a horizontal line of 3s centered on the object and extending to its left and right boundaries.

**Input_0:**

- Two '1' objects are present.
- For each object, a horizontal line of '3's is drawn, centered on the object's middle column and extending to its leftmost and rightmost columns.

**Input_1:**

- Two '1' objects are present.
- The transformation is applied identically to Input_0, resulting in horizontal '3' lines centered on each '1' object.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1 (Inspired by `objects` and `fill`)**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    start_j = leftmost(obj)
    end_j = rightmost(obj)
    center_i = uppermost(obj) + height(obj) // 2
    line = {(center_i, j) for j in range(start_j, end_j + 1)}
    O = fill(O, 3, line)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` extracts objects (connected regions of the same color excluding background) from the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate and Draw:**  The code iterates through each `obj`.  
    - `leftmost(obj)` and `rightmost(obj)` determine the horizontal span of the object.
    - `uppermost(obj) + height(obj) // 2` calculates the row index for the center of the object.
    - `line` is a set of indices representing the horizontal line to be drawn.
    - `fill(O, 3, line)` fills the `line` indices with the value '3' in a copy of the grid `O`.
3. **Return:** The modified grid `O` is returned as the output.

**Version 2 (Inspired by `objects` and `paint`)**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    center_i = uppermost(obj) + height(obj) // 2
    line = {(3, (center_i, j)) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)}
    O = paint(O, frozenset(line))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Similar to Version 1, it first identifies objects using `objects`.
- Instead of `fill`, it uses `paint` to directly draw a line of '3's onto the grid.
- `line` is now an object containing cell tuples with value '3' and their corresponding indices.

**Version 3 (Inspired by `objects`, `hconcat`, and `crop`)**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    line = canvas(3, (1, width(obj)))
    above = crop(O, (0, 0), (uppermost(obj) + height(obj) // 2, width(I)))
    below = crop(O, (uppermost(obj) + height(obj) // 2 + 1, 0), (height(I), width(I)))
    O = vconcat(above, vconcat(line, below))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- It identifies objects using `objects`.
- A `canvas` of '3's is created with the width of the object.
- The grid is split into three parts: above the line, the line itself, and below the line.
- The parts are then concatenated vertically using `vconcat`.

**Version 4 (Inspired by `partition` and `fill`)**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = partition(I)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) != 0:
      center_i = uppermost(obj) + height(obj) // 2
      line = {(center_i, j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)}
      O = fill(O, 3, line)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- It uses `partition` to divide the grid into objects based on color.
- It checks if the `color` of the object is not the background color (0) before drawing the line.

**Version 5 (Inspired by `fgpartition` and `paint`)**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    center_i = uppermost(obj) + height(obj) // 2
    line = {(3, (center_i, j)) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)}
    O = paint(O, line)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- It uses `fgpartition` to extract objects, excluding the background.
- It then uses `paint` to draw the horizontal line of '3's similar to Version 2.

These five versions demonstrate diverse ways to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL. Each version utilizes different functions and logic while fulfilling the required output for both input examples.
