## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects with the value '1' and extending them horizontally with the value '3', creating a line segment three cells wide centered on the original '1' object. The background color (most frequent color) remains unchanged.


## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  ones = colorfilter(objs, 1)
  shifted_ones = mapply(lambda obj: toindices(shift(obj, (0, -1))) | toindices(obj) | toindices(shift(obj, (0, 1))), ones)
  return paint(I, recolor(3, shifted_ones))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' objects:**  We use `objects` to find connected components of the same color, then filter for objects with color '1' using `colorfilter`.
2. **Extend horizontally:** For each '1' object, we create two shifted copies, one to the left and one to the right using `shift`. We merge the indices of the original object and its shifted copies using `toindices` and set union.
3. **Paint on the grid:** Finally, we paint the extended indices with color '3' using `recolor` and `paint` onto the original grid.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  output = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for x in range(height(I)):
    for y in range(width(I)):
      if I[x][y] == 1:
        for dx in (-1, 0, 1):
          if 0 <= y + dx < width(I):
            output = fill(output, 3, {(x, y + dx)})
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a blank canvas:** We initialize an output grid filled with the background color using `canvas` and `shape`.
2. **Iterate and fill:** We iterate through each cell of the input grid. If a cell has value '1', we fill the corresponding cell and its horizontal neighbors in the output grid with '3'.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  horizontal_lines = mpapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + dx) for dx in (-1, 0, 1)}, ones, ones)
  return paint(I, recolor(3, horizontal_lines))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get indices of '1's:** We find the indices of all cells with value '1' using `ofcolor`.
2. **Generate horizontal line indices:** For each '1' index, we generate the indices of a three-cell horizontal line centered at that index using `mpapply`.
3. **Paint the lines:** Finally, we recolor these line indices to '3' and paint them onto the original grid.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(
    3,
    merge([toindices(shift(obj, (0, dx))) 
           for obj in sfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1) 
           for dx in (-1, 0, 1)])
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Filter '1' objects:** We extract objects from the input, filter for those with color '1', and get their indices.
2. **Generate shifted indices:** For each '1' object, we create three sets of indices, one for the original object and two shifted horizontally by one unit.
3. **Merge and recolor:** We merge all the generated indices and recolor them to '3'.
4. **Paint onto the grid:** Finally, we paint the recolored indices onto the original grid.


**Program Version 5:**

def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  lines = mfilter(
      asindices(I),
      lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 1 and all((loc[0], loc[1] + dx) in asindices(I) for dx in (-1, 1))
  )
  return paint(I, recolor(3, lines | shift(lines, (0, -1)) | shift(lines, (0, 1))))

**Explanation:**

1. **Find valid line centers:**  We iterate through all cell indices and filter for those containing '1' and having valid left and right neighbors within the grid boundaries.
2. **Extend to lines:** For each valid center, we generate a three-cell horizontal line by including its left and right neighbors.
3. **Paint the lines:**  We recolor the line indices to '3' and paint them onto the original grid.
