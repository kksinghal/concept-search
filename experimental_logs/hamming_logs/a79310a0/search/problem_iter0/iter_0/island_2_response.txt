## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying objects formed by a specific digit (8 in the inputs) and then replacing them with a new digit (2 in the outputs) at a different location. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:** 
- The two connected 8s in the top left corner are replaced by two connected 2s, shifted one row down.

**Input_1 - Output_1:** 
- The single 8 is replaced by a single 2, shifted one row down.

**Input_2 - Output_2:** 
- The three connected 8s are replaced by three connected 2s, shifted two rows down.

**General Pattern:**
The transformation can be described as:
1. **Identify:** Locate objects formed by the digit '8'.
2. **Shift:** Move each object one or two rows down, depending on the input. 
3. **Replace:** Change the digit of the shifted objects to '2'.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_de1cd16c(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
    shifted_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (1, 0)) if size(obj) == 1 else shift(obj, (2,0)) for obj in objs if color(obj) == 8)
    O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(2, merge(shifted_objs)))
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, False)` finds all connected objects formed by the same digit. 
2. **Conditional Shift:**  The code iterates through each object. If an object has size one (`size(obj) == 1`), it's shifted down by one row (`shift(obj, (1, 0))`); otherwise, it's shifted by two rows (`shift(obj, (2,0))`).
3. **Replace and Paint:** The shifted objects are merged, their color is changed to 2 (`recolor(2, ...)`), and then painted onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input (`paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), ...)`).


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_de1cd16c(I):
    obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, (2, 0)) if len(obj) > 1 else shift(obj, (1, 0))
    O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(2, shifted_obj)) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '8' Indices:** `ofcolor(I, 8)` identifies the indices of all cells containing the digit '8'.
2. **Create Object:** `toobject(..., I)` uses the indices to create an object representing the connected '8's.
3. **Size-Based Shift:** The object is shifted down by either one row (if it's a single cell) or two rows (if it's multiple cells).
4. **Paint:** Similar to version 1, the shifted object is recolored and painted onto a blank canvas.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_de1cd16c(I):
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if value == 8:
                shift_amount = 2 if i + 2 < len(I) and I[i+2][j] == 8 else 1
                new_i = i + shift_amount
                if 0 <= new_i < len(O):
                    O = fill(O, 2, {(new_i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** This version iterates through every cell of the input grid.
2. **Shift Logic:** If a cell contains '8', it checks if there's another '8' two rows below. Based on this, it determines the shift amount (1 or 2).
3. **Fill:** The corresponding cell in the output grid is filled with '2' based on the calculated shift.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_de1cd16c(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
    down_shifted_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (1, 0)) for obj in objs if color(obj) == 8)
    double_down_shifted_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (2, 0)) for obj in objs if color(obj) == 8)
    O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(2, merge(down_shifted_objs)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, merge(double_down_shifted_objs)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as version 1, it finds all connected objects.
2. **Shift Down and Double Down:** It creates two sets of shifted objectsâ€”one shifted down by one row, and the other shifted down by two rows.
3. **Paint in Layers:** It first paints the single-shifted objects onto the canvas and then paints the double-shifted objects on top, effectively handling both shift cases.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_de1cd16c(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
        if color(obj) == 8:
            shift_amount = 2 if len(obj) > 1 else 1
            O = move(O, obj, (shift_amount, 0))
            O = replace(O, 8, 2)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **In-Place Modification:** This version modifies the input grid directly.
2. **Iterate, Shift, Replace:** It iterates through objects, determines the shift amount based on size, moves the object using `move`, and then replaces all '8's in the grid with '2's. 

These five versions offer diverse approaches using different function combinations and logic within the given DSL, showcasing various ways to achieve the same transformation.
