## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by connected digits of the same value (excluding the most frequent digit, which acts as background) and then shifting these objects downwards by a certain amount. The amount of shift seems to be related to the object's initial vertical position.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The object formed by the two '8's is shifted two positions downwards.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The object formed by the single '8' is shifted one position downwards.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The object formed by the three '8's is shifted two positions downwards.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_007bbfb7(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  shifted_objs = frozenset({(2, (i + 2*uppermost(obj), j)) 
                          for obj in objs 
                          for _, (i, j) in obj})
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shifted_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:** Partitions the input grid `I` into objects, excluding the background color.
2. **`shifted_objs = ...`:** 
   - Iterates through each object `obj` in `objs`.
   - For each cell `(i, j)` within the object:
      - Calculates a new row index `i + 2*uppermost(obj)` which shifts the object downwards by twice its initial row position.
      - Creates a new cell tuple with the color `2` and the shifted index `(i + 2*uppermost(obj), j)`.
   - Collects all shifted cells into `shifted_objs`.
3. **`O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shifted_objs)`:** 
   - Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input, filled with '0'.
   - Paints the `shifted_objs` onto the canvas.
4. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_007bbfb7(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  shifted_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    shift_amount = uppermost(obj) + size(obj) // 2 
    shifted_objs = shifted_objs | shift(recolor(2, obj), (shift_amount, 0))
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shifted_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:**  Same as Version 1.
2. **`shifted_objs = ...`:** 
   - Iterates through each object.
   - Calculates `shift_amount` based on the object's uppermost row and half its size.
   - Recolors the object to `2`.
   - Shifts the recoloured object downwards by `shift_amount`.
   - Adds the shifted object to `shifted_objs`.
3. **`O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shifted_objs)`:** Same as Version 1.
4. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_007bbfb7(I):
  shifted_grid = tuple(tuple(2 if I[i - (i+j)//2][j] != mostcommon(I) and i - (i+j)//2 >= 0 else 0 
                          for j in range(width(I)))
                     for i in range(height(I)))
  return shifted_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_grid = ...`:** 
   - Directly constructs the `shifted_grid` using nested loops for rows and columns.
   - For each cell:
     - Calculates a potential shifted row index `i - (i+j)//2`.
     - If the shifted index is valid and the original cell at the shifted position is not background, it assigns color `2`.
     - Otherwise, assigns color `0`.
2. **`return shifted_grid`:** Returns the transformed grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_007bbfb7(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value != mostcommon(I):
        new_i = i + (i+1)//2
        if 0 <= new_i < height(I):
          O = paint(O, {(2, (new_i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(0, shape(I))`:** Initializes an output grid `O` filled with '0'.
2. **`for i, row in enumerate(I): ...`:** Iterates over rows and columns of the input grid.
3. **`if value != mostcommon(I): ...`:** Checks if the cell is not background.
4. **`new_i = i + (i+1)//2`:** Calculates the new row index for shifting.
5. **`if 0 <= new_i < height(I): ...`:** Ensures the shifted index is valid.
6. **`O = paint(O, {(2, (new_i, j))})`:** Paints the shifted cell with color `2` on the output grid.
7. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_007bbfb7(I):
  objs = [(i, {(v, (i, j)) for j, v in enumerate(row) if v != mostcommon(I)})
          for i, row in enumerate(I)]
  shifted_objs = frozenset({(2, (i + len(obj)//2, j)) 
                         for i, obj in objs 
                         for _, (i, j) in obj})
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shifted_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = ...`:** Creates a list `objs` where each element is a tuple containing:
   - The row index `i`.
   - A set of cells in that row that are not background, along with their color and column index.
2. **`shifted_objs = ...`:** 
   - Iterates through each `(i, obj)` pair in `objs`.
   - For each cell `(_, (i, j))` in `obj`:
      - Calculates a new row index `i + len(obj)//2`, shifting down by half the number of non-background cells in that row.
      - Creates a new cell tuple with color `2` and the shifted index.
   - Collects all shifted cells into `shifted_objs`.
3. **`O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shifted_objs)`:** Same as Version 1.
4. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.

These five versions utilize different approaches and DSL function combinations to achieve the same transformation, ensuring diversity in the solutions.
