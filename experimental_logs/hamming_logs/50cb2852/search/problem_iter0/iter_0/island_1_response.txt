## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific objects within the input grid and replacing a portion of their cells with the value '8'. The selection of cells within the object seems to be consistent across different occurrences of the same object.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The object formed by '2's has its inner cells replaced with '8's, keeping a one-cell border of '2's.
- The object formed by '3's has its top and bottom rows unchanged, while the inner rows are entirely replaced with '8's.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
-  The object formed by '2's has its inner column replaced with '8's, keeping a one-cell border of '2's on the sides.
- The object formed by '1's has its top and bottom rows unchanged, while the inner rows are entirely replaced with '8's.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- The object formed by '2's has its corner cells unchanged, while the remaining cells are replaced with '8's.
- The object formed by '1's has its top and bottom rows unchanged, while the inner rows are entirely replaced with '8's.
- The object formed by '3's has its corner cells unchanged, while a single diagonal line of '8's is drawn across.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, each with an explanation:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    # Identify objects
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)

    # Function to replace inner cells with 8
    def replace_inner(obj):
        # Get object's bounding box
        ul = ulcorner(obj)
        lr = lrcorner(obj)
        
        # Generate indices for inner cells
        inner_indices = frozenset(
            (i, j) 
            for i in range(ul[0] + 1, lr[0]) 
            for j in range(ul[1] + 1, lr[1])
        )
        
        # Recolor inner cells to 8
        return recolor(EIGHT, toobject(inner_indices, I))

    # Apply replacement to each object
    modified_objs = apply(replace_inner, objs)
    
    # Paint the modified objects back onto a blank canvas
    O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(modified_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  Uses `objects(I, T, F, T)` to find all objects in the input grid (`I`), considering them as truly univalued, ignoring diagonal connections, and excluding the background.
2. **`replace_inner` function:**  This nested function handles the cell replacement logic for a single object. 
    - It determines the bounding box of the object using `ulcorner` and `lrcorner`.
    - It generates indices for the inner cells of the object, excluding the border.
    - It uses `recolor` to change the color of the cells at these indices to '8'.
3. **Apply replacement:** The `apply` function applies the `replace_inner` function to each object identified in step 1.
4. **Paint objects:** The modified objects are then painted onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid, effectively replacing the original objects.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    def modify_obj(obj):
        ul = ulcorner(obj)
        lr = lrcorner(obj)
        inner = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(ul[0]+1, lr[0]) for j in range(ul[1]+1, lr[1]))
        border = difference(toindices(obj), inner)
        return combine(recolor(EIGHT, toobject(inner, I)), toobject(border, I))
    new_objs = apply(modify_obj, objs)
    O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(new_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1, this identifies all unique objects in the input grid.
2. **`modify_obj` Function:**  This function processes each object individually. 
    - It finds the bounding box of the object.
    - It calculates the indices of the inner cells and the border cells separately.
    - It then recolors the inner cells to '8' and combines them with the original border cells.
3. **Apply Modification:** The `apply` function applies `modify_obj` to all identified objects.
4. **Paint Objects:** This step paints the modified objects onto a blank canvas of the same dimensions as the input. 


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    def process_color(color_val):
        obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, color_val), I)
        ul = ulcorner(obj)
        lr = lrcorner(obj)
        inner = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(ul[0]+1, lr[0]) for j in range(ul[1]+1, lr[1]))
        border = difference(toindices(obj), inner)
        return combine(recolor(EIGHT, toobject(inner, I)), toobject(border, I))
    new_objs = apply(process_color, palette(I))
    O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(new_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`process_color` Function:** This function handles the modification for each color present in the input grid.
    - It extracts the object corresponding to the current color using `ofcolor` and `toobject`.
    - It calculates the bounding box of the object.
    - Similar to Version 2, it identifies inner and border cells and recolors only the inner cells to '8'.
2. **Apply to Each Color:** The `apply` function applies the `process_color` function to each unique color found in the input grid using `palette(I)`.
3. **Paint Objects:**  Similar to previous versions, this step paints the modified objects onto a blank canvas.


**Program Version 4:** 

```python
def solve(I):
    def modify_row(row, row_idx, ul, lr):
        if ul[0] < row_idx < lr[0]:
            return tuple(EIGHT if ul[1] < col_idx < lr[1] else val 
                        for col_idx, val in enumerate(row))
        return row

    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    ul = ulcorner(merge(objs))
    lr = lrcorner(merge(objs))
    O = tuple(
        tuple(modify_row(row, row_idx, ul, lr)) 
        for row_idx, row in enumerate(I)
    )
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`modify_row` Function:** This function processes each row of the input grid.
    - If the row is within the bounds of any object (determined by `ul` and `lr`), it replaces the cell values within the object's horizontal span with '8', leaving the cells outside the object's span unchanged.
    - If the row is outside any object's bounds, it returns the row unmodified.
2. **Find Overall Bounds:** It first identifies all objects in the grid and then determines the overall bounding box (`ul` and `lr`) encompassing all objects.
3. **Apply to Each Row:**  The code iterates through each row of the input grid, applying the `modify_row` function. 


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    def process_cell(i, j, ul, lr):
        if ul[0] < i < lr[0] and ul[1] < j < lr[1]:
            return EIGHT
        return I[i][j]
    
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    ul = ulcorner(merge(objs))
    lr = lrcorner(merge(objs))

    O = tuple(
        tuple(process_cell(i, j, ul, lr) for j in range(len(I[0]))) 
        for i in range(len(I))
    )
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`process_cell` Function:** This function checks if a given cell (at index `i`, `j`) is within the bounds of any object. If it is, it replaces the cell value with '8'; otherwise, it keeps the original value.
2. **Find Overall Bounds:** It determines the overall bounding box (`ul` and `lr`) of all objects in the grid.
3. **Apply to Each Cell:** The code iterates through each cell of the input grid, applying the `process_cell` function.
