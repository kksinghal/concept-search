## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves the following steps:

1. **Identify Objects:** The distinct objects within the input grid are identified. An object is defined as a group of connected cells with the same value, considering only direct (not diagonal) adjacency.
2. **Frame Objects:** Each object is framed with the value '6'. This frame extends one cell outward from the object's boundaries.
3. **Fill Objects:** The interior of each object is filled with the value '4'. 
4. **Checkerboard Pattern:** A checkerboard pattern is applied to the grid, but only outside the framed objects. This pattern alternates between the values '1' and '2'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, each with explanations:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify objects
  O = fill(I, 1, prapply(lambda i, j: (i + j) % 2 == 0, range(len(I)), range(len(I[0]))))  # Checkerboard with 1s starting with (0,0)
  O = fill(O, 2, prapply(lambda i, j: (i + j) % 2 == 1, range(len(I)), range(len(I[0]))))  # Checkerboard with 2s
  O = fill(O, 4, mapply(toindices, objs)) # Fill objects with 4
  O = fill(O, 6, mapply(outbox, objs))  # Frame objects with 6
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Checkerboard First:** This version prioritizes creating the checkerboard pattern across the entire grid. 
2. **Fill and Frame:**  It then fills the objects with '4' and finally adds the '6' frame, ensuring the checkerboard doesn't overwrite these elements.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify objects
  O = canvas(2, shape(I)) # Canvas of 2s 
  O = fill(O, 1, prapply(lambda i, j: (i + j) % 2 == 0, range(len(I)), range(len(I[0])))) # Checkerboard with 1s starting with (0,0)
  O = paint(O, mapply(lambda obj: recolor(6, outbox(obj)), objs))  # Frame objects with 6
  O = paint(O, mapply(lambda obj: recolor(4, obj), objs))  # Fill objects with 4
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and Checkerboard:** This version starts with a canvas of '2's and applies the checkerboard pattern with '1's.
2. **Paint Objects:** It utilizes the 'paint' function to directly draw the frames and fill the objects, potentially offering efficiency for larger grids.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify objects
  O = canvas(1, shape(I)) # Canvas of 1s
  O = fill(O, 2, prapply(lambda i, j: (i + j) % 2, range(len(I)), range(len(I[0]))))  # Checkerboard with 2s starting with (0,1)
  O = paint(O, mapply(lambda obj: recolor(4, obj), objs))  # Fill objects with 4
  O = paint(O, mapply(lambda obj: recolor(6, outbox(obj)), objs))  # Frame objects with 6
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Alternative Canvas:** Similar to version 2 but starts with a canvas of '1's before applying the checkerboard.
2. **Order of Operations:** The order of painting frames and filling objects is reversed compared to version 2, potentially impacting performance in specific scenarios. 

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify objects
    O = fill(I, 6, mapply(outbox, objs))  # Frame objects with 6
    O = underfill(O, 4, mapply(backdrop, objs))  # Fill backdrops with 4, preserving existing values
    O = fill(O, 1, prapply(lambda i, j: (i + j) % 2 == 0, range(len(I)), range(len(I[0]))))  # Checkerboard with 1s starting with (0,0)
    O = fill(O, 2, prapply(lambda i, j: (i + j) % 2 == 1, range(len(I)), range(len(I[0]))))  # Checkerboard with 2s
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Frame and Underfill:** This version prioritizes framing the objects first and then utilizes 'underfill' to specifically target the backdrops of objects with the '4' value, avoiding modification within the frames.
2. **Checkerboard Last:** It applies the checkerboard pattern as the final step.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify objects
  O = canvas(1, shape(I))  # Create canvas of 1s
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(fill(O, 6, outbox(obj)), recolor(4, obj))  # Frame with 6, fill object with 4, and paint 
  O = fill(O, 2, prapply(lambda i, j: (i + j) % 2, range(len(I)), range(len(I[0]))))  # Checkerboard with 2s starting with (0,1)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterative Approach:** This version iterates through each object individually. Within the loop, it paints the frame, fills the object, and then paints the combined result onto the canvas.
2. **Canvas and Checkerboard:** It starts with a canvas of '1's and applies the checkerboard as the final step.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
