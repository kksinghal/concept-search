## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit, excluding the background color 0) and drawing a specific shape around them. The shape appears to be a rectangle with the following properties:

- **Color Pattern:** The rectangle has a specific color pattern for its corners and sides.
    - Top Left Corner: 6
    - Top Right Corner: Not always present, appears to be 1 when the object touches the top grid border.
    - Bottom Left Corner: 6
    - Bottom Right Corner:  Not always present, appears to be 1 when the object touches the bottom grid border.
    - Top Side: 6
    - Right Side: 1
    - Bottom Side: 1
    - Left Side: 6 
- **Placement:** The rectangle encloses the object, leaving one empty cell between itself and the object on all sides. 

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**

- The object (8) is enclosed in a rectangle formed by digits 6 and 1. 
- Notice the corners where '1' is present only when the object is touching the edge of the grid.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**

- Similar to the previous example, a rectangle is drawn around the object (3).
- Since the object is not touching any grid border, the corner '1's are absent.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**

-  The pattern holds, with rectangles drawn around both objects (3 and 2).
-  The object '3' touches the top border, so the top right corner of the rectangle is '1'.

**Input_3 - Output_3:**

-  Again, a rectangle (using digit 4) encloses the object (8). 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  result = I
  for obj in objs:
    up = uppermost(obj)
    down = lowermost(obj)
    left = leftmost(obj)
    right = rightmost(obj)
    result = fill(result, 6, {(up - 1, j) for j in range(left - 1, right + 2)})  # Top
    result = fill(result, 6, {(down + 1, j) for j in range(left - 1, right + 2)}) # Bottom
    result = fill(result, 6, {(i, left - 1) for i in range(up - 1, down + 2)})  # Left
    result = fill(result, 1, {(i, right + 1) for i in range(up, down + 2)})    # Right
    if up == 0:
      result = fill(result, 1, {(up, right + 1)}) # Top Right Corner 
    if down == len(I) - 1:
      result = fill(result, 1, {(down, right + 1)}) # Bottom Right Corner
  return result
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` finds all objects in the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Draw:** The program iterates through each object.
   - It calculates the bounding box (top, bottom, left, right) of the object.
   - It fills the grid cells corresponding to the rectangle's top, bottom, left, and right sides with the appropriate colors (6 and 1).
   - It checks for corner conditions (if the object touches top/bottom borders) and fills the corner cells with '1' if required.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  grid = I
  for obj in objs:
    box = outbox(obj) 
    grid = fill(grid, 6, box - (shoot(ulcorner(box), (0, 1)) | shoot(llcorner(box), (0, 1))))
    grid = fill(grid, 1, box - (shoot(ulcorner(box), (1, 0)) | shoot(urcorner(box), (1, 0))))
    if uppermost(obj) == 0:
      grid = fill(grid, 1, {urcorner(box)})
    if lowermost(obj) == len(I) - 1:
      grid = fill(grid, 1, {lrcorner(box)})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Find Objects & Initialize:**  Similar to version 1.
2.  **Draw Using Set Operations:**  This version cleverly uses set operations to draw the rectangle:
    - It gets the `outbox` of the object.
    - It fills the `outbox` with '6' except for the cells along the top and bottom horizontal lines using `shoot` and set difference (`-`).
    - Similarly, it fills with '1' for vertical lines.
    - Handles corner cases like version 1. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  canvas_grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, (1, 1))
    canvas_grid = underpaint(canvas_grid, recolor(6, outbox(shifted_obj)))
    canvas_grid = underpaint(canvas_grid, recolor(1, {(i, rightmost(shifted_obj)) for i in range(uppermost(shifted_obj), lowermost(shifted_obj) + 1)}))
    if uppermost(obj) == 0:
      canvas_grid = underpaint(canvas_grid, recolor(1, {(0, rightmost(shifted_obj))}))
    if lowermost(obj) == len(I) - 1:
      canvas_grid = underpaint(canvas_grid, recolor(1, {(len(I) - 1, rightmost(shifted_obj))}))
  return canvas_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** This version creates a blank canvas (`canvas_grid`) of the same size and background color as the input.
2. **Shift and Paint:** 
   - It shifts the object by (1, 1) to account for the spacing.
   - It uses `underpaint` to draw the rectangle on the `canvas_grid`, ensuring it only paints over the background. 
   - Like previous versions, it handles corner conditions.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    ul = add(ulcorner(obj), (-1, -1))
    lr = add(lrcorner(obj), (1, 1))
    for i in range(ul[0], lr[0] + 1):
      for j in range(ul[1], lr[1] + 1):
        if i == ul[0] or i == lr[0] or j == ul[1] or j == lr[1]:
          if i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
            if j == lr[1]:
              O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
            else:
              O = fill(O, 6, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Calculate:** This version iterates over the objects and calculates the upper-left (`ul`) and lower-right (`lr`) corners of the rectangle.
2. **Nested Loops & Conditions:** It uses nested loops to iterate through all cells within the rectangle's bounding box. 
   - If a cell is on the border of the rectangle, it fills it with the appropriate color (6 or 1) based on its position. 
   - The corner conditions are handled implicitly within the loops.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  grid = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    top, left = ulcorner(obj)
    bottom, right = lrcorner(obj)
    for i in range(top - 1, bottom + 2):
      for j in range(left - 1, right + 2):
        if 0 <= i < len(grid) and 0 <= j < len(grid[0]):
          if i == top - 1 or i == bottom + 1:
            grid = fill(grid, 6, {(i, j)})
          elif j == left - 1:
            grid = fill(grid, 6, {(i, j)})
          elif j == right + 1 and top <= i <= bottom:
            grid = fill(grid, 1, {(i, j)})
          if j == right + 1 and (i == top - 1 or i == bottom + 1): 
            grid = fill(grid, 1, {(i, j)}) 
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Define Boundaries:** This version iterates over the objects and determines the upper-left and lower-right corners to define the rectangular boundaries.

2. **Nested Loop and Conditions:** It utilizes nested loops to go through every cell within the defined rectangle's boundaries.

3. **Conditional Filling:** Inside the loop, it conditionally fills cells based on their position relative to the object:
    - Cells on the top and bottom rows within the boundaries are filled with '6'.
    - Cells in the leftmost column within the boundaries are filled with '6'.
    - Cells in the rightmost column within the boundaries and aligned with the object's height are filled with '1'.
    - Corners where '1' should be are filled conditionally if the object touches the grid border.

4. **Boundary Check:** It includes a check (`0 <= i < len(grid) and 0 <= j < len(grid[0])`) to ensure it's operating within the grid's boundaries, preventing potential "index out of range" errors.


These five versions offer different approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
