## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to involve these steps:

1. **Identify Non-Background Objects:** The program focuses on objects within the grid that are not the background color (most common color).
2. **Outline Objects:**  A border of a specific color (4 in the output examples) is drawn around each non-background object.
3. **Fill Specific Areas:** Certain areas within the outlined region are filled with a different color (1 in the output examples). These areas seem related to the object's original shape.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL to achieve the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  result = I
  for obj in objs:
    result = underfill(result, 4, outbox(obj)) # Outline the object with 4
    result = underfill(result, 1, difference(outbox(obj), box(obj))) # Fill inside outline with 1, excluding the actual border
  return result
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** It identifies non-background objects using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Outline:** It outlines each object using `underfill` with color 4 on the `outbox` of the object.
3. **Fill:** It fills the area between the outline and the object (`difference(outbox(obj), box(obj))`) with color 1 using `underfill`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  result = I
  for obj in objs:
    result = paint(result, recolor(4, outbox(obj))) # Outline with 4
    result = underpaint(result, recolor(1, difference(backdrop(obj), obj))) # Fill area within bounding box excluding the object with 1
  return result 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to v1.
2. **Outline:**  It directly paints the outline with color 4 using `paint` and `recolor` on the object's `outbox`.
3. **Fill:** It fills the area within the bounding box but outside the object (`difference(backdrop(obj), obj)`) with color 1 using `underpaint`.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  result = fill(I, 1, asindices(I)) # Start with a grid filled with 1
  for obj in objs:
    result = paint(result, recolor(color(obj), obj)) # Paint original objects
    result = paint(result, recolor(4, box(obj))) # Paint outline with 4
  return result
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialize:** It starts with a grid filled with color 1.
2. **Paint Objects:** It paints the original objects back onto the grid.
3. **Outline:** Outlines each object with color 4 using `paint` and `recolor`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  result = I
  for obj in objs:
    for d in (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT): # Iterate through four directions
      result = underfill(result, 4, shift(obj, d)) # Outline by shifting object in each direction and filling
    result = underfill(result, 1, inbox(obj)) # Fill the area within the object's inner box with 1
  return result
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Outline:** It creates the outline by shifting the object one step in each cardinal direction and filling those positions with 4.
3. **Fill:**  Fills the inner area (`inbox`) with color 1. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  result = I
  for v in palette(I):
    if colorcount(I, v) < colorcount(I, mostcommon(I)): # Iterate through non-background colors
      obj = frozenset({(v, (i, j)) for i, r in enumerate(I) for j, c in enumerate(r) if c == v}) # Reconstruct object from color
      result = underfill(result, 4, outbox(obj)) # Outline the object
      result = underfill(result, 1, difference(backdrop(obj), obj)) # Fill within bounding box excluding object
  return result
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate Colors:** This version iterates through each color in the grid that is not the background color.
2. **Reconstruct Object:** It reconstructs the object based on the current color.
3. **Outline & Fill:**  Similar to previous versions, it outlines and fills the areas. 

Each version provides a slightly different approach to achieving the desired transformation, utilizing various combinations of DSL functions.
