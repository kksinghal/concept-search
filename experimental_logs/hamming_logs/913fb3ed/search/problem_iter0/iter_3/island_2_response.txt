## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit excluding the background color 0) and applying the following changes:

* **Recoloring:** The digits surrounding each object are recolored based on their position relative to the object.
    * Digits directly above and below the object are changed to **6**.
    * Digits to the left and right of the object are changed to **6**.
    * A rectangular frame of **4s** is added around each object with a thickness of one. 
    * Digits within the framed region but not part of the object are changed to **1**.
* **Preserving object values:**  The values of the digits within the object itself remain unchanged.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions implementing the transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  # Create the outer frame
  framed_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(6, outbox(toindices(obj))), objs)
  # Create the inner frame
  inner_framed_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(4, outbox(toindices(obj))), objs)
  # Fill the area between frames with 1s
  filled_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(1, delta(inbox(toindices(obj)))), objs)
  O = paint(paint(paint(I, framed_objs), inner_framed_objs), filled_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:** Identifies objects (non-background connected components) in the input grid `I`.
2. **`framed_objs = ...`:** Creates a set of objects where the outbox (surrounding cells) of each original object is recolored to **6**.
3. **`inner_framed_objs = ...`:** Creates another set of objects where the outbox of each original object is recolored to **4**, forming the inner frame.
4. **`filled_objs = ...`:**  Creates a set of objects where the cells between the inner and outer frames (`delta(inbox(toindices(obj)))`) are recolored to **1**.
5. **`O = paint(...)`:**  The original grid `I` is painted over with the outer frame (`framed_objs`), then the inner frame (`inner_framed_objs`), and finally the filling (`filled_objs`) to achieve the final output `O`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  modified_grid = I
  for obj in objs:
    # Paint the outer frame
    modified_grid = paint(modified_grid, recolor(6, outbox(toindices(obj))))
    # Paint the inner frame
    modified_grid = paint(modified_grid, recolor(4, inbox(toindices(obj))))
    # Fill the area between frames with 1s
    modified_grid = paint(modified_grid, recolor(1, delta(inbox(toindices(obj)))))
  O = modified_grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:**  Identifies objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`modified_grid = I`:** Initializes a `modified_grid` with the input grid.
3. **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterates through each object.
4. **`modified_grid = paint(...)`:**  For each object:
   - Paints the outer frame (recolored to **6**) onto the `modified_grid`.
   - Paints the inner frame (recolored to **4**) onto the `modified_grid`.
   - Paints the filling (recolored to **1**) between the frames onto the `modified_grid`.
5. **`O = modified_grid`:** Assigns the `modified_grid` to the output `O`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  outer_frame = merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(6, outbox(toindices(obj))), objs))
  inner_frame = merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(4, inbox(toindices(obj))), objs))
  filling = merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(1, delta(inbox(toindices(obj)))), objs))
  O = paint(paint(paint(I, outer_frame), inner_frame), filling)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses `merge` and `apply` to achieve the transformation.

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:** Identifies objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`outer_frame = ...`:** Creates a single object representing the outer frames of all objects, recolored to **6**.
3. **`inner_frame = ...`:**  Creates a single object representing the inner frames of all objects, recolored to **4**.
4. **`filling = ...`:** Creates a single object representing the filling between the frames of all objects, recolored to **1**.
5. **`O = paint(...)`:** Paints the original grid `I` with the `outer_frame`, then the `inner_frame`, and finally the `filling` to generate the output `O`.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  modified_grid = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != 0:
        obj = extract(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: (i,j) in toindices(obj))
        # Paint the outer frame
        modified_grid = paint(modified_grid, recolor(6, outbox(toindices(obj))))
        # Paint the inner frame
        modified_grid = paint(modified_grid, recolor(4, inbox(toindices(obj))))
        # Fill the area between frames with 1s
        modified_grid = paint(modified_grid, recolor(1, delta(inbox(toindices(obj)))))
  O = modified_grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each cell of the grid and if it's not background, it applies the transformation to the object containing that cell.

1. **`modified_grid = I`:** Initializes a `modified_grid` with the input grid.
2. **`for i in range(len(I))`**: Iterates through each row.
3. **`for j in range(len(I[0]))`**: Iterates through each column.
4. **`if I[i][j] != 0:`**: If the current cell is not background.
   - **`obj = ...`**: Finds the object containing the current cell.
   -  Applies the same frame and filling logic as in previous versions, painting onto the `modified_grid`.
5. **`O = modified_grid`:** Assigns the `modified_grid` to the output `O`. 

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(paint(paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(6, outbox(toindices(obj))), fgpartition(I)))),
                    merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(4, inbox(toindices(obj))), fgpartition(I)))),
                merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(1, delta(inbox(toindices(obj)))), fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version condenses the logic into a single line using nested function calls. 

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Identifies objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`recolor(...)`:** Creates objects representing the outer frame (6), inner frame (4), and filling (1).
3. **`merge(apply(...))`:** Applies the recoloring to each object and merges the results into single objects for the outer frame, inner frame, and filling.
4. **`paint(...)`:**  Paints the original grid `I` with the outer frame, inner frame, and filling in a nested manner to generate the output.


These five versions offer different ways to achieve the desired transformation using various combinations of DSL functions. They showcase the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for solving spatial reasoning tasks.
