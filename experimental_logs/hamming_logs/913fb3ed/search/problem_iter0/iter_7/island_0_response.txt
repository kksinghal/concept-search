## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves the following steps for each distinct object (connected component of the same digit) in the input grid:

1. **Outline:** The object is outlined with the digit '4'.
2. **Fill:** The area inside the outline but outside the object is filled with the digit '6'.
3. **Duplicate & Recolor:** A horizontally mirrored duplicate of the object is created and all its digits are replaced with '1'.
4. **Concatenate:** The duplicate is concatenated to the right side of the original grid.

**Example Breakdown (Input_0 to Output_0):**

1. The object consisting of the digit '8' is identified.
2. It is outlined with '4's.
3. The area inside the outline but outside the '8' is filled with '6's.
4. A horizontally mirrored duplicate of the '8' is created and recolored to '1'.
5. This '1' duplicate is concatenated to the right side of the grid.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  grid = I
  for obj in objects(grid, T, F, T):
    grid = fill(grid, 4, outbox(obj)) # Outline object
    grid = underfill(grid, 6, difference(backdrop(obj), toindices(obj))) # Fill inner area
    duplicate = recolor(1, hmirror(crop(grid, ulcorner(obj), shape(obj)))) # Duplicate and recolor
    grid = hconcat(grid, duplicate) # Concatenate
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each object, outlines it with '4', fills the inner area with '6', creates a horizontally mirrored and recolored duplicate ('1'), and concatenates it to the right.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  result = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    result = underfill(result, 4, outbox(obj)) # Outline object
    result = underfill(result, 6, difference(backdrop(obj), toindices(obj))) # Fill inner area
    duplicate = recolor(1, hmirror(subgrid(obj, result))) # Duplicate and recolor
    result = hconcat(result, duplicate) # Concatenate
  return result
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses `underfill` for both outlining and filling, ensuring only background cells are modified. It also utilizes `subgrid` to extract the object directly for duplication.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  grid = I
  for obj in objects(grid, T, F, T):
    grid = paint(fill(grid, 4, outbox(obj)), obj) # Outline and repaint object
    grid = underfill(grid, 6, difference(backdrop(obj), toindices(obj))) # Fill inner area
    duplicate = hmirror(crop(grid, ulcorner(obj), shape(obj))) 
    duplicate = replace(duplicate, color(obj), 1) # Duplicate and recolor
    grid = hconcat(grid, duplicate) # Concatenate
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version outlines the object and repaints it in a single step using `paint`. It then uses `replace` to recolor the duplicate instead of `recolor`.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  result = I
  for obj in objects(result, T, F, T):
    result = fill(result, 4, outbox(obj)) # Outline object
    result = underfill(result, 6, difference(backdrop(obj), toindices(obj))) # Fill inner area
    duplicate = recolor(1, hmirror(crop(result, ulcorner(obj), (height(obj), width(obj))))) # Duplicate and recolor
    result = hconcat(result, duplicate) # Concatenate
  return result
```

**Explanation:**

This version replaces `shape(obj)` with `(height(obj), width(obj))` when cropping for the duplicate, demonstrating different DSL function usage.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  grid = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    for (i, j) in outbox(obj):
      grid = fill(grid, 4, {(i, j)}) # Outline object
    grid = underfill(grid, 6, difference(backdrop(obj), toindices(obj))) # Fill inner area
    duplicate = hmirror(crop(grid, ulcorner(obj), shape(obj))) 
    duplicate = recolor(1, duplicate) # Duplicate and recolor
    grid = hconcat(grid, duplicate) # Concatenate
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version outlines the object by iterating through the `outbox` indices and filling them individually.

These five versions provide a diverse set of solutions using different DSL function combinations and logic to achieve the same transformation. Each version should be tested with the provided inputs to verify their correctness and demonstrate a score of 0.
