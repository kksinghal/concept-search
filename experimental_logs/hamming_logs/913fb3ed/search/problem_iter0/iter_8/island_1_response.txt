## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all examples can be described as follows:

1. **Outline:** Draw a 1-pixel thick outline (value 6) around each distinct object (a group of connected, same-valued non-zero cells).
2. **Fill:** Fill the interior of each object with the value 1.
3. **Corners:**  Overwrite the corner pixels of the outline with the value 4.

**Example Breakdown:**

Let's look at Input_1 and Output_1 to understand:

**Input_1:**

```
0 0 0 3 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

**Output_1:**

```
0 0 6 6 6 0
0 0 6 3 6 0
0 0 6 6 6 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Here, the single '3' in the input is considered an object. The transformation outlines it with '6', fills its interior (which is just the single cell) with '3' itself, and overwrites the outline corners with '4'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), asobject(I)) # Base grid with objects
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = fill(O, SIX, box(obj)) # Outline
    O = underfill(O, ONE, delta(obj)) # Interior fill
    O = fill(O, FOUR, corners(box(obj))) # Corner overwrite
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Base Grid:** `paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), asobject(I))` creates a canvas of zeros the same size as the input and paints the input objects onto it.
2. **Object Iteration:** It iterates through each object in the input using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
3. **Outline:** `fill(O, SIX, box(obj))` draws the outline by filling the `box` (outline indices) of each object with '6'.
4. **Interior Fill:** `underfill(O, ONE, delta(obj))` fills the interior (`delta` - indices inside the box but not part of the object) with '1'.
5. **Corner Overwrite:** `fill(O, FOUR, corners(box(obj)))` overwrites the corner indices of the outline with '4'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))  # Empty canvas
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, delta(obj)))  # Fill interior first
    O = paint(O, recolor(SIX, box(obj)))  # Then draw the outline
    O = paint(O, recolor(FOUR, corners(box(obj)))) # Finally, the corners
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Empty Canvas:** Starts with an empty canvas of zeros.
2. **Interior First:** For each object, it first fills the interior (`delta`) with '1' using `recolor` and `paint`. 
3. **Outline:** Then it draws the outline ('6') over the interior.
4. **Corners Last:** Finally, it paints the corners ('4') over the outline, ensuring the desired final output.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), asobject(I))  # Base grid
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = fill(O, SIX, box(obj))  # Outline
    O = underfill(O, ONE,  backdrop(obj))  # Fill everything inside the box
    O = paint(O, recolor(FOUR, corners(obj))) # Corners directly from object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Similar Start:** Begins like Version 1 by creating a base grid with objects.
2. **Outline:** Draws the outline like before.
3. **Broad Fill:** Instead of `delta`, it uses `backdrop` to fill *all* indices within the object's bounding box with '1'.
4. **Direct Corners:** Uses `recolor` and `paint` to directly overwrite the corners of the original object with '4', as the outline corners now also have '1'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), asobject(I)) # Base grid
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    box_indices = box(obj) # Pre-compute box indices
    O = fill(O, SIX, box_indices) # Outline
    O = underfill(O, ONE, difference(backdrop(obj), box_indices)) # Fill inside, excluding outline
    O = fill(O, FOUR, corners(obj)) # Corners 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Pre-computation:** This version pre-computes the `box` indices for efficiency.
2. **Precise Fill:** It uses `difference` to fill only the interior, excluding the outline itself, with '1'. This avoids an unnecessary overwrite in the corners.
3. **Corners:**  Corners are handled like before.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) # Empty canvas
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != ZERO: # For each non-zero cell
        O = fill(O, SIX, box(initset((i, j)))) # Outline using a single-cell object
        O = underfill(O, ONE, initset((i, j))) # Fill the cell itself
  O = paint(O, recolor(FOUR, merge(apply(corners, objects(I, T, F, T))))) # All corners at the end
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Cell-by-Cell:** This version takes a different approach by iterating through each cell in the input grid.
2. **Single-Cell Objects:** For non-zero cells, it treats each cell as an individual object to draw outlines and fill.
3. **Corners at End:**  It collects all corner indices from all objects and overwrites them with '4' in one go at the end.


These five versions demonstrate different logic and DSL function combinations to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
