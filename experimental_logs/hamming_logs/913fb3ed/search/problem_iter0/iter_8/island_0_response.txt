## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation can be described as follows:

1. **Outline and Fill:** For each object in the input grid:
   - Draw a border (outline) around the object using the value '4'.
   - Fill the area inside the border but outside the object with the value '6'.
2. **Duplicate and Recolor:**
   - Create a horizontally mirrored copy of the original object.
   - Recolor this mirrored copy to have the value '1'.
3. **Concatenate:**
   - Concatenate the modified original grid with the mirrored and recolored copy horizontally.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  grid = I
  for obj in objects(grid, T, F, T):
    grid = fill(grid, 4, outbox(obj)) # Outline object
    grid = underfill(grid, 6, difference(backdrop(obj), toindices(obj))) # Fill inner area
    duplicate = recolor(1, hmirror(crop(grid, ulcorner(obj), shape(obj)))) # Duplicate and recolor
    grid = hconcat(grid, duplicate) # Concatenate
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version closely follows the identified transformation steps:

- **Outline and Fill:**  Uses `outbox` and `underfill` to outline the object with '4' and fill the inner area with '6'.
- **Duplicate and Recolor:** `hmirror` creates the horizontal mirror, `crop` extracts the original object from the grid (now with the border and fill), and `recolor` changes its color to '1'.
- **Concatenate:**  `hconcat` combines the modified original and the mirrored copy.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  result = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    result = underfill(result, 4, outbox(obj)) # Outline object
    result = underfill(result, 6, difference(backdrop(obj), toindices(obj))) # Fill inner area
    duplicate = recolor(1, hmirror(subgrid(obj, result))) # Duplicate and recolor
    result = hconcat(result, duplicate) # Concatenate
  return result
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 1 but uses `subgrid` instead of `crop` to extract the object for mirroring.

- **Outline and Fill:**  Same as Version 1.
- **Duplicate and Recolor:** Uses `subgrid` to directly extract the object based on its original bounding box. This avoids issues of accidentally copying the border or fill.
- **Concatenate:** Same as Version 1. 

## Program Version 3: 

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  grid = I
  for obj in objects(grid, T, F, T):
    grid = paint(fill(grid, 4, outbox(obj)), obj) # Outline and repaint object
    grid = underfill(grid, 6, difference(backdrop(obj), toindices(obj))) # Fill inner area
    duplicate = hmirror(crop(grid, ulcorner(obj), shape(obj))) 
    duplicate = replace(duplicate, color(obj), 1) # Duplicate and recolor
    grid = hconcat(grid, duplicate) # Concatenate
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version changes how the object is preserved during outlining.

- **Outline and Fill:** It first outlines using `fill` and `outbox`. Then, it uses `paint` to redraw the original object over the outline, ensuring it's not overwritten. 
- **Duplicate and Recolor:** Similar to Version 1 but uses `replace` to specifically change the color of the original object's value to '1' in the mirrored copy.
- **Concatenate:** Same as Version 1.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  result = I
  for obj in objects(result, T, F, T):
    result = fill(result, 4, outbox(obj)) # Outline object
    result = underfill(result, 6, difference(backdrop(obj), toindices(obj))) # Fill inner area
    duplicate = recolor(1, hmirror(crop(result, ulcorner(obj), (height(obj), width(obj))))) # Duplicate and recolor
    result = hconcat(result, duplicate) # Concatenate
  return result
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 1, but instead of `shape` function, it explicitly uses `height` and `width` to define the dimensions for `crop`.

- **Outline and Fill:** Same as Version 1.
- **Duplicate and Recolor:** Uses explicit `height(obj)` and `width(obj)` within `crop`.
- **Concatenate:** Same as Version 1.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  grid = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    for (i, j) in outbox(obj):
      grid = fill(grid, 4, {(i, j)}) # Outline object
    grid = underfill(grid, 6, difference(backdrop(obj), toindices(obj))) # Fill inner area
    duplicate = hmirror(crop(grid, ulcorner(obj), shape(obj))) 
    duplicate = recolor(1, duplicate) # Duplicate and recolor
    grid = hconcat(grid, duplicate) # Concatenate
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version modifies how the outlining is done. 

- **Outline and Fill:** Instead of filling the entire `outbox` at once, it iterates through each cell in the `outbox` and fills it individually.
- **Duplicate and Recolor:** Same as Version 1.
- **Concatenate:** Same as Version 1.
