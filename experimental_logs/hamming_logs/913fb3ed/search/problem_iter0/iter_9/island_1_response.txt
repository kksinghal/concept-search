## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (defined as connected areas of the same digit excluding the background color 0) and drawing a border around them with specific rules:

* **Border:** A single-cell thick border with the digit '6' surrounds each object.
* **Inner Fill:** The area directly inside the border is filled with the digit '4'.
* **Corners:** Corner cells of the inner fill are replaced with the digit '1'.

**Example Breakdown:**

Let's take Input_3 and Output_3 to illustrate:

**Input_3:**

```
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

1. **Object Detection:**  The digit '8' is identified as an object.

2. **Border:** A '6' border is drawn around the '8'.

```
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 6 6 6 0 0
0 6 8 6 0 0
0 6 6 6 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

3. **Inner Fill:** The area enclosed by the border is filled with '4'.

```
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 4 4 4 0 0
0 4 8 4 0 0
0 4 4 4 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

4. **Corners:** The corner cells of the inner fill are replaced with '1'. 

**Output_3:**

```
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 4 4 4 0 0
0 4 8 4 0 0
0 4 4 4 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct code versions for the "Program_to_be_generated":

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), asobject(I)) 
  for obj in objs:
    O = fill(O, SIX, box(obj)) # Draw the border
    O = underfill(O, FOUR, inbox(obj))  # Fill the inside of the border 
    O = underfill(O, ONE, corners(inbox(obj))) # Fill the corners
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Identify objects in the input grid `I` and create an output grid `O` identical to `I`.
2. **Border Drawing:**  For each object `obj`, draw a border with digit '6' using the `box` function.
3. **Inner Fill:** Fill the area inside the border with digit '4' using the `underfill` and `inbox` functions.
4. **Corner Marking:**  Replace corner cells of the inner fill with digit '1' using `underfill` and `corners` on the `inbox`.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = fill(O, SIX, box(obj)) # Draw the border
    O = fill(O, FOUR, difference(inbox(obj), corners(inbox(obj))))  # Fill non-corner cells inside
    O = fill(O, ONE, corners(inbox(obj))) # Fill the corners
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Identify objects in the input grid `I` and use `I` as the output grid `O`.
2. **Border Drawing:** Draw the border around each object with digit '6'.
3. **Inner Fill (Non-Corners):**  Fill the non-corner cells inside the border with digit '4' using `difference` to exclude corners.
4. **Corner Marking:** Fill the corner cells of the inner fill with digit '1'.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), asobject(I)) # Initialize output grid
  for obj in objs:
    for d in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:
      O = fill(O, SIX, shift(obj, d))  # Draw border lines by shifting object 
    O = underfill(O, FOUR, inbox(obj)) # Fill the inside
    corner_indices = frozenset({(i,j) for i,j in inbox(obj) if len(dneighbors((i,j)) & inbox(obj)) < 4})
    O = underfill(O, ONE, corner_indices)  # Fill corners based on neighbor count
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Border Drawing:** Draw the border by shifting the object in four directions and filling with '6'.
3. **Inner Fill:**  Similar to Version 1.
4. **Corner Detection & Marking:** Detect corners by counting direct neighbors within the `inbox` - corners have less than four. Fill corners with '1'.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(uppermost(obj) - 1, lowermost(obj) + 2):
      for j in range(leftmost(obj) - 1, rightmost(obj) + 2):
        if (i,j) in obj:
          continue
        if uppermost(obj) <= i <= lowermost(obj) and leftmost(obj) <= j <= rightmost(obj):
          if (i == uppermost(obj) + 1 and j == leftmost(obj) + 1) or \
             (i == uppermost(obj) + 1 and j == rightmost(obj) - 1) or \
             (i == lowermost(obj) - 1 and j == leftmost(obj) + 1) or \
             (i == lowermost(obj) - 1 and j == rightmost(obj) - 1):
            O = underfill(O, ONE, (i,j))
          else:
            O = underfill(O, FOUR, (i,j))
        else:
          O = underfill(O, SIX, (i,j))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 2.
2. **Iterate through Bounding Box:** Iterate through cells within the bounding box of each object.
3. **Conditional Filling:**
   - If the cell is part of the object, skip it.
   - If the cell is inside the border, fill with '4', except for corners which are filled with '1'.
   - If the cell is on the border, fill with '6'.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), asobject(I))
  for obj in objs:
    O = fill(O, SIX, box(obj)) # Border
    inner_area = difference(backdrop(obj), box(obj))
    O = underfill(O, FOUR, inner_area)  # Fill inside
    corner_indices = frozenset({
        (uppermost(obj) + 1, leftmost(obj) + 1),
        (uppermost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) - 1),
        (lowermost(obj) - 1, leftmost(obj) + 1),
        (lowermost(obj) - 1, rightmost(obj) - 1)
    })
    O = underfill(O, ONE, corner_indices)  # Explicitly fill corners
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Border Drawing:** Similar to previous versions.
3. **Inner Area Calculation:** Calculate the inner area by subtracting the border from the object's backdrop. 
4. **Inner Fill:**  Fill the calculated inner area with '4'.
5. **Explicit Corner Marking:** Explicitly define and fill the corner indices with '1'. 

These five program versions showcase different approaches to achieving the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic. They demonstrate the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
