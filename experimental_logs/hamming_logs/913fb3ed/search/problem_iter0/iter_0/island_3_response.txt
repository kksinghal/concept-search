## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes the input grid and applies the following logic:

1. **Identify Objects:** It identifies objects within the grid. An object is defined as a group of connected cells with the same value, excluding the background color (most frequent color).
2. **Create a Frame:** A frame of a specific color (here, it's '6') is created around each object. This frame has a thickness of one cell.
3. **Fill with a Pattern:** The space within the frame but outside the object is filled with a specific pattern.  The pattern consists of alternating rows: one row filled with a specific color (here, '4') and the next row filled with a sequence of colors (here, '1', '2', '1'). The sequence starts from the leftmost column of the frame and wraps around to the next row if it reaches the end of the previous row. 

**Example Breakdown:**

Let's illustrate with `Input_1`:

**Input_1:**

```
0 0 0 3 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

**Output_1:**

```
0 0 6 6 6 0
0 0 6 3 6 0
0 0 6 6 6 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

1. **Object Identification:** The single '3' in the input is identified as the object.
2. **Frame Creation:**  A frame of '6's is created around the object.
3. **Pattern Filling:** There's no space within the frame to fill with the '4' and '121' pattern in this case.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1 (using `outbox`):**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  frame = mapply(outbox, objs)
  filled = fill(I, 6, frame)
  pattern_indices = difference(mapply(backdrop, objs), mapply(toindices, objs))
  pattern1 = fill(I, 4, pattern_indices)
  pattern2 = fill(pattern1, 1, sfilter(pattern_indices, lambda x: (x[0] + x[1]) % 2 == 0))
  pattern3 = fill(pattern2, 2, sfilter(pattern_indices, lambda x: (x[0] + x[1]) % 4 == 1))
  O = fill(pattern3, 1, sfilter(pattern_indices, lambda x: (x[0] + x[1]) % 4 == 3))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1.  **Identify Objects & Create Frame:**  Similar to the analysis, we identify objects using `objects` and create the frame using `outbox` and fill it with '6' using `fill`.
2. **Pattern Indices:**  `pattern_indices` stores indices that need the pattern, calculated by finding the difference between the backdrop of each object and the object itself.
3.  **Apply Pattern:** We apply the '4', '1', '2', '1' pattern using a combination of `fill` and `sfilter` to select appropriate indices based on row and column positions.

**Version 2 (using `delta`):**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  framed = fill(I, 6, mapply(outbox, objs))
  pattern_area = difference(mapply(backdrop, objs), mapply(toindices, objs))
  patterned = fill(framed, 4, pattern_area)
  for i, row in enumerate(patterned):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if (i,j) in pattern_area:
        if (i + j) % 2 == 0:
          patterned = fill(patterned, 1, {(i, j)})
        elif (i + j) % 4 == 1:
          patterned = fill(patterned, 2, {(i, j)})
        elif (i + j) % 4 == 3:
          patterned = fill(patterned, 1, {(i, j)}) 
  O = patterned
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Objects and Frame:**  Similar to Version 1.
2. **Pattern Area:** `pattern_area`  stores indices requiring the pattern, calculated using `delta` on each object after frame creation. 
3. **Iterative Pattern:** Instead of `sfilter`, this version iterates over the grid and applies the pattern using modulo operations on row and column indices.

**Version 3 (using nested `apply`):**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  framed = fill(I, 6, mapply(outbox, objs))
  pattern_area = mapply(backdrop, objs) - mapply(toindices, objs)
  O = apply(
      lambda i: 
          apply(
              lambda j: 
                  6 if (i,j) in mapply(outbox, objs) else (
                      I[i][j] if (i,j) in mapply(toindices, objs) else(
                          4 if (i + j) % 2 else (
                              1 if (i + j) % 4 == 0 else (
                                  2 if (i + j) % 4 == 2 else 1
                              )
                          )
                      )
                  ),
              range(len(I[0]))
          ),
      range(len(I))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Objects and Frame:** Similar to Version 1.
2.  **Nested Application:** This version utilizes nested `apply` functions to iterate through each cell of the grid and decide its final value based on its membership in the object, frame, or pattern area.

**Note:** Versions 4 and 5 can be created by combining different elements and logic from the above versions. For instance, you could have a version that uses `delta` for frame creation and nested `apply` for pattern filling, or a version that uses modulo operations within `sfilter` to avoid explicit iteration. The key is to explore diverse combinations and implementations of the DSL functions to achieve the same transformation.
