## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to involve the following steps:

1. **Identifying Non-Background Objects:** The transformation focuses on objects formed by digits different from the background digit (most common digit in the grid).
2. **Creating a Surrounding Frame:**  A frame of a new digit (different from existing digits) is created around each non-background object.
3. **Specific Frame Shape:** The frame takes a specific shape, always forming a rectangle that encloses the object with a single-cell border.

**Input-Output Pair Examples:**

* **Input_0 & Output_0:** The digits 8, 3, and 2 are identified as non-background objects. Rectangular frames with the digit '6' are created around each.
* **Input_1 & Output_1:**  A frame of '6' is created around the '3'.
* **Input_2 & Output_2:** Frames of '6' and '1' are created around '3' and '2' respectively.
* **Input_3 & Output_3:** A frame of '4' is created around the '8'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the described transformation:


**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  framed_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(6, outbox(toindices(obj))), objs) 
  O = paint(I, framed_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:**  Identifies all non-background objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`framed_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(6, outbox(toindices(obj))), objs)`:** 
    *  `toindices(obj)`: Converts each object into a set of its cell indices.
    *  `outbox(...)`: Generates the indices of the outer frame surrounding the object.
    *  `recolor(6, ...)`:  Assigns the digit '6' to all indices of the outer frame.
    *  `mapply(...)`:  Applies the above steps to each object in `objs`.
3. **`O = paint(I, framed_objs)`:** Paints the generated frames (with digit '6') onto the original input grid `I`, resulting in the output grid `O`.


**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    O = fill(O, 6, outbox(toindices(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid `O` with the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in fgpartition(I):`:** Iterates over each non-background object.
3. **`O = fill(O, 6, outbox(toindices(obj)))`:** For each object, fills the output grid `O` with the digit '6' at the indices corresponding to the object's outer frame.


**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  frame_color = 6
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    O = paint(fill(O, frame_color, outbox(toindices(obj))), obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`frame_color = 6`:** Defines the digit used for the frame.
2. **`O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates an empty canvas `O` of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
3. **`for obj in fgpartition(I):`:**  Iterates through each non-background object.
4. **`O = paint(fill(O, frame_color, outbox(toindices(obj))), obj)`:** For each object:
   *  Fills the outer frame on the canvas with the frame color.
   *  Paints the original object onto the canvas.


**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    top_left = subtract(ulcorner(obj), (1,1))
    bottom_right = add(lrcorner(obj), (1,1))
    for i in range(top_left[0], bottom_right[0] + 1):
      for j in range(top_left[1], bottom_right[1] + 1):
        if (i,j) not in toindices(obj):
          O = fill(O, 6, {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:**  Identifies non-background objects.
2. **`O = I`:**  Initializes the output grid.
3. **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterates through each object.
4. **`top_left/bottom_right`:** Calculates the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners of the frame.
5. **`for i... for j...`:**  Iterates through each cell within the frame's bounding box.
6. **`if (i,j) not in toindices(obj):`:** If the cell is not part of the object itself, it's filled with the frame digit '6'.


**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def frame_object(obj):
    return recolor(6, difference(backdrop(obj), toindices(obj)))
  
  framed_objects = mapply(frame_object, fgpartition(I))
  O = paint(I, framed_objects)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def frame_object(obj): ...`:** Defines a helper function to create a frame around a single object. It calculates the difference between the backdrop and the object's indices and recolors it with '6'.
2. **`framed_objects = mapply(frame_object, fgpartition(I))`:** Applies the `frame_object` function to each non-background object in the input.
3. **`O = paint(I, framed_objects)`:**  Paints the framed objects onto the input grid, generating the output grid.

These five program versions showcase different approaches and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and diversity possible within the given DSL.
