## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected components of the same digit) in the input grid and drawing a box around them in the output grid. The box uses the following color scheme for its corners:

* **Top Left:** 6
* **Top Right:** 4
* **Bottom Left:** 6
* **Bottom Right:** 1 

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:**  The input grid has three objects (8, 3, 2). The output grid shows boxes drawn around these objects using the designated corner colors.

**Pair 1:** Similar to Pair 0, a box is drawn around the object '3' using the corner color scheme.

**Pair 2:**  This example reinforces the pattern observed in the previous pairs. A box encloses the objects '3' and '2' with the correct corner colors.

**Pair 3:** This example demonstrates that even when objects are adjacent, individual boxes are drawn around each object ('8' and its adjacent '4's).


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL functions to achieve the described transformation:

**Version 1: (Inspired by `objects` and corner functions)**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = fill(O, SIX, {ulcorner(obj)})
    O = fill(O, FOUR, {urcorner(obj)})
    O = fill(O, SIX, {llcorner(obj)})
    O = fill(O, ONE, {lrcorner(obj)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all connected components in the input grid (`I`) as individual objects.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** The program iterates through each `obj` and uses the corner functions (`ulcorner`, `urcorner`, `llcorner`, `lrcorner`) to get the corner indices of the object's bounding box. It then uses `fill` to color these corners with the specified values (6, 4, 6, 1) on the output grid (`O`).

**Version 2: (Inspired by `objects` and `box`)**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    box_indices = box(obj)
    for i, j in box_indices:
      if (i, j) == ulcorner(box_indices): O = fill(O, SIX, {(i, j)})
      elif (i, j) == urcorner(box_indices): O = fill(O, FOUR, {(i, j)})
      elif (i, j) == llcorner(box_indices): O = fill(O, SIX, {(i, j)})
      elif (i, j) == lrcorner(box_indices): O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Objects and Boxes:**  Similar to Version 1, it identifies objects. Then, for each object, it uses `box(obj)` to get the indices of its bounding box.
2. **Iterate and Color:**  It iterates through the `box_indices` and for each index, checks if it corresponds to one of the corners using comparison. If so, it fills the corresponding corner on the output grid (`O`) with the specific color.

**Version 3: (Inspired by `objects` and conditional logic)**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if i == uppermost(obj) and j == leftmost(obj): O = fill(O, SIX, {(i, j)})
      if i == uppermost(obj) and j == rightmost(obj): O = fill(O, FOUR, {(i, j)})
      if i == lowermost(obj) and j == leftmost(obj): O = fill(O, SIX, {(i, j)})
      if i == lowermost(obj) and j == rightmost(obj): O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Iteration:** This version iterates directly through the cells of each identified object using `toindices(obj)`.
2. **Conditional Coloring:**  For each cell `(i, j)`, it checks if it corresponds to one of the corner conditions using `uppermost`, `lowermost`, `leftmost`, and `rightmost`. If a condition is met, the corresponding corner on the output grid (`O`) is colored.

**Version 4: (Inspired by `partition` and `box`)**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = partition(I)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) != mostcolor(I):
      box_indices = box(obj)
      O = fill(O, SIX, {ulcorner(box_indices)})
      O = fill(O, FOUR, {urcorner(box_indices)})
      O = fill(O, SIX, {llcorner(box_indices)})
      O = fill(O, ONE, {lrcorner(box_indices)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partitioning:**  Instead of `objects`, this version utilizes `partition(I)` to group cells with the same value. 
2. **Background Exclusion:**  It iterates through the partitions (objects) and uses `color(obj) != mostcolor(I)` to avoid drawing boxes around the background color.
3. **Box Drawing:** The remaining steps are identical to Version 2, using `box` and corner functions to draw the box with the designated colors.

**Version 5: (Inspired by `fgpartition` and `box`)**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    box_indices = box(obj)
    O = fill(O, SIX, {ulcorner(box_indices)})
    O = fill(O, FOUR, {urcorner(box_indices)})
    O = fill(O, SIX, {llcorner(box_indices)})
    O = fill(O, ONE, {lrcorner(box_indices)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Foreground Partitioning:**  This version uses `fgpartition(I)` to directly obtain objects without the background.
2. **Box Drawing:** Similar to Version 4, it iterates through the objects and uses `box` and corner functions to draw boxes around them.


These five versions demonstrate diverse ways to achieve the target transformation using the DSL, each with its own logic and function combinations.
