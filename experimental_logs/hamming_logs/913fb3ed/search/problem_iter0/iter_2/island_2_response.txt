## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

1. **Identify Non-Background Objects:**  Identify all connected components of non-background pixels in the input grid. The background color is the most frequent color in the grid. 
2. **Draw Outbox:** Draw a rectangular outline (outbox) around each identified object. The outline color is always 6.
3. **Fill Below:** For each object, fill the area below its outbox with color 1, extending to the leftmost column of the grid.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions for "Program_to_be_generated" that implement the described transformation:

**Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  outboxed_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(6, outbox(toindices(obj))), objs)
  filled_area = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(1, 
                        difference(
                          product(interval(0,lowermost(obj)+1,1), interval(0,len(I[0]),1)), 
                          backdrop(toindices(obj))
                        )), objs)
  O = paint(paint(I, outboxed_objs), filled_area)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to the previous programs, `fgpartition(I)` identifies non-background objects.
2. **Draw Outbox:** `outboxed_objs` uses `mapply` to apply `recolor(6, outbox(toindices(obj)))` to each object, outlining it in color 6.
3. **Fill Below:**  `filled_area` calculates the area to fill by:
    * Generating all indices below the object's lowermost point using `product` and `interval`.
    * Subtracting the object's backdrop from the generated area using `difference`, leaving only the area below the outbox to be filled.
    * Finally, it recolors this area with 1.
4. **Combine:** The output `O` is obtained by painting the outboxes (`outboxed_objs`) and the filled area (`filled_area`) onto the original image `I`.

**Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, outbox(toindices(obj))))
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, difference(hfrontier((i,0)), toindices(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Uses `fgpartition(I)` as before.
2. **Iterate and Transform:** Iterates through each object (`obj` in `objs`):
    * Draws the outbox using `paint` and `recolor` as in previous versions.
    * Iterates through rows from the object's uppermost to lowermost points.
    * For each row, it fills the entire horizontal line (`hfrontier`) starting from the leftmost column (`(i,0)`) with color 1, except for the indices that are part of the object itself (using `difference`). 

**Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value != mostcommon(I):
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, outbox({(i, j)})))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(k, l) for k in range(i+1, len(I)) for l in range(len(I[0]))}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Cells:** Iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Identify Non-Background:**  Checks if the cell value is not the background color (`mostcommon(I)`).
3. **Draw Outbox and Fill:** If it's not background:
    * It draws the outbox around the single cell using `recolor` and `outbox`.
    * It fills all cells below the current row (`i+1` onwards) with color 1.

**Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  O = paint(I, mapply(lambda obj: recolor(6, outbox(toindices(obj))), objs))
  bottom_row = maximum({lowermost(obj) for obj in objs})
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, difference(product(interval(0,bottom_row+1,1), interval(0,len(I[0]),1)), 
                                        merge(apply(toindices, objs)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Outboxes:**  Identifies objects and draws outboxes as in previous versions.
2. **Find Global Bottom Row:** Determines the bottommost row across all objects using `maximum` and `lowermost`.
3. **Fill Below All Objects:**  Fills the entire area below the global bottom row with color 1, excluding all object indices (using `difference`, `merge`, and `apply`).

**Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(len(I[0])):
    for i in range(len(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I):
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, outbox({(i,j)})))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, connect((i+1, 0), (i+1, len(I[0])-1))))
        break 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Column-wise:**  Iterates through the grid column by column.
2. **Find First Non-Background:**  For each column, it finds the first non-background pixel. 
3. **Draw Outbox and Fill:**  When a non-background pixel is found:
    * It draws the outbox around the pixel.
    * It fills the entire row below the pixel with color 1 using `connect` to create a horizontal line.
    * It then moves on to the next column (`break`).

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieving the desired transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic. They demonstrate the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for image manipulation tasks.
