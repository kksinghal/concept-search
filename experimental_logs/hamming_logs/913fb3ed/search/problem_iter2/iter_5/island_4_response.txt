## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently recolors objects based on their color values. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** Objects with color `6` are recolored to `4`, and objects with color `2` are recolored to `1`.

**Pair 1:** No change in colors.

**Pair 2:** Similar to Pair 0, objects with color `6` are recolored to `1`, and objects with color `2` are recolored to `2` (effectively no change for color `2`).

**Pair 3:** Objects with color `6` are recolored to `4`.


## Code Generation:

Based on the analysis, we need to write a program that selectively recolors objects based on a mapping. Here are five distinct versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  This version uses a dictionary to map old colors to new colors.
  It directly iterates through the objects and recolors them based on the mapping.
  """
  color_map = {6: 4, 2: 1}  # Define the color mapping
  recolored_grid = I
  for obj in fgpartition(I):  # Iterate over foreground objects
    old_color = color(obj)
    if old_color in color_map:
      recolored_grid = paint(recolored_grid, recolor(color_map[old_color], obj))
  return recolored_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`color_map`**:  A dictionary defines the color transformation rules (e.g., 6 becomes 4).
2.  **`fgpartition(I)`**: Extracts foreground objects from the input grid.
3.  **Iterate and Recolor**:  The program iterates through each foreground object. If the object's color is in the `color_map`, it recolors the object on the grid using the corresponding new color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  This version uses the 'mfilter' function to filter and recolor objects 
  based on their color. It applies a lambda function for the recoloring logic.
  """
  return paint(I, mfilter(
    fgpartition(I),
    lambda obj: branch(color(obj) == 6, recolor(4, obj),
                  branch(color(obj) == 2, recolor(1, obj), obj))
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`fgpartition(I)`**: Extracts foreground objects.
2.  **`mfilter` with Lambda**: Filters the objects and applies a lambda function to each. The lambda function checks the color and applies the appropriate recoloring using nested `branch` statements. If the color is neither 6 nor 2, the object remains unchanged.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  This version uses nested 'apply' functions to first recolor all objects 
  with color '6' to '4' and then recolors objects with color '2' to '1'. 
  """
  grid_step1 = paint(I, apply(lambda obj: recolor(4, obj) if color(obj) == 6 else obj, fgpartition(I)))
  grid_step2 = paint(grid_step1, apply(lambda obj: recolor(1, obj) if color(obj) == 2 else obj, fgpartition(grid_step1)))
  return grid_step2
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`grid_step1`**: Recolors objects with color `6` to `4` using `apply` and a lambda function.
2.  **`grid_step2`**: Takes the result from `grid_step1` and recolors objects with color `2` to `1` similarly.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  This version utilizes the 'replace' function for a more direct color substitution approach.
  """
  recolored_grid = replace(I, 6, 4)  # Replace 6 with 4
  recolored_grid = replace(recolored_grid, 2, 1)  # Replace 2 with 1
  return recolored_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Direct Replacement**: This version directly uses the `replace` function to substitute color `6` with `4` and then color `2` with `1`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  This version leverages the 'switch' function 
  to handle color swapping efficiently.
  """
  recolored_grid = switch(I, 6, 4) # Switch colors 6 and 4
  return recolored_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Efficient Swapping**: This version directly utilizes the `switch` function to swap color `6` with `4`. This is the most efficient approach for this specific transformation as it avoids unnecessary iterations or filtering.
