## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consists of two parts:

**1. Square Transformation:** 

- This transformation targets cells with the value `8`. 
- For each `8`, it recolors the surrounding 3x3 area (including the `8` itself) to `4`.

**2. Line Transformation:**

- This transformation targets horizontal lines of `2`s. 
- Each `2` in such a line is replaced with `1`. 
- If a `2` in the line is preceded by an `8` (in the original input), it remains `2`.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  # Square Transformation
  O = paint(I, recolor(FOUR, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, add(loc, (ONE, ONE))) == EIGHT)))
  
  # Line Transformation
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == TWO and j > 0 and row[j-1] == TWO:
        if I[i][j-1] == EIGHT:
          O = paint(O, {(TWO, (i, j))})
        else:
          O = paint(O, {(ONE, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Square Transformation:** We use `mfilter` to find all locations in the grid where the diagonally adjacent cell (bottom-right) has the value `8`. Then, we recolor the entire 3x3 area around each of these locations to `4` using `recolor` and `paint`.
2. **Line Transformation:** We iterate through each cell in the grid. If a cell has the value `2`, and its left neighbor also has the value `2`, we check the original input (`I`). If the left neighbor in the original input was `8`, the current cell remains `2`; otherwise, it's recolored to `1`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  # Square Transformation
  O = I
  for i in range(1, len(I)-1):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0])-1):
      if I[i][j] == EIGHT:
        O = fill(O, FOUR, {(i-1, j-1), (i-1, j), (i-1, j+1), (i, j-1), (i, j), (i, j+1), (i+1, j-1), (i+1, j), (i+1, j+1)})
  
  # Line Transformation
  objs = objects(O, False, False, False)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == TWO and hline(obj):
      for x, y in toindices(obj):
        if index(I, (x, y - 1)) != EIGHT:
          O = paint(O, {(ONE, (x, y))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Square Transformation:** This version iterates through the grid and directly fills a 3x3 area with `4` around each `8` using `fill`.
2. **Line Transformation:** This version identifies horizontal lines of `2`s using `objects` and `hline`. For each cell in these lines, it checks the original input. If the cell's left neighbor in the original input was not `8`, the cell is recolored to `1`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  # Square Transformation 
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for i in range(1, len(I)-1):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0])-1):
      if I[i][j] == EIGHT:
        O = paint(O, recolor(FOUR, {(i-1, j-1), (i-1, j), (i-1, j+1), (i, j-1), (i, j), (i, j+1), (i+1, j-1), (i+1, j), (i+1, j+1)}))
  O = paint(O, recolor(EIGHT, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == EIGHT)))

  # Line Transformation
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j in range(1, len(row)):
      if row[j] == TWO and row[j-1] == TWO:
        O = paint(O, {(ONE, (i, j)) if I[i][j-1] != EIGHT else (TWO, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Square Transformation:** This version initializes an empty canvas and paints the 3x3 areas around `8`s onto it. It also paints the original `8`s back onto the canvas.
2. **Line Transformation:** Similar to version 1, but uses a conditional expression within `paint` to handle the recoloring based on the original input.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  # Square Transformation
  O = I
  squares = prapply(lambda i, j: intersection({(i-1, j-1), (i-1, j), (i-1, j+1), (i, j-1), (i, j), (i, j+1), (i+1, j-1), (i+1, j), (i+1, j+1)}, asindices(I)) if I[i][j] == EIGHT else {}, range(1, len(I)-1), range(1, len(I[0])-1))
  O = paint(O, recolor(FOUR, merge(squares)))
  
  # Line Transformation
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(1, len(I[i])):
      if I[i][j] == TWO and I[i][j-1] == TWO:
        if I[i][j-1] != EIGHT:
          O = paint(O, {(ONE, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Square Transformation:**  This version uses `prapply` to apply a lambda function on every cell of the input grid. The lambda function checks if the cell value is 8 and if yes, returns a set of surrounding indices; otherwise returns an empty set. Then it merges all the sets and recolors them to 4.
2. **Line Transformation:** Similar to Version 2, but instead of using objects it directly iterates through cells and performs recoloring.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  # Square Transformation
  O = paint(I, recolor(FOUR, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, add(loc, (ONE, ONE))) == EIGHT)))

  # Line Transformation
  lines = objects(I, False, False, False)
  for line in lines:
    if color(line) == TWO and hline(line):
      O = paint(O, 
                combine(
                  recolor(TWO, mfilter(toindices(line), lambda loc: index(I, (loc[0], loc[1]-1)) == EIGHT)),
                  recolor(ONE, mfilter(toindices(line), lambda loc: index(I, (loc[0], loc[1]-1)) != EIGHT))
                )
              )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Square Transformation:** Uses the same logic as version 1 and 4.
2. **Line Transformation:** Identifies the horizontal lines of 2s. For each such line, it uses `mfilter` to find locations where the left neighbor in the original input was `8` and recolors them to `2` and the remaining locations to `1`. Finally, it combines both sets and paints them onto the output grid.

These five versions showcase different approaches and DSL function combinations to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating diversity in code generation.
