## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves two distinct operations:

**1. Square Transformation:**

- **Input:** Any occurrence of the digit '8'.
- **Output:** A 3x3 square of the digit '4' is drawn, centered on the location of the '8'.

**2. Line Transformation:**

- **Input:**  Horizontal lines formed by the digit '2'.
- **Output:**  The '2's are replaced by a combination of '1's and a single '2':
    - All positions occupied by the '2's in the input are replaced with '1's in the output.
    - The center position of the line in the output retains the digit '2'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions for the transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  # Square Transformation
  O = paint(I, recolor(FOUR, mpapply(lambda loc: backdrop(shift(asindices(canvas(ZERO, (THREE, THREE))), subtract(loc, (ONE, ONE)))), ofcolor(I, EIGHT))))

  # Line Transformation
  for loc in ofcolor(I, TWO):
    start = (loc[0], leftmost(ofcolor(I, TWO)))
    end = (loc[0], rightmost(ofcolor(I, TWO)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, connect(start, end)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, frozenset({loc})))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Square Transformation:**
   - `ofcolor(I, EIGHT)` identifies the locations of all '8's in the input.
   - For each location `loc`, we calculate the backdrop of a 3x3 square centered at `loc` using a combination of `canvas`, `asindices`, `shift`, `subtract`, and `backdrop`.
   - `mpapply` applies this operation to all '8' locations and merges the resulting indices.
   - `recolor` changes the color of these indices to '4'.
   - `paint` applies this change to a copy of the input grid `I`.

2. **Line Transformation:**
   - `ofcolor(I, TWO)` identifies locations of all '2's.
   - For each location `loc`, the leftmost and rightmost points of the line are found using `leftmost` and `rightmost`.
   - `connect` generates indices for a line between the start and end points.
   - This line is recolored to '1' and painted onto the grid.
   - Finally, the original `loc` (center of the line) is recolored to '2' and painted.


**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  # Square Transformation (Same as Version 1)
  O = paint(I, recolor(FOUR, mpapply(lambda loc: backdrop(shift(asindices(canvas(ZERO, (THREE, THREE))), subtract(loc, (ONE, ONE)))), ofcolor(I, EIGHT)))) 

  # Line Transformation
  for row in range(len(I)):
    line_start = None
    line_end = None
    for col in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[row][col] == TWO:
        if line_start is None:
          line_start = col
        line_end = col
    if line_start is not None:
      O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, connect((row, line_start), (row, line_end))))
      O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, frozenset({(row, (line_start + line_end) // 2)})))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses a similar approach to Version 1, but the line transformation is implemented differently. 
- Instead of using DSL functions to find the leftmost and rightmost points, it iterates through each row, detecting the start and end positions of '2' lines.  
- It then calculates the center point for the '2' placement.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  # Square Transformation (Same as Version 1)
  O = paint(I, recolor(FOUR, mpapply(lambda loc: backdrop(shift(asindices(canvas(ZERO, (THREE, THREE))), subtract(loc, (ONE, ONE)))), ofcolor(I, EIGHT))))

  # Line Transformation
  lines = objects(replace(I, ONE, TWO), univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  for line in lines:
    if color(line) == TWO:
      O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, toindices(line)))
      O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, frozenset({centerofmass(line)})))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version leverages the `objects` function to identify lines of '2's.
- First, it temporarily replaces all '1's with '2's in the input grid using `replace`.
- Then, it uses `objects` with appropriate parameters to identify horizontal lines formed by the now-connected '2's.
- For each identified line, it recolors the entire line to '1' and places a '2' at the center of mass of the line.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  # Square Transformation (Same as Version 1)
  O = paint(I, recolor(FOUR, mpapply(lambda loc: backdrop(shift(asindices(canvas(ZERO, (THREE, THREE))), subtract(loc, (ONE, ONE)))), ofcolor(I, EIGHT))))

  # Line Transformation 
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
      for j in range(len(row) - 1):
          if row[j] == TWO and row[j + 1] == TWO:
              start = j
              while start >= 0 and row[start] == TWO:
                  start -= 1
              end = j + 1
              while end < len(row) and row[end] == TWO:
                  end += 1
              O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, connect((i, start + 1), (i, end))))
              O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, frozenset({(i, (start + 1 + end) // 2)})))
              break 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates through the grid, checking for adjacent '2's to identify lines.
- Once a line is detected, it expands in both directions to find the start and end points.
- It then proceeds similar to Version 2, recoloring the line and placing the '2' at the center.
- The `break` statement optimizes the process by moving to the next row once a line is processed. 

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  # Square Transformation (Same as Version 1)
  O = paint(I, recolor(FOUR, mpapply(lambda loc: backdrop(shift(asindices(canvas(ZERO, (THREE, THREE))), subtract(loc, (ONE, ONE)))), ofcolor(I, EIGHT))))

  # Line Transformation
  for loc in ofcolor(I, TWO):
    left_end = extract(hfrontier(loc), lambda l: index(I, l) != TWO)
    right_end = extract(hfrontier(loc), lambda l: index(I, l) != TWO and l[1] > loc[1])
    if left_end is not None and right_end is not None:
      O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, connect((loc[0], left_end[1] + 1), (loc[0], right_end[1]))))
      O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, frozenset({(loc[0], (left_end[1] + 1 + right_end[1]) // 2)})))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses `hfrontier` to get the horizontal line containing each '2'.
- `extract` function is then used to find the left and right ends of the continuous '2' segment.
- The rest of the logic is similar to previous versions, with the line being recolored and the '2' placed at the center. 


These five program versions provide diverse solutions to the given transformation problem. Each version utilizes a distinct combination of DSL functions and logic, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
