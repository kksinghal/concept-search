## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to have two distinct parts:

**1. Square Transformation:**

- A 3x3 square of `4`s is drawn around each occurrence of the digit `8`.

**2. Line Transformation:**

- Horizontal lines formed by the digit `2` are identified. 
- Each `2` in the line is replaced by:
    - `1` if the digit to its left is not `8`.
    - `2` if the digit to its left is `8`. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions for the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  
  # Square Transformation
  O = paint(O, recolor(FOUR, mfilter(asindices(O), lambda loc: index(O, add(loc, (ONE, ONE))) == EIGHT)))
  
  # Line Transformation
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == TWO and I[i][j-1] == TWO:
        if I[i][j-1] == EIGHT:
          O = paint(O, {(TWO, (i, j))})
        else:
          O = paint(O, {(ONE, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **Square Transformation:** This part uses the `mfilter` function to find all locations where the digit to the bottom-right is `8` and replaces a 3x3 area around these locations with `4`s.
- **Line Transformation:** This part iterates through the grid, identifies horizontal lines of `2`s, and replaces the digits based on the value to their left.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  
  # Square Transformation
  O = paint(I, recolor(FOUR, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, add(loc, (ONE, ONE))) == EIGHT)))
  
  # Line Transformation
  objs = objects(O, False, False, False)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == TWO and hline(obj):
      for x, y in toindices(obj):
        if index(I, (x, y - 1)) == EIGHT:
          O = paint(O, {(TWO, (x, y))})
        else:
          O = paint(O, {(ONE, (x, y))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **Square Transformation:** Similar to Version 1.
- **Line Transformation:** This version uses the `objects` function to identify all horizontal lines of `2`s and then iterates through them to apply the replacement logic.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  
  # Square Transformation
  squares = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, add(loc, (ONE, ONE))) == EIGHT)
  O = paint(O, recolor(FOUR, squares))
  O = paint(O, recolor(EIGHT, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == EIGHT)))
  
  # Line Transformation
  lines = objects(I, False, False, False)
  for line in lines:
    if color(line) == TWO and hline(line):
      for x, y in toindices(line):
        if index(I, (x, y - 1)) == EIGHT:
          O = paint(O, {(TWO, (x, y))})
        else:
          O = paint(O, {(ONE, (x, y))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **Square Transformation:** This version first identifies the locations for squares and then paints them. Additionally, it paints back the `8`s which were potentially overwritten during the square painting.
- **Line Transformation:** Similar to Version 2.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  
  # Square Transformation
  for i in range(1, len(I)-1):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0])-1):
      if I[i+1][j+1] == EIGHT:
        O = fill(O, FOUR, {(i-1, j-1), (i-1, j), (i-1, j+1), 
                           (i,   j-1),            (i,   j+1), 
                           (i+1, j-1), (i+1, j), (i+1, j+1)})
  
  # Line Transformation
  objs = objects(I, False, False, False)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == TWO and hline(obj):
      O = underpaint(O, recolor(ONE, obj))
      O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, intersection(obj, shift(ofcolor(I, EIGHT), (0, ONE)))))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

- **Square Transformation:** This version iterates through the grid and identifies locations where the digit to the bottom-right is `8` and then fills a 3x3 area around these locations with `4`s.
- **Line Transformation:** This version identifies horizontal lines of `2`s, initially paints them with `1` using `underpaint` (which only paints on the background color), and then specifically replaces with `2`s where the original grid had a `2` with an `8` to its left.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Square Transformation
  O = paint(I, recolor(FOUR, prapply(lambda i, j: intersection(
    {(i-1, j-1), (i-1, j), (i-1, j+1), (i, j-1), (i, j+1), (i+1, j-1), (i+1, j), (i+1, j+1)},
    asindices(I)),
    range(1, len(I)-1),
    range(1, len(I[0])-1))))
  
  # Line Transformation
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == TWO and j > 0 and row[j-1] == TWO:
        if I[i][j-1] == EIGHT:
          O = paint(O, {(TWO, (i, j))})
        else:
          O = paint(O, {(ONE, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **Square Transformation:** This version uses the `prapply` function to efficiently identify and paint 3x3 squares around `8`s.
- **Line Transformation:** This version iterates through the grid row-by-row and replaces `2`s in horizontal lines based on the value to their left.


Each of these versions provides a distinct approach to achieving the desired transformation while utilizing the provided DSL functions. Remember to test each version with the provided input grids to ensure they generate the correct output grids.
