## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves two distinct operations:

**1. Square Transformation:**  A 3x3 square of value `4` is drawn centered around each occurrence of value `8`.

**2. Line Transformation:** Each continuous horizontal line of value `2` is transformed into a line of value `1`. If the line contains an `8`, the `8` is replaced with a `2`.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  
  # Square Transformation
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == EIGHT and 0 < i < h - 1 and 0 < j < w - 1:
        O = fill(O, FOUR, {(i-1, j-1), (i-1, j), (i-1, j+1), 
                           (i,   j-1),            (i,   j+1), 
                           (i+1, j-1), (i+1, j), (i+1, j+1)})
  
  # Line Transformation
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(1, w):
      if I[i][j] == TWO and I[i][j-1] == TWO:
        O = paint(O, {(ONE, (i, j))})
      if I[i][j] == EIGHT and I[i][j-1] == TWO:
        O = paint(O, {(TWO, (i, j))})

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Square Transformation:** Iterates through the grid and replaces the surrounding cells of `8` with `4`.
2. **Line Transformation:** Iterates through the grid. If a `2` is preceded by another `2` on the same row, it's replaced with `1`. If an `8` is preceded by a `2` on the same row, the `8` is replaced with a `2`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  
  # Square Transformation
  O = paint(O, recolor(FOUR, mfilter(asindices(O), lambda loc: index(O, add(loc, (ONE, ONE))) == EIGHT)))
  
  # Line Transformation
  objs = objects(I, False, False, False)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == TWO and hline(obj):
      for x, y in toindices(obj):
        if I[x][y] == EIGHT:
          O = paint(O, {(TWO, (x, y))})
        else:
          O = paint(O, {(ONE, (x, y))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Square Transformation:** Uses `mfilter` and `asindices` to find the center cells of the 3x3 squares around `8` and recolors them to `4`.
2. **Line Transformation:** Extracts objects from the grid and checks for horizontal lines of `2`s. Replaces each cell in the line with `1` except for `8` which gets replaced by `2`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
  # Square Transformation
  O = paint(I, recolor(FOUR, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, add(loc, (ONE, ONE))) == EIGHT)))

  # Line Transformation
  objs = objects(O, False, False, False)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == TWO and hline(obj):
      O = underpaint(O, recolor(ONE, obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Square Transformation:**  Same as Version 2.
2. **Line Transformation:** Extracts objects and uses `underpaint` to replace `2`s with `1`s, ensuring only the original line is modified.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I

  # Square Transformation
  for loc in ofcolor(I, EIGHT):
    O = paint(O, recolor(FOUR, backdrop(shift(asindices(canvas(ZERO, (THREE, THREE))), subtract(loc, (ONE, ONE))))))

  # Line Transformation
  for i in range(len(I)):
    O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, frozenset((i,j) for j in range(len(I[0])) if (i, j) in ofcolor(O, TWO))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Square Transformation:**  Same as in Program_A.
2. **Line Transformation:**  Iterates through rows and uses `ofcolor` to find `2`s, recoloring them to `1`s.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
  # Square Transformation
  O = paint(I, recolor(FOUR, mapply(lambda loc: backdrop(shift(asindices(canvas(ZERO, (THREE, THREE))), subtract(loc, (ONE, ONE)))), ofcolor(I, EIGHT))))
  
  # Line Transformation
  for row_index, row in enumerate(I):
    line_start = None
    for col_index, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == TWO and line_start is None:
        line_start = col_index
      elif value != TWO and line_start is not None:
        O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, frozenset((row_index, j) for j in range(line_start, col_index))))
        line_start = None
    if line_start is not None:
      O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, frozenset((row_index, j) for j in range(line_start, len(row)))))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Square Transformation:** Uses `mapply` to apply the square drawing logic to all occurrences of `8`.
2. **Line Transformation:** Iterates through each row and keeps track of the starting index of a line of `2`s. Once the line ends, it recolors the segment to `1`s.

These five versions showcase different ways to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL, demonstrating diverse logic and function combinations.
