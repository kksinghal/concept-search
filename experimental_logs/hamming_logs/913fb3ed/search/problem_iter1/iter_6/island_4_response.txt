## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves the following steps:

**1. Outlining:** All non-background objects are outlined with the color '6'. This outline excludes the corner cells.

**2. Vertical Shift:** Objects with color '8' and '2' are shifted one cell downwards.

**3. Horizontal Lines:** Horizontal lines of color '1' are drawn extending from the left and right edges of the shifted '2' objects. These lines stop at the object's outline.

**4. Square Expansion:** Objects with color '8' are expanded into a 3x3 square of color '4', centered on the original object's center of mass.

Let's break down how this transformation applies to each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
- The '8' object is shifted down, outlined, and expanded into a 3x3 square of '4'.
- The '2' object is shifted down, outlined, and has horizontal lines of '1' added.
- The '3' object is only outlined.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- The '3' object is only outlined.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
- The '3' object is only outlined.
- The '2' object is shifted down, outlined, and has horizontal lines of '1' added.

**Input_3 -> Output_3:**
- The '8' object is outlined and expanded into a 3x3 square of '4'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code in the provided DSL:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def transform_object(obj):
    obj_color = color(obj)
    obj_indices = toindices(obj)
    return merge([
        recolor(6, outbox(obj_indices) - corners(obj_indices)),
        recolor(obj_color, shift(obj_indices, DOWN)) if obj_color in [8, 2] else obj,
        recolor(1, (shift(obj_indices, LEFT) | shift(obj_indices, RIGHT)) - recolor(6, outbox(obj_indices))) if obj_color == 2 else frozenset(),
        recolor(4, backdrop(shift(asindices(canvas(8, (3, 3))), subtract(centerofmass(obj_indices), (1, 1))))) if obj_color == 8 else frozenset()
    ])
  return paint(I, merge(apply(transform_object, fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`transform_object(obj)`:** This function takes an object as input and applies the transformations: outlining, shifting, line drawing, and square expansion. 
2. **`fgpartition(I)`:** This partitions the input grid into foreground objects, excluding the background.
3. **`apply(transform_object, fgpartition(I))`:** Applies the `transform_object` function to each object in the partitioned foreground.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the transformed objects into a single object.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the merged, transformed object onto the original input grid, resulting in the output grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_object(obj):
    c = color(obj)
    ind = toindices(obj)
    shifted = shift(ind, DOWN) if c in [2, 8] else ind
    outlined = outbox(shifted) - corners(shifted)
    lines = (shift(ind, LEFT) | shift(ind, RIGHT)) - recolor(6, outbox(ind)) if c == 2 else frozenset()
    expansion = backdrop(shift(asindices(canvas(8, (3, 3))), subtract(centerofmass(ind), (1, 1)))) if c == 8 else frozenset()
    return merge([recolor(6, outlined), recolor(c, shifted), recolor(1, lines), recolor(4, expansion)])
  return paint(I, merge(apply(process_object, fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

- Similar to Version 1 but restructures the code for readability.
- It defines `process_object` to handle transformations for each object based on its color.
- Transformations are calculated separately and then merged before being painted onto the grid.


**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    c = color(obj)
    idx = toindices(obj)
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, outbox(idx) - corners(idx)))  # Outline
    if c in [2, 8]:
      O = paint(O, recolor(c, shift(idx, DOWN)))  # Shift
    if c == 2:
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, (shift(idx, LEFT) | shift(idx, RIGHT)) - recolor(6, outbox(idx))))  # Lines
    if c == 8:
      center = subtract(centerofmass(idx), (1, 1))
      O = paint(O, recolor(4, backdrop(shift(asindices(canvas(8, (3, 3))), center))))  # Expand
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Employs an iterative approach, processing one object at a time.
- Directly modifies the output grid `O` with each transformation.
- Simplifies the code by calculating and applying transformations within the loop.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = paint(I, recolor(6, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: any(index(I, n) != mostcommon(I) for n in dneighbors(loc)) and index(I, loc) != mostcommon(I)))) # Outlining
  for c in palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}:
    if c in [2,8]:
      O = paint(O, recolor(c, mapply(lambda loc: shift(frozenset({(c, loc)}), DOWN), ofcolor(O, c)))) # Vertical Shift
    if c == 2:
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, mapply(lambda loc: (connect(add(loc, (0, -1)), add(loc, (0, 1))) - recolor(6, outbox(frozenset({loc})))), ofcolor(O, c)))) # Horizontal Lines
    if c == 8:
      O = paint(O, recolor(4, mapply(lambda loc: backdrop(shift(asindices(canvas(8, (3, 3))), subtract(loc, (1, 1)))), ofcolor(O, c)))) # Square Expansion
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Focuses on processing colors instead of individual objects.
- Outlines all foreground objects first.
- Iterates through each foreground color and applies transformations based on color.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def apply_transform(grid, color_val, transformation):
    return paint(grid, recolor(color_val, mapply(lambda loc: transformation(frozenset({(color_val, loc)})), ofcolor(grid, color_val))))

  O = paint(I, recolor(6, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: any(index(I, n) != mostcommon(I) for n in dneighbors(loc)) and index(I, loc) != mostcommon(I))))  # Outlining
  O = apply_transform(O, 8, lambda obj: backdrop(shift(asindices(canvas(8, (3, 3))), subtract(centerofmass(obj), (1, 1)))))  # Square Expansion
  O = apply_transform(O, 8, lambda obj: shift(obj, DOWN))  # Vertical shift 8
  O = apply_transform(O, 2, lambda obj: shift(obj, DOWN))  # Vertical shift 2
  O = apply_transform(O, 2, lambda obj: connect(add(ulcorner(obj), (0, -1)), add(ulcorner(obj), (0, 1))) - recolor(6, outbox(frozenset({ulcorner(obj)}))))  # Horizontal Lines for 2
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Introduces a reusable `apply_transform` function to apply a specific transformation to a given color on the grid.
- Improves code readability and organization by separating transformation logic.
- Applies transformations sequentially for each relevant color.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same output, utilizing various DSL functions and programming paradigms. Each version offers a distinct logic flow while adhering to the specified DSL and achieving the desired transformation.
