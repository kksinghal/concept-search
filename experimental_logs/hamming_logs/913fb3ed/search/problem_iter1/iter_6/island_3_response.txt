## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation revolves around identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit excluding the background color '0') and applying specific modifications:

**Input 0 - Output 0:**
* **Object Filling:** The interior of each object is filled with the digit '4'.
* **Frame Creation:** A frame of '6's is drawn around each object.
* **Bottom Extension:** The bottom part of the frame is extended by one unit with '1's. 

**Input 1 - Output 1:**
* **Object Framing:** A frame of '6's is drawn around each object.

**Input 2 - Output 2:**
* **Object Framing:** A frame of '6's is drawn around each object.
* **Bottom Extension:** The bottom part of the frame is extended by one unit with '1's. 

**Input 3 - Output 3:**
* **Object Filling:** The interior of each object is filled with the digit '4'.

**Common Pattern:**

The core transformation involves:
1. **Identifying Objects:** Locate connected regions of non-zero digits.
2. **Object Manipulation:**
    * Fill the object's interior with '4'.
    * Draw a frame of '6's around the object.
    * Optionally extend the bottom frame with '1's.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), asobject(I))  # Initialize grid
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = underfill(O, 4, obj) # Fill the interior with '4'
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, box(obj))) # Draw the frame
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, j) for i, j in box(obj) if i == lowermost(obj) + 1})) # Extend bottom frame
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas (`canvas`) of the same size as the input (`I`) and paints the input objects onto it.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each object in the input.
3. **Interior Filling:** Fills the object's interior with '4' using `underfill`.
4. **Frame Drawing:** Draws a frame of '6's around the object using `recolor` and `box`.
5. **Bottom Extension:**  Extends the bottom frame with '1's by finding the indices one unit below the bottom edge of the box and recoloring them.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = fill(O, 4, inbox(obj)) # Fill the interior with '4'
    O = fill(O, 6, box(obj)) # Draw the frame
    O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j) for (i, j) in backdrop(obj) if i == lowermost(obj) + 1}) # Extend bottom frame
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Modification:** This version directly modifies the input grid `I`.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each object in the input.
3. **Interior Filling:** Fills the object's interior with '4' using `fill` and `inbox`.
4. **Frame Drawing:** Draws a frame of '6's around the object using `fill` and `box`.
5. **Bottom Extension:** Extends the bottom frame with '1's by finding the indices within the backdrop one unit below the object and filling them.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), asobject(I)) # Initialize grid
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        O = underfill(O, 4, obj)  # Fill the interior with '4'
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, box(obj)))  # Draw the frame
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(hline(toindices(obj)), (1, 0))))  # Extend bottom frame
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas (`canvas`) and paints the input objects onto it.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each object.
3. **Interior Filling:**  Fills the object's interior with '4' using `underfill`.
4. **Frame Drawing:** Draws a frame of '6's using `recolor` and `box`.
5. **Bottom Extension:** Extends the bottom frame by shifting a horizontal line (`hline`) representing the object's width one unit down and recoloring it to '1'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = fill(O, 4, difference(backdrop(obj), box(obj)))
    O = fill(O, 6, box(obj))
    O = fill(O, 1, {(lowermost(obj) + 1, j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Modification:**  This version directly modifies the input grid `I`.
2. **Object Iteration:**  Iterates through each object.
3. **Interior Filling:**  Fills the object's interior by finding the difference between the backdrop and the box (which represents the frame) and filling it with '4'.
4. **Frame Drawing:** Draws a frame of '6's using `fill` and `box`.
5. **Bottom Extension:**  Expands the bottom frame by directly iterating through the column indices of the bottom edge and filling them with '1'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), asobject(I)) # Initialize grid
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        O = underfill(O, 4, obj) # Fill the interior with '4'
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, box(obj))) # Draw the frame
        bottom_line = connect((lowermost(obj) + 1, leftmost(obj)), (lowermost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj)))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, bottom_line))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Creates an empty canvas and paints the input objects onto it.
2. **Object Iteration:**  Iterates through each object.
3. **Interior Filling:**  Fills the object's interior with '4' using `underfill`.
4. **Frame Drawing:**  Draws a frame of '6's around the object using `recolor` and `box`.
5. **Bottom Extension:**  Constructs the bottom line segment using the `connect` function with the coordinates of the bottom left and right corners of the object, shifted one unit down, then recolors it to '1'.
