## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying foreground objects (non-zero values) and creating a border around them. The border's color depends on its position relative to the object:

- **Horizontal sides:** Filled with the value `4`.
- **Vertical sides:** Filled with the value `6`.
- **Corners:** Filled with the value `1`.

Let's analyze each example:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

- Objects with values `8`, `3`, and `2` get borders.
- The top and bottom borders of these objects are filled with `4`.
- The left and right borders are filled with `6`.
- The corners of the borders are filled with `1`.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

- Same logic applied as in Input_0.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

- Same logic applied as in Input_0.

**Input_3 -> Output_3:**

- Same logic applied as in Input_0.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  result = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), objs) 
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      for (dx, dy), val in [((0, 1), 4), ((0, -1), 4), ((1, 0), 6), ((-1, 0), 6)]:
        if index(I, (i+dx, j+dy)) == 0:
          result = fill(result, val, {(i+dx, j+dy)})
      for dx, dy in [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]:
        if index(I, (i+dx, j+dy)) == 0:
          result = fill(result, 1, {(i+dx, j+dy)})
  return result
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - `objs = fgpartition(I)`: Extracts foreground objects from the input grid `I`.
   - `result = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), objs)`: Creates a blank canvas of the same size as `I` and paints the extracted objects onto it.

2. **Border Generation:**
   - Iterates through each object (`obj`) and its cell indices (`i`, `j`).
   - Uses two loops to handle horizontal/vertical sides and corners separately.
   - For each neighboring cell:
     - `if index(I, (i+dx, j+dy)) == 0:`: Checks if the neighbor is part of the background (value `0`).
     - `result = fill(result, val, {(i+dx, j+dy)})`: If it's background, fills it with the appropriate border value (`4`, `6`, or `1`) based on the relative position.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  result = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), objs)
  for obj in objs:
    result = underfill(result, 4, remove(inbox(obj), obj))  # Horizontal sides
    result = underfill(result, 6, remove(outbox(obj), remove(inbox(obj), obj)))  # Vertical sides
    result = underfill(result, 1, delta(outbox(obj))) # Corners
  return result
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Same as Version 1.

2. **Border Generation:**
   - Iterates through each object (`obj`).
   - `result = underfill(result, 4, remove(inbox(obj), obj))`: Fills horizontal sides with `4` by targeting cells within the outer box but outside the object.
   - `result = underfill(result, 6, remove(outbox(obj), remove(inbox(obj), obj)))`: Fills vertical sides with `6` by targeting cells within the outer box but outside both the inner box and the object.
   - `result = underfill(result, 1, delta(outbox(obj)))`: Fills corners with `1` by targeting cells within the delta (difference) between the outer box and its contents.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  result = I
  for obj in objs:
    result = underfill(result, 4, shift(toindices(obj), (1, 0)) - toindices(obj)) # Top
    result = underfill(result, 4, shift(toindices(obj), (-1, 0)) - toindices(obj)) # Bottom
    result = underfill(result, 6, shift(toindices(obj), (0, 1)) - toindices(obj)) # Right
    result = underfill(result, 6, shift(toindices(obj), (0, -1)) - toindices(obj)) # Left
    result = underfill(result, 1, delta(outbox(obj))) # Corners
  return result
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - `objs = fgpartition(I)`: Extracts foreground objects from the input grid `I`.
   - `result = I`: Initializes the `result` grid with a copy of the input grid.

2. **Border Generation:**
   - Iterates through each object (`obj`).
   - Uses `shift` to calculate the indices of neighboring cells in each direction.
   - `result = underfill(result, value, shifted_indices - toindices(obj))`: For each direction (top, bottom, left, right), it fills the corresponding border cells with the appropriate value (`4` or `6`) by targeting the shifted indices that are not part of the original object.
   - `result = underfill(result, 1, delta(outbox(obj)))`: Fills corners with `1` by targeting cells within the delta (difference) between the outer box and its contents.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  result = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), objs)
  for obj in objs:
    for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1)]:
      border = shift(toindices(obj), (dx, dy)) - toindices(obj)
      result = underfill(result, 4, border)
    for dx, dy in [(1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
      border = shift(toindices(obj), (dx, dy)) - toindices(obj)
      result = underfill(result, 6, border)
    result = underfill(result, 1, delta(outbox(obj)))
  return result
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Same as Version 3.

2. **Border Generation:**
   - Iterates through each object (`obj`).
   - Uses two separate loops to handle horizontal and vertical sides.
   - Within each loop, `shift` is used to calculate the indices of neighboring cells in the corresponding directions.
   - `border = shift(toindices(obj), (dx, dy)) - toindices(obj)`: Calculates the border indices by taking the difference between the shifted indices and the object's original indices.
   - `result = underfill(result, value, border)`: Fills the calculated border indices with the appropriate value (`4` or `6`).
   - `result = underfill(result, 1, delta(outbox(obj)))`: Fills corners with `1` by targeting cells within the delta (difference) between the outer box and its contents.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    result = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), fgpartition(I))
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if value != 0:
                for dx, dy, border_val in [(0, 1, 4), (0, -1, 4), (1, 0, 6), (-1, 0, 6)]:
                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy
                    if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(row) and I[ni][nj] == 0:
                        result = fill(result, border_val, {(ni, nj)})
                for dx, dy in [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]:
                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy
                    if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(row) and I[ni][nj] == 0:
                        result = fill(result, 1, {(ni, nj)})
    return result
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** 
   -  `result = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), fgpartition(I))`: Creates a new grid (`result`) by painting the foreground objects of input grid (`I`) onto a blank canvas of the same size. 

2. **Border Generation:**
   - It iterates through each cell (`i`, `j`) and its value (`value`) in the input grid (`I`).
   - `if value != 0:`:  It proceeds only if the current cell is part of a foreground object.
   - For each neighboring cell, it calculates the neighbor's coordinates (`ni`, `nj`) and checks if it's within the grid boundaries and if it's a background cell (value `0`). 
   - If both conditions are met, it fills the neighboring cell with the appropriate border value (`4`, `6`, or `1`) based on its relative position to the current cell. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
