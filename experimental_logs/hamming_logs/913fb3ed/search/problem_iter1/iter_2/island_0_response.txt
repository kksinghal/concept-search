## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves the following steps:

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all the non-zero digit groups in the input grid. Each group represents a distinct object.
2. **Draw Outlines:** Draw an outline around each object using the following rules:
   *  **Directly Adjacent Cells:** Cells directly above, below, left, or right of an object are filled with the digit '4'.
   *  **Diagonally Adjacent Cells:** Cells diagonally adjacent to an object are filled with the digit '1'.
3. **Frame Objects:** Draw a frame around each object using the digit '6'. The frame should enclose both the object and its outline.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)  # Identify objects
  result = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), objs)  # Initialize result with objects
  for obj in objs:
    result = underfill(result, 4, remove(inbox(obj), obj))  # Horizontal & Vertical outline
    result = underfill(result, 1, delta(outbox(obj)))  # Diagonal outline
    result = paint(result, recolor(6, outbox(obj)))  # Draw frame
  return result
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `fgpartition(I)` identifies all distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Initialize Result:** `paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), objs)` creates a blank canvas and paints the identified objects onto it.
3. **Outline and Frame:** For each object:
   * `underfill(result, 4, remove(inbox(obj), obj))` draws the horizontal and vertical outlines using '4'.
   * `underfill(result, 1, delta(outbox(obj)))` draws the diagonal outlines using '1'.
   * `paint(result, recolor(6, outbox(obj)))` draws the frame using '6'.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  result = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), objs)
  for obj in objs:
    for (dx, dy), val in [((0, 1), 4), ((0, -1), 4), ((1, 0), 4), ((-1, 0), 4)]: # Direct neighbors
      border = shift(toindices(obj), (dx, dy)) - toindices(obj)
      result = underfill(result, val, border)
    for (dx, dy), val in [((1, 1), 1), ((1, -1), 1), ((-1, 1), 1), ((-1, -1), 1)]: # Diagonal neighbors
      border = shift(toindices(obj), (dx, dy)) - toindices(obj)
      result = underfill(result, val, border)
    result = paint(result, recolor(6, outbox(obj)))  # Frame
  return result
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects & Initialize:** Same as in Version 1.
2. **Outline and Frame:** This version iterates through each object and explicitly defines the direction vectors for direct and diagonal neighbors to draw outlines using '4' and '1' respectively. The frame is drawn similar to Version 1.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  result = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value != 0:
        result = fill(result, value, {(i, j)})  # Paint original object
        for (dx, dy), val in [((0, 1), 4), ((0, -1), 4), ((1, 0), 4), ((-1, 0), 4)]:
          ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy
          if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(row) and I[ni][nj] == 0:
            result = fill(result, val, {(ni, nj)})  # Direct outline
        for dx, dy in [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)]:
          ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy
          if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(row) and I[ni][nj] == 0:
            result = fill(result, 1, {(ni, nj)})  # Diagonal outline
  return paint(result, recolor(6, outbox(asindices(I)))) # Frame
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Result:** Starts with a blank canvas.
2. **Iterate through Cells:** Iterates through each cell in the input grid.
3. **Paint, Outline & Frame:** If a cell is part of an object:
   * The original object value is painted onto the result canvas.
   * Direct and diagonal outlines are drawn using similar logic to Version 2, but iterating through individual cells.
4. **Frame the Entire Grid:** Finally, a frame is drawn around the entire grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  result = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), objs)
  for obj in objs:
    result = paint(result, recolor(4, inbox(obj) - toindices(obj))) # Outline
    result = paint(result, recolor(1, delta(outbox(obj)))) # Diagonal outline
  return paint(result, recolor(6, outbox(asindices(I)))) # Frame
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects & Initialize:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Outline and Frame:**
   * `recolor(4, inbox(obj) - toindices(obj))` identifies the outline cells and recolors them to '4'.
   * `recolor(1, delta(outbox(obj))))` identifies the diagonal outline cells and recolors them to '1'.
   * The frame is drawn around the entire grid similar to Version 3.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  result = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), fgpartition(I))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    result = underfill(result, 4, mapply(lambda x: shift(toindices(obj), x)- toindices(obj), [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)])) # Direct outlines
    result = underfill(result, 1, mapply(lambda x: shift(toindices(obj), x)- toindices(obj), [(1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1)])) # Diagonal outlines
  return paint(result, recolor(6, outbox(asindices(I)))) # Frame
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects & Initialize:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Outline and Frame:** 
   * `mapply` is used here to apply the shifting and difference operations to generate direct and diagonal outlines efficiently.
   * The frame is drawn around the entire grid similar to Version 3 and 4.

These are five distinct versions of the program utilizing different combinations of DSL functions to achieve the desired transformation. Each version highlights the flexibility and expressive power of the DSL.
