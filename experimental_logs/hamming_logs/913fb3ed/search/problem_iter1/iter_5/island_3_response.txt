## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves three main steps for each object:

1. **Interior Fill:** The interior of each object (excluding the border) is filled with the value `4`.
2. **Border Drawing:** A border with the value `1` is drawn around each object, excluding the four corner cells.
3. **Corner Replacement:** The four corner cells of the border are replaced with the value `6`.

**Note:** The background (value `0`) remains unchanged. 

## Program Version 1

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), asobject(I))  # Initialize grid
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = underfill(O, 4, obj)  # Fill the interior with '4'
    O = fill(O, 1, inbox(obj))  # Draw border with '1's
    O = fill(O, 6, corners(inbox(obj)))  # Replace corners with '6's
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** The code initializes an output grid `O` with the same shape as the input grid `I`, filled with the background value `0`. It then paints the objects from the input onto this grid. 
2. **Interior Fill:** The `underfill` function fills the interior of each object with the value `4`.
3. **Border Drawing:** The `inbox` function identifies the indices of the object's border (excluding corners). The `fill` function then sets these indices in the output grid to `1`.
4. **Corner Replacement:** The `corners` function, applied to the `inbox`, identifies the corner indices. These corners are then filled with the value `6` using the `fill` function.

## Program Version 2

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), asobject(I))  # Initialize grid
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = fill(O, 4, difference(backdrop(obj), box(obj))) # Fill interior with '4'
    O = fill(O, 1, difference(box(obj), corners(box(obj))))  # Draw border with '1's
    O = fill(O, 6, corners(obj))  # Replace corners with '6's
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to version 1, initializes the output grid.
2. **Interior Fill:** This version utilizes `backdrop` and `box` functions. It finds the difference between the bounding box (`backdrop`) and the outline (`box`) of the object, which gives the interior indices. These indices are then filled with `4`.
3. **Border Drawing:** Similar to the interior fill, it finds the difference between the outline and the corners of the outline, giving the border indices (excluding corners). These indices are filled with `1`.
4. **Corner Replacement:**  Uses `corners` function directly on the object to find and fill corners with `6`.

## Program Version 3

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = asobject(I)
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = O.union(recolor(4, difference(backdrop(obj), box(obj)))) # Add interior with '4'
    O = O.union(recolor(1, difference(box(obj), corners(box(obj))))) # Add border with '1's
    O = O.union(recolor(6, corners(obj)))  # Add corners with '6's
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), O) # Paint the final object on an empty canvas
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Initializes the output `O` as an object representation of the input grid `I`.
2. **Interior Fill/Border Drawing/Corner Replacement:** Instead of `fill`, uses `recolor` and `union` to achieve the same outcome. `recolor` changes the color of indices within an object, and `union` merges the recolored objects with the existing output object `O`.
3. **Final Painting:** Finally, paints the transformed object `O` onto an empty canvas of the same shape as the input. 

## Program Version 4

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
    O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), asobject(I))
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        for i, j in backdrop(obj):
            if (i, j) in corners(obj):
                O = fill(O, 6, {(i, j)})
            elif (i, j) in box(obj):
                O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
            else:
                O = fill(O, 4, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Initializes the output grid similar to previous versions.
2. **Iterative Transformation:** Iterates through each cell in the `backdrop` of the object. For each cell, it checks if it belongs to corners, box (excluding corners), or the interior and fills it with the corresponding value (6, 1, or 4).

## Program Version 5

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = asobject(I)
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    for i, j in backdrop(obj):
        new_val = 6 if (i, j) in corners(obj) else 1 if (i, j) in box(obj) else 4
        O = O.union(frozenset({(new_val, (i, j))})) 
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Initializes output as an object representation similar to version 3.
2. **Combined Transformation:** Iterates through each cell in the `backdrop`.  It uses a conditional expression to determine the new value for each cell based on its position (corner, border, interior). 
3. **Object Update:**  Adds the cell with the new value to the output object `O` using `union`.
4. **Final Painting:** Finally paints the transformed object `O` onto an empty canvas.
