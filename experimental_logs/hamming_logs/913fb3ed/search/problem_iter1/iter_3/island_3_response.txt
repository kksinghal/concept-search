## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves these steps:

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all connected regions of non-zero digits in the input grid.
2. **Fill Interior:** Fill the interior of each object with the digit '4'.
3. **Horizontal Border:** Draw a horizontal line with the digit '1' below each object, extending one cell to the left and right of the object's bounding box. 
4. **Vertical Border:**  Draw vertical lines with the digit '1' on the left and right sides of each object, extending one cell above the top horizontal border and one cell below the bottom horizontal border.
5. **Corner Adjustment:**  Replace the corner digits of the border with the digit '6'.

**Example:**

Let's analyze Input_3 and Output_3:

**Input_3:**

```
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 
```

**Output_3:**

```
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 4 4 4 0 0
0 4 8 4 0 0
0 4 4 4 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

1.  There's one object formed by the digit '8'.
2.  The interior of the object remains unchanged ('8').
3.  A horizontal line of '1's is drawn below the '8', extending one cell left and right.
4.  Vertical lines of '1's are drawn on either side, overlapping the horizontal line.
5.  The corners of the resulting border are replaced with '6's.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program implementing the described transformation:

**Version 1 (using `underfill`, `inbox`, and corner replacement):**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), asobject(I)) # Initialize grid
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = underfill(O, 4, obj) # Fill the interior with '4'
    O = fill(O, 1, inbox(obj)) # Draw border with '1's
    O = fill(O, 6, {(uppermost(obj)-1, leftmost(obj)-1), (uppermost(obj)-1, rightmost(obj)+1),
                     (lowermost(obj)+1, leftmost(obj)-1), (lowermost(obj)+1, rightmost(obj)+1)}) # Replace corners with '6's
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty grid (`O`) of the same size as input (`I`) and paints the input objects onto it.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each object in the input.
3. **Interior Fill:** Fills the interior of the object with '4' using `underfill`.
4. **Border Drawing:** Draws the border with '1's using `inbox`.
5. **Corner Replacement:** Replaces the four corners of the border with '6's by directly accessing and modifying the grid cells.

**Version 2 (using `shift` and `paint` for border drawing):**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), asobject(I))  # Initialize grid
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = underfill(O, 4, obj) # Fill the interior with '4'
    for i in range(leftmost(obj) - 1, rightmost(obj) + 2):
      O = paint(O, {(1, (uppermost(obj)-1, i)), (1, (lowermost(obj)+1, i))}) # Draw horizontal border lines
    for j in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      O = paint(O, {(1, (j, leftmost(obj)-1)), (1, (j, rightmost(obj)+1))}) # Draw vertical border lines
    O = fill(O, 6, {(uppermost(obj)-1, leftmost(obj)-1), (uppermost(obj)-1, rightmost(obj)+1),
                     (lowermost(obj)+1, leftmost(obj)-1), (lowermost(obj)+1, rightmost(obj)+1)}) # Replace corners with '6's
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Object Iteration:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Interior Fill:** Same as Version 1.
4. **Border Drawing:** Draws the border by iterating over the rows and columns defining the border and painting '1's at those locations using `paint` and `shift`.
5. **Corner Replacement:** Same as Version 1. 

**Version 3 (using `hconcat`, `vconcat`, and pre-built border components):**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), asobject(I))  # Initialize grid
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = underfill(O, 4, obj) # Fill the interior with '4'
    h = height(obj)
    w = width(obj)
    top_border = canvas(1, (1, w + 2))
    bottom_border = canvas(1, (1, w + 2))
    left_border = canvas(1, (h, 1))
    right_border = canvas(1, (h, 1))
    bordered_obj = vconcat(hconcat(top_border, vconcat(left_border, hconcat(subgrid(obj, O), right_border))), bottom_border)
    O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(asobject(bordered_obj), ulcorner(obj) + (-1, -1))) # Paint bordered object onto grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Object Iteration:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Interior Fill:** Same as Version 1.
4. **Border Construction:** Creates separate top, bottom, left, and right border components using `canvas`. 
5. **Border Assembly:** Combines the border components with the object using `hconcat` and `vconcat`.
6. **Placement:**  Paints the bordered object onto the output grid at the correct position using `cover`, `shift`, and `asobject`.

**Version 4 (using nested loops and conditional logic for border):**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), asobject(I))  # Initialize grid
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = underfill(O, 4, obj) # Fill the interior with '4'
    top, left = ulcorner(obj)
    bottom, right = lrcorner(obj)
    for i in range(top - 1, bottom + 2):
      for j in range(left - 1, right + 2):
        if 0 <= i < len(O) and 0 <= j < len(O[0]):
          if i == top - 1 or i == bottom + 1: # Horizontal border
            O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)}) 
          elif j == left - 1 or j == right + 1: # Vertical border
            O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
          if (i == top-1 or i == bottom+1) and (j == left-1 or j == right+1): # Corners
            O = fill(O, 6, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Object Iteration:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Interior Fill:** Same as Version 1.
4. **Border Drawing and Corner Handling:** Iterates over a bounding box encompassing the object and its border. Within the loop, conditional logic determines whether a cell belongs to the horizontal border, vertical border, or is a corner, and fills it with the appropriate digit.

**Version 5 (using `box` and `delta` for border manipulation):**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), asobject(I))  # Initialize grid
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = underfill(O, 4, obj) # Fill the interior with '4'
    O = fill(O, 1, box(obj)) # Draw initial box border with '1's
    O = fill(O, 6, corners(obj) & delta(obj))  # Replace appropriate corners with '6's
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Object Iteration:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Interior Fill:** Same as Version 1.
4. **Border Drawing:** Draws an initial box border around the object with '1's using `box`.
5. **Corner Replacement:** Replaces corners that are part of the border (not the object itself) with '6's using `corners` and `delta` to identify the correct cells.


These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, leveraging different DSL functions and logic structures. They highlight the flexibility and expressive power of the DSL for spatial reasoning tasks.
