## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving non-background colored single-cell objects to specific locations within their original row while maintaining their original color. 

**Input_0:**
* The single '3' cell moved from (1,0) to (0,1).

**Input_1:**
* The single '6' cells moved from (2,0) & (3,0) to (0,2) & (0,3) respectively.
* The single '4' cell moved from (3,2) to (2,3).

**Input_2:**
* The single '8' cells moved from (2,0) & (2,1) to (0,2) & (0,3) respectively.
* The single '2' cells moved from (3,1) & (4,1) to (1,2) & (1,3) respectively.
* The single '1' cell moved from (4,3) to (3,4).


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Extract single-color objects, excluding background
    moved_objs = frozenset() 
    for obj in objs:
        if len(obj) == 1: # Process only single-cell objects
            v, (i, j) = first(obj)  
            new_j = i  # New column index is the same as original row index
            moved_objs = moved_objs | frozenset({(v, (i, new_j))}) 
        else:
            moved_objs = moved_objs | obj # Keep multi-cell objects unchanged

    O = paint(cover(I, objs), moved_objs)  # Paint the moved objects on a clean canvas
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify single-color objects excluding the background.
2. **Move Single-Cell Objects:** For objects containing a single cell, change their column index to match their row index.
3. **Preserve Multi-Cell Objects:** Keep objects with multiple cells in their original positions.
4. **Paint on Canvas:**  Clear the input grid and paint the modified objects onto it.

**Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    moved_cells = frozenset()
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and len(ofcolor(I, I[i][j])) == 1: 
                # Check for non-background, single-cell objects
                moved_cells = moved_cells | {(I[i][j], (i, i))}  # Move to new column based on row

    O = paint(cover(I, objects(I, True, False, True)), moved_cells) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Identify:** Loop through each cell in the grid. Check if the cell is not the background color and if it's the only cell with that color.
2. **Move:** If a cell meets the criteria, add it to the `moved_cells` set with its column index changed to match the row index.
3. **Paint:** Clear the input grid and paint the `moved_cells` set onto it.

**Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Extract objects, excluding background
    single_cells = merge(sizefilter(objs, 1))  # Extract single-cell objects
    moved_cells = apply(lambda cell: (cell[0], (cell[1][0], cell[1][0])), single_cells)  # Move to new column based on row
    O = paint(cover(I, objs), moved_cells)  # Paint the moved cells on a clean canvas
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** Extract all single-color objects, excluding background objects.
2. **Isolate Single Cells:** Filter the extracted objects to get a set of single-cell objects.
3. **Move Cells:** Change the column index of each single-cell object to match its row index.
4. **Paint on Grid:** Clear the input grid and paint the moved cells onto it.

**Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
    new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create an empty grid of the same shape as the input

    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if value != mostcolor(I) and colorcount(I, value) == 1: 
                # Check for non-background, single-cell objects
                new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(value, (i, i))})  # Move to new column based on row
            else:
                new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(value, (i, j))}) # Keep other cells in their original position

    return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Blank Canvas:**  Generates an empty grid of the same dimensions and background color as the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Analyze:**  Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
3. **Identify and Move:** If a cell is not a background color and is the only cell with its color, paint it onto the new grid at a position where the column index matches the original row index. 
4. **Maintain Other Cells:**  If a cell is either a background color or not the only cell with its color, paint it onto the new grid at its original position. 

**Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
  def move_cell(i, j, v):
    return (v, (i, i)) if v != mostcolor(I) and colorcount(I, v) == 1 else (v, (i, j))

  return tuple(
      tuple(move_cell(i, j, v)[0] for j, v in enumerate(row)) 
      for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `move_cell` Function:** This function takes the row index (i), column index (j), and value (v) of a cell. If the cell is a non-background, single-cell object, it returns the cell with its column index changed to match the row index. Otherwise, it returns the cell unchanged.
2. **Apply Transformation:** The code iterates through each row and cell of the input grid, applying the `move_cell` function to each cell.  
3. **Construct Output:**  The transformed cells are collected and used to construct the output grid.


These five versions provide different approaches to achieving the same transformation using the provided DSL. They highlight the flexibility of the DSL and demonstrate the ability to solve the problem with various logic and function combinations.
