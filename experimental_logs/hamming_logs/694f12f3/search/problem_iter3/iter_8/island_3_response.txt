## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

The program takes the digit '7' and constructs a stylized '7' using the main color (4) for the outline and secondary color (1) for the inner fill. The constructed '7' is then mirrored and placed in the bottom half of the canvas. The inner fill of the mirrored '7' uses a different secondary color (2).

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

Similar to the transformation for digit '7', the program takes the digit '1' and constructs a stylized '1' with main color (4) and secondary color (2). This stylized '1' is then mirrored and placed at the bottom half of the canvas. However, this time, the inner fill of the mirrored '1' uses a different secondary color (1).


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  main_color = 4
  secondary_color = 1 if digit == 7 else 2

  if digit == 7:
    stroke = asobject(canvas(main_color, (4, 1)))
    seven = hconcat(stroke, hmirror(stroke))
    seven = vconcat(seven, canvas((0,), (2, 8)))
    seven = vconcat(seven, seven)
    O = paint(O, shift(asobject(seven), (1, 1)))
    O = fill(O, secondary_color,  {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)})
    O = fill(O, 2, {(i,j) for i in range(7,9) for j in range(4,6)})
  elif digit == 1:
    one_stroke = asobject(canvas(main_color, (1, 6)))
    one_body = vconcat(canvas((0,), (10, 6)), one_stroke)
    one_flag = asobject(canvas(main_color, (2, 2)))
    O = paint(O, one_body)
    O = paint(O, shift(one_flag, (2, 7)))
    O = paint(O, shift(one_flag, (3, 7)))
    O = fill(O, secondary_color, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(8, 10)})
    O = fill(O, 1, {(i,j) for i in range(8,10) for j in range(7,9)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version focuses on constructing the top half of the digit and then mirroring it to create the bottom half. 
* It uses `hconcat`, `vconcat`, and `shift` to assemble the digit shape.
* The `fill` function is used strategically to fill specific regions with secondary colors.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  main_color = 4
  secondary_color = 1 if digit == 7 else 2

  if digit == 7:
    base = asobject(canvas(main_color, (4, 1)))
    seven = hconcat(base, hmirror(base))
    seven = vconcat(seven, canvas((0,), (2, 8)), seven)
    O = paint(O, shift(seven, (1, 1)))
    O = fill(O, secondary_color,  {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)})
    O = fill(O, 2, {(i + 5, j + 2) for i,j in {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)}}) 
  elif digit == 1:
    stroke = asobject(canvas(main_color, (6, 1)))
    body = hconcat(canvas((0,), (6, 6)), stroke)
    flag = asobject(canvas(main_color, (2, 2)))
    O = paint(O, body)
    O = paint(O, shift(flag, (2, 7)))
    O = paint(O, shift(flag, (3, 7)))
    O = fill(O, secondary_color,  {(4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 8), (5, 9)})
    O = fill(O, 1, {(i - 3, j - 1) for i,j in {(4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 8), (5, 9)}})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version simplifies the construction process by reusing the base shape for both the top and bottom parts of the digit.
* It leverages set comprehension and coordinate transformations to efficiently fill the secondary color regions. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    digit = I[0][0]
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    main_color = 4
    secondary_color = 1 if digit == 7 else 2
  
    if digit == 7:
        diag = asobject(canvas(main_color, (4, 1)))
        seven = vconcat(hconcat(diag, hmirror(diag)), canvas((0,), (6, 8)))
        seven = vconcat(seven, hconcat(diag, hmirror(diag)))
        O = paint(O, shift(asobject(seven), (1, 1)))
        O = fill(O, secondary_color, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 4) for j in range(2, 4)})
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i + 5, j) for i,j in {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)}}) 
    elif digit == 1:
        one_stroke = asobject(canvas(main_color, (6, 1)))
        one_body = hconcat(canvas((0,), (6, 6)), one_stroke)
        one_flag = asobject(canvas(main_color, (2, 2)))
        O = paint(O, one_body)
        O = paint(O, shift(one_flag, (2, 7)))
        O = paint(O, shift(one_flag, (3, 7)))
        O = fill(O, secondary_color, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(8, 10)})
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i + 3, j - 1) for i,j in {(3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 8), (4, 9)}})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version takes a more geometric approach, treating the digit as a combination of diagonal and horizontal strokes. 
* It utilizes `hconcat` and `vconcat` to combine these strokes strategically.
* Coordinate transformations within the `fill` function are used to accurately position the secondary colors. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    digit = I[0][0]
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    main_color = 4
    secondary_color = 1 if digit == 7 else 2
  
    if digit == 7:
        base_seven = asobject(canvas(main_color, (4, 1)))
        seven = hconcat(base_seven, hmirror(base_seven))
        seven = vconcat(seven, canvas((0,), (2, 8)))
        seven = vconcat(seven, seven)
        O = paint(O, shift(asobject(seven), (1, 1)))
        O = fill(O, secondary_color,  {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)})
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i + 5, j + 2) for i,j in {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)}}) 
    elif digit == 1:
        one_line = asobject(canvas(main_color, (6, 1)))
        one_body = hconcat(canvas((0,), (6, 6)), one_line)
        flag = asobject(canvas(main_color, (2, 2)))
        O = paint(O, one_body)
        O = paint(O, shift(flag, (2, 7)))
        O = paint(O, shift(flag, (3, 7)))
        O = fill(O, secondary_color, {(i, j) for i in range(4, 6) for j in range(8, 10)})
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i + 4, j - 1) for i,j in {(0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 8), (1, 9)}})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version combines elements from previous versions, using a blend of shape construction and coordinate transformations.
* It aims for a balance between conciseness and readability.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  main_color = 4
  secondary_color = 1 if digit == 7 else 2

  if digit == 7:
    stroke = asobject(canvas(main_color, (1, 4)))
    seven = vconcat(stroke, vmirror(stroke))
    seven = hconcat(seven, canvas((0,), (8, 2)))
    seven = hconcat(seven, seven)
    O = paint(O, rot90(shift(asobject(seven), (1, 1))))
    O = fill(O, secondary_color,  {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)})
    O = fill(O, 2, {(j + 2, i + 5) for i,j in {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)}}) 
  elif digit == 1:
    one_stroke = asobject(canvas(main_color, (1, 6)))
    one_body = vconcat(canvas((0,), (10, 6)), one_stroke)
    one_flag = asobject(canvas(main_color, (2, 2)))
    O = paint(O, one_body)
    O = paint(O, shift(one_flag, (2, 7)))
    O = paint(O, shift(one_flag, (3, 7)))
    O = fill(O, secondary_color, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(8, 10)})
    O = fill(O, 1, {(j - 1, i + 4) for i,j in {(3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 8), (4, 9)}})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version introduces a different construction order, building the digits horizontally first and then mirroring them vertically. 
* It incorporates the `rot90` function to achieve the final orientation.
* This approach aims to showcase alternative ways of utilizing the DSL's functionality.

These five program versions offer distinct approaches to solving the given transformation task. Each version utilizes different combinations of DSL functions and logic, demonstrating the versatility and flexibility of the programming language.
