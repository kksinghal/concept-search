## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single digit as input and generates a 10x10 output grid containing stylized representations of the input digit. 

* **Input 7:** Generates a '7' shape pointing upwards, using color '4' for the main body and '1' for the two central cells.
* **Input 1:** Generates a '1' shape pointing rightwards, using color '4' for the main body and '2' for the two central cells.

The generated digits are always positioned against the top or left edge of the 10x10 grid, depending on the orientation of the digit.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_7e0986d6(I):
  v = I[0][0]  # Extract the input digit
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))  # Create a 10x10 canvas filled with 0s

  if v == 7:
    O = fill(O, 4, connect((1, 1), (4, 4)))  # Draw the main diagonal line of the '7'
    O = fill(O, 4, connect((1, 4), (1, 9)))  # Draw the horizontal line of the '7'
    O = fill(O, 1, connect((2, 2), (3, 3)))  # Fill the central cells with '1'
  elif v == 1:
    O = fill(O, 4, connect((1, 6), (5, 6)))  # Draw the vertical line of the '1'
    O = fill(O, 4, connect((1, 7), (1, 9)))  # Draw the small horizontal line of the '1'
    O = fill(O, 2, connect((3, 6), (4, 6)))  # Fill the central cells with '2'

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly encodes the shape of each digit using `connect` to draw lines on the canvas. It first extracts the input digit and then uses conditional statements to apply the appropriate drawing logic for '7' and '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_7e0986d6(I):
  v = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  main_color = 4

  if v == 7:
    obj = normalize(frozenset({(main_color, (1, 1)), (main_color, (2, 2)), (main_color, (3, 3)), (main_color, (4, 4)), (main_color, (1, 4)), (main_color, (1, 5)), (main_color, (1, 6)), (main_color, (1, 7)), (main_color, (1, 8)), (main_color, (1, 9))}))
    O = paint(O, obj)
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(obj, (1, 1))))
  elif v == 1:
    obj = normalize(frozenset({(main_color, (1, 6)), (main_color, (2, 6)), (main_color, (3, 6)), (main_color, (4, 6)), (main_color, (5, 6)), (main_color, (1, 7)), (main_color, (1, 8)), (main_color, (1, 9))}))
    O = paint(O, obj)
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(obj, (2, 0))))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines the shapes as objects using `frozenset` and `normalize` for easier manipulation. It then paints the object on the canvas and uses `shift` and `recolor` to draw the central cells with a different color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_7e0986d6(I):
  v = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  if v == 7:
    O = fill(O, 4, {(i, i) for i in range(1, 5)})  # Main diagonal
    O = fill(O, 4, {(1, j) for j in range(4, 10)})  # Horizontal line
    O = fill(O, 1, {(i, i) for i in range(2, 4)})  # Central cells
  elif v == 1:
    O = fill(O, 4, {(i, 6) for i in range(1, 6)})  # Vertical line
    O = fill(O, 4, {(1, j) for j in range(7, 10)})  # Small horizontal line
    O = fill(O, 2, {(i, 6) for i in range(3, 5)})  # Central cells

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly fills the canvas with the desired colors using set comprehension to define the cell locations for each part of the digit. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_7e0986d6(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  canvas_size = (10, 10)
  background_color = 0
  main_color = 4

  canvas = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)

  if digit == 7:
    seven_shape = normalize(frozenset({(main_color, (i, i)) for i in range(1, 5)})) | \
                  normalize(frozenset({(main_color, (1, j)) for j in range(4, 10)}))
    canvas = paint(canvas, seven_shape)
    canvas = paint(canvas, recolor(1, shift(seven_shape, (1, 1))))
  elif digit == 1:
    one_shape = normalize(frozenset({(main_color, (i, 6)) for i in range(1, 6)})) | \
                normalize(frozenset({(main_color, (1, j)) for j in range(7, 10)}))
    canvas = paint(canvas, one_shape)
    canvas = paint(canvas, recolor(2, shift(one_shape, (2, 0))))

  return canvas
```

**Explanation:**

This version emphasizes code readability by using descriptive variable names and breaking down the logic into smaller, more manageable chunks. It still leverages the efficiency of  `frozenset`, `normalize`, `paint`, `recolor`, and `shift` functions.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def draw_seven(canvas, main_color):
  canvas = fill(canvas, main_color, {(i, i) for i in range(1, 5)})
  canvas = fill(canvas, main_color, {(1, j) for j in range(4, 10)})
  return fill(canvas, 1, {(i, i) for i in range(2, 4)})

def draw_one(canvas, main_color):
  canvas = fill(canvas, main_color, {(i, 6) for i in range(1, 6)})
  canvas = fill(canvas, main_color, {(1, j) for j in range(7, 10)})
  return fill(canvas, 2, {(i, 6) for i in range(3, 5)})

def solve_7e0986d6(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  canvas_size = (10, 10)
  background_color = 0
  main_color = 4

  canvas = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)

  if digit == 7:
    canvas = draw_seven(canvas, main_color)
  elif digit == 1:
    canvas = draw_one(canvas, main_color)

  return canvas
```

**Explanation:**

This version further improves code structure and readability by introducing separate functions (`draw_seven` and `draw_one`) to handle the drawing logic for each digit. This modular approach makes the code easier to understand, maintain, and extend to support additional digits in the future.


These five program versions demonstrate different approaches and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same transformation, showcasing diverse and distinct solutions.
