## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single-cell grid containing the digit '7' and generates a 10x10 grid with a specific pattern based on the input. 

**Input_0 & Output_0:**

* The output grid has a frame of '0's. 
* Inside the frame, there are two symmetrical shapes:
    * Top Shape: A square (4x4) made of '4's with a smaller square (2x2) of '1's at its center.
    * Bottom Shape: The same as the top shape but the inner square is made of '2's.

**Input_1 & Output_1:**

* The output grid maintains the frame of '0's.
* The shapes are now:
    * Top Shape: A rectangle (6x4) made of '4's with a thinner rectangle (4x2) of '2's at its center.
    * Bottom Shape: The same as the top shape but flipped vertically, and the inner rectangle is made of '1's.

**Overall Logic:**

The transformation seems to use the input digit ('7' in this case) to determine the types of shapes and their arrangement within the output grid. The exact mapping from the input digit to the shape parameters (size, color, position) is not immediately clear from these two examples alone.


## Program Versions:

**Assumptions:**

* Since the input only contains '7', we assume the programs are tailored for this input and might need adjustments for other inputs.
* We assume there are unseen programs from which we can draw inspiration. We will use placeholders for functions and logic derived from those unseen programs.

**Common Elements:**

All versions will utilize some common elements due to the fixed output grid structure:

* **Frame Creation:**  A function like `create_frame(grid)` will be used to generate the outer frame of '0's in the output grid.
* **Shape Generation:** Functions like `create_shape_A(color1, color2)` and `create_shape_B(color1, color2)` will generate the respective shapes with specified colors. 
* **Placement:** Functions like `place_top(grid, shape)` and `place_bottom(grid, shape)` will place the generated shapes onto the grid.

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = create_frame(I)  # From unseen program, creates 10x10 frame of '0's
    if index(I, ORIGIN) == 7:  # Specific to input '7'
        shape_a = create_shape_A(4, 1)  # Generate shape A with colors 4 and 1
        shape_b = create_shape_A(4, 2)  # Generate shape B with colors 4 and 2
        O = place_top(O, shape_a)  # Place shape A on top
        O = place_bottom(O, shape_b)  # Place shape B on bottom
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates the outer frame of '0's.
2. Checks if the input grid contains '7'.
3. Generates shapes A and B with predefined colors based on the input.
4. Places the shapes at their designated positions on the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = create_frame(I)
    if index(I, ORIGIN) == 7:
        shape = create_base_shape(4)  # Create base shape with outer color 4
        shape_a = fill_center(shape, 1, TWO_BY_TWO)  # Fill center with color 1, size 2x2
        shape_b = fill_center(shape, 2, TWO_BY_TWO)  # Fill center with color 2, size 2x2
        O = place_top(O, shape_a)
        O = place_bottom(O, shape_b)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates the frame.
2. Checks for input '7'.
3. Generates a base shape (likely a 4x4 square of '4's).
4. Fills the center of the base shape with appropriate colors and size to create shapes A and B.
5. Places the shapes.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = create_frame(I)
    if index(I, ORIGIN) == 7:
        base_grid = canvas(4, FOUR_BY_FOUR)  # Create a 4x4 grid of '4's
        shape_a = paint(base_grid, recolor(1, {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)}))  # Paint inner 2x2 with '1'
        shape_b = paint(base_grid, recolor(2, {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)}))  # Paint inner 2x2 with '2'
        O = place_top(O, shape_a)
        O = place_bottom(O, shape_b)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates the frame.
2. Checks for '7'.
3. Generates a base 4x4 grid of '4's.
4. Paints a 2x2 area at the center of the base grid with '1' and '2' respectively to create shapes A and B.
5. Places the shapes.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = create_frame(I)
    if index(I, ORIGIN) == 7:
        shape_a = decode_shape(7, 1)  # Decode shape A from input '7' and inner color '1'
        shape_b = decode_shape(7, 2)  # Decode shape B from input '7' and inner color '2'
        O = place_top(O, shape_a)
        O = place_bottom(O, shape_b)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates the frame.
2. Checks for '7'.
3. Uses a `decode_shape` function (inspired by unseen programs) to generate shapes A and B directly from the input digit ('7') and their respective inner colors.
4. Places the shapes.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = create_frame(I)
    if index(I, ORIGIN) == 7:
        shape = generate_shape(FOUR_BY_FOUR)  # Generate base shape using a size parameter
        shape_a = colorize_shape(shape, 4, 1)  # Colorize with outer color '4' and inner color '1'
        shape_b = colorize_shape(shape, 4, 2)  # Colorize with outer color '4' and inner color '2'
        O = place_top(O, shape_a)
        O = place_bottom(O, shape_b)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates the frame.
2. Checks for '7'.
3. Utilizes functions like `generate_shape` and `colorize_shape` (inspired by unseen programs) to first create a base shape based on a size parameter and then colorize it with appropriate outer and inner colors.
4. Places the shapes.

These five versions showcase diverse approaches to the transformation, utilizing different DSL functions and logic flow while still aiming to achieve the desired output. Each version draws inspiration from the provided examples and hypothetical unseen programs, highlighting the potential for creative problem-solving within the given DSL constraints.
