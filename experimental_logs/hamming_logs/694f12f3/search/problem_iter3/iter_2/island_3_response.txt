## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single digit (7 or 1) as input and outputs a 10x10 grid representing a stylized version of the digit.  The stylization uses two colors: a main color (4) for the outline and a secondary color (1 or 2) for internal details.

**Input 0:**

* **Input:** Digit '7'
* **Output:** A stylized '7' is drawn on the grid. 
    * The outline of the '7' is drawn using the main color (4). 
    * The slanted stroke of the '7' has an inner line drawn with the secondary color (1).

**Input 1:**

* **Input:** Digit '1'
* **Output:** A stylized '1' is drawn on the grid.
    * The outline of the '1' is drawn using the main color (4).
    * The horizontal base of the '1' has an inner line drawn with the secondary color (2). 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:** (Object-based Approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  canvas_size = (10, 10)
  background_color = 0
  main_color = 4
  canvas_ = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)

  if digit == 7:
    horizontal_stroke = normalize(frozenset({(main_color, (0, j)) for j in range(6)}))
    slanted_stroke = normalize(frozenset({(main_color, (i, i + 3)) for i in range(4)})) 
    seven_shape = horizontal_stroke | slanted_stroke
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, shift(seven_shape, (1, 1)))
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, recolor(1, shift(slanted_stroke, (2, 2))))
  elif digit == 1:
    vertical_stroke = normalize(frozenset({(main_color, (i, 0)) for i in range(6)}))
    horizontal_stroke = normalize(frozenset({(main_color, (5, j)) for j in range(4)})) 
    one_shape = vertical_stroke | horizontal_stroke
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, shift(one_shape, (2, 6)))
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, recolor(2, shift(horizontal_stroke, (3, 7)))) 
  return canvas_
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Sets up the canvas, background color, and main color.
2. **Digit-Specific Logic:**
   - **Digit 7:** 
     - Defines the horizontal and slanted strokes of the '7' as separate objects.
     - Combines them to form the complete '7' shape.
     - Paints the '7' onto the canvas.
     - Creates an inner line for the slanted stroke using `recolor` and `shift`.
   - **Digit 1:**
     - Defines the vertical and horizontal strokes of the '1' as separate objects.
     - Combines them to form the '1' shape.
     - Paints the '1' onto the canvas.
     - Creates an inner line for the horizontal stroke using `recolor` and `shift`.
3. **Output:** Returns the modified canvas.

**Program Version 2:** (Grid-Based Approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    digit = I[0][0]
    canvas_size = (10, 10)
    background_color = 0
    main_color = 4
    canvas_ = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)

    if digit == 7:
        seven_base = canvas((main_color if j < 6 else background_color), (1, 10))
        seven_base = vconcat(seven_base, canvas((main_color if i in (1, 2, 3) else background_color), (3, 10)))
        canvas_ = paint(canvas_, asobject(shift(seven_base, (1, 1))))
        canvas_ = paint(canvas_, recolor(1, asobject(shift(crop(seven_base, (2, 2), (2, 4)), (2, 2))))) 
    elif digit == 1:
        one_base = canvas((main_color if i < 6 else background_color), (6, 1))
        one_base = hconcat(one_base, canvas((main_color if j == 0 else background_color), (6, 4))) 
        canvas_ = paint(canvas_, asobject(shift(one_base, (2, 6))))
        canvas_ = paint(canvas_, recolor(2, asobject(shift(crop(one_base, (3, 1), (2, 3)), (3, 7))))) 
    return canvas_
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Digit-Specific Logic:**
    - **Digit 7:**
        - Creates the horizontal and slanted parts of the '7' as separate grids using conditional logic within `canvas`.
        - Concatenates them vertically using `vconcat`.
        - Paints the combined grid onto the canvas.
        - Creates the inner line for the slanted stroke using `recolor`, `shift`, and `crop` to select the appropriate part.
   - **Digit 1:**
        - Creates the vertical and horizontal parts of the '1' as separate grids using conditional logic within `canvas`.
        - Concatenates them horizontally using `hconcat`.
        - Paints the combined grid onto the canvas.
        - Creates the inner line for the horizontal stroke using `recolor`, `shift`, and `crop` to select the appropriate part.
3. **Output:** Returns the modified canvas. 

**Program Version 3:** (Coordinate Iteration)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    digit = I[0][0]
    canvas_size = (10, 10)
    background_color = 0
    main_color = 4
    canvas_ = canvas(background_color, canvas_size) 

    for i in range(canvas_size[0]):
        for j in range(canvas_size[1]):
            if digit == 7:
                if (1 <= i <= 4 and 1 <= j <= 6 and i + j <= 7) or (i == 2 and 2 <= j <= 9) or (i == 3 and 3 <= j <= 9): 
                    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, main_color, {(i, j)})
                if 2 <= i <= 3 and 3 <= j <= 5 and i + j <= 7:
                    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, 1, {(i, j)})
            elif digit == 1:
                if (2 <= i <= 7 and j == 6) or (i == 3 and 7 <= j <= 9) or (i == 4 and 7 <= j <= 9): 
                    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, main_color, {(i, j)})
                if (i == 4 and 8 <= j <= 9) or (i == 5 and 8 <= j <= 9): 
                    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, 2, {(i, j)})
    return canvas_
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Digit-Specific Logic:**
    - Uses nested loops to iterate over each cell in the grid.
    - **Digit 7 & 1:** Applies complex conditional statements based on the cell's coordinates (`i` and `j`) to determine the color. 
        - Fills the appropriate cells with the main color (4).
        - Fills the inner line cells with the secondary color (1 or 2).
3. **Output:** Returns the modified canvas.

**Program Version 4:** (Line-based Drawing for '7')

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  canvas_size = (10, 10)
  background_color = 0
  main_color = 4
  canvas_ = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)

  if digit == 7:
    top_stroke = normalize(frozenset({(main_color, (0, j)) for j in range(6)})) 
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, shift(top_stroke, (1, 1)))
    for i in range(2, 4): 
      for j in range(i + 3, 10):
        canvas_ = fill(canvas_, main_color if i == 2 else 1, {(i, j)}) 
  elif digit == 1: 
    vert_stroke = normalize(frozenset({(main_color, (i, 0)) for i in range(6)}))
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, shift(vert_stroke, (2, 6)))
    for i in range(3, 6): 
      for j in range(7, 10):
        canvas_ = fill(canvas_, main_color if i <= 4 else 2, {(i, j)})
  return canvas_
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Digit-Specific Logic:**
    - **Digit 7:**
        - Draws the horizontal top stroke using an object.
        - Uses nested loops to draw the slanted stroke and its inner line dynamically.
        - The outer loop controls the row, and the inner loop fills cells in the row to create the slanted shape.
        - Uses conditional logic within `fill` to switch between the main color (4) and secondary color (1) for the inner line.
    - **Digit 1:** Similar to Version 3.
3. **Output:** Returns the modified canvas.

**Program Version 5:** (Mirroring for '7')

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    digit = I[0][0]
    canvas_size = (10, 10)
    background_color = 0
    main_color = 4
    canvas_ = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)

    if digit == 7:
      base_shape = normalize(frozenset({(main_color, (i, 0)) for i in range(4)}))
      canvas_ = paint(canvas_, shift(base_shape, (1, 1)))
      canvas_ = paint(canvas_, hmirror(shift(base_shape, (1, 8))))
      canvas_ = paint(canvas_, recolor(1, shift(base_shape, (2, 2))))
      canvas_ = paint(canvas_, hmirror(recolor(1, shift(base_shape, (2, 7)))))
    elif digit == 1:
      base_shape = normalize(frozenset({(main_color, (i, 0)) for i in range(6)})) 
      canvas_ = paint(canvas_, shift(base_shape, (2, 6)))
      canvas_ = paint(canvas_, vmirror(shift(base_shape, (7, 6)))) 
      canvas_ = paint(canvas_, recolor(2, shift(crop(vmirror(shift(base_shape, (8, 6))), (0, 0), (2, 4)), (3, 7))))
    return canvas_
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Digit-Specific Logic:**
    - **Digit 7:**
        - Creates a base shape for the slanted stroke.
        - Paints the base shape onto the canvas.
        - Uses `hmirror` to create and paint the mirrored version, forming the complete '7'.
        - Repeats the process with the secondary color (1) and appropriate shifts to create the inner line.
    - **Digit 1:** Similar to Version 1.
3. **Output:** Returns the modified canvas.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version utilizes different combinations of functions and logic, offering unique perspectives on solving the problem.
