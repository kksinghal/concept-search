## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking the input digit and creating two distinct shapes based on its parity (even or odd):

**Input_0 (7 - Odd):**

1. **Background:**  A 10x10 canvas is created with a background color of 0.
2. **Shape 1:** A 5x9 rectangle filled with the color 4 is placed at the top of the canvas. 
3. **Shape 2:** A 5x5 square filled with the color 4 is placed at the bottom of the canvas.
4. **Inner Fill (Odd):** A 3x3 square within the bottom shape is filled with the color 1.

**Input_1 (7 - Odd):**

1. **Background:** A 10x10 canvas is created with a background color of 0.
2. **Shape 1:** A 6x9 rectangle filled with the color 4 is placed at the top of the canvas. 
3. **Shape 2:** A 4x5 rectangle filled with the color 4 is placed at the bottom of the canvas.
4. **Inner Fill (Odd):** A 2x3 rectangle within the bottom shape is filled with the color 1.


**General Pattern:**

* The input digit determines the inner fill color (1 for even, 2 for odd) and the position of the inner filled area.
* The two main shapes (rectangle and square/rectangle) are always filled with the color 4. 
* The exact dimensions and positions of the shapes change slightly based on the input's parity.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  # Canvas and background
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  
  # Determine fill color and position based on input parity
  fill_color = 1 if I[0] % 2 == 0 else 2
  top_height = 5 if I[0] % 2 == 0 else 6
  bottom_width = 5 if I[0] % 2 == 0 else 4
  inner_start_i = 3 if I[0] % 2 == 0 else 7
  inner_height = 3 if I[0] % 2 == 0 else 2

  # Draw shapes
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, product(interval(1, top_height + 1, 1), interval(1, 10, 1))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, product(interval(top_height + 2, 11, 1), interval(4 - bottom_width // 2, 4 - bottom_width // 2 + bottom_width, 1))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(fill_color, product(interval(inner_start_i, inner_start_i + inner_height, 1), interval(4, 7, 1)))) 
  
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

* This version directly calculates the dimensions and positions of the shapes based on the input parity.
* It uses `product` and `interval` for creating rectangular areas to be filled.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  
  # Shape definitions
  top_rect = product(interval(1, 6, 1), interval(1, 10, 1))
  bottom_rect = product(interval(7, 11, 1), interval(3, 8, 1))
  even_inner = product(interval(3, 6, 1), interval(4, 7, 1))
  odd_inner = product(interval(7, 9, 1), interval(4, 6, 1))

  # Conditional painting based on parity
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, top_rect))
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, bottom_rect))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, even_inner)) if I[0] % 2 == 0 else paint(O, recolor(2, odd_inner))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version predefines the shapes and conditionally paints the inner area based on the input parity.
* It avoids redundant calculations by reusing shape definitions.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  
  # Define common shapes
  rect_top = product(interval(1, 5, 1), interval(1, 9, 1))
  rect_bottom = product(interval(6, 10, 1), interval(3, 7, 1))

  # Draw common shapes
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, rect_top))
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, rect_bottom))

  # Conditional inner fill based on parity
  if I[0] % 2 == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, product(interval(3, 5, 1), interval(4, 6, 1))))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, product(interval(7, 9, 1), interval(4, 6, 1))))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Similar to version 2, but focuses on separating the common shape definitions from the conditional inner fill logic.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  # Determine fill color and offsets
  fill_color = 1 if I[0] % 2 == 0 else 2
  offset_i = 0 if I[0] % 2 == 0 else 4
  offset_j = 1 if I[0] % 2 == 0 else 0

  # Draw shapes with calculated offsets
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(4, product(interval(1, 6, 1), interval(1, 10, 1))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, product(interval(6, 11, 1), interval(3, 8, 1))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(fill_color, product(interval(3 + offset_i, 5 + offset_i, 1), interval(4 + offset_j, 6 + offset_j, 1)))) 

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version calculates offsets for the inner fill area based on input parity.
* It simplifies the code by using offsets instead of recalculating the entire position.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Define base shapes
  base_top = product(interval(1, 5, 1), interval(1, 9, 1))
  base_bottom = product(interval(6, 10, 1), interval(2, 6, 1)) # Adjusted base for offset

  # Apply conditional shifts for complete shapes
  top_shape = base_top
  bottom_shape = base_bottom if I[0] % 2 == 0 else shift(base_bottom, (0, 2))
  inner_shape = product(interval(3, 5, 1), interval(4, 6, 1)) if I[0] % 2 == 0 else shift(product(interval(3, 5, 1), interval(4, 6, 1)), (4, 1))

  # Draw shapes
  O = paint(paint(paint(O, recolor(4, top_shape)), recolor(4, bottom_shape)), recolor(1 if I[0] % 2 == 0 else 2, inner_shape))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version defines base shapes and uses `shift` to position them correctly based on parity.
* It demonstrates a more modular approach by manipulating shapes independently.


These five versions showcase different approaches to achieving the same transformation while using distinct DSL function combinations and logic, making them significantly different from each other.
