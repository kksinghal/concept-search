## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** A 10x10 canvas filled with 0s is created.
2. **Object Placement:** Two 4x4 squares of value 4 are placed on the canvas. The top square is positioned with its upper-left corner at (1,1). The bottom square is positioned with its upper-left corner at (6,3). 
3. **Conditional Filling:**  A 2x2 square is filled with either value 1 or 2 depending on the input. If the input is even, the square is filled with 1 and placed with its upper-left corner at (3,4). If the input is odd, the square is filled with 2 and placed with its upper-left corner at (7,4).

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

1. **Canvas Creation:**  A 10x10 canvas filled with 0s is created.
2. **Object Placement:** Two 4x6 rectangles of value 4 are placed on the canvas. The top rectangle is positioned with its upper-left corner at (1,1). The bottom rectangle is positioned with its upper-left corner at (7,3). 
3. **Conditional Filling:**  A 2x2 square is filled with either value 1 or 2 depending on the input. If the input is odd, the square is filled with 1 and placed with its upper-left corner at (8,4). If the input is even, the square is filled with 2 and placed with its upper-left corner at (3,4).

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  color_fill = 1 if I[0] % 2 == 0 else 2
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, product(interval(1, 6, 1), interval(1, 10, 1))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, product(interval(6, 11, 1), interval(3, 8, 1))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(color_fill, product(interval(3 if I[0] % 2 == 0 else 7, 5 if I[0] % 2 == 0 else 9, 1), interval(4, 7, 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Color Selection:** This line determines the fill color (1 or 2) for the smaller square based on the parity of the input `I[0]`. 
2. **Canvas Initialization:** A 10x10 canvas `O` is created and filled with 0s.
3. **Top Rectangle:** The top rectangle is drawn using `paint` and `recolor`, filling a 4x6 area with the value 4.
4. **Bottom Rectangle:** The bottom rectangle is drawn similarly to the top rectangle but positioned differently.
5. **Conditional Square:** This line draws the smaller 2x2 square. The position and fill color are determined by the input `I[0]`.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, product(interval(1, 5, 1), interval(1, 9, 1))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, product(interval(6, 10, 1), interval(3, 7, 1))))
  if I[0] % 2 == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, product(interval(3, 5, 1), interval(4, 6, 1))))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, product(interval(7, 9, 1), interval(4, 6, 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** Similar to version 1, a 10x10 canvas is created.
2. **Rectangles:** The two 4x4 rectangles with value 4 are drawn.
3. **Conditional Square:** An `if` statement checks the parity of `I[0]` and draws the 2x2 square accordingly, filling it with 1 if even and 2 if odd.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  for i in range(1, 5):
    for j in range(1, 9):
      O = paint(O, recolor(4, {(i, j)}))
  for i in range(6, 10):
    for j in range(3, 7):
      O = paint(O, recolor(4, {(i, j)}))
  fill_color = 1 if I[0] % 2 == 0 else 2
  start_i = 3 if I[0] % 2 == 0 else 7
  for i in range(start_i, start_i + 2):
    for j in range(4, 6):
      O = paint(O, recolor(fill_color, {(i, j)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Rectangles:** This version uses nested loops to individually paint each cell of the two rectangles with value 4.
3. **Conditional Square:** Similar to version 2 but uses nested loops to paint each cell individually.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  is_even = I[0] % 2 == 0
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(4, product(interval(1, 5, 1), interval(1, 9, 1))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, product(interval(6, 10, 1), interval(3, 7, 1))))
  square_pos = (3, 4) if is_even else (7, 4)
  O = paint(O, recolor(1 if is_even else 2, product(interval(square_pos[0], square_pos[0] + 2, 1), interval(square_pos[1], square_pos[1] + 2, 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Parity Check:**  This line directly calculates whether the input `I[0]` is even and stores it in `is_even`.
2. **Combined Painting:**  The canvas creation and painting of the first rectangle are combined into a single line.
3. **Square Position:** The starting position of the smaller square is pre-calculated based on `is_even`.
4. **Conditional Painting:** The smaller square is painted using the pre-calculated position and fill color based on `is_even`.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  top_rect = product(interval(1, 5, 1), interval(1, 9, 1))
  bottom_rect = product(interval(6, 10, 1), interval(3, 7, 1))
  gap_rect = product(interval(3, 5, 1), interval(4, 6, 1)) if I[0] % 2 == 0 else product(interval(7, 9, 1), interval(4, 6, 1))
  O = paint(paint(paint(O, recolor(4, top_rect)), recolor(4, bottom_rect)), recolor(1 if I[0] % 2 == 0 else 2, gap_rect))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Pre-calculation of Areas:** This version pre-calculates the indices for all three shapes (two rectangles and the square) and stores them in `top_rect`, `bottom_rect`, and `gap_rect` respectively.
2. **Chained Painting:** The painting of all shapes is done in a single line using chained `paint` calls. This makes the code more compact.


Each of these versions provides a distinct approach to achieve the same transformation. They differ in their use of loops, conditional statements, pre-calculation of values, and chaining of functions.
