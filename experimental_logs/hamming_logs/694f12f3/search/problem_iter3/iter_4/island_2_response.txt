## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves creating two distinct shapes based on the input digit (7): a larger rectangle and a smaller rectangle. 

**Input 0:** 
- **Larger Rectangle:** The larger rectangle is 6x5, filled with the value 4, and positioned at the top left corner for input 0.
- **Smaller Rectangle:** The smaller rectangle is 2x3, filled with the value 1, and positioned one cell down and one cell right from the top left corner of the larger rectangle.

**Input 1:**
- **Larger Rectangle:** The larger rectangle is 6x6, filled with the value 4, and positioned at the bottom right corner for input 1. 
- **Smaller Rectangle:** The smaller rectangle is 2x3, filled with the value 2, and positioned one cell up and one cell left from the bottom right corner of the larger rectangle. 

Essentially, the input digit determines the position, size, and color of the smaller rectangle, while the larger rectangle's position is also affected.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct programs achieving the described transformation:

### Program Version 1:

```python
def program_v1(I):
  d = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  lr = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(6) for j in range(5 + d))
  sr = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(2) for j in range(3))
  lr = shift(lr, (0, 5 * d)) 
  sr = shift(sr, (1 + d, 6 * d))
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, lr))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1 + d, sr))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Input Check:** `d = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7` checks if the input digit is 7 and stores the boolean result in `d`.
2. **Canvas Creation:** `O = canvas(0, (10, 10))` creates a 10x10 canvas filled with 0s.
3. **Rectangle Definitions:**  
    - `lr` represents the larger rectangle (6x5 or 6x6 depending on `d`).
    - `sr` represents the smaller rectangle (always 2x3).
4. **Position Adjustment:** 
    - `lr = shift(lr, (0, 5 * d))` shifts the larger rectangle to the right by 5 units if `d` is True (input is 7).
    - `sr = shift(sr, (1 + d, 6 * d))` shifts the smaller rectangle down and right based on `d`.
5. **Painting:**
    - `O = paint(O, recolor(4, lr))` paints the larger rectangle with value 4.
    - `O = paint(O, recolor(1 + d, sr))` paints the smaller rectangle with value 1 or 2 based on `d`.

### Program Version 2:

```python
def program_v2(I):
  d = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, {(i, j) for i in range(6) for j in range(5 + d)}))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1 + d, {(i + 1 + d, j + 6 * d) for i in range(2) for j in range(3)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version streamlines the process by directly embedding the rectangle definitions and position adjustments within the `paint` function calls.

### Program Version 3:

```python
def program_v3(I):
  is_seven = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  lr_dims = (6, 5 + is_seven)
  lr_start = (0, 5 * is_seven)
  sr_dims = (2, 3)
  sr_start = (1 + is_seven, 6 * is_seven)
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, {(i, j) for i in range(lr_start[0], lr_start[0] + lr_dims[0]) for j in range(lr_start[1], lr_start[1] + lr_dims[1])}))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1 + is_seven, {(i, j) for i in range(sr_start[0], sr_start[0] + sr_dims[0]) for j in range(sr_start[1], sr_start[1] + sr_dims[1])}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version introduces variables for rectangle dimensions (`lr_dims`, `sr_dims`) and starting positions (`lr_start`, `sr_start`) to improve readability and make the code more modular.

### Program Version 4:

```python
def program_v4(I):
  d = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  lr = {(i, j) for i in range(6) for j in range(5)}
  sr = {(i, j) for i in range(2) for j in range(3)}
  lr = shift(lr, (0, 5 * d)) 
  sr = shift(sr, (1, 1)) if d else shift(sr, (2, 3))
  sr = upscale(sr, 1 + d)
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, lr))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1 + d, sr))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages the `upscale` function to dynamically adjust the size of the smaller rectangle based on the input. 

### Program Version 5:

```python
def program_v5(I):
  d = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, {(i, j) for i in range(6) for j in range(5 + d * 5)}))
  small_rect = {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)}
  small_rect = shift(small_rect, (1 + d, 1 + 5 * d))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1 + d, small_rect))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly defines the smaller rectangle as a set of coordinates and then shifts it based on the input. This approach avoids using nested loops for rectangle definition.


These five versions showcase distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation using different function combinations and logic. Each version is significantly different and demonstrates the flexibility of the DSL in solving this spatial reasoning problem.
