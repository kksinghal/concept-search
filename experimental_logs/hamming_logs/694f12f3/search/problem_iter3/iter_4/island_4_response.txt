## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:**

The transformation takes a single cell grid (representing a location) and generates two rectangles. 
* The top rectangle is 5 units wide and 4 units tall, centered horizontally at the input cell's column.
* The bottom rectangle is also 5 units wide and 4 units tall, centered horizontally at the input cell's column but positioned 2 rows below the top rectangle.
* The inner 3x3 area of both rectangles is filled with a different color (color 1) than the rest of the rectangle (color 4).

**Input 1 -> Output 1:**

This transformation is similar to the previous one, but with a few key differences:
* The top rectangle is now 6 units wide.
* The bottom rectangle starts one row lower.
* The inner area of the bottom rectangle is shifted one column to the right. 

This suggests a pattern based on the parity (even/odd) of the input cell's value.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformations:

**Program Version 1: Using Conditional Logic**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  x = index(I, (0, 0)) % 2 == 0
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, product(interval(1, 5 if x else 6, 1), interval(1, 10, 1))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, product(interval(7 if x else 8, 11, 1), interval(3 if x else 2, 8 if x else 7, 1))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, product(interval(3 if x else 7, 6 if x else 9, 1), interval(4, 7, 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  A 10x10 canvas `O` is created, filled with color 0.
2. **Parity Check:**  The code checks if the value at cell (0, 0) of the input is even using `x = index(I, (0, 0)) % 2 == 0`. 
3. **Rectangle Drawing:**  The `product` and `interval` functions define the areas of the two rectangles. The `recolor` function sets the color to 4. The `paint` function draws the rectangles on the canvas. The dimensions and positions of the rectangles are controlled by conditional expressions (`if x else`) based on the parity check.
4. **Inner Area Filling:** Similar to the rectangle drawing, the inner 3x3 areas are filled with color 1 using conditional logic.

**Program Version 2: Using Offsets**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  offset = 1 if index(I, (0, 0)) % 2 == 0 else 0 
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, product(interval(1, 6 - offset, 1), interval(1, 10, 1))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, product(interval(7 + offset, 11, 1), interval(2 + offset, 7 + offset, 1))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, product(interval(3 + offset * 4, 6 + offset * 3, 1), interval(4, 7, 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version simplifies the logic by using an `offset` variable:
1. **Offset Calculation:**  `offset` is 1 if the input cell value is even, else 0.
2. **Rectangle and Inner Area Drawing:**  The `offset` is used to adjust the starting and ending points of the `interval` functions, controlling the dimensions and positions of the rectangles and their inner areas.

**Program Version 3:  Using Helper Functions**

```python
def draw_rectangle(O, color, top_left, dimensions):
  return paint(O, recolor(color, product(interval(top_left[0], top_left[0] + dimensions[0], 1), interval(top_left[1], top_left[1] + dimensions[1], 1))))

def program_v3(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  is_even = index(I, (0, 0)) % 2 == 0
  top_offset = 0 if is_even else 1
  bottom_offset = 1 if is_even else 2 
  O = draw_rectangle(O, 4, (1, 1), (4, 9))
  O = draw_rectangle(O, 4, (7 + top_offset, 3 - top_offset), (4, 5))
  O = draw_rectangle(O, 1, (3 + bottom_offset * 4, 4), (3, 3))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version introduces a helper function `draw_rectangle` for better code organization:
1. **`draw_rectangle` Function:**  This function takes the canvas, color, top-left corner coordinates, and dimensions as input and draws a rectangle on the canvas.
2. **Main Logic:** The main logic remains similar to previous versions, but now uses the `draw_rectangle` function for better readability and modularity.

**Program Version 4: Using Shifts**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  is_even = index(I, (0, 0)) % 2 == 0
  base_rect_top = recolor(4, product(interval(1, 5, 1), interval(1, 10, 1)))
  base_rect_bottom = recolor(4, product(interval(7, 11, 1), interval(3, 8, 1)))
  inner_rect = recolor(1, product(interval(3, 6, 1), interval(4, 7, 1)))
  O = paint(O, base_rect_top)
  O = paint(O, shift(base_rect_bottom, (0 if is_even else 1, 0 if is_even else -1)))
  O = paint(O, shift(inner_rect, (4 if is_even else 7, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the `shift` function to move pre-defined shapes:
1. **Base Shape Definition:**  The code first defines the base shapes of the rectangles and the inner area using `recolor` and `product`.
2. **Conditional Shifting:**  Based on the parity check, the bottom rectangle and inner area are shifted to their correct positions using the `shift` function.

**Program Version 5:  Combining Objects**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  is_even = index(I, (0, 0)) % 2 == 0
  top_rect = recolor(4, product(interval(1, 5 if is_even else 6, 1), interval(1, 10, 1)))
  bottom_rect = recolor(4, product(interval(7 if is_even else 8, 11, 1), interval(3 if is_even else 2, 8 if is_even else 7, 1)))
  inner_rect = recolor(1, product(interval(3, 6, 1), interval(4, 7, 1)))
  combined_obj = top_rect | bottom_rect | shift(inner_rect, (4 if is_even else 7, 0))
  O = paint(O, combined_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version combines the shapes into a single object before painting:
1. **Shape Definition and Shifting:**  The rectangles and inner areas are defined similarly to the previous version. The inner area is shifted based on parity.
2. **Object Combination:**  The shapes are combined using the `|` operator, creating a single object representing the final output.
3. **Painting:**  The combined object is then painted onto the canvas.

These five programs demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing different DSL functions and logic flow. Each program offers a unique perspective on solving the problem while adhering to the constraints of the provided DSL.
