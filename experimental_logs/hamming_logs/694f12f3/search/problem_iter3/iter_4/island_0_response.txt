## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single digit as input and produces a 10x10 grid as output. The output grid contains two distinct shapes drawn with different digits (1, 2, and 4). 

* **Shape 1:** This shape is a square (5x5 or 6x6) outlined by the digit '4' and filled with a specific digit (1 or 2) based on the input digit. If the input digit is '7', the square is filled with '1'; otherwise, it's filled with '2'.
* **Shape 2:** This shape is always a 5x4 rectangle outlined by the digit '4' and filled with the digit '2'.

The positioning of these shapes also depends on the input digit:

* **Input '7':** Shape 1 is placed at the top-left corner of the grid, and shape 2 is placed below it, starting from the 7th row.
* **Other inputs:** Shape 1 is placed at the bottom-right corner, spanning from the 3rd column to the 9th column, and shape 2 is placed above it, starting from the 2nd row.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) # Canvas of 0s

  # Shape 1 parameters based on input
  fill_value = 1 if I == 7 else 2
  shape_size = (5, 5) if I == 7 else (6, 6)
  shape_pos = (1, 1) if I == 7 else (0, 3)

  # Create and paint Shape 1
  shape_1 = canvas(4, shape_size)
  shape_1 = fill(shape_1, fill_value, product(interval(1, shape_size[1] - 1, 1), interval(1, shape_size[0] - 1, 1)))
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(shape_1), shape_pos))

  # Create and paint Shape 2
  shape_2 = canvas(4, (5, 4))
  shape_2 = fill(shape_2, 2, product(interval(1, 3, 1), interval(1, 3, 1)))
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(shape_2), (6 if I == 7 else 2, 4)))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0'.
2. Defines the fill value, size, and position of Shape 1 based on the input digit 'I'.
3. Creates Shape 1 by first making a square of '4's with the determined size and then filling its interior with the appropriate digit.
4. Paints Shape 1 onto the canvas at the determined position.
5. Creates Shape 2 as a fixed-size rectangle of '4's filled with '2's.
6. Paints Shape 2 onto the canvas at a position determined by the input digit 'I'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) # Canvas of 0s

  # Define shapes as objects
  shape_1 = frozenset({(4, (0, 0)), (4, (0, 1)), (4, (0, 2)), (4, (0, 3)), (4, (0, 4)), (4, (1, 0)), (1 if I == 7 else 2, (1, 1)), (1 if I == 7 else 2, (1, 2)), (1 if I == 7 else 2, (1, 3)), (4, (1, 4)), (4, (2, 0)), (1 if I == 7 else 2, (2, 1)), (1 if I == 7 else 2, (2, 2)), (1 if I == 7 else 2, (2, 3)), (4, (2, 4)), (4, (3, 0)), (1 if I == 7 else 2, (3, 1)), (1 if I == 7 else 2, (3, 2)), (1 if I == 7 else 2, (3, 3)), (4, (3, 4)), (4, (4, 0)), (4, (4, 1)), (4, (4, 2)), (4, (4, 3)), (4, (4, 4))})
  shape_2 = frozenset({(4, (0, 0)), (4, (0, 1)), (4, (0, 2)), (4, (0, 3)), (4, (1, 0)), (2, (1, 1)), (2, (1, 2)), (4, (1, 3)), (4, (2, 0)), (2, (2, 1)), (2, (2, 2)), (4, (2, 3)), (4, (3, 0)), (4, (3, 1)), (4, (3, 2)), (4, (3, 3))})

  # Position shapes based on input
  if I == 7:
    O = paint(O, shape_1)
    O = paint(O, shift(shape_2, (6, 4)))
  else:
    O = paint(O, shift(shape_1, (0, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(shape_2, (2, 4)))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0'.
2. Defines Shape 1 and Shape 2 directly as objects with their respective cell values and coordinates. The fill value of Shape 1 is determined based on the input digit 'I'.
3. Positions Shape 1 and Shape 2 on the canvas based on the input digit 'I', using the 'shift' function for appropriate placement.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Determine shape sizes based on input
  size_1 = 5 if I == 7 else 6
  size_2 = 4

  # Create and combine shapes using 'product'
  shape_1 = frozenset({(4, (i, j)) for i in range(size_1) for j in range(size_1)} | {(1 if I == 7 else 2, (i, j)) for i in range(1, size_1 - 1) for j in range(1, size_1 - 1)})
  shape_2 = frozenset({(4, (i, j)) for i in range(size_2) for j in range(size_2 - 1)} | {(2, (i, j)) for i in range(1, size_2 - 1) for j in range(1, size_2 - 2)})

  # Position and paint shapes onto the canvas
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, shift(shape_1, (1 if I == 7 else 0, 1 if I == 7 else 3)))
  O = paint(O, shift(shape_2, (6 if I == 7 else 2, 4)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Determines the size of Shape 1 and Shape 2 based on the input digit 'I'.
2. Creates Shape 1 and Shape 2 directly as objects using set comprehension and the 'product' function to define their boundaries and fill.
3. Positions and paints the shapes onto the canvas based on the input digit 'I', utilizing the 'shift' function.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) # Canvas of 0s

  # Function to create a filled rectangle
  def filled_rect(size, fill_value, offset=(0, 0)):
    return frozenset({(4, (i + offset[0], j + offset[1])) for i in range(size[0]) for j in range(size[1])} | 
                   {(fill_value, (i + offset[0] + 1, j + offset[1] + 1)) for i in range(size[0] - 2) for j in range(size[1] - 2)})

  # Create shapes using 'filled_rect' function
  shape_1 = filled_rect((5 if I == 7 else 6, 5 if I == 7 else 6), 1 if I == 7 else 2, (1 if I == 7 else 0, 1 if I == 7 else 3))
  shape_2 = filled_rect((4, 4), 2, (6 if I == 7 else 2, 4))

  # Paint shapes onto the canvas
  O = paint(O, shape_1)
  O = paint(O, shape_2)

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0'.
2. Defines a helper function 'filled_rect' to create filled rectangles with specified size, fill value, and offset.
3. Creates Shape 1 and Shape 2 using the 'filled_rect' function, dynamically determining their size, fill value, and offset based on the input digit 'I'.
4. Paints the generated shapes onto the canvas.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Determine shape parameters based on input
  fill_value = 1 if I == 7 else 2
  shape_1_pos = (1, 1) if I == 7 else (0, 3)
  shape_2_pos = (6, 4) if I == 7 else (2, 4)

  # Define base shapes
  base_square = canvas(4, (5, 5))
  base_rect = canvas(4, (5, 4))

  # Fill shapes based on input
  shape_1 = fill(base_square, fill_value, product(interval(1, 4, 1), interval(1, 4, 1)))
  if I != 7:
    shape_1 = vconcat(shape_1, (4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4))
    shape_1 = hconcat(shape_1, ((4,), (4,), (4,), (4,), (4,), (4,)))
  shape_2 = fill(base_rect, 2, product(interval(1, 3, 1), interval(1, 3, 1)))

  # Position and paint shapes onto the canvas
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(shape_1), shape_1_pos))
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(shape_2), shape_2_pos))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Determines the fill value for Shape 1 and positions for both shapes based on the input digit 'I'.
2. Defines base shapes for Shape 1 and Shape 2 - a 5x5 square and a 5x4 rectangle, both outlined with '4'.
3. Fills Shape 1 based on the input: uses the base square and fills it with the determined value. If the input is not '7', it enlarges the square to 6x6 by adding rows and columns.
4. Fills Shape 2 with '2' using the base rectangle.
5. Positions and paints the filled shapes onto the canvas at their respective positions using the 'shift' function.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic. Each version offers a distinct way of generating and positioning the shapes based on the input digit, highlighting the flexibility of the DSL and showcasing diverse coding styles.
