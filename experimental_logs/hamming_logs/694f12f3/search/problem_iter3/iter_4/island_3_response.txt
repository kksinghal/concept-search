## Transformation Analysis:

The task involves drawing stylized digits '7' and '1' on a 10x10 canvas based on the input digit. Here's a breakdown of the transformation for each digit:

**Digit 7:**

1. **Main Structure:** A slanted line from (1,1) to (4,4) and a horizontal line from (1,4) to (1,9) form the basic '7' shape.
2. **Inner Fill:** The two cells enclosed within the '7' at (2,2) and (3,3) are filled with a secondary color (1).
3. **Color Scheme:** The '7' is drawn with a main color (4) and the inner fill uses a secondary color (1).

**Digit 1:**

1. **Main Structure:** A vertical line from (1,6) to (5,6) and a short horizontal line from (1,7) to (1,9) form the '1'.
2. **Extended Base:** Two 3x3 squares are added to the base of the vertical line, extending from (2,6) to (4,8).
3. **Color Scheme:**  The '1' is drawn with a main color (4) and the top-left 2x2 square of the extended base is filled with a secondary color (2).


## Program Versions:

Below are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  canvas_size = (10, 10)
  background_color = 0
  main_color = 4
  secondary_color = 1 if digit == 7 else 2 
  canvas_ = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)
  
  if digit == 7:
    # Construct the "7" using lines
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, main_color, connect((1, 1), (4, 4))) 
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, main_color, connect((1, 4), (1, 9)))
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, secondary_color, connect((2, 2), (3, 3))) 
  elif digit == 1:
    # Construct the "1" using lines and squares
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, main_color, connect((1, 6), (5, 6))) 
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, main_color, connect((1, 7), (1, 9)))
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, main_color, astuple(2, 6) + astuple(3, 8)) # Square 1
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, main_color, astuple(3, 6) + astuple(4, 8)) # Square 2
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, secondary_color, astuple(2, 6) + astuple(3, 7)) # Fill top-left
  return canvas_
```

**Explanation:**

- **Digit 7:**  Draws the '7' using `connect` for the slanted and horizontal lines, then fills the inner cells with the secondary color.
- **Digit 1:** Draws the '1' using `connect` for the lines and defines the two base squares using coordinate addition (`astuple`). The top-left square is then filled with the secondary color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) 
  if digit == 7:
    seven = vconcat(canvas((4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),), 
                    canvas((4, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),),
                    canvas((4, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),), 
                    canvas((4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),),
                    canvas((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),),
                    canvas((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),),
                    canvas((0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0),),
                    canvas((0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0),),
                    canvas((0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0),),
                    canvas((0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0),))
    O = paint(O, asobject(seven))
  elif digit == 1:
    one = vconcat(canvas((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),),
                   canvas((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),),
                   canvas((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),),
                   canvas((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),),
                   canvas((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0),),
                   canvas((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0),),
                   canvas((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0),),
                   canvas((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0),),
                   canvas((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0),),
                   canvas((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),))
    O = paint(O, asobject(one))
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

- **Direct Representation:** This version directly defines the pixel values of the '7' and '1' within the code using nested tuples and `vconcat` for vertical concatenation. 
- **Painting onto Canvas:**  It then uses `asobject` to convert these representations into objects and paints them onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  canvas_size = (10, 10)
  background_color = 0
  main_color = 4
  secondary_color = 1 if digit == 7 else 2
  canvas_ = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)
  
  if digit == 7:
    # Construct the "7" using shifting and combining
    segment = asobject(canvas(main_color, (1, 4)))
    seven = segment
    for i in range(1, 4):
      seven = seven.union(shift(segment, (i, i)))
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, seven)
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, secondary_color, astuple(2, 2) + astuple(3, 4))
  elif digit == 1:
    # Construct the "1" using shifting and combining
    body = asobject(shift(canvas(main_color, (6, 1)), (1, 6)))
    base = asobject(canvas(main_color, (3, 3)))
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, body)
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, shift(base, (2, 6)))
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, shift(base, (3, 6)))
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, secondary_color, astuple(2, 6) + astuple(3, 7))
  return canvas_
```

**Explanation:**

- **Building Blocks:**  This version breaks down the digits into smaller segments or building blocks.
- **Shifting and Combining:** It utilizes `shift` to move the segments into their correct positions and `union` to combine them.
- **Digit 7:**  A single segment is repeatedly shifted and combined to form the slanted line. 
- **Digit 1:**  The vertical line and base squares are created separately and then combined.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  canvas_size = (10, 10)
  background_color = 0
  main_color = 4
  secondary_color = 1 if digit == 7 else 2
  canvas_ = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)
  
  if digit == 7:
    # Construct the "7" using mirroring
    segment = asobject(canvas(main_color, (4, 1)))
    seven = hconcat(segment, hmirror(segment))
    seven = vconcat(canvas((4,), (1, 6)), canvas((0,), (1, 4)))
    seven = vconcat(seven, seven)
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, shift(seven, (1, 1)))
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, secondary_color,  astuple(2, 2) + astuple(3, 4))
  elif digit == 1:
    # Construct the "1" using combining
    one_body = asobject(shift(canvas(main_color, (6, 1)), (1, 6)))
    one_flag = asobject(canvas(main_color, (3, 3)))
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, one_body)
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, shift(one_flag, (2, 6)))
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, shift(one_flag, (3, 6)))
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, secondary_color,  astuple(2, 6) + astuple(3, 7))
  return canvas_
```

**Explanation:**

- **Mirroring:**  This version utilizes the `hmirror` function to create symmetrical parts of the digits, specifically for the '7'.
- **Digit 7:**  The slanted line is created by horizontally mirroring a single vertical segment.
- **Digit 1:**  Retains the logic of building blocks from Version 3.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    d = I[0][0]
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    c1 = 4
    c2 = 1 if d == 7 else 2

    if d == 7:
        p1 = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)}
        p2 = {(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9)}
        p3 = {(2, 2), (3, 3)}
        O = fill(O, c1, p1)
        O = fill(O, c1, p2)
        O = fill(O, c2, p3)
    elif d == 1:
        p1 = {(1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)}
        p2 = {(1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9)}
        p3 = {(2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8)}
        p4 = {(2, 6), (3, 6)}
        O = fill(O, c1, p1)
        O = fill(O, c1, p2)
        O = fill(O, c1, p3)
        O = fill(O, c2, p4)

    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **Predefined Coordinate Sets:**  This version predefines the coordinates for each part of the digits as sets (`p1`, `p2`, etc.).
- **Direct Filling:**  It then directly fills the canvas with the main and secondary colors at the specified coordinates.
- **Intuitive Representation:**  While potentially less efficient, this approach offers a highly readable and intuitive representation of the digit construction. 

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to solve the digit drawing problem, ensuring zero similarity in their logic and function combinations.
