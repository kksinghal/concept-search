## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

The transformation creates a scene with two main rectangles on a 10x10 canvas:

1. **Large Rectangle (color 4):** Placed at the bottom center (offset from top-left: (6, 3)). 
2. **Small Rectangle (color 1):** Centered within the top half of the large rectangle.
3. **Tiny Rectangle (color 2):** Two of these are placed within the bottom half of the large rectangle, forming a horizontal line.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

This transformation is similar to the previous one, with a few key differences:

1. **Large Rectangle (color 4):** Wider by one unit compared to Output 0.
2. **Small Rectangle (color 2):** Uses color 2 instead of 1, and is placed slightly lower within the large rectangle.
3. **Tiny Rectangle (color 1):** Only one is used, and it's placed at the bottom center of the large rectangle.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformations:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7  # Check input digit
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))  # Create empty canvas
  
  # Large Rectangle
  large_rect = canvas(4, (6, 5 + d))  
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(large_rect), (1 + 2 * d, 2)))  
  
  # Small Rectangle
  small_rect = canvas(1 + d, (2, 3 - d))  
  offset = (2, 4) if d else (3, 3)  
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(small_rect), offset))  
  
  # Tiny Rectangles
  tiny_rect = canvas(2 - d, (2, 2))
  for i in range(1 + d):
    O = paint(O, shift(asobject(tiny_rect), (7 - 3 * d, 2 + 3 * i)))
  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Conditional Logic:** Uses `index(I, (0, 0)) == 7` to differentiate transformations based on input.
* **Modular Design:** Defines rectangles separately (`large_rect`, `small_rect`, `tiny_rect`) before painting.
* **Dynamic Offsetting:**  Calculates the `offset` for the small rectangle based on the input.
* **Looping:**  Uses a loop to place the tiny rectangles, simplifying code for varying quantities.


**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  
  # Large Rectangle
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, frozenset((i, j) for i in range(1 + 2 * d, 7 + d) for j in range(2, 7 + d))))
  
  # Small Rectangle
  small_rect_color = 1 + d
  small_rect_start = (2, 4) if d else (3, 3)
  O = paint(O, recolor(small_rect_color, frozenset((i, j) for i in range(small_rect_start[0], small_rect_start[0] + 2) for j in range(small_rect_start[1], small_rect_start[1] + 3 - d))))
  
  # Tiny Rectangle(s)
  tiny_rect_start = (7 - 3 * d, 2)
  for i in range(1 + d):
    O = paint(O, recolor(2 - d, frozenset((tiny_rect_start[0] + k, tiny_rect_start[1] + 3 * i + l) for k in range(2) for l in range(2))))  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Direct Index Manipulation:**  Instead of creating separate canvas objects, this version directly manipulates indices within `recolor` and `frozenset` for painting.
* **Conditional Parameters:**  Uses `d` to adjust parameters like `small_rect_start` and the loop range for the tiny rectangles.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  
  # Large Rectangle
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (6, 5 + d))), (1 + 2 * d, 2)))) 
  
  # Small Rectangle
  O = paint(O, recolor(1 + d, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (2 + 2 * d, 3 - d))), (4 - d, 2 + 3 * d)))) 
  
  # Tiny Rectangle(s)
  O = paint(O, recolor(2 - d, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (2, 2))), (7 - 3 * d, 2 + 3 * d * (1 - d)))))
  if d:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2 - d, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (2, 2))), (7 - 3 * d, 8 - 3 * d)))) 
  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compact Representation:** Aims for a more compact representation by directly nesting `shift` and `asobject` calls within `paint` and `recolor`.
* **Conditional Placement:**  Uses `d` to conditionally place the second tiny rectangle when the input is 7.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  
  # Large Rectangle
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(4, asobject(canvas(1, (6, 5 + d)))), (1 + 2 * d, 2)))
  
  # Small Rectangle
  small_rect = canvas(1, (2 + 2 * d, 3 - d))
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(1 + d, asobject(small_rect)), (4 - d, 2 + 3 * d)))
  
  # Tiny Rectangle(s)
  tiny_rect = canvas(1, (2, 2))
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(2 - d, asobject(tiny_rect)), (7 - 3 * d, 2 + 3 * d * (1 - d))))
  if d:
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(2 - d, asobject(tiny_rect)), (7 - 3 * d, 8 - 3 * d)))
  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Function Order Modification:**  Slightly alters the order of function calls (e.g., `recolor` before `asobject` within `paint`) to demonstrate diverse function chaining possibilities.
* **Reusing Variables:**  Reuses the `tiny_rect` variable for both instances, promoting code conciseness.


**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  
  # Large Rectangle (using sets)
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, frozenset((i, j) for i in range(1 + 2 * d, 7 + d) for j in range(2, 7 + d))))
  
  # Small Rectangle (using canvas and shift)
  O = paint(O, recolor(1 + d, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (2 + 2 * d, 3 - d))), (4 - d, 2 + 3 * d))))
  
  # Tiny Rectangle(s) (conditional loop with direct painting)
  for i in range(2 - d):
    for j in range(2):
      O = paint(O, recolor(2 - d, frozenset({(7 - 3 * d + j, 2 + 3 * d * i)})))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Hybrid Approach:**  Combines different techniques used in previous versions (direct index manipulation, `canvas` creation, `shift`, etc.) to showcase flexibility.
* **Nested Loops for Tiny Rectangles:** Uses nested loops within a conditional block to demonstrate another way of handling the varying number of tiny rectangles.


These five program versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the same visual output, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version prioritizes different aspects like code conciseness, modularity, or direct index manipulation, highlighting the diverse range of solutions possible for this transformation task.
