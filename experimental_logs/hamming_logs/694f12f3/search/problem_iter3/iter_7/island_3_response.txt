## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single digit (1 or 7) as input and produces a stylized version of that digit on a 10x10 grid. The output digit is composed of two colors:

* **Main color (4):** Forms the outline of the digit.
* **Secondary color (1 for 7, 2 for 1):** Fills the interior of certain parts of the digit. 

Let's analyze the specific transformations for each digit:

**Input 0 (Digit 7):**

1. The main outline of the '7' is drawn with two diagonal lines converging at the top right corner.
2. A horizontal line connects these diagonal lines at the top.
3. Two smaller squares are filled with the secondary color (1) within the main outline, creating the illusion of depth.
4. The '7' is positioned towards the top of the grid, and a larger version of the digit, filled with the secondary color (2) and outlined with the main color (4), is positioned towards the bottom.

**Input 1 (Digit 1):**

1. The main outline of the '1' is drawn as a vertical line.
2. A horizontal line extends to the right from the top of the vertical line.
3. Two smaller squares are filled with the secondary color (2) at the end of the horizontal line, creating the illusion of depth.
4. The '1' is positioned towards the left of the grid, and a larger version of the digit, filled with the secondary color (1) and outlined with the main color (4), is positioned towards the right.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions utilizing different DSL function combinations to achieve the desired transformations:

### Program Version 1:  (Building blocks approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  main_color = 4
  secondary_color = 1 if digit == 7 else 2

  if digit == 7:
    stroke = asobject(canvas(main_color, (4, 1)))
    seven = hconcat(stroke, hmirror(stroke))
    seven = vconcat(seven, canvas((0,), (2, 8)))
    seven = vconcat(seven, seven)
    O = paint(O, shift(asobject(seven), (1, 1)))
    O = fill(O, secondary_color,  {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 4), (8, 5)})
  elif digit == 1:
    one_body = asobject(shift(canvas(main_color, (6, 1)), (1, 6)))
    one_flag = asobject(canvas(main_color, (3, 3)))
    O = paint(O, one_body)
    O = paint(O, shift(one_flag, (2, 6)))
    O = paint(O, shift(one_flag, (3, 6)))
    O = fill(O, secondary_color, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(8, 10)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Digit 7:** This version builds the '7' by concatenating horizontal and vertical strokes. It then duplicates and positions the constructed '7' to create the larger version. 
* **Digit 1:**  This version first creates the vertical body and then paints the horizontal flag twice to create the 3D effect. It then fills in the specified region with the secondary color.

### Program Version 2: (Line drawing approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    digit = I[0][0]
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    main_color = 4
    secondary_color = 1 if digit == 7 else 2
  
    if digit == 7:
        O = paint(O, recolor(main_color, connect((1,1),(4,4))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(main_color, connect((1,4),(1,9))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(main_color, connect((4,1),(4,4))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(main_color, connect((6,1),(9,4))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(main_color, connect((6,4),(9,7))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(main_color, connect((9,1),(9,7))))
        O = fill(O, secondary_color,  {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (7, 2), (7, 3), (8, 2), (8, 3)})
    elif digit == 1:
        O = paint(O, recolor(main_color, connect((1,6),(6,6))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(main_color, connect((3,6),(5,8))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(main_color, connect((4,6),(6,8))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(main_color, connect((6,6),(6,8))))
        O = fill(O, secondary_color, {(i, j) for i in range(4, 6) for j in range(7, 9)}) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Digit 7 and 1**: This version utilizes the `connect` and `recolor` functions to draw lines that form the outline of the digits. It then fills in the specified areas with the secondary color.

### Program Version 3: (Shifting and Merging approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    digit = I[0][0]
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    main_color = 4
    secondary_color = 1 if digit == 7 else 2
  
    if digit == 7:
        base_seven = asobject(canvas(main_color, (4, 1)))
        seven = hconcat(base_seven, hmirror(base_seven))
        seven = vconcat(seven, canvas((0,), (2, 8)))
        seven = vconcat(seven, seven)
        O = paint(O, shift(asobject(seven), (1, 1)))
        O = fill(O, secondary_color,  {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 4), (8, 5)})
    elif digit == 1:
        one_stroke = asobject(canvas(main_color, (1, 6)))
        one_body = vconcat(canvas((0,), (10, 6)), one_stroke)
        one_flag = asobject(canvas(main_color, (2, 2)))
        O = paint(O, one_body)
        O = paint(O, shift(one_flag, (2, 7)))
        O = paint(O, shift(one_flag, (3, 7)))
        O = fill(O, secondary_color, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(8, 10)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Digit 7 and 1:** This version creates basic building blocks for each part of the digits and then uses `shift` and `paint` to position them correctly on the canvas. The `fill` function then adds the secondary color to specific areas.

### Program Version 4: (Mirroring approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    digit = I[0][0]
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    main_color = 4
    secondary_color = 1 if digit == 7 else 2
  
    if digit == 7:
        diag = asobject(canvas(main_color, (4, 1)))
        seven = vconcat(hconcat(diag, hmirror(diag)), canvas((0,), (6, 8)))
        seven = vconcat(seven, hconcat(diag, hmirror(diag)))
        O = paint(O, shift(asobject(seven), (1, 1)))
        O = fill(O, secondary_color, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 4) for j in range(2, 4)} | {(i, j) for i in range(7, 9) for j in range(4, 6)})
    elif digit == 1:
        one_stroke = asobject(canvas(main_color, (6, 1)))
        one_body = hconcat(canvas((0,), (6, 6)), one_stroke)
        one_flag = asobject(canvas(main_color, (2, 2)))
        O = paint(O, one_body)
        O = paint(O, shift(one_flag, (2, 7)))
        O = paint(O, shift(one_flag, (3, 7)))
        O = fill(O, secondary_color, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(8, 10)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Digit 7:** This version leverages the `hmirror` function to create symmetrical parts of the '7'. It constructs the diagonal line and then mirrors it to form the full outline.
* **Digit 1:** This version first creates the vertical body and then paints the horizontal flag twice to create the 3D effect. It then fills in the specified region with the secondary color.

### Program Version 5: (Combination Approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    digit = I[0][0]
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    main_color = 4
    secondary_color = 1 if digit == 7 else 2
  
    if digit == 7:
        stroke = asobject(canvas(main_color, (4, 1)))
        seven_top = hconcat(stroke, hmirror(stroke))
        seven = vconcat(seven_top, canvas((0,), (2, 8)), seven_top)
        O = paint(O, shift(asobject(seven), (1, 1)))
        O = fill(O, secondary_color,  {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 4), (8, 5)})
    elif digit == 1:
        one_line = asobject(canvas(main_color, (6, 1)))
        one_body = hconcat(canvas((0,), (6, 6)), one_line)
        flag = asobject(canvas(main_color, (2, 2)))
        O = paint(O, one_body)
        O = paint(O, shift(flag, (2, 7)))
        O = paint(O, shift(flag, (3, 7)))
        O = fill(O, secondary_color,  {(4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 8), (5, 9)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Digit 7:** This version combines building blocks and mirroring techniques. It builds the top part of the '7' and then mirrors it to create the bottom part, optimizing the code.
* **Digit 1:** This version constructs the vertical body of the '1' using `hconcat` and then paints two squares to create the flag, adding depth to the output. The `fill` function is used to color the specified region.


These five versions showcase distinct approaches to solving the transformation task. Each leverages different DSL functions and strategies, highlighting the flexibility and power of the provided DSL.
