## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves creating two shapes on a canvas based on the input value (7 or any other value). 

* **Shape 1:** A square with an inner cross. The color of the cross depends on the input. If the input is 7, the cross is filled with '1', otherwise with '2'. 
* **Shape 2:** A rectangle with a horizontal line. Similar to shape 1, the line's color depends on the input. It's '2' if the input is 7, else '1'.

The positioning of these shapes also depends on the input:

* **Input 7:** Shape 1 is positioned at the top of the canvas, and Shape 2 is placed below it, slightly overlapping.
* **Other Input:** Shape 1 is positioned towards the bottom right, and Shape 2 is placed above it, slightly overlapping.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, each with a different approach:

**Version 1 (Inspired by manipulating shapes directly):**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  fill_1 = 1 if I == 7 else 2
  fill_2 = 2 if I == 7 else 1
  shape_1 = frozenset({
    (4, (0, 0)), (4, (0, 1)), (4, (0, 2)), (4, (0, 3)), (4, (0, 4)),
    (4, (4, 0)), (4, (4, 1)), (4, (4, 2)), (4, (4, 3)), (4, (4, 4)),
    (4, (1, 0)), (4, (2, 0)), (4, (3, 0)), 
    (4, (1, 4)), (4, (2, 4)), (4, (3, 4)),
    (fill_1, (1, 1)), (fill_1, (1, 2)), (fill_1, (1, 3)), 
    (fill_1, (2, 1)), (fill_1, (2, 2)), (fill_1, (2, 3)), 
    (fill_1, (3, 1)), (fill_1, (3, 2)), (fill_1, (3, 3))
  })
  shape_2 = frozenset({
    (4, (0, 0)), (4, (0, 1)), (4, (0, 2)), (4, (0, 3)),
    (4, (1, 0)), (4, (2, 0)), (4, (3, 0)),
    (fill_2, (1, 1)), (fill_2, (1, 2)), (fill_2, (2, 1)), (fill_2, (2, 2))
  })
  if I == 7:
    O = paint(O, shift(shape_1, (1, 1)))
    O = paint(O, shift(shape_2, (6, 4)))
  else:
    O = paint(O, shift(shape_1, (6, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(shape_2, (1, 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version directly defines the shapes as frozen sets of (value, (i, j)) tuples.
* It then uses conditional logic to determine the fill color of the inner parts of the shapes based on the input 'I'.
* Finally, it paints the shapes onto the canvas at specific positions based on the input.


**Version 2 (Inspired by building shapes with functions):**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  fill_1 = 1 if I == 7 else 2
  fill_2 = 2 if I == 7 else 1
  square_1 = frozenset(product(interval(0, 5, 1), interval(0, 5, 1)))
  cross_1 = frozenset(product(interval(1, 4, 1), interval(1, 4, 1))) - frozenset({(2, 2)})
  shape_1 = recolor(4, square_1) | recolor(fill_1, cross_1)
  rect_2 = frozenset(product(interval(0, 4, 1), interval(0, 4, 1)))
  line_2 = frozenset(product(interval(1, 3, 1), interval(1, 3, 1)))
  shape_2 = recolor(4, rect_2) | recolor(fill_2, line_2)
  if I == 7:
    O = paint(O, shift(shape_1, (1, 1)))
    O = paint(O, shift(shape_2, (6, 4)))
  else:
    O = paint(O, shift(shape_1, (6, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(shape_2, (1, 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version builds the shapes using a combination of `product`, `recolor`, and set operations.
* It first generates the basic outline of each shape (square, cross, rectangle, line) using indices.
* Then, it recolors those indices with the appropriate colors based on the input.
* Finally, it paints the assembled shapes onto the canvas at specific positions.


**Version 3 (Inspired by splitting and combining grids):** 

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  fill_1 = 1 if I == 7 else 2
  fill_2 = 2 if I == 7 else 1
  shape_1 = vconcat((
    (4, 4, 4, 4, 4), 
    (4, fill_1, fill_1, fill_1, 4),
    (4, fill_1, fill_1, fill_1, 4),
    (4, fill_1, fill_1, fill_1, 4),
    (4, 4, 4, 4, 4)
  ))
  shape_2 = vconcat((
    (4, 4, 4, 4),
    (4, fill_2, fill_2, 4),
    (4, fill_2, fill_2, 4),
    (4, 4, 4, 4)
  ))
  if I == 7:
    O = paint(O, shift(asobject(shape_1), (1, 1)))
    O = paint(O, shift(asobject(shape_2), (6, 4)))
  else:
    O = paint(O, shift(asobject(shape_1), (6, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(asobject(shape_2), (1, 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version constructs the shapes by concatenating rows using `vconcat`.
* Each row is defined as a tuple, simplifying the shape definition.
* This approach offers good readability for simple shapes.
* The final shapes are then painted onto the canvas at the determined positions.


**Version 4 (Inspired by filling predefined areas):** 

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  fill_1 = 1 if I == 7 else 2
  fill_2 = 2 if I == 7 else 1
  if I == 7:
    O = fill(O, 4, frozenset(product(interval(1, 6, 1), interval(1, 6, 1))))
    O = fill(O, fill_1, frozenset(product(interval(2, 5, 1), interval(2, 5, 1))))
    O = fill(O, 4, frozenset(product(interval(6, 10, 1), interval(4, 8, 1))))
    O = fill(O, fill_2, frozenset(product(interval(7, 9, 1), interval(5, 7, 1))))
  else:
    O = fill(O, 4, frozenset(product(interval(6, 11, 1), interval(4, 9, 1))))
    O = fill(O, fill_1, frozenset(product(interval(7, 10, 1), interval(5, 8, 1))))
    O = fill(O, 4, frozenset(product(interval(1, 5, 1), interval(1, 5, 1))))
    O = fill(O, fill_2, frozenset(product(interval(2, 4, 1), interval(2, 4, 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version defines areas to be filled using `product` and `interval` to create sets of indices.
* It fills those areas with the appropriate color based on the input.
* This approach avoids explicit shape creation and focuses on directly manipulating the canvas.


**Version 5 (Inspired by shifting and painting smaller parts):** 

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  fill_1 = 1 if I == 7 else 2
  fill_2 = 2 if I == 7 else 1
  square = asobject(canvas(4, (5, 5)))
  cross = asobject(canvas(fill_1, (3, 3))) - {(fill_1, (1, 1))}
  rect = asobject(canvas(4, (4, 4)))
  line = asobject(canvas(fill_2, (2, 2)))
  if I == 7:
    O = paint(O, shift(square, (1, 1)))
    O = paint(O, shift(cross, (2, 2)))
    O = paint(O, shift(rect, (6, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (7, 5)))
  else:
    O = paint(O, shift(square, (6, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(cross, (7, 5)))
    O = paint(O, shift(rect, (1, 1)))
    O = paint(O, shift(line, (2, 2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version defines smaller building blocks for the shapes and then shifts and paints them onto the canvas.
* It utilizes `asobject` and `canvas` to generate basic shapes.
* This approach provides flexibility and can be efficient for creating complex shapes from simpler components.

These five versions demonstrate different strategies for achieving the same visual transformation. Each version utilizes the provided DSL functions differently, offering diverse solutions with varying levels of readability and complexity.
