## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single digit (1 or 7) as input and generates a 10x10 grid representing a stylized version of the digit. The digit is drawn using two colors (main_color and a secondary color) on a background color. 

* **Input 7:**  The output is a stylized "7" leaning to the right. The main body of the "7" uses the main_color. The short segment at the top left of the "7" uses the secondary color.
* **Input 1:** The output is a stylized "1" with a flag-like top. The main body of the "1" uses the main_color. The rectangular section at the top right of the "1" uses the secondary color.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:** (Building blocks approach)

```python
def ecdgehaecdgceifbbbeccdbhcgfihaaf(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  canvas_size = (10, 10)
  background_color = 0
  main_color = 4
  secondary_color = 1 if digit == 7 else 2 
  canvas_ = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)
  
  if digit == 7:
    # Construct the "7"
    seven_base = vconcat(
        canvas((main_color), (1, 6)), 
        canvas((background_color), (1, 4))
    )
    seven_base = vconcat(seven_base, canvas((main_color), (3, 10)))
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, asobject(shift(seven_base, (1, 1))))
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, recolor(secondary_color, asobject(shift(crop(seven_base, (2, 2), (2, 4)), (2, 2))))) 
  elif digit == 1:
    # Construct the "1"
    one_base = vconcat(
        canvas((background_color), (4, 1)),
        canvas((main_color), (6, 1))
    )
    one_base = hconcat(one_base, canvas((main_color), (10, 4)))
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, asobject(shift(one_base, (2, 6))))
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, recolor(secondary_color, asobject(shift(crop(one_base, (3, 7), (3, 3)), (3, 7))))) 
  return canvas_
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Sets up digit, canvas size, and colors.
2. **Digit-specific Construction:** Based on the input digit, it builds the basic shape using `canvas`, `vconcat`, and `hconcat`.
3. **Painting:**  Paints the constructed shape onto the canvas using `paint` and `asobject`.
4. **Secondary Color:**  Adds the secondary color segment using `recolor`, `crop`, and `shift`.

**Program Version 2:** (Mirroring and Combining)

```python
def ecdgehaecdgceifbbbeccdbhcgfihaaf(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  canvas_size = (10, 10)
  background_color = 0
  main_color = 4
  secondary_color = 1 if digit == 7 else 2
  canvas_ = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)
  
  if digit == 7:
    # Construct the "7" using mirroring
    seven_segment = canvas(main_color, (4, 3))
    seven_base = hconcat(seven_segment, hmirror(seven_segment))
    seven_base = vconcat(canvas((main_color), (1, 6)), canvas((background_color), (1, 4)))
    seven_base = vconcat(seven_base, seven_base)
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, asobject(shift(seven_base, (1, 1))))
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, recolor(secondary_color, asobject(shift(crop(seven_base, (2, 2), (2, 4)), (2, 2))))) 
  elif digit == 1:
    # Construct the "1" using combining
    one_base = vconcat(
        canvas((background_color), (4, 1)),
        canvas((main_color), (6, 1))
    )
    one_flag = canvas(main_color, (3, 3))
    one_base = hconcat(one_base,  hconcat(one_flag, one_flag))
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, asobject(shift(one_base, (2, 6))))
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, recolor(secondary_color, asobject(shift(crop(one_base, (3, 7), (3, 3)), (3, 7))))) 
  return canvas_
```

**Explanation:**

* **"7" Construction:**  Constructs the main body of the "7" by creating a segment and mirroring it horizontally using `hmirror`.
* **"1" Construction:**  Builds the "1" by combining multiple smaller canvases together.

**Program Version 3:** (Offset and Fill)

```python
def ecdgehaecdgceifbbbeccdbhcgfihaaf(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  canvas_size = (10, 10)
  background_color = 0
  main_color = 4
  secondary_color = 1 if digit == 7 else 2
  canvas_ = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)
  
  if digit == 7:
    # "7" with offset and fill 
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, main_color, {(i, j) for i in range(1, 5) for j in range(1, 7) if i + j <= 7})
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, main_color, {(2, j) for j in range(2, 10)})
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, main_color, {(3, j) for j in range(3, 10)})
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, secondary_color, {(2, j) for j in range(3, 6)})
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, secondary_color, {(3, j) for j in range(4, 6)})
  elif digit == 1:
    # "1" with offset and fill
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, main_color, {(i, 6) for i in range(2, 8)}) 
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, main_color, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 6) for j in range(7, 10)})
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, secondary_color, {(i, j) for i in range(4, 6) for j in range(8, 10)})
  return canvas_
```

**Explanation:**

* **Direct Filling:** This version directly fills the canvas with the desired colors at specific locations calculated using set comprehensions.

**Program Version 4:** (Object Manipulation and Overlaying)

```python
def ecdgehaecdgceifbbbeccdbhcgfihaaf(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  canvas_size = (10, 10)
  background_color = 0
  main_color = 4
  secondary_color = 1 if digit == 7 else 2
  canvas_ = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)

  if digit == 7:
    # "7" with object manipulation
    base_segment = asobject(canvas(main_color, (1, 4)))
    seven_base = base_segment
    for i in range(1, 4):
      seven_base = seven_base.union(shift(base_segment, (i, i)))
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, shift(seven_base, (1, 1)))
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, recolor(secondary_color, asobject(shift(crop(canvas(main_color, (2, 4)), (0, 1), (2, 3)), (2, 3)))))
  elif digit == 1:
    # "1" with overlaying
    one_body = asobject(shift(canvas(main_color, (6, 1)), (2, 6)))
    one_flag = asobject(shift(canvas(main_color, (3, 3)), (3, 7)))
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, one_body)
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, one_flag)
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, recolor(secondary_color, asobject(shift(crop(canvas(main_color, (2, 3)), (0, 0), (2, 2)), (4, 8)))))
  return canvas_
```

**Explanation:**

* **Object-Oriented Approach:** Focuses on creating and manipulating objects representing parts of the digits and then painting them onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5:** (Line Drawing and Filling)

```python
def ecdgehaecdgceifbbbeccdbhcgfihaaf(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  canvas_size = (10, 10)
  background_color = 0
  main_color = 4
  secondary_color = 1 if digit == 7 else 2
  canvas_ = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)
  
  if digit == 7:
    # "7" with line drawing
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, main_color, connect((1, 1), (4, 4))) # Diagonal line
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, main_color, connect((1, 1), (1, 6))) # Vertical line
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, main_color, {(2, j) for j in range(2, 10)}) # Horizontal lines
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, main_color, {(3, j) for j in range(3, 10)})
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, secondary_color, {(2, j) for j in range(3, 6)})
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, secondary_color, {(3, j) for j in range(4, 6)})
  elif digit == 1:
    # "1" with line drawing
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, main_color, connect((2, 6), (7, 6))) # Vertical line
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, main_color, connect((3, 7), (5, 9))) # Diagonal line
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, main_color, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 6) for j in range(7, 10)}) # Fill the rest
    canvas_ = fill(canvas_, secondary_color, {(i, j) for i in range(4, 6) for j in range(8, 10)})
  return canvas_
```

**Explanation:**

* **Line-Based Construction:** Uses `connect` to draw lines forming the basic structure of the digits and then fills in the remaining areas. 

These five versions offer diverse approaches to solving the transformation task, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL. Each version utilizes a different combination of functions and logic, achieving the same visual output through distinct methods.
