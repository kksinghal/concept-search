## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be based on the value of the single cell in the input grid. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Large Rectangle:** A large rectangle (6x5) filled with '4' is drawn on the canvas.
2. **Small Rectangle:** A smaller rectangle (2x3) filled with '1' is drawn on top of the large rectangle, slightly offset. 
3. **Bottom Rectangle:** Another large rectangle (6x4) filled with '4' is drawn at the bottom of the canvas.
4. **Smallest Rectangle:**  A tiny rectangle (2x2) filled with '2' is drawn on top of the bottom rectangle, centered horizontally. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. **Large Rectangle:**  A large rectangle (6x6) filled with '4' is drawn on the canvas.
2. **Small Rectangle:** A smaller rectangle (4x2) filled with '2' is drawn on top of the large rectangle, centered horizontally. 
3. **Right Rectangle:** Another rectangle (4x4) filled with '4' is drawn on the right side of the canvas, vertically centered.
4. **Smallest Rectangle:** A tiny rectangle (2x2) filled with '1' is drawn on top of the right rectangle, centered vertically.


## Program Versions:

**Program_to_be_generated: Version 1**

```python
def bgchcjfgcffdefcjajahgcdfdafaaffe(I):
  d = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7  # Check if input is 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))     # Create a 10x10 canvas filled with 0s
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, shift(canvas(1, (6, 5 + d)), (1 + 2 * d, 1))))  # Large rectangle
  O = paint(O, recolor(1 + d, shift(canvas(1, (2 + 2 * d, 3 - d)), (4 - d, 2 + 3 * d)))) # Small rectangle
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, shift(canvas(1, (6 - d, 4)), (6 - 3 * d, d * 5)))) # Bottom/Right rectangle
  O = paint(O, recolor(2 - d, shift(canvas(1, (2, 2)), (7 - 3 * d, 1 + 5 * d)))) # Smallest rectangle 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested `canvas`, `recolor`, and `shift` functions to draw the rectangles. The `d` variable acts as a boolean flag based on the input value, controlling the size and position of the rectangles.

**Program_to_be_generated: Version 2**

```python
def bgchcjfgcffdefcjajahgcdfdafaaffe(I):
  d = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, frozenset((i, j) for i in range(1 + 2 * d, 7 + d) for j in range(1, 6 + d)))) # Large rectangle
  O = paint(O, recolor(1 + d, frozenset((i, j) for i in range(4 - d, 6 + d) for j in range(2 + 3 * d, 5 + 2 * d)))) # Small rectangle
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, frozenset((i, j) for i in range(6 - 3 * d, 10 - 3 * d) for j in range(d * 5, 4 + d * 5)))) # Bottom/Right rectangle
  O = paint(O, recolor(2 - d, frozenset((i, j) for i in range(7 - 3 * d, 9 - 3 * d) for j in range(1 + 5 * d, 3 + 5 * d)))) # Smallest rectangle
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses directly defined index sets for each rectangle. This approach eliminates the need for nested `canvas` calls, making the code more concise. 

**Program_to_be_generated: Version 3**

```python
def bgchcjfgcffdefcjajahgcdfdafaaffe(I):
  d = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  large_rect =  frozenset((i, j) for i in range(1 + 2 * d, 7 + d) for j in range(1, 6 + d))
  small_rect = shift(frozenset((i, j) for i in range(2 + 2 * d) for j in range(3 - d)), (3 - d, 2 + 3 * d))
  bottom_right_rect = shift(frozenset((i, j) for i in range(4) for j in range(6 - d)), (6 - 3 * d, d * 5))
  smallest_rect = shift(frozenset((i, j) for i in range(2) for j in range(2)), (7 - 3 * d, 1 + 5 * d))
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, large_rect))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1 + d, small_rect))
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, bottom_right_rect))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2 - d, smallest_rect))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines the index sets for the rectangles separately and then uses them within the `paint` and `recolor` functions. This enhances readability and modularity.

**Program_to_be_generated: Version 4**

```python
def bgchcjfgcffdefcjajahgcdfdafaaffe(I):
  d = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(4,  frozenset((i, j) for i in range(1 + 2 * d, 7 + d) for j in range(1, 6 + d))))
  if d:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(1, (2, 3)), (3, 5))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(4, shift(canvas(1, (6, 4)), (6, 0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(canvas(1, (2, 2)), (7, 6))))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(canvas(1, (4, 2)), (4, 5))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(4, shift(canvas(1, (4, 4)), (3, 5))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(canvas(1, (2, 2)), (4, 6))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses conditional branching based on the value of `d`. It simplifies the logic by handling the different rectangle sizes and positions separately.

**Program_to_be_generated: Version 5**

```python
def bgchcjfgcffdefcjajahgcdfdafaaffe(I):
  d = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, shift(canvas(1, (6, 5 + d)), (1 + 2 * d, 1)))) # Large rectangle
  for i in range(2):
    for j in range(3 - d):
      O = paint(O, recolor(1 + d, frozenset({(4 - d + i, 2 + 3 * d + j)}))) # Small rectangle
  for i in range(4):
    for j in range(6 - d):
      O = paint(O, recolor(4, frozenset({(6 - 3 * d + i, d * 5 + j)}))) # Bottom/Right rectangle
  for i in range(2):
    for j in range(2):
      O = paint(O, recolor(2 - d, frozenset({(7 - 3 * d + i, 1 + 5 * d + j)}))) # Smallest rectangle
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes loops to draw the smaller rectangles by iterating through their cells and painting them individually. This approach emphasizes a more granular control over the painting process. 


These five versions offer a range of approaches to achieve the desired transformation, each with its own strengths and weaknesses in terms of readability, conciseness, and computational efficiency.
