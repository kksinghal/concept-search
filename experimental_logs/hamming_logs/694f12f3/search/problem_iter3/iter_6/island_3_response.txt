## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves rendering stylized digits "7" and "1" on a 10x10 canvas.  The digits are positioned in the top and bottom half of the canvas respectively. The style involves a main color (4) for the outline and a secondary color (1 for '7', 2 for '1') for inner fill.

**Input 0 (7) -> Output 0:**

1. **Outline:** A stylized '7' is drawn using color 4. 
2. **Inner Fill:**  The horizontal stroke of '7' is filled with color 1.
3. **Positioning:** The '7' is positioned in the top half of the canvas with a slight left offset.

**Input 1 (1) -> Output 1:**

1. **Outline:** A stylized '1' is drawn using color 4. This involves a vertical stroke and two smaller square "flags" to the right.
2. **Inner Fill:** The bottom flag of the '1' is filled with color 2.
3. **Positioning:** The '1' is positioned in the bottom half of the canvas with a slight right offset.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing the transformation:

### Program Version 1: (Direct Drawing)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  main_color = 4
  secondary_color = 1 if digit == 7 else 2

  if digit == 7:
    O = fill(O, main_color, {(i, j) for i in range(1, 5) for j in range(1, 5) if i + j <= 6})
    O = fill(O, main_color, {(2, j) for j in range(1, 5)})
    O = fill(O, main_color, {(3, j) for j in range(1, 5)})
    O = fill(O, main_color, {(i, j) for i in range(6, 10) for j in range(3, 7)})
    O = fill(O, secondary_color, {(2, j) for j in range(2, 4)})
    O = fill(O, secondary_color, {(3, j) for j in range(2, 4)})
  elif digit == 1:
    O = fill(O, main_color, {(i, 6) for i in range(1, 7)})
    O = fill(O, main_color, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 5) for j in range(7, 10)})
    O = fill(O, secondary_color, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(8, 10)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version directly draws the shapes of the digits by filling in the appropriate cells on the canvas using `fill`. 
- It iterates through the rows and columns, selectively filling cells based on the digit and its desired shape.

### Program Version 2: (Shape Combination)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  main_color = 4
  secondary_color = 1 if digit == 7 else 2
  
  if digit == 7:
    stroke = asobject(canvas(main_color, (4, 1)))
    seven = hconcat(stroke, hmirror(stroke))
    seven = vconcat(seven, canvas((0,), (2, 8)))
    seven = vconcat(seven, seven)
    O = paint(O, shift(asobject(seven), (1, 1)))
    O = fill(O, secondary_color,  {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 4), (8, 5)})
  elif digit == 1:
    one_body = asobject(shift(canvas(main_color, (6, 1)), (1, 6)))
    one_flag = asobject(canvas(main_color, (3, 3)))
    O = paint(O, one_body)
    O = paint(O, shift(one_flag, (2, 6)))
    O = paint(O, shift(one_flag, (3, 6)))
    O = fill(O, secondary_color, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(8, 10)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version constructs the digits by combining basic shapes like horizontal and vertical strokes using functions like `hconcat` and `vconcat`.
- It then positions and paints these combined shapes onto the canvas.

### Program Version 3: (Line Drawing)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  main_color = 4
  secondary_color = 1 if digit == 7 else 2
  
  if digit == 7:
    O = paint(O, recolor(main_color, connect((1, 1), (1, 4))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(main_color, connect((1, 1), (4, 4))))
    O = fill(O, main_color, {(i, j) for i in range(6, 10) for j in range(3, 7)})
    O = fill(O, secondary_color, {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 4), (8, 5)})
  elif digit == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(main_color, connect((1, 6), (7, 6))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(main_color, connect((2, 7), (4, 9))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(main_color, connect((3, 7), (5, 9))))
    O = fill(O, secondary_color, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(8, 10)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version utilizes the `connect` function to draw lines representing the digit outlines. 
- It then fills in the remaining parts of the shapes and applies secondary colors.

### Program Version 4: (Mirroring)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  main_color = 4
  secondary_color = 1 if digit == 7 else 2
  
  if digit == 7:
    seven_half = asobject(canvas(main_color, (2, 4)))
    seven = hconcat(seven_half, hmirror(seven_half))
    seven = vconcat(seven, canvas((0,), (2, 8)))
    seven = vconcat(seven, seven)
    O = paint(O, shift(asobject(seven), (1, 1)))
    O = fill(O, secondary_color,  {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 4), (8, 5)})
  elif digit == 1:
    one_stroke = asobject(canvas(main_color, (6, 1)))
    one_body = hconcat(canvas((0,), (6, 6)), one_stroke)
    one_flag = asobject(canvas(main_color, (2, 2)))
    O = paint(O, one_body)
    O = paint(O, shift(one_flag, (2, 7)))
    O = paint(O, shift(one_flag, (3, 7)))
    O = fill(O, secondary_color, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(8, 10)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version leverages symmetry to simplify drawing. 
- It constructs half of the digit, then uses `hmirror` to create a mirrored copy and combines them.

### Program Version 5: (Patch Manipulation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  main_color = 4
  secondary_color = 1 if digit == 7 else 2
  
  if digit == 7:
    base_patch =  {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1)}
    seven = recolor(main_color, base_patch)
    seven = combine(seven, shift(seven, (5, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(seven, (1, 1)))
    O = fill(O, secondary_color, {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 4), (8, 5)})
  elif digit == 1:
    base_patch = {(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0)}
    one_body = recolor(main_color, base_patch)
    one_body = combine(one_body, shift(one_body, (0, 6)))
    one_flag = recolor(main_color, {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)})
    O = paint(O, one_body)
    O = paint(O, shift(one_flag, (2, 7)))
    O = paint(O, shift(one_flag, (3, 7)))
    O = fill(O, secondary_color, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(8, 10)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version defines the shapes as patches of indices and then manipulates and recolors them using functions like `recolor`, `combine`, and `shift`. 
- It offers a more abstract way of constructing the digits.

These five program versions demonstrate various approaches to achieve the same output, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version uses a distinct combination of DSL functions, demonstrating diverse logic and code structures, thereby ensuring significant differences between the versions.
