## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single digit and embeds it into a larger 10x10 grid. The transformation depends on the value of the input digit:

**Input_0 (digit 7):**

1. **Two rectangles:**  A 5x5 rectangle (color 4) is placed at the top-left, and another at the bottom-right.
2. **Inner Square:** A 3x3 square (color 2) is centered within the bottom-right rectangle.
3. **Central Cells:** The center cell of the top rectangle and the inner square are replaced with the input digit (7).

**Input_1 (digit 7):**

This follows the same pattern as Input_0, but the inner square with the digit is placed in the top-right rectangle.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL, each with an explanation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Create the rectangles
  rect = recolor(4, product(interval(1,6,1), interval(1,6,1)))
  top_rect = rect
  bottom_rect = shift(rect, (5, 0))

  # Create the inner square
  inner_square = recolor(2, product(interval(1,4,1), interval(1,4,1)))

  # Position the inner square based on input
  inner_pos = (0, 5) if I == 7 else (5, 5) 
  inner_square = shift(inner_square, inner_pos)

  # Place the digit in the correct position
  digit_pos = (2, 3) if I == 7 else (7, 3)
  digit_cell = recolor(I, {digit_pos})

  # Combine and paint
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10,10)), top_rect | bottom_rect | inner_square | digit_cell)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rectangles:** Creates two 5x5 rectangles (color 4) and positions them at the top-left and bottom-right.
* **Inner Square:** Creates a 3x3 square (color 2) and conditionally shifts it based on the input digit (7: bottom-right, other: top-right).
* **Digit Placement:** Calculates the correct position for the input digit within the chosen rectangle and places it there.
* **Combine and Paint:** Merges all elements onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Create the base rectangle and inner square
  rect = recolor(4, product(interval(1,6,1), interval(1,6,1)))
  inner = recolor(2, product(interval(2,5,1), interval(2,5,1)))

  # Determine top/bottom based on input
  top = I == 7
  offset = (5, 0) if top else (0, 0)

  # Create the objects
  top_rect = shift(rect, offset)
  bottom_rect = shift(rect, (5, 0) if not top else (0, 0))
  inner_square = shift(inner, offset) 
  digit_cell = recolor(I, (3 if top else 8, 3))

  # Paint on canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10,10)), top_rect | bottom_rect | inner_square | digit_cell)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Base Shapes:** Defines a base rectangle and inner square.
* **Conditional Positioning:** Uses the input digit to determine whether the inner square should be at the top or bottom, adjusting offsets accordingly.
* **Object Creation:** Creates and positions the top/bottom rectangles, inner square, and digit cell based on calculated offsets.
* **Painting:** Paints the elements onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Define base shapes
  rect = product(interval(1,6,1), interval(1,6,1))
  inner = product(interval(2,5,1), interval(2,5,1))

  # Choose target rectangle based on input
  target_rect = rect if I == 7 else shift(rect, (5, 0))

  # Color and position elements
  top_rect = recolor(4, rect)
  bottom_rect = recolor(4, shift(rect, (5, 0)))
  inner_square = recolor(2, shift(inner, ulcorner(target_rect)))
  digit_cell = recolor(I, (center(target_rect)[0], 3))

  # Combine and paint
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10,10)), top_rect | bottom_rect | inner_square | digit_cell)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Base Shapes:** Defines base rectangle and inner square shapes as indices.
* **Target Selection:**  Selects the target rectangle based on the input digit.
* **Color and Position:** Colors and positions elements relative to the chosen target rectangle, simplifying placement logic.
* **Painting:** Paints the final objects onto the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Base shapes and positions
  base = recolor(4, product(interval(1,6,1), interval(1,6,1)))
  inner_offset = (0, 5) if I == 7 else (5, 5) 

  # Construct objects
  top_rect = base
  bottom_rect = shift(base, (5, 0))
  inner_square = recolor(2, shift(product(interval(1,4,1), interval(1,4,1)), inner_offset))
  digit_cell = recolor(I, (inner_offset[0] + 2, 3)) 

  # Paint the objects on the canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), top_rect | bottom_rect | inner_square | digit_cell)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Base Shapes and Positions:** Defines base shapes and calculates the offset for the inner square based on the input digit.
* **Object Construction:** Creates the objects using the pre-calculated offset, simplifying positioning logic.
* **Canvas Painting:** Combines and paints the objects onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Define base rectangle and target area
  rect = product(interval(1,6,1), interval(1,6,1))
  target_area = crop(canvas(0, (10, 10)), (0, 5) if I == 7 else (5, 0), (5, 5))

  # Create and position elements
  top_rect = recolor(4, rect)
  bottom_rect = recolor(4, shift(rect, (5, 0)))
  inner_square = recolor(2, shift(product(interval(2,5,1), interval(2,5,1)), ulcorner(target_area)))
  digit_cell = recolor(I, center(asindices(target_area)))

  # Paint on canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10,10)), top_rect | bottom_rect | inner_square | digit_cell)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Base Shapes and Target Area:** Defines the base rectangle and identifies the target area (top-right or bottom-right) based on the input digit.
* **Element Creation and Positioning:** Creates the elements and positions them relative to the pre-defined target area.
* **Canvas Painting:** Combines and paints the elements onto the canvas.

These five program versions showcase diverse approaches to achieving the same transformation, utilizing different combinations of DSL functions and logic. Each version is significantly distinct from the others, offering a range of solutions to the problem.
