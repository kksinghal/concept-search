## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking a single-cell input grid containing the digit '7' and generating a 10x10 output grid with specific patterns based on the input digit. The patterns consist of two rectangles:

* **Large Rectangle:** This rectangle has a fixed size of 6x5 and is always filled with the digit '4'. 
* **Small Rectangle:** This rectangle's size and fill color depend on the input digit:
    * If the input is '7', the size is 4x2 and the fill color is '2'.
    * If the input is not '7', the size is 2x3 and the fill color is '1'.

The rectangles are positioned within the output grid based on the input digit:

* **Input '7':** 
    * Large Rectangle: Shifted down by 3 rows and right by 5 columns.
    * Small Rectangle: Shifted down by 6 rows.
* **Input other than '7':**
    * Large Rectangle: Shifted down by 1 row and right by 2 columns.
    * Small Rectangle: Shifted down by 4 rows and right by 3 columns.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  d = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (6, 5))), (1 + 2 * d, 2 + 3 * d))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2 * d + 1, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (4 * d + 2, 3 - d))), (4 - d, 6 * d + 2))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Detect Input:** `d = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7` checks if the input digit is '7'. `d` becomes True (1) if it is, and False (0) otherwise.
2. **Create Canvas:** `O = canvas(0, (10, 10))` generates a 10x10 grid filled with '0's.
3. **Large Rectangle:** 
   - `canvas(1, (6, 5))` creates a 6x5 rectangle filled with '1's.
   - `asobject(...)` converts it to an object representation.
   - `shift(..., (1 + 2 * d, 2 + 3 * d))` positions the rectangle based on `d`:
     - If `d` is True (input is '7'), it shifts down by 3 rows and right by 5 columns.
     - If `d` is False, it shifts down by 1 row and right by 2 columns.
   - `recolor(4, ...)` changes the fill color to '4'.
   - `paint(O, ...)` draws the rectangle onto the canvas.
4. **Small Rectangle:**
   - `canvas(1, (4 * d + 2, 3 - d))` creates the rectangle with dynamic size: 4x2 if `d` is True, 2x3 otherwise.
   - The remaining steps are analogous to the Large Rectangle, but with different positioning and fill color based on `d`.
5. **Return Output:** The final canvas `O` is returned as the output.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  is_seven = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  large_rect = asobject(canvas(1, (6, 5)))
  small_rect = asobject(canvas(1, (4, 2))) if is_seven else asobject(canvas(1, (2, 3)))
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, shift(large_rect, branch(is_seven, (3, 5), (1, 2)))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(branch(is_seven, 2, 1), shift(small_rect, branch(is_seven, (6, 0), (4, 3)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on code readability by using more descriptive variable names and employing the `branch` function for conditional logic. The logic remains similar to Version 1, but it's presented in a more structured and easier-to-understand manner.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  d = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  lr_pos = (1 + 2*d, 2 + 3*d)
  sr_pos = (4 - d, 6*d + 2)
  lr_dims = (6, 5)
  sr_dims = (4, 2) if d else (2, 3)
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, shift(asobject(canvas(1, lr_dims)), lr_pos)))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2*d + 1, shift(asobject(canvas(1, sr_dims)), sr_pos)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version improves code structure by pre-calculating the positions and dimensions of both rectangles based on the input digit. This separation enhances clarity and makes it easier to modify the program for different rectangle configurations.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def draw_rect(O, color, dims, offset):
  return paint(O, recolor(color, shift(asobject(canvas(1, dims)), offset)))

def program_v4(I):
  d = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = draw_rect(O, 4, (6, 5), (1 + 2*d, 2 + 3*d))
  O = draw_rect(O, 2*d + 1, (4, 2) if d else (2, 3), (4 - d, 6*d + 2))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version introduces a helper function `draw_rect` to encapsulate the logic of drawing a rectangle with a specified color, dimensions, and offset. This promotes code reuse and makes the main program more concise and readable.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  is_seven = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (6, 5))), (3 - 2 * (not is_seven), 5 - 3 * (not is_seven)))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2 if is_seven else 1, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (4 if is_seven else 2, 2 if is_seven else 3))), (6 - 2 * is_seven, 2 + 4 * is_seven))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version rewrites the logic for calculating offsets and dimensions within the function calls, directly utilizing the boolean value of `is_seven` and its negation. While potentially less readable, it demonstrates a different approach and emphasizes the flexibility of the DSL.
