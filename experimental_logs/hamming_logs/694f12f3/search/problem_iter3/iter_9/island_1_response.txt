## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single digit as input and produces a 10x10 grid as output. The output grid consistently features two distinct shapes:

* **Shape 1:**  A horizontal line of 4s with a center filled with either 1s (if input is 7) or 2s (if input is any other digit). 
* **Shape 2:** A vertical line of 4s with a center filled with either 1s (if input is 7) or 2s (if input is any other digit).

The position and orientation of these shapes depend on the input digit:

* **Input 7:** Shape 1 is placed at the top of the grid, and Shape 2 is placed at the bottom. 
* **Other Inputs:** Shape 1 is placed at the bottom of the grid, and Shape 2 is placed at the top.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0]) if str(I)[0].isdigit() else 0 
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  fill_value = 2 if digit == 7 else 1
  h_shape = fill(canvas(4, (1, 9)), fill_value, asindices(crop(canvas(4, (1, 9)), (0, 3), (1, 3))))
  v_shape = fill(canvas(4, (9, 1)), fill_value, asindices(crop(canvas(4, (9, 1)), (3, 0), (3, 1))))
  if digit == 7:
    O = vconcat(h_shape, O)
    O = vconcat(O, v_shape)
  else:
    O = vconcat(v_shape, O)
    O = vconcat(O, h_shape)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create a blank canvas `O` of size 10x10 filled with 0s and determine the `fill_value` (1 or 2) based on the input digit.
2. **Shape Creation:**
   - Create `h_shape`: a horizontal line of 4s filled with `fill_value` in the center.
   - Create `v_shape`: a vertical line of 4s filled with `fill_value` in the center.
3. **Conditional Placement:**
   - If the input digit is 7:
     - Concatenate `h_shape` on top of `O`.
     - Concatenate `v_shape` at the bottom of `O`.
   - Else:
     - Concatenate `v_shape` on top of `O`.
     - Concatenate `h_shape` at the bottom of `O`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0]) if str(I)[0].isdigit() else 0
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  fill_value = 2 if digit == 7 else 1
  shape = fill(canvas(4, (9, 9)), fill_value, asindices(crop(canvas(4, (9, 9)), (3, 3), (3, 3))))
  if digit == 7:
    O = paint(O, toobject(crop(shape, (0, 4), (1, 9)), shape))
    O = paint(O, toobject(crop(shape, (4, 0), (9, 1)), shape))
  else:
    O = paint(O, toobject(crop(shape, (4, 0), (9, 1)), shape))
    O = paint(O, toobject(crop(shape, (0, 4), (1, 9)), shape))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create a blank canvas `O` of size 10x10 and determine the `fill_value` based on the input.
2. **Base Shape:** Create a large 9x9 base shape `shape` filled with 4s and a center of `fill_value`.
3. **Conditional Extraction & Placement:**
   - If the input digit is 7:
     - Extract the horizontal line from `shape` and paint it onto the top of `O`.
     - Extract the vertical line from `shape` and paint it onto the bottom of `O`.
   - Else:
     - Extract the vertical line from `shape` and paint it onto the top of `O`.
     - Extract the horizontal line from `shape` and paint it onto the bottom of `O`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0]) if str(I)[0].isdigit() else 0
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  fill_value = 2 if digit == 7 else 1
  h_line = fill(canvas(4, (1, 9)), fill_value, asindices(crop(canvas(4, (1, 9)), (0, 3), (1, 3))))
  v_line =  fill(canvas(4, (9, 1)), fill_value, asindices(crop(canvas(4, (9, 1)), (3, 0), (3, 1))))
  h_pos = (1, 0) if digit == 7 else (7, 0)
  v_pos = (7, 0) if digit == 7 else (1, 0)
  O = paint(O, toobject(shift(asindices(h_line), h_pos), h_line))
  O = paint(O, toobject(shift(asindices(v_line), v_pos), v_line))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create a blank canvas `O` of size 10x10 and determine `fill_value` based on the input.
2. **Line Creation:**
   - Create `h_line`: a horizontal line of 4s with a center filled with `fill_value`.
   - Create `v_line`: a vertical line of 4s with a center filled with `fill_value`.
3. **Conditional Positioning:**
   - Determine the starting position (`h_pos`, `v_pos`) for each line based on the input digit.
4. **Painting:** Paint both lines onto the canvas `O` at their respective positions.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0]) if str(I)[0].isdigit() else 0
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  fill_value = 2 if digit == 7 else 1
  shape = lambda orientation: fill(canvas(4, (9, 1)) if orientation == 'v' else canvas(4, (1, 9)), fill_value, asindices(crop(canvas(4, (9, 1)), (3, 0), (3, 1))))
  O = paint(O, toobject(shift(asindices(shape('h')), (1, 0) if digit == 7 else (7, 0)), shape('h')))
  O = paint(O, toobject(shift(asindices(shape('v')), (7, 0) if digit == 7 else (1, 0)), shape('v')))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create a blank canvas `O` and determine `fill_value` based on the input.
2. **Shape Function:** Define a lambda function `shape` that takes orientation ('v' for vertical, 'h' for horizontal) as input and returns the corresponding line with the correct fill.
3. **Conditional Painting:** Similar to version 3, paint the shapes at their calculated positions based on the input digit using the `shape` function. 

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0]) if str(I)[0].isdigit() else 0
  fill_value = 2 if digit == 7 else 1
  h_base = canvas(0, (1, 9))
  v_base = canvas(0, (9, 1))
  h_shape = paint(h_base, recolor(4, asindices(h_base)))
  h_shape = paint(h_shape, recolor(fill_value, {(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5)}))
  v_shape = paint(v_base, recolor(4, asindices(v_base)))
  v_shape = paint(v_shape, recolor(fill_value, {(3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0)}))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if digit == 7:
    O = paint(O, toobject(shift(asindices(h_shape), (1, 0)), h_shape))
    O = paint(O, toobject(shift(asindices(v_shape), (7, 0)), v_shape))
  else:
    O = paint(O, toobject(shift(asindices(v_shape), (1, 0)), v_shape))
    O = paint(O, toobject(shift(asindices(h_shape), (7, 0)), h_shape))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create base canvases for both shapes (`h_base`, `v_base`) filled with 0s.
2. **Shape Construction:**
   - For `h_shape`: Recolor all cells to 4s, then recolor the center three cells to `fill_value`.
   - For `v_shape`: Recolor all cells to 4s, then recolor the center three cells to `fill_value`.
3. **Conditional Placement:** Similar to previous versions, paint the constructed shapes onto the main canvas `O` at their determined positions based on the input digit.
