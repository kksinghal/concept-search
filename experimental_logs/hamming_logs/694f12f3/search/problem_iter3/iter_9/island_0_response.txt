## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single digit as input and produces a 10x10 grid with two distinct objects. The objects are always squares with a border of '4's and an inner filling.  The transformation depends on the input digit:

**Input 7:**

* **Object 1:** A 5x5 square located in the top left corner. The border is filled with '4's and the inner 3x3 area is filled with '1's.
* **Object 2:**  A 4x4 square located in the bottom right corner. The border is filled with '4's and the inner 2x2 area is filled with '2's.

**Input other than 7 (example uses default input provided):**

* **Object 1:**  A 6x6 square located slightly offset from the top left corner. The border is filled with '4's and the inner 4x4 area is filled with '2's. 
* **Object 2:** A 4x4 square located in the bottom center. The border is filled with '4's and the inner 2x2 area is filled with '1's.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct programs using the provided DSL to achieve the transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Determine object sizes and colors based on input
  outer_size = 5 if I == 7 else 6
  inner_size = outer_size - 2
  outer_color = 4
  inner_color = 1 if I == 7 else 2
  inner_color_2 = 2 if I == 7 else 1

  # Create outer and inner squares as patches
  outer = frozenset({(outer_color, (i, j)) for i in range(outer_size) for j in range(outer_size)})
  inner = frozenset({(inner_color, (i, j)) for i in range(1, inner_size) for j in range(1, inner_size)})

  # Create second object
  outer_2 = frozenset({(outer_color, (i, j)) for i in range(4) for j in range(4)})
  inner_2 = frozenset({(inner_color_2, (i, j)) for i in range(1, 3) for j in range(1, 3)})

  # Define offsets based on input
  offset_1 = (1, 1) if I == 7 else (2, 3)
  offset_2 = (6, 4) if I == 7 else (7, 3)

  # Create canvas and paint objects
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, shift(outer, offset_1))
  O = paint(O, shift(inner, offset_1))
  O = paint(O, shift(outer_2, offset_2))
  O = paint(O, shift(inner_2, offset_2))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Determine Parameters:**  Calculates object sizes, colors, and offsets based on the input value.
2. **Create Patches:** Defines the outer and inner squares of both objects as separate patches using nested loops.
3. **Position and Paint:** Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0's and then paints both objects with their respective inner and outer colors at the calculated offsets.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Define base object
  base = frozenset({(4, (i, j)) for i in range(5) for j in range(5)})

  # Modify base object based on input
  if I == 7:
    obj_1 = paint(base, {(1, (i, j)) for i in range(1, 4) for j in range(1, 4)})
    obj_2 = paint(shift(base, (1, 1)), {(2, (i, j)) for i in range(2, 3) for j in range(2, 3)})
  else:
    obj_1 = paint(upscale(base, 2), {(2, (i, j)) for i in range(2, 6) for j in range(2, 6)})
    obj_2 = paint(shift(base, (2, 0)), {(1, (i, j)) for i in range(2, 3) for j in range(2, 3)})

  # Create canvas and paint objects
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, shift(obj_1, (1, 1) if I == 7 else (2, 3)))
  O = paint(O, shift(obj_2, (6, 4) if I == 7 else (7, 3)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Base:** Creates a base 5x5 square patch with a border of '4's.
2. **Conditional Modification:** Modifies the base object based on the input value, either painting the inner area directly or upscaling and then painting for the larger object. 
3. **Positioning:**  Positions both objects on the canvas using shifts.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Define small and large square functions
  def small_square(color):
    return paint(frozenset({(4, (i, j)) for i in range(4) for j in range(4)}), {(color, (i, j)) for i in range(1, 3) for j in range(1, 3)})
  
  def large_square(color):
    return paint(frozenset({(4, (i, j)) for i in range(6) for j in range(6)}), {(color, (i, j)) for i in range(2, 4) for j in range(2, 4)})

  # Choose objects based on input
  if I == 7:
    obj_1 = paint(small_square(1), {(4, (i, j)) for i in range(5) for j in range(5)})
    obj_2 = small_square(2)
  else:
    obj_1 = large_square(2)
    obj_2 = small_square(1)

  # Position objects on canvas
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, shift(obj_1, (1, 1) if I == 7 else (2, 3)))
  O = paint(O, shift(obj_2, (6, 4) if I == 7 else (7, 3)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Helper Functions:** Defines helper functions to create small (4x4) and large (6x6) squares with specific border and inner colors.
2. **Object Selection:**  Selects the appropriate pre-defined squares based on the input.
3. **Positioning:** Positions the selected objects on the canvas using shifts. 


**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Define base square and inner fill functions
  def square_base(size):
    return frozenset({(4, (i, j)) for i in range(size) for j in range(size)})
  
  def fill_inner(obj, color, size):
    return paint(obj, {(color, (i, j)) for i in range(1, size - 1) for j in range(1, size - 1)})
  
  # Determine object parameters based on input
  size_1 = 5 if I == 7 else 6
  color_1 = 1 if I == 7 else 2
  color_2 = 2 if I == 7 else 1

  # Create objects using helper functions
  obj_1 = fill_inner(square_base(size_1), color_1, size_1)
  obj_2 = fill_inner(square_base(4), color_2, 4)

  # Position objects on canvas
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, shift(obj_1, (1, 1) if I == 7 else (2, 3)))
  O = paint(O, shift(obj_2, (6, 4) if I == 7 else (7, 3)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Helper Functions:** Defines functions to create a square base with a given size and a function to fill the inner area of an object with a specific color and size.
2. **Parameter Calculation:**  Calculates the required size and color parameters based on the input.
3. **Object Construction:**  Constructs both objects by first creating the base squares and then filling their inner areas using the helper functions.
4. **Positioning:**  Positions the created objects on the canvas.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Define function for creating squares with border and inner color
  def colored_square(size, outer_color, inner_color):
    obj = frozenset({(outer_color, (i, j)) for i in range(size) for j in range(size)})
    return paint(obj, {(inner_color, (i, j)) for i in range(1, size - 1) for j in range(1, size - 1)})
  
  # Create objects using the helper function
  obj_1 = colored_square(5 if I == 7 else 6, 4, 1 if I == 7 else 2)
  obj_2 = colored_square(4, 4, 2 if I == 7 else 1)

  # Position objects on canvas based on input
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, shift(obj_1, (1, 1) if I == 7 else (2, 3)))
  O = paint(O, shift(obj_2, (6, 4) if I == 7 else (7, 3)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Versatile Helper Function:** Defines a function `colored_square` that can create a square of any size with a given outer and inner color.
2. **Direct Object Creation:**  Directly creates both objects using the `colored_square` function, simplifying the code structure.
3. **Positioning:**  Positions the objects on the canvas according to the input.

These five program versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version employs unique logic and function combinations, making them distinct solutions beyond minor variations.
