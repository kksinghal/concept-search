## Transformation Analysis:

The task involves transforming a single-digit input (7 or 1) into a stylized representation on a 10x10 grid. 

**Input 0 & Output 0:**

* The digit "7" is drawn with a thickness of two cells. 
* The left vertical stroke is filled with the main color (4). 
* The angled stroke is also filled with the main color.
* The space between the strokes is filled with a secondary color (1).

**Input 1 & Output 1:**

* The digit "1" is drawn with a thickness of two cells. 
* The vertical stroke is filled with the main color (4).
* A small horizontal base is added to the "1", also filled with the main color.
* The space within the "1" is filled with a secondary color (2).

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) 
  if digit == 7:
    seven = vconcat(canvas((4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),), 
                    canvas((4, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),),
                    canvas((4, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),), 
                    canvas((4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),),
                    canvas((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),),
                    canvas((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),),
                    canvas((0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0),),
                    canvas((0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0),),
                    canvas((0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0),),
                    canvas((0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0),))
    O = paint(O, asobject(seven))
  elif digit == 1:
    one = vconcat(canvas((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),),
                   canvas((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0),),
                   canvas((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0),),
                   canvas((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0),),
                   canvas((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0),),
                   canvas((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0),),
                   canvas((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),),
                   canvas((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),),
                   canvas((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 4, 0),),
                   canvas((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0),))
    O = paint(O, asobject(one))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version directly constructs the output grids for "7" and "1" using nested `canvas` calls and `vconcat` to combine rows. 
* It's straightforward but less flexible for potential variations in digit style or size.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  main_color = 4
  secondary_color = 1 if digit == 7 else 2 

  if digit == 7:
    O = paint(O, recolor(main_color, connect((1, 1), (1, 4)))) # Vertical line
    O = paint(O, recolor(main_color, connect((1, 1), (4, 4)))) # Diagonal line
    O = fill(O, main_color, {(2, j) for j in range(2, 10)}) # Horizontal lines
    O = fill(O, main_color, {(3, j) for j in range(3, 10)}) 
    O = fill(O, secondary_color, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 4) for j in range(3, min(6, 9))})
  elif digit == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(main_color, connect((2, 6), (8, 6)))) # Vertical line
    O = paint(O, recolor(main_color, connect((3, 7), (5, 9)))) # Diagonal line
    O = fill(O, main_color, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 6) for j in range(7, 10)}) # Fill the rest
    O = fill(O, secondary_color, {(4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 8), (5, 9)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version uses `connect` to draw the main lines of the digits.
* It utilizes `recolor` to paint the connected lines with the main color.
* It then fills in the remaining areas using `fill` with appropriate colors.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  main_color = 4
  secondary_color = 1 if digit == 7 else 2
  
  if digit == 7:
    stroke = asobject(canvas(main_color, (4, 1)))
    seven = hconcat(stroke, hmirror(stroke))
    seven = vconcat(canvas((4,), (1, 6)), canvas((0,), (1, 4)))
    seven = vconcat(seven, seven)
    O = paint(O, shift(asobject(seven), (1, 1)))
    O = fill(O, secondary_color,  {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)}) 
  elif digit == 1:
    one_body = asobject(shift(canvas(main_color, (6, 1)), (1, 6)))
    one_flag = asobject(canvas(main_color, (3, 3)))
    O = paint(O, one_body)
    O = paint(O, shift(one_flag, (2, 6)))
    O = paint(O, shift(one_flag, (3, 6)))
    O = fill(O, secondary_color, {(i, j) for i in range(4, 6) for j in range(8, 10)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version leverages mirroring with `hmirror` to construct the "7". 
* It builds the digits by combining smaller grid components created with `canvas` and then shifts them into position.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  main_color = 4
  secondary_color = 1 if digit == 7 else 2

  if digit == 7:
    base_segment = asobject(canvas(main_color, (1, 4)))
    seven = base_segment
    for i in range(1, 4):
      seven = seven.union(shift(base_segment, (i, i)))
    O = paint(O, seven)
    O = fill(O, secondary_color, {(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)})
  elif digit == 1:
    body = asobject(shift(canvas(main_color, (6, 1)), (1, 6)))
    base = asobject(canvas(main_color, (3, 3)))
    O = paint(O, body)
    O = paint(O, shift(base, (2, 6)))
    O = paint(O, shift(base, (3, 6)))
    O = fill(O, secondary_color, {(i, j) for i in range(4, 6) for j in range(8, 10)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version iteratively builds the angled stroke of the "7" by shifting and combining a base segment.
* It uses set union (`union`) to combine object parts.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0,(10,10))
  if digit == 7:
    O = paint(O, recolor(4, connect((1, 1), (1, 4))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(4, connect((1, 1), (4, 4))))
    O = fill(O, 4, {(2, i) for i in range(2, 10)})
    O = fill(O, 4, {(3, i) for i in range(3, 10)})
    O = fill(O, 1, {(2, i) for i in range(3, 6)})
    O = fill(O, 1, {(3, i) for i in range(4, 6)})
  elif digit == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(4, connect((2, 6), (8, 6))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(4, {(3, 7), (4, 8), (5, 9)}))
    O = fill(O, 4, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 6) for j in range(7, 10)})
    O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j) for i in range(4, 6) for j in range(8, 10)}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version combines `connect` and direct index specification for drawing the digit shapes.
* It aims for a balance between conciseness and readability.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version uses a distinct combination of functions and logic, ensuring significant differences beyond minor variations.
