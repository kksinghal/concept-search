## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves manipulating two rectangles on a 10x10 canvas based on the value of the top-left cell in the input grid.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Large Rectangle:** A 6x5 rectangle of value '4' is placed at the bottom-left corner of the canvas.
2. **Small Rectangle:** A 2x3 rectangle of value '1' is placed one cell above the large rectangle, shifted two cells to the right.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. **Large Rectangle:** A 6x6 rectangle of value '4' is placed at the top-left corner of the canvas, extending one cell further to the right compared to Output_0.
2. **Small Rectangle:** A 2x3 rectangle of value '2' is placed one cell below the large rectangle, shifted five cells to the right.

**Key Observations:**

* The width of the large rectangle and the value of the small rectangle are dependent on the input (value '7' results in a wider large rectangle and a different value for the small rectangle).
* The positioning of the small rectangle changes horizontally and vertically based on the input.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, inspired by the provided Program_A and Program_B, achieving the desired transformation using different DSL function combinations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  lr = canvas(4, (6, 5 + d))
  sr = canvas(1 + d, (2, 3))
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(lr), (3, d * 5)))
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(sr), (4 - d, 1 + 5 * d)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* `d`: Boolean indicating if the input value is '7'.
* `lr`: Constructs the large rectangle with dynamic width.
* `sr`: Constructs the small rectangle with a dynamic value.
* `shift`: Positions both rectangles based on `d`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  lr = {(i, j) for i in range(6) for j in range(5 + d)}
  sr = {(i, j) for i in range(2) for j in range(3)}
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, shift(lr, (3, 5 * d))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1 + d, shift(sr, (4 - d, 1 + 5 * d))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Similar to Version 1, but constructs rectangles using set comprehension for indices and `recolor` for values.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = fill(O, 4, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 9) for j in range(5 * d, 5 * d + 5)})
  O = fill(O, 1 + d, {(i, j) for i in range(4 - d, 6 - d) for j in range(1 + 5 * d, 4 + 5 * d)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Directly fills the canvas with respective values and dynamically calculated indices based on `d`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, shift(canvas(1, (6, 5)), (3, d * 5))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1 + d, shift(canvas(1, (2, 3)), (4 - d, 1 + 5 * d))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Uses `canvas` to create rectangles of value '1', then recolors and positions them based on `d`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  lr = {(i, j) for i in range(6) for j in range(5)}
  sr = {(i, j) for i in range(2) for j in range(3)}
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, shift(lr, (3, lrcorner(lr)[1] * d))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1 + d, shift(sr, (4 - d, 1 + lrcorner(lr)[1] * d))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Similar to Version 2, but calculates the horizontal shift dynamically using `lrcorner` on the initially constructed large rectangle.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic, ensuring diversity in the solutions.
