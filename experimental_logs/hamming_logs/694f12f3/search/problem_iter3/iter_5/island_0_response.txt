## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves creating two distinct shapes on a 10x10 canvas filled with 0s. The shapes are positioned based on the input value (7 or not 7). 

**Shape 1:**

* **Input 7:** A 5x5 square with its top left corner at (1,1). The inner 3x3 square is filled with `fill_value` (1 in this case), while the border is filled with 4s.
* **Input other than 7:** A 6x6 square with its top left corner at (0,3). The inner 4x4 square is filled with `fill_value` (2 in this case), while the border is filled with 4s.

**Shape 2:**

* **Input 7:** A 4x3 rectangle with its top left corner at (6,4). The inner 2x1 rectangle is filled with 2s, while the border is filled with 4s. 
* **Input other than 7:** A 4x3 rectangle with its top left corner at (2,4). The inner 2x1 rectangle is filled with 1s, while the border is filled with 4s.

The input value determines the `fill_value` for shape 1 and the positions of both shapes on the canvas.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using only functions from the provided DSL (`dsl.py`):

**Program Version 1:** Using `canvas`, `fill`, `shift`, and `paint`

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    fill_value = 1 if I == 7 else 2
    shape_1_pos = (1, 1) if I == 7 else (0, 3)
    shape_2_pos = (6, 4) if I == 7 else (2, 4)

    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(4, asobject(canvas(0, (5, 5)))), shape_1_pos))
    O = fill(O, fill_value, shift(product(interval(2, 4, 1), interval(2, 4, 1)), shape_1_pos))
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(4, asobject(canvas(0, (4, 3)))), shape_2_pos))
    O = fill(O, 2 if I == 7 else 1, shift(product(interval(1, 3, 1), interval(1, 2, 1)), shape_2_pos))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Define `fill_value`, `shape_1_pos`, and `shape_2_pos` based on the input `I`. Create a 10x10 canvas `O` filled with 0s.
2. **Shape 1:** Paint a 5x5 square of color 4 at `shape_1_pos`. Then, fill a 3x3 area within the square with `fill_value`.
3. **Shape 2:** Paint a 4x3 rectangle of color 4 at `shape_2_pos`. Then, fill a 2x1 area within the rectangle with 2 (if I is 7) or 1 (otherwise).

**Program Version 2:** Using nested loops and conditional statements

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    for i in range(10):
        for j in range(10):
            if (1 <= i - shape_1_pos[0] <= 4) and (1 <= j - shape_1_pos[1] <= 4):
                if (2 <= i - shape_1_pos[0] <= 3) and (2 <= j - shape_1_pos[1] <= 3):
                    O = fill(O, fill_value, {(i, j)})
                else:
                    O = fill(O, 4, {(i, j)})
            if (0 <= i - shape_2_pos[0] <= 3) and (1 <= j - shape_2_pos[1] <= 2):
                if (1 <= i - shape_2_pos[0] <= 2) and (1 <= j - shape_2_pos[1] <= 1):
                    O = fill(O, 2 if I == 7 else 1, {(i, j)})
                else:
                    O = fill(O, 4, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create a 10x10 canvas `O` filled with 0s. Define `fill_value`, `shape_1_pos`, and `shape_2_pos` based on input `I`.
2. **Nested Loops:** Iterate through each cell (i,j) on the canvas.
3. **Conditional Filling:** For each cell, check if it falls within the boundaries of shape 1 or shape 2. If so, fill it with the appropriate color based on its position within the shape.

**Program Version 3:** Using `hconcat` and `vconcat` for shape construction

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    fill_value = 1 if I == 7 else 2
    shape_1_pos = (1, 1) if I == 7 else (0, 3)
    shape_2_pos = (6, 4) if I == 7 else (2, 4)

    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    shape_1 = vconcat((
        (4, 4, 4, 4, 4), 
        (4, fill_value, fill_value, fill_value, 4),
        (4, fill_value, fill_value, fill_value, 4),
        (4, fill_value, fill_value, fill_value, 4),
        (4, 4, 4, 4, 4)
    ))
    shape_2 = vconcat((
        (4, 4, 4),
        (4, 2 if I == 7 else 1, 4),
        (4, 2 if I == 7 else 1, 4),
        (4, 4, 4)
    ))
    O = paint(O, shift(asobject(shape_1), shape_1_pos))
    O = paint(O, shift(asobject(shape_2), shape_2_pos))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Define `fill_value`, `shape_1_pos`, and `shape_2_pos` based on the input `I`. Create a 10x10 canvas `O` filled with 0s.
2. **Shape Construction:** Construct `shape_1` and `shape_2` using `vconcat` and hardcoded values for each row, with `fill_value` determined by input `I`.
3. **Painting:** Paint the constructed shapes onto the canvas `O` at their respective positions.

**Program Version 4:** Using `crop` and `fill` for shape creation

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    fill_value = 1 if I == 7 else 2
    shape_1_pos = (1, 1) if I == 7 else (0, 3)
    shape_2_pos = (6, 4) if I == 7 else (2, 4)

    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    shape_1 = fill(canvas(4, (5, 5)), fill_value, product(interval(1, 4, 1), interval(1, 4, 1)))
    shape_2 = fill(canvas(4, (4, 3)), 2 if I == 7 else 1, product(interval(1, 3, 1), interval(1, 2, 1)))
    O = paint(O, shift(asobject(shape_1), shape_1_pos))
    O = paint(O, shift(asobject(shape_2), shape_2_pos))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Define `fill_value`, `shape_1_pos`, and `shape_2_pos` based on the input `I`. Create a 10x10 canvas `O` filled with 0s.
2. **Shape Creation:** Create `shape_1` and `shape_2` by filling specific areas within canvases of appropriate sizes with the appropriate colors.
3. **Painting:** Paint the created shapes onto the canvas `O` at their respective positions.

**Program Version 5:** Using `replace` for color switching

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    fill_value = 1 if I == 7 else 2
    shape_1_pos = (1, 1) if I == 7 else (0, 3)
    shape_2_pos = (6, 4) if I == 7 else (2, 4)

    O = canvas(4, (10, 10))
    O = fill(O, 0, product(interval(0, 10, 1), interval(0, 10, 1)))
    O = fill(O, fill_value, shift(product(interval(2, 4, 1), interval(2, 4, 1)), shape_1_pos))
    O = fill(O, 2 if I == 7 else 1, shift(product(interval(1, 3, 1), interval(1, 2, 1)), shape_2_pos))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Define `fill_value`, `shape_1_pos`, and `shape_2_pos` based on the input `I`. Create a 10x10 canvas `O` filled with 4s.
2. **Background Fill:** Fill the entire canvas with 0s.
3. **Shape Filling:** Fill specific areas within the canvas with `fill_value` and 2 (if I is 7) or 1 (otherwise) based on their positions to create the shapes.

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation, ensuring diversity in logic and DSL function usage. Each version should achieve a similarity score of 0 when compared to the target output.
