## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Identify objects:** The program identifies the two distinct objects (connected regions of the same digit excluding the background) formed by the digit '4'.
2. **Partial Recoloring:** For each object, a 2x2 subgrid is extracted from the top-left corner of the object. This subgrid is then recolored:
    * The top object's subgrid is recolored to '1'.
    * The bottom object's subgrid is recolored to '2'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

This transformation follows the same logic as the previous one, with the recoloring applied to the two '4'-objects in Input_1.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Iterates through objects and recolors a 2x2 subgrid from their upper-left corner.
  """
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Get all objects, non-diagonal, without background
  O = I  # Initialize output grid
  for obj in objs:
    if size(obj) > 1:  # Only process objects larger than one cell
      i, j = ulcorner(obj) # Get upper-left corner of the object
      O = fill(O, 1 if uppermost(obj) < len(I) // 2 else 2, ((i,j),(i+1,j),(i,j+1),(i+1,j+1))) # Recolor a 2x2 region
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:**  `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Subgrid Recoloring:** For each object, its upper-left corner is determined using `ulcorner(obj)`. Then, a 2x2 subgrid starting from this corner is recolored using `fill` based on the object's vertical position relative to the grid's middle.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Recolors a 2x2 subgrid from the upper-left corner of objects based on their center of mass.
  """
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Get all objects
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if size(obj) > 1:
      ci, cj = centerofmass(obj)  # Calculate object's center of mass
      O = fill(O, 1 if ci < height(I) // 2 else 2, ((ci, cj), (ci - 1, cj), (ci, cj - 1), (ci - 1, cj - 1)))  # Fill from center of mass upwards and leftwards
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object and Center Calculation:** The code first identifies objects and then determines their center of mass using `centerofmass(obj)`.
2. **Conditional Recoloring:**  A 2x2 region is then filled, starting from the center of mass and extending upwards and leftwards. The fill color is determined by the center of mass's vertical position within the grid.


**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Uses a nested loop to check each cell's object affiliation and recolor accordingly.
  """
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      for obj in objs:
        if (i, j) in toindices(obj) and 0 < i < height(I) - 1 and 0 < j < width(I) - 1:
          O = fill(O, 1 if uppermost(obj) < height(I) // 2 else 2, ((i, j), (i + 1, j), (i, j + 1), (i + 1, j + 1)))
          break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterative Object Check:** This version iterates through each grid cell and checks if it belongs to any object.
2. **Recoloring within Bounds:** If a cell is part of an object and not on the grid's edge, the program recolors a 2x2 region starting from that cell.


**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Applies recoloring to a shifted subgrid and then inserts it back into the main grid.
  """
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if size(obj) > 1:
      i, j = ulcorner(obj)
      subgrid = crop(I, (i, j), (2, 2))
      new_color = 1 if uppermost(obj) < len(I) // 2 else 2
      recolored_subgrid = replace(subgrid, subgrid[0][0], new_color)
      O = paint(cover(O, ((i, j), (i + 1, j), (i, j + 1), (i + 1, j + 1))), 
               {(new_color, (i, j)), (new_color, (i + 1, j)), (new_color, (i, j + 1)), (new_color, (i + 1, j + 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Subgrid Manipulation:**  This version extracts a 2x2 subgrid, recolors it based on the object's position, and then paints it back onto the main grid at the same location.


**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Leverages map and lambda functions to recolor cells based on object properties.
  """
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  def recolor_func(i, j):
    for obj in objs:
      if (i, j) in toindices(obj) and 0 < i < height(I) - 1 and 0 < j < width(I) - 1:
        return 1 if uppermost(obj) < height(I) // 2 else 2
    return I[i][j]
  O = tuple(tuple(map(lambda j: recolor_func(i, j), range(width(I)))) for i in range(height(I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Functional Approach:** This program defines a `recolor_func` that uses object properties to determine the new color for each cell. 
2. **Map Application:** The `map` function applies `recolor_func` to each cell of the input grid, resulting in the transformed output.

Each program version utilizes different combinations of DSL functions and strategies, showcasing diverse approaches to achieve the target transformation while maintaining clarity and conciseness.
