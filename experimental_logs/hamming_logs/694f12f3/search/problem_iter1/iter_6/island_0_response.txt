## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the grid and recoloring a specific portion of them based on their width and position.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. Two objects are identified: one at the top and one at the bottom.
2. **Top Object:**  Since its width is greater than 4, it's divided horizontally into three equal parts. The middle part is recolored to '1'.
3. **Bottom Object:** Its width is greater than 4, so it's divided horizontally into three equal parts. The middle part is recolored to '2'. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. Two objects are identified: one at the top and one at the bottom.
2. **Top Object:**  Since its width is greater than 4, it's divided horizontally into three equal parts. The middle part is recolored to '2'. 
3. **Bottom Object:** Its width is greater than 4, so it's divided horizontally into three equal parts. The middle part is recolored to '1'. 


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, T, F, F)
  output_grid = canvas(0, shape(grid))
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    if width(obj) > 4:
      parts = hsplit(subgrid(obj, grid), 3)
      recolored_obj = combine(recolor(2 if i == 1 else 1, toobject(asindices(parts[1]), grid)),
                             recolor(color(obj), toobject(asindices(parts[0]), grid)),
                             recolor(color(obj), toobject(asindices(parts[2]), grid)))
    else:
      recolored_obj = obj
    output_grid = paint(output_grid, recolored_obj)
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(grid, T, F, F)` identifies all distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:** For each object:
   - If the object's width is greater than 4, split it into three parts horizontally using `hsplit`.
   - Recolor the middle part using `recolor` based on object index (`i`).
   - Combine the recolored parts and original parts using `combine`.
   - Paint the recolored object onto the output grid using `paint`.
3. **Return Output:** Return the modified `output_grid`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  obj1, obj2 = objects(grid, T, F, F)
  output_grid = canvas(0, shape(grid))
  
  def recolor_middle(obj, new_color):
    if width(obj) > 4:
      parts = hsplit(subgrid(obj, grid), 3)
      return combine(recolor(new_color, toobject(asindices(parts[1]), grid)),
                    recolor(color(obj), toobject(asindices(parts[0]), grid)),
                    recolor(color(obj), toobject(asindices(parts[2]), grid)))
    return obj
  
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, recolor_middle(obj1, 1))
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, recolor_middle(obj2, 2))
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Directly unpack objects into `obj1` and `obj2` assuming there are always two.
2. **Helper Function:** Define a function `recolor_middle` to encapsulate the recoloring logic.
3. **Recolor and Paint:**
   - Apply `recolor_middle` with color '1' to the first object and paint onto the output.
   - Apply `recolor_middle` with color '2' to the second object and paint onto the output. 
4. **Return Output:** Return the final `output_grid`.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = sorted(objects(grid, T, F, F), key=lambda obj: uppermost(obj))
  output_grid = canvas(0, shape(grid))
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    if width(obj) > 4:
      parts = hsplit(subgrid(obj, grid), 3)
      new_color = 2 if i == 1 else 1 
      output_grid = paint(output_grid, recolor(new_color, toobject(asindices(parts[1]), grid)))
    output_grid = paint(output_grid, obj)
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Sort:** Identify objects and sort them based on their vertical position using `uppermost`.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:**  For each object:
   - If the width is greater than 4, split and recolor only the middle part.
   - Paint the recolored middle part onto the output.
   - Paint the entire original object over it (this overwrites the non-middle parts with the original color). 
3. **Return Output:** Return the final `output_grid`.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  output_grid = canvas(0, shape(grid))
  for i, obj in enumerate(objects(grid, T, F, F)):
    if width(obj) > 4:
      for j, part in enumerate(hsplit(subgrid(obj, grid), 3)):
        new_color = 2 if i == 1 and j == 1 else (1 if j == 1 else color(obj))
        output_grid = paint(output_grid, recolor(new_color, toobject(asindices(part), grid)))
    else:
      output_grid = paint(output_grid, obj)
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Objects:** Iterate through each object in the grid.
2. **Conditional Splitting:**  If object width is greater than 4:
   - Split it horizontally into three parts.
   - Iterate through each part and recolor the middle part (j == 1) based on object index (i).
3. **Paint:**  Paint each part (recolored or original) onto the `output_grid`.
4. **Return Output:**  Return the modified `output_grid`.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, T, F, F)
  output_grid = canvas(0, shape(grid))
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    if width(obj) > 4:
      output_grid = paint(output_grid, recolor(2 if i == 1 else 1, toobject(asindices(hsplit(subgrid(obj, grid), 3)[1]), grid)))
    output_grid = paint(output_grid, obj)
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:** For each object:
   - If its width is greater than 4:
     - Split it into three parts and directly access the middle part.
     - Recolor the middle part based on the object index (i).
     - Paint the recolored middle part onto the `output_grid`.
   - Paint the entire original object over it.
3. **Return Output:** Return the final `output_grid`.
