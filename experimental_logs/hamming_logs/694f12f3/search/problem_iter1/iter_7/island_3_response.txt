## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. Identify the two distinct objects in the input grid (both consisting of the digit '4').
2. In the top object, recolor the 2x2 subgrid starting from the upper-left corner to '1'.
3. In the bottom object, recolor the 2x2 subgrid starting from the upper-left corner to '2'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. Identify the two distinct objects in the input grid (both consisting of the digit '4').
2. In the top object, recolor the 3x2 subgrid starting from the second cell of the second row to '2'.
3. In the bottom object, recolor the 2x2 subgrid starting from the second cell of the second-to-last row to '1'.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    if i == 0:
      a, b = ulcorner(obj)
      O = fill(O, 1, ((a+1,b+1),(a+2,b+1),(a+1,b+2),(a+2,b+2)))
    else:
      a, b = ulcorner(obj)
      O = fill(O, 2, ((a+1,b),(a+2,b),(a+1,b+1),(a+2,b+1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` retrieves all non-background objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:** The code iterates through each object. 
    - For the first object (`i == 0`), it recolors a 2x2 subgrid with '1', offset by (1,1) from the object's upper-left corner.
    - For the second object, it recolors a 2x2 subgrid with '2', offset by (1,0) from the object's upper-left corner.
3. **Return Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, obj in enumerate(objects(I, T, F, T)):
    corner = ulcorner(obj)
    if i == 0:
      O = fill(O, 1, shift(((0,1),(1,1),(0,2),(1,2)), corner))
    else:
      O = fill(O, 2, shift(((1,0),(2,0),(1,1),(2,1)), corner))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects & Initialize:** Similar to Version 1, the code identifies objects and initializes the output grid.
2. **Predefined Subgrids:** This version defines the 2x2 subgrids to be recolored as separate entities: `((0,1),(1,1),(0,2),(1,2))` and `((1,0),(2,0),(1,1),(2,1))`. 
3. **Shift and Fill:**  The appropriate subgrid is shifted to the object's upper-left corner using `shift` and then filled with the corresponding color using `fill`.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  obj1, obj2 = tuple(objs)
  O = fill(I, 1, shift(((0,1),(1,1),(0,2),(1,2)), ulcorner(obj1)))
  return fill(O, 2, shift(((1,0),(2,0),(1,1),(2,1)), ulcorner(obj2)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Object Assignment:** This version directly assigns the two objects to `obj1` and `obj2`, assuming there are always two objects.
2. **Sequential Filling:** It then fills the predefined subgrids (as in Version 2), shifted to the respective object's upper-left corner, directly into the output grid.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for n, obj in enumerate(objects(I, True, False, True)):
    c = 1 if n == 0 else 2
    i, j = ulcorner(obj)
    for di in range(1, 3):
      for dj in range(0 if n == 1 else 1, 2):
        O = fill(O, c, ((i+di, j+dj),))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Nested Loops for Filling:** This version uses nested loops to iterate through the cells of the 2x2 subgrids, calculating the offset based on the object index `n`.
2. **Conditional Filling:** It fills each cell individually using `fill` with the appropriate color determined by `n`.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, obj in enumerate(objects(I, T, F, T)):
    u, l = ulcorner(obj)
    if i == 0:
      O = paint(O, {(1, (u+1, l+1)), (1, (u+2, l+1)), (1, (u+1, l+2)), (1, (u+2, l+2))})
    else:
      O = paint(O, {(2, (u+1, l)), (2, (u+2, l)), (2, (u+1, l+1)), (2, (u+2, l+1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Creation for Painting:** Instead of filling individual cells, this version constructs the target sub-objects with the desired color and then paints them directly onto the grid using `paint`.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing different DSL functions and logic flows. This showcases the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for solving spatial reasoning tasks.
