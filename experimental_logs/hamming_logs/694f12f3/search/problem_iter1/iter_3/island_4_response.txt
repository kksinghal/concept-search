## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on identifying objects within the grid and modifying a central vertical strip within each object based on the object's width. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Object Identification:** Two distinct objects are identified: a larger object formed by the digit '4' and a background object formed by the digit '0'.
2. **Strip Modification:** 
    - For the object with '4', a central vertical strip of width 3 is re-colored to '1'.
    - For the object with '0', a central vertical strip is maintained as '0'. 
3. **Width-Based Recoloring:** The recoloring of the strip is dependent on the width of the object:
    - Objects wider than 4 cells have their strip recolored to '1'.
    - Objects 4 cells wide or less have their strip recolored to '2'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

The same logic applies to Input_1, with the central strip of the wider '4' object recolored to '2' and the smaller '4' object having a strip of '1'.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def cgdaebbiachaeaeejbbabjiajbdaaebc(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  def modify_obj(O, obj):
    w = width(obj)
    mid = leftmost(obj) + w // 2
    strip = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for j in range(max(0, mid - 1), min(mid + 2, width(I))))
    color = 1 if w > 4 else 2
    return paint(fill(O, color, strip), recolor(bg, intersection(toindices(obj), strip)))
  return functools.reduce(modify_obj, objs, canvas(bg, shape(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Background Identification:** `bg = mostcolor(I)` determines the background color.
3. **`modify_obj` Function:**  This function iterates through each object (`obj`) and modifies it:
    - `w = width(obj)` calculates the object's width.
    - `mid = leftmost(obj) + w // 2` finds the middle column index of the object.
    - `strip` defines the indices of the central vertical strip.
    - `color = 1 if w > 4 else 2` assigns the recolor value based on width.
    - `paint(fill(O, color, strip), recolor(bg, intersection(toindices(obj), strip)))` first fills the strip with the chosen color and then restores any background cells within the strip.
4. **`functools.reduce`:**  Applies `modify_obj` to each object and accumulates the results on a canvas initialized with the background color. 

**Note:** This version utilizes `functools.reduce` for concisely applying the object modification function iteratively.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def cgdaebbiachaeaeejbbabjiajbdaaebc(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  out = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    w = width(obj)
    mid = leftmost(obj) + w // 2
    strip = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for j in range(max(0, mid - 1), min(mid + 2, width(I))))
    color = 1 if w > 4 else 2
    out = paint(fill(out, color, strip), recolor(bg, intersection(toindices(obj), strip)))
  return out 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  `bg = mostcolor(I)` and `out = canvas(bg, shape(I))` determine the background color and initialize an output grid with this color.
2. **Iterative Modification:** The code iterates through each object in the input grid. 
3. **Strip Calculation and Recoloring:** Within the loop, the central strip's indices and the appropriate recolor value are determined based on the object's width.
4. **Painting and Background Restoration:** The strip is filled with the chosen color, and then any background cells within the strip are restored.

**Note:** This version explicitly iterates through objects using a `for` loop, offering a more step-by-step approach.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def cgdaebbiachaeaeejbbabjiajbdaaebc(I):
  out = I 
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    w = width(obj)
    mid = leftmost(obj) + w // 2
    strip = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for j in range(max(0, mid - 1), min(mid + 2, width(I))))
    color = 1 if w > 4 else 2
    out = fill(out, color, strip)
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if (i,j) in strip:
        out = fill(out, I[i][j], {(i,j)})
  return out
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Modification:**  This version directly modifies the input grid `I` to produce the output.
2. **Object Iteration:**  Similar to Version 2, the code iterates through each object.
3. **Strip Manipulation and Filling:** The central strip is calculated, and `fill` is used to directly recolor the strip with the chosen color.
4. **Background Restoration:**  An inner loop iterates through the object's indices and uses `fill` to restore the original color of any background cells within the strip.

**Note:** This version emphasizes direct manipulation of the input grid, minimizing intermediate grids.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def cgdaebbiachaeaeejbbabjiajbdaaebc(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    def modify_obj(obj):
        w = width(obj)
        mid = leftmost(obj) + w // 2
        strip = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for j in range(max(0, mid - 1), min(mid + 2, width(I))))
        color = 1 if w > 4 else 2
        modified_obj = recolor(color, toindices(obj))
        for i, j in toindices(obj):
            if (i,j) in strip and I[i][j] == bg:
                modified_obj = fill(modified_obj, bg, {(i,j)})
        return modified_obj
    return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(apply(modify_obj, objs)))
```
**Explanation:**

1. **Object Processing and Merging:** This version utilizes `apply` to process each object individually and `merge` to combine the results.
2. **`modify_obj` Function:**
    - Determines object width, middle column, and strip indices.
    - `recolor` initially recolors the entire object with the chosen color.
    - An inner loop then iterates through the object's indices, restoring the background color to cells within the strip that were originally background.
3. **Final Painting:** The modified objects are merged, and `paint` is used to draw them onto a canvas initialized with the background color.

**Note:** This version demonstrates a data-flow approach where objects are transformed and then combined.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def cgdaebbiachaeaeejbbabjiajbdaaebc(I):
    out =  canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        obj_indices = toindices(obj)
        w = width(obj_indices)
        mid = leftmost(obj_indices) + w // 2
        for i, j in obj_indices:
            if j in range(max(0, mid - 1), min(mid + 2, width(I))):
                out = fill(out, 1 if w > 4 else 2, {(i, j)})
            else:
                out = fill(out, I[i][j], {(i, j)})
    return out
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterative Grid Modification:**  This version iterates through each object and directly modifies the output grid.
2. **Cell-by-Cell Processing:** Within each object, it iterates through individual cell indices.
3. **Conditional Filling:** For cells within the central strip, it fills with '1' or '2' based on width. For cells outside the strip, it restores the original color from the input grid.

**Note:** This version focuses on clarity and explicitness by processing each cell individually.
