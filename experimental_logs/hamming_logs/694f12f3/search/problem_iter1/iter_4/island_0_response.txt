## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves recoloring specific parts of objects in the grid. The recoloring pattern depends on the width of the object:

**For objects wider than 4 cells:**

1. The object is split horizontally into three equal parts.
2. The left and right parts retain the original color.
3. The middle part is recolored with color '1'.

**For objects 4 cells wide or narrower:**

1. The object is split horizontally into two equal parts.
2. The left part is recolored with color '2'.
3. The right part is recolored with color '4'.

The first object in the grid remains unchanged.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, T, F, F)  # Extract all objects
  first_obj, *rest_objs = objs # Separate the first object
  output_grid = canvas(0, shape(grid)) # Create an empty canvas
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, first_obj) # Paint the first object as-is
  for obj in rest_objs: # Iterate over remaining objects
    if width(obj) > 4: # Check object width
      parts = hsplit(subgrid(obj, grid), 3) # Split into three parts
      recolored_obj = combine(recolor(color(obj), toobject(parts[0], grid)), 
                             recolor(1, toobject(parts[1], grid)), 
                             recolor(color(obj), toobject(parts[2], grid))) # Recolor parts
    else:
      parts = hsplit(subgrid(obj, grid), 2) # Split into two parts
      recolored_obj = combine(recolor(2, toobject(parts[0], grid)), 
                             recolor(4, toobject(parts[1], grid))) # Recolor parts
    output_grid = paint(output_grid, recolored_obj) # Paint recolored object
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Separate First Object:** Isolates the first object for later painting.
3. **Create Empty Canvas:** Generates a blank grid with the same dimensions as the input.
4. **Paint First Object:** Transfers the first object to the canvas without modification.
5. **Iterate and Recolor:** Loops through remaining objects, applying the width-dependent recoloring logic before painting them onto the canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, T, F, F)
  output_grid = canvas(0, shape(grid))
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    if i == 0:
      output_grid = paint(output_grid, obj)
    else:
      n = 3 if width(obj) > 4 else 2
      parts = hsplit(subgrid(obj, grid), n)
      recolored_obj = combine(*[recolor(1 if j == 1 and n == 3 
                                         else (2 if n == 2 and j == 0 else 4), 
                                         toobject(part, grid)) for j, part in enumerate(parts)])
      output_grid = paint(output_grid, recolored_obj)
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects and Initialize Canvas:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Iterate with Enumeration:** Loops through objects, using the index to identify the first object.
3. **Conditional Recoloring:** Applies the width-based recoloring logic using a conditional expression within a list comprehension. This version streamlines the code compared to version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, T, F, F)
  output_grid = canvas(0, shape(grid))
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, next(iter(objs)))  # Paint the first object directly
  for obj in objs - {next(iter(objs))}: # Iterate from the second object onwards
    n = 3 if width(obj) > 4 else 2
    parts = hsplit(subgrid(obj, grid), n)
    recolored_parts = [recolor(1 if j == 1 and n == 3 else (2 if j == 0 and n == 2 else 4),
                             toobject(part, grid)) for j, part in enumerate(parts)]
    for part in recolored_parts:
      output_grid = paint(output_grid, part)
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Directly Paint First Object:**  Instead of using an index, directly paints the first object extracted from `objs`.
2. **Iterate from Second Object:** Modifies the loop to skip the first object by using set difference. 
3. **Paint Individual Parts:**  Recolors each part of the object separately and then paints them onto the canvas. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, T, F, F)
  first, *rest = objs # Unpack objects into first and the rest
  output_grid = canvas(0, shape(grid))
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, first)
  for obj in rest:
    n = 3 if width(obj) > 4 else 2
    parts = hsplit(subgrid(obj, grid), n)
    for j, part in enumerate(parts):
      new_color = 1 if j == 1 and n == 3 else (2 if n == 2 and j == 0 else 4)
      recolored_part = recolor(new_color, toobject(part, grid))
      output_grid = paint(output_grid, recolored_part)
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Unpack Objects:** Uses unpacking to assign the first object and the remaining objects to separate variables.
2. **Iterate and Recolor Individually:** Loops through the remaining objects, recoloring each part separately within the loop. This approach emphasizes clarity by handling each part individually.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, T, F, F)
  output_grid = paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), next(iter(objs))) # Combine canvas creation and painting
  for obj in objs - {next(iter(objs))}:
    if width(obj) > 4:
      parts = hsplit(subgrid(obj, grid), 3)
      recolored_obj = recolor(1, toobject(parts[1], grid)) # Recolor middle part first
      for j in (0, 2):
        recolored_obj = combine(recolored_obj, recolor(color(obj), toobject(parts[j], grid)))
    else:
      parts = hsplit(subgrid(obj, grid), 2)
      recolored_obj = combine(recolor(2, toobject(parts[0], grid)),
                              recolor(4, toobject(parts[1], grid)))
    output_grid = paint(output_grid, recolored_obj)
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Combined Canvas and Painting:** Creates the canvas and paints the first object in a single line for conciseness.
2. **Recolor Middle First:** When handling objects wider than 4 cells, recolors the middle part first and then combines it with the left and right parts. This demonstrates a slightly different order of operations.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing different DSL functions, logic flow, and variable handling techniques. Each version is designed to be readable, efficient, and true to the specified DSL constraints.
