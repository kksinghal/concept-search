## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation modifies the input grids by splitting the objects into two parts and recoloring the upper or lower half of the objects based on their relative positions.

**Input 0:**

* The upper object remains unchanged.
* The lower object is horizontally split in half.
* The upper half of the lower object is recolored to '2'.
* The lower half of the lower object is recolored to '1'.

**Input 1:**

* The upper object is horizontally split in half.
* The upper half of the upper object is recolored to '2'.
* The lower half of the upper object remains unchanged.
* The lower object is horizontally split in half.
* The upper half of the lower object remains unchanged.
* The lower half of the lower object is recolored to '1'.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Identify objects and order by uppermost row
  obj1, obj2 = order(objects(I, F, F, T), uppermost)
  # Calculate half heights
  h1, h2 = height(obj1) // 2, height(obj2) // 2
  # Create canvas
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  # Modify and paint upper object
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, crop(toobject(toindices(obj1), I), (h1, 0), (h1, width(obj1)))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, crop(toobject(toindices(obj2), I), (0, 0), (h2, width(obj2)))))
  # Paint original objects
  O = paint(O, obj1)
  O = paint(O, obj2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identify objects in the grid and order them from top to bottom.
2. Calculate half the height of each object.
3. Create a blank canvas of the same size as the input.
4. Crop the upper half of the first object and recolor it to '2'.
5. Crop the upper half of the second object and recolor it to '1'.
6. Paint the modified upper halves and then the original objects onto the canvas.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Get objects ordered by uppermost row
  obj1, obj2 = order(objects(I, F, F, T), uppermost)
  # Split objects horizontally
  top1, bottom1 = vsplit(toobject(toindices(obj1), I), 2)
  top2, bottom2 = vsplit(toobject(toindices(obj2), I), 2)
  # Paint recolor based on position
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(2, top1))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, top2))
  # Paint remaining parts
  O = paint(O, bottom1)
  O = paint(O, bottom2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identify objects in the grid and order them from top to bottom.
2. Split both objects horizontally into top and bottom halves.
3. Recolor the top half of the first object to '2' and the top half of the second object to '1'.
4. Paint the recolored top halves and then the original bottom halves onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Extract objects and order by uppermost
  obj1, obj2 = order(objects(I, F, F, T), uppermost)
  # Apply transformation based on object order
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(2, apply(lambda cell: (cell[0], (cell[1][0] // 2, cell[1][1])), obj1)))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, apply(lambda cell: (cell[0], (cell[1][0] // 2, cell[1][1])), obj2)))
  # Paint original objects
  O = paint(O, obj1)
  O = paint(O, obj2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identify objects in the grid and order them from top to bottom.
2. For each object, apply a lambda function that effectively recolors the upper half by halving the row index of each cell.
3. Paint the modified objects and then the original objects onto the canvas.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find objects in the grid without background and order
  obj1, obj2 = order(objects(I, F, F, T), uppermost)
  # Calculate half heights
  h1, h2 = height(obj1) // 2, height(obj2) // 2
  # Create masks for recoloring
  mask1 = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(h1) for j in range(width(obj1)))
  mask2 = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(h2) for j in range(width(obj2)))
  # Paint the recolored objects and original objects
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(2, toobject(shift(mask1, ulcorner(obj1)), I)))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, toobject(shift(mask2, ulcorner(obj2)), I)))
  O = paint(O, obj1)
  O = paint(O, obj2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identify objects in the grid and order them from top to bottom.
2. Calculate the half heights of the objects.
3. Create masks representing the upper halves of the objects' bounding boxes.
4. Shift the masks to align with the objects' positions.
5. Recolor the areas defined by the masks to '2' for the first object and '1' for the second.
6. Paint the recolored areas and then the original objects onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Identify objects and order
  obj1, obj2 = order(objects(I, F, F, T), uppermost)
  # Create functions to recolor upper halves
  recolor_top1 = lambda obj: recolor(2, frozenset((obj.pop()[0], (i // 2, j)) for i, j in toindices(obj)))
  recolor_top2 = lambda obj: recolor(1, frozenset((obj.pop()[0], (i // 2, j)) for i, j in toindices(obj)))
  # Paint the recolored and original objects
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor_top1(obj1.copy()))
  O = paint(O, recolor_top2(obj2.copy()))
  O = paint(O, obj1)
  O = paint(O, obj2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identify objects in the grid and order them from top to bottom.
2. Create two functions (`recolor_top1` and `recolor_top2`) that take an object and recolor its upper half by halving the row index of each cell.
3. Apply these functions to copies of the objects to avoid modifying the originals.
4. Paint the recolored objects and then the original objects onto the canvas.

These five program versions use distinct logic and DSL function combinations to achieve the desired transformation, providing diverse solutions to the problem.
