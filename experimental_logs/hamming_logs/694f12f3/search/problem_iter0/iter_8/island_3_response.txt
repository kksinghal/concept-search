## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves splitting one of the objects horizontally and recoloring the halves. Additionally, a 2x2 square in the center of the other object is filled with a specific color.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Split & Recolor:** The lower object (composed of '4's) is split horizontally. The top half retains its original color ('4'), while the bottom half is recolored to '2'.
2. **Inner Square Fill:**  A 2x2 square at the center of the upper object (composed of '4's) is filled with '1'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. **Split & Recolor:** The upper object (composed of '4's) is split horizontally. The top half is recolored to '2', and the bottom half retains its original color ('4').
2. **Inner Square Fill:** A 2x2 square at the center of the lower object (composed of '4's) is filled with '1'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions for the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Identify objects and their vertical order
  obj1, obj2 = order(objects(I, F, F, T), uppermost) 

  # Determine the object to be split based on vertical order
  split_obj = obj2 if uppermost(obj1) < uppermost(obj2) else obj1

  # Split the object horizontally
  split_point = height(split_obj) // 2
  top_half = recolor(2 if split_obj == obj2 else 1, toindices(crop(toobject(toindices(split_obj), I), (0, 0), (split_point, width(split_obj)))))
  bottom_half = recolor(1 if split_obj == obj2 else 2, toindices(crop(toobject(toindices(split_obj), I), (split_point, 0), (height(split_obj) - split_point, width(split_obj)))))

  # Fill the inner 2x2 square of the other object
  other_obj = obj1 if split_obj == obj2 else obj2
  inner_corner = add(ulcorner(other_obj), (1, 1))
  inner_square = frozenset((inner_corner[0] + i, inner_corner[1] + j) for i in range(2) for j in range(2))

  # Construct the output grid
  O = paint(paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), top_half), bottom_half), other_obj)
  O = underfill(O, 1, inner_square)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify & Order:** Identifies the objects and orders them based on their vertical position.
2. **Determine Split Object:** Determines which object needs to be split based on the vertical order.
3. **Split & Recolor:** Splits the determined object horizontally and recolors the halves based on the split object's identity.
4. **Fill Inner Square:**  Fills a 2x2 square at the center of the other object with color '1'.
5. **Construct Output:**  Paints the split and recolored halves and the other object onto a blank canvas to generate the final output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Identify objects, ensuring obj1 is always the upper object
  obj1, obj2 = order(objects(I, F, F, T), uppermost)

  # Calculate the midpoint of the lower object for splitting
  split_row = uppermost(obj2) + height(obj2) // 2

  # Generate a mask for the lower object based on the split
  mask = frozenset((i, j) for i, j in toindices(obj2) if i < split_row)

  # Create the top and bottom halves with appropriate colors
  top_half = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(2, mask))
  bottom_half = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(1, toindices(obj2) - mask))

  # Fill the inner 2x2 square of the upper object
  inner_corner = add(ulcorner(obj1), (1, 1))
  inner_square = frozenset((inner_corner[0] + i, inner_corner[1] + j) for i in range(2) for j in range(2))
  filled_obj1 = paint(toobject(toindices(obj1), I), recolor(1, inner_square))

  # Combine the elements to generate the final output grid
  O = paint(paint(top_half, bottom_half), filled_obj1)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify & Order:** Identifies the objects, ensuring `obj1` is always the upper one.
2. **Calculate Split:**  Calculates the row index to split the lower object.
3. **Generate Mask:**  Creates a mask of indices for the top half of the lower object.
4. **Create Halves:**  Generates separate grids for the top and bottom halves with their respective colors.
5. **Fill Inner Square:**  Fills the inner 2x2 square of the upper object.
6. **Combine & Output:**  Combines the top and bottom halves and the modified upper object to create the output grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Identify and order objects based on their vertical position
  obj1, obj2 = order(objects(I, F, F, T), uppermost)

  # Determine the object to be split and its color
  split_obj, static_obj = (obj2, obj1) if uppermost(obj1) < uppermost(obj2) else (obj1, obj2)
  split_color = 2 if split_obj == obj2 else 1

  # Create the top half of the split object with the determined color
  top_half = recolor(split_color, toindices(crop(toobject(toindices(split_obj), I), (0, 0), (height(split_obj) // 2, width(split_obj)))))

  # Paint the top half, bottom half (original color), and static object onto a canvas
  O = paint(paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), top_half), toobject(toindices(split_obj), I)), toobject(toindices(static_obj), I))

  # Fill the inner 2x2 square of the static object with color 1
  inner_corner = add(ulcorner(static_obj), (1, 1))
  inner_square = frozenset((inner_corner[0] + i, inner_corner[1] + j) for i in range(2) for j in range(2))
  O = underfill(O, 1, inner_square)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify & Order:**  Identifies objects and their vertical order.
2. **Determine Split:** Determines the object to split and the static object, along with the split color.
3. **Create Top Half:** Generates the top half of the split object with the determined color.
4. **Paint Elements:**  Paints the top half, bottom half (retaining its original color), and the static object onto a canvas.
5. **Fill Inner Square:** Fills the inner 2x2 square of the static object.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Identify objects and order them based on vertical position
  obj1, obj2 = order(objects(I, F, F, T), uppermost)

  # Determine the object to split based on their vertical order
  if uppermost(obj1) < uppermost(obj2):
    split_obj, static_obj = obj2, obj1
  else:
    split_obj, static_obj = obj1, obj2

  # Calculate the split point for the object
  split_point = height(split_obj) // 2

  # Generate masks for the top and bottom halves of the split object
  top_mask = frozenset((i, j) for i, j in toindices(split_obj) if i < uppermost(split_obj) + split_point)
  bottom_mask = frozenset((i, j) for i, j in toindices(split_obj) if i >= uppermost(split_obj) + split_point)

  # Paint the top and bottom halves with their respective colors
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(2 if split_obj == obj2 else 1, top_mask))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1 if split_obj == obj2 else 2, bottom_mask))
  O = paint(O, static_obj)

  # Fill the inner 2x2 square of the static object
  inner_corner = (uppermost(static_obj) + 1, leftmost(static_obj) + 1)
  O = underfill(O, 1, frozenset((inner_corner[0] + i, inner_corner[1] + j) for i in range(2) for j in range(2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify & Order:**  Identifies objects and their vertical order.
2. **Determine Split:**  Determines the splitting and static objects.
3. **Calculate Split Point:** Calculates the row index to split the object.
4. **Generate Masks:** Creates masks for top and bottom halves of the split object.
5. **Paint Halves:**  Paints the top and bottom halves with their respective colors onto a canvas.
6. **Fill Inner Square:** Fills the inner 2x2 square of the static object.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Identify objects based on color, assuming colors are consistent
  obj1 = next(obj for obj in objects(I, F, F, T) if color(obj) == 4)
  obj2 = next(obj for obj in objects(I, F, F, T) if obj != obj1)

  # Calculate the center of mass for both objects to determine vertical order
  cm1, cm2 = centerofmass(obj1), centerofmass(obj2)

  # Determine the split object based on vertical order
  if cm1[0] < cm2[0]:
    split_obj, static_obj = obj1, obj2
  else:
    split_obj, static_obj = obj2, obj1

  # Split the determined object horizontally and recolor the halves
  split_point = height(split_obj) // 2
  top = crop(toobject(toindices(split_obj), I), (0, 0), (split_point, width(split_obj)))
  bottom = crop(toobject(toindices(split_obj), I), (split_point, 0), (split_point, width(split_obj)))
  top_half = recolor(2 if split_obj == obj1 else 1, toindices(top))
  bottom_half = recolor(1 if split_obj == obj1 else 2, toindices(bottom))

  # Fill the inner 2x2 square of the other object
  inner_corner = add(ulcorner(static_obj), (1, 1))
  inner_square = frozenset((inner_corner[0] + i, inner_corner[1] + j) for i in range(2) for j in range(2))
  filled_static = paint(toobject(toindices(static_obj), I), recolor(1, inner_square))

  # Construct the final output grid by combining the elements
  O = paint(paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), top_half), bottom_half), filled_static)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects (Color-Based):** Identifies objects based on their color, assuming consistent color usage.
2. **Determine Vertical Order:** Uses center of mass to determine the vertical order of objects.
3. **Determine Split:**  Determines the split and static objects based on the vertical order.
4. **Split & Recolor:**  Splits the determined object and recolors the halves.
5. **Fill Inner Square:**  Fills the inner 2x2 square of the static object.
6. **Construct Output:** Combines the elements to create the final output grid.

These five program versions provide distinct logic and DSL function combinations to achieve the desired transformation, offering a diverse set of solutions.
