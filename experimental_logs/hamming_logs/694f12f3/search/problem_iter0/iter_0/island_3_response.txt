## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:** The transformation involves identifying the two distinct objects (clusters of the same digit excluding the background 0). The top object retains its color (4). The bottom object is split horizontally, with the top half recolored to 2 and the bottom half recolored to 1. 

**Input 1 to Output 1:**  This transformation again involves identifying the two distinct objects. This time, the bottom object retains its color (4). The top object is split horizontally, with the top half recolored to 2 and the bottom half recolored to 1.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct program versions for the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Identify objects
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T) 
  # Sort objects by uppermost row
  obj1, obj2 = order(objs, uppermost) 
  # Split the lower object horizontally
  split_point = height(obj2) // 2
  top_half = frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj2 if i < uppermost(obj2) + split_point)
  bottom_half = frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj2 if i >= uppermost(obj2) + split_point)
  # Recolor the split parts
  top_half = recolor(2, top_half)
  bottom_half = recolor(1, bottom_half)
  # Paint back to grid
  O = paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), obj1), top_half)
  O = paint(O, bottom_half)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Uses `objects` to find distinct objects (excluding background).
2. **Sort Objects:**  Sorts the objects based on their uppermost row position using `order` and `uppermost`.
3. **Split Object:**  The lower object is split horizontally into two halves based on its height.
4. **Recolor:** The top and bottom halves of the split object are recolored to 2 and 1 respectively.
5. **Paint:** The original object and the recolored halves are painted back onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Identify and separate the objects
  obj1, obj2 = order(objects(I, F, F, T), uppermost)
  # Create a mask for the lower half of the second object
  mask = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj2) + height(obj2) // 2, lowermost(obj2) + 1) for j in range(leftmost(obj2), rightmost(obj2) + 1))
  # Apply color transformations based on the mask
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(1, intersection(toindices(obj2), mask)))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, difference(toindices(obj2), mask)))
  O = paint(O, obj1)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Separate:** Similar to Version 1, objects are identified and separated.
2. **Create Mask:**  A mask is created representing the indices of the lower half of the second object.
3. **Color Transformation:**  Using the mask, the lower half is recolored to 1 and the remaining part of the second object is recolored to 2.
4. **Paint:** Objects are painted onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Get the bounding boxes of the objects
  obj1, obj2 = order(objects(I, F, F, T), uppermost)
  box1, box2 = backdrop(obj1), backdrop(obj2)
  # Define a function for recoloring based on box coordinates
  def recolor_box(box, top_color, bottom_color):
    split = uppermost(box) + height(box) // 2
    return paint(recolor(top_color, frozenset((i, j) for i in range(uppermost(box), split) for j in range(leftmost(box), rightmost(box) + 1))), 
                recolor(bottom_color, frozenset((i, j) for i in range(split, lowermost(box) + 1) for j in range(leftmost(box), rightmost(box) + 1))))
  # Apply recoloring based on object positions
  O = recolor_box(box2, 2, 1) if uppermost(box1) < uppermost(box2) else recolor_box(box1, 2, 1)
  O = paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), obj1), obj2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Bounding Boxes:**  Instead of directly splitting, this version calculates bounding boxes for each object.
2. **Recolor Function:**  A helper function `recolor_box` is defined to split and recolor a given bounding box.
3. **Conditional Recoloring:**  The program determines which object is lower and applies the recoloring function accordingly.
4. **Paint:**  Objects are painted onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find the non-background color
  color = leastcolor(I) if mostcolor(I) == 0 else mostcolor(I)
  # Create masks for upper and lower halves of the grid
  upper_mask = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(len(I) // 2) for j in range(len(I[0])))
  lower_mask = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(len(I) // 2, len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0])))
  # Recolor based on object positions and masks
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(2, intersection(ofcolor(I, color), upper_mask))) 
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, intersection(ofcolor(I, color), lower_mask)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Non-Background Color:**  Finds the prominent color (non-background) in the grid.
2. **Half Masks:** Creates masks for the upper and lower halves of the grid.
3. **Recolor with Masks:**  Recolors the grid based on the intersection of the object color with the upper and lower masks.
4. **Paint:** Paints the recolored cells onto a blank canvas. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find objects and their bounding boxes
  obj1, obj2 = order(objects(I, F, F, T), uppermost)
  box1, box2 = backdrop(obj1), backdrop(obj2)
  # Define a function to recolor a grid portion
  def recolor_portion(grid, start, end, color):
    return tuple(tuple(color if start[0] <= i <= end[0] and start[1] <= j <= end[1] else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(grid))
  # Determine the target object and recolor its portions
  if uppermost(box1) < uppermost(box2):
    O = recolor_portion(I, (uppermost(box2), leftmost(box2)), (uppermost(box2) + height(box2) // 2 - 1, rightmost(box2)), 2)
    O = recolor_portion(O, (uppermost(box2) + height(box2) // 2, leftmost(box2)), (lowermost(box2), rightmost(box2)), 1)
  else:
    O = recolor_portion(I, (uppermost(box1), leftmost(box1)), (uppermost(box1) + height(box1) // 2 - 1, rightmost(box1)), 2)
    O = recolor_portion(O, (uppermost(box1) + height(box1) // 2, leftmost(box1)), (lowermost(box1), rightmost(box1)), 1)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Objects and Boxes:**  Identifies objects and their corresponding bounding boxes.
2. **Recolor Function:** Defines a function to recolor a specific portion of the grid defined by start and end coordinates.
3. **Conditional Recoloring:**  Based on the object positions, applies the `recolor_portion` function to the correct object and its top and bottom halves. 


These five programs provide distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation, showcasing the versatility and flexibility of the DSL. Each utilizes different logic and function combinations, ensuring diversity in the solutions.
