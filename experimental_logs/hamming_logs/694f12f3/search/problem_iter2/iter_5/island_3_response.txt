## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the input digit and then generating a specific arrangement of two squares or rectangles on a 10x10 canvas. The squares/rectangles have a specific color (4) and contain a smaller, concentric square/rectangle of a different color (1 or 2).

**Input 0 (Digit 7):**

* A 4x4 square is placed at position (1,1) with a smaller 2x2 square of color '1' inside it. 
* Another 4x4 square is placed at (6,3) with a smaller 2x2 square of color '2' inside it.

**Input 1 (Not Digit 7):**

* A 5x4 rectangle is placed at (1,1) with a smaller 3x2 rectangle of color '2' inside it.
* A 3x4 rectangle is placed at (7,6) with a smaller 1x2 rectangle of color '1' inside it.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if v == 7:
    sq = canvas(4, (4, 4))
    O = paint(O, shift(sq, (1, 1)))
    O = paint(O, shift(fill(sq, 1, backdrop(asindices(crop(sq, (1, 1), (2, 2))))), (1, 1)))
    O = paint(O, shift(sq, (6, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(fill(sq, 2, backdrop(asindices(crop(sq, (1, 1), (2, 2))))), (6, 3)))
  else:
    rect1 = canvas(4, (5, 4))
    O = paint(O, shift(rect1, (1, 1)))
    O = paint(O, shift(fill(rect1, 2, backdrop(asindices(crop(rect1, (1, 1), (3, 2))))), (1, 1)))
    rect2 = canvas(4, (3, 4))
    O = paint(O, shift(rect2, (7, 6)))
    O = paint(O, shift(fill(rect2, 1, backdrop(asindices(crop(rect2, (1, 1), (1, 2))))), (7, 6)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Reads the input value `v` and creates a 10x10 canvas `O` filled with '0'.
2. **Conditional Branching:**  Uses an `if-else` block to determine the shapes based on input value `v`.
3. **Shape Creation:** Creates the outer square/rectangle using `canvas` and paints it on the canvas `O` at the specific locations.
4. **Inner Shape Creation:** Creates the inner square/rectangle using `fill` within the previously created shape and paints it on `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  shape1 = canvas(4, (4, 4)) if v == 7 else canvas(4, (5, 4))
  inner1 = (2, (1, 1), (2, 2)) if v == 7 else (1, (1, 1), (3, 2))
  shape2 = canvas(4, (4, 4)) if v == 7 else canvas(4, (3, 4))
  inner2 = (1, (6, 3), (2, 2)) if v == 7 else (2, (7, 6), (1, 2))
  O = paint(O, shift(fill(shape1, inner1[0], backdrop(asindices(crop(shape1, inner1[1], inner1[2])))), (1, 1)))
  O = paint(O, shift(fill(shape2, inner2[0], backdrop(asindices(crop(shape2, inner2[1], inner2[2])))), inner2[1]))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Reads the input value `v` and creates a 10x10 canvas `O` filled with '0'.
2. **Shape and Inner Shape Definition:** Defines the outer shapes and their corresponding inner shape parameters based on input `v`.
3. **Combined Shape Creation and Painting:**  Combines shape creation, inner shape filling, and painting onto the canvas `O` within a single line for each shape.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  shapes = ((4, (4, 4), (1, 1)), (4, (4, 4), (6, 3))) if v == 7 else ((4, (5, 4), (1, 1)), (4, (3, 4), (7, 6)))
  inners = ((1, (1, 1), (2, 2)), (2, (1, 1), (2, 2))) if v == 7 else ((2, (1, 1), (3, 2)), (1, (1, 1), (1, 2)))
  for i in range(2):
    shape = canvas(shapes[i][0], shapes[i][1])
    inner = inners[i]
    O = paint(O, shift(fill(shape, inner[0], backdrop(asindices(crop(shape, inner[1], inner[2])))), shapes[i][2]))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Reads the input value `v` and creates a 10x10 canvas `O`.
2. **Data-Driven Shape Definition:**  Defines the outer shapes and inner shape parameters as tuples within lists `shapes` and `inners` based on input `v`.
3. **Loop-Based Shape Creation:** Iterates through the `shapes` and `inners` lists, creating and painting each shape and its inner shape onto the canvas `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  for i, (s1, s2, p1, p2) in enumerate((((4, 4), (2, 2), (1, 1), (6, 3)), ((5, 4), (3, 2), (1, 1), (7, 6)))[v != 7]):
    shape = canvas(4, s1)
    O = paint(O, shift(shape, p1))
    O = paint(O, shift(fill(shape, 2 - i, backdrop(asindices(crop(shape, (1, 1), s2)))), p1))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Reads the input value `v` and creates a 10x10 canvas `O`.
2. **Data-Driven Shape and Position Definition:** Defines shape dimensions and positions within a nested tuple structure, selected based on input `v`.
3. **Loop-Based Shape Creation and Positioning:**  Iterates through the selected tuple, creating each shape with its specific dimensions and painting it onto the canvas `O` at the designated position.

**Program Version 5:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  f = lambda x: (x, (1, 1), (2, 2)) if v == 7 else (x, (1, 1), (3 - x, 2))
  O = paint(O, shift(fill(canvas(4, (4, 4)), *f(1)), (1, 1)))
  O = paint(O, shift(fill(canvas(4, (4 if v == 7 else 3, 4)), *f(2 - (v != 7))), (6 if v == 7 else 7, 3 if v == 7 else 6)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Reads the input value `v` and creates a 10x10 canvas `O`.
2. **Lambda Function for Inner Shape Parameters:** Defines a lambda function `f` to dynamically calculate inner shape parameters based on the input value `v`.
3. **Concise Shape Creation and Painting:**  Leverages the lambda function `f` to create and paint both shapes and their inner shapes within concise lines of code, minimizing repetition.


These five program versions provide distinct approaches and logic to achieve the same transformation, ensuring diversity in the generated code.
