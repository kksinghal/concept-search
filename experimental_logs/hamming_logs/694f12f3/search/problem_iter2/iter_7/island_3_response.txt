## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves creating two distinct shapes on a 10x10 canvas based on the input value. The shapes resemble filled squares with a contrasting inner square. 

**Input 7:**

- **Shape 1:** A 4x4 square filled with '4' at position (1,1). The inner 2x2 square is filled with '1'.
- **Shape 2:** A 4x4 square filled with '4' at position (6,3). The inner 2x2 square is filled with '2'.

**Input other than 7:**

- **Shape 1:** A 5x4 square filled with '4' at position (1,1). The inner 3x2 square is filled with '2'.
- **Shape 2:** A 3x4 square filled with '4' at position (7,6). The inner 1x2 square is filled with '1'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  
  # Shape properties based on input
  size1 = (4, 4) if v == 7 else (5, 4)
  inner_size1 = (2, 2) if v == 7 else (3, 2)
  fill_value1 = 1 if v == 7 else 2
  pos1 = (1, 1)
  
  size2 = (4, 4) if v == 7 else (3, 4)
  inner_size2 = (2, 2) if v == 7 else (1, 2)
  fill_value2 = 2 if v == 7 else 1
  pos2 = (6, 3) if v == 7 else (7, 6)
  
  # Function to draw shape
  def draw_shape(size, fill_value, pos, inner_size):
    O = paint(O, shift(canvas(4, size), pos))
    inner_pos = add(pos, (1,1))
    O = paint(O, shift(fill(canvas(0, inner_size), fill_value, backdrop(asindices(canvas(0, inner_size)))), inner_pos))
    return O
  
  # Draw the shapes
  O = draw_shape(size1, fill_value1, pos1, inner_size1)
  O = draw_shape(size2, fill_value2, pos2, inner_size2)
  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Get input value 'v' and create a 10x10 canvas 'O'.
2. **Shape Properties:** Define size, inner size, fill value, and position for both shapes based on 'v'.
3. **draw_shape Function:** This function paints a shape with a specific size, fill value, position, and inner size.
   - It first paints the outer shape with value '4'.
   - Then it calculates the inner position and paints the inner shape with the specified fill value.
4. **Drawing Shapes:** Calls 'draw_shape' twice to draw both shapes on the canvas.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  
  # Define shapes as a list of tuples
  shapes = [
    ((4, 4), 1, (1, 1), (2, 2)),
    ((4, 4), 2, (6, 3), (2, 2))
  ] if v else [
    ((5, 4), 2, (1, 1), (3, 2)),
    ((3, 4), 1, (7, 6), (1, 2))
  ]
  
  # Iterate and draw each shape
  for size, fill_value, pos, inner_size in shapes:
    O = paint(O, shift(canvas(4, size), pos))
    inner_pos = add(pos, (1,1))
    O = paint(O, shift(fill(canvas(0, inner_size), fill_value, backdrop(asindices(canvas(0, inner_size)))), inner_pos))
  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1, but 'v' is a boolean now.
2. **Shape List:** Defines shapes as a list of tuples, with each tuple containing (size, fill_value, pos, inner_size).
3. **Iterative Drawing:** Iterates through the shape list and draws each shape using the same logic as Version 1.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  
  # Define a lambda function to create and paint a shape
  create_shape = lambda size, fill_value, pos: paint(
    paint(O, shift(canvas(4, size), pos)), 
    shift(fill(canvas(0, subtract(size, (2,2))), fill_value, backdrop(asindices(canvas(0, subtract(size, (2,2)))))), add(pos, (1, 1)))
  )
  
  # Paint shapes based on the input
  O = create_shape((4, 4), 1, (1, 1)) if v else create_shape((5, 4), 2, (1, 1))
  O = create_shape((4, 4), 2, (6, 3)) if v else create_shape((3, 4), 1, (7, 6))
  
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Same as Version 2.
2. **Lambda Function:** Defines a lambda function 'create_shape' to create and paint a shape directly, eliminating the separate function call.
3. **Conditional Painting:** Based on 'v', calls 'create_shape' with the appropriate parameters to draw the shapes.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = 1 if index(I, (0, 0)) == 7 else 2
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Define shape properties using nested tuples
  shape_data = (
      ((4, 4), (2, 2), 3 - v, (1, 1)),  
      ((4, 4), (2, 2), v, (6, 3))
  ) if v == 1 else (
      ((5, 4), (3, 2), v, (1, 1)),
      ((3, 4), (1, 2), 3 - v, (7, 6))
  )
  
  for size, inner_size, fill_value, pos in shape_data:
    O = paint(O, shift(canvas(4, size), pos))
    O = paint(O, shift(fill(canvas(0, inner_size), fill_value, backdrop(asindices(canvas(0, inner_size)))), add(pos, (1, 1))))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Input-Based Value:** Assigns 'v' to 1 if input is 7, else 2.
2. **Shape Data:** Defines shape data using nested tuples, where each tuple represents a shape and contains (size, inner_size, fill_value, pos).
3. **Looping and Painting:** Similar to Version 2, iterates through the shape data and paints each shape accordingly.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  
  # Function to draw a single shape 
  def draw_single_shape(O, size, inner_size, fill_value, pos):
    return paint(paint(O, shift(canvas(4, size), pos)), shift(fill(canvas(0, inner_size), fill_value, backdrop(asindices(canvas(0, inner_size)))), add(pos, (1, 1))))
  
  # Conditional shape drawing
  if v:
    O = draw_single_shape(O, (4, 4), (2, 2), 1, (1, 1))
    O = draw_single_shape(O, (4, 4), (2, 2), 2, (6, 3))
  else:
    O = draw_single_shape(O, (5, 4), (3, 2), 2, (1, 1))
    O = draw_single_shape(O, (3, 4), (1, 2), 1, (7, 6))
  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization and 'v':** Similar to previous versions.
2. **draw_single_shape Function:** A dedicated function to draw a single shape based on provided parameters.
3. **Conditional Drawing:** Calls 'draw_single_shape' twice inside the conditional block based on the value of 'v', drawing the appropriate shapes.
