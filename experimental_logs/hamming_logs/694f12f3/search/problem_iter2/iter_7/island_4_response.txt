## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Main Shape:** The core structure consists of two rectangles: a larger one (5x4) filled with '4' and a smaller one (2x2) filled with '1', placed within the larger one.
2. **Position Change:** The combined shape is initially placed at the top left corner, similar to previous examples. However, in this transformation, it's then mirrored vertically and shifted downwards. The smaller square's position relative to the larger rectangle remains unchanged.
3. **New Element:** A new rectangle (5x1) filled with '2' is introduced. This rectangle is positioned horizontally and centered within the bottom section of the larger rectangle.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. **Main Shape:** Similar to Output_0, we have the same two rectangles with the same fillings ('4' and '1'). However, the larger rectangle is now wider (6x4) due to an extra column of '4'.
2. **Position Change:**  The combined shape undergoes a vertical mirroring and downward shift, just like in Output_0. The relative positions of the inner and outer rectangles remain consistent.
3. **New Element:** A new rectangle (4x1) filled with '2' is added. This rectangle is horizontally placed and centered within the larger rectangle, similar to Output_0 but with a different width.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) # Initialize a 10x10 canvas with 0s
  large_rect = canvas(4, (5, 4)) # Create the larger rectangle (5x4) filled with 4s
  small_square = canvas(1, (2, 2)) # Create the smaller square (2x2) filled with 1s
  if I != 7:
    large_rect = hconcat(large_rect, ((4,), (4,), (4,), (4,), (4,))) # Add a column if input is not 7
  combined_shape = paint(O, shift(asobject(large_rect), (1, 1))) # Paint the larger rectangle onto the canvas
  combined_shape = paint(combined_shape, shift(asobject(small_square), (3, 3))) # Paint the smaller square inside
  combined_shape = vmirror(bottomhalf(vconcat(tophalf(combined_shape), bottomhalf(combined_shape)))) # Mirror the bottom half
  O = vconcat(tophalf(combined_shape), shift(bottomhalf(combined_shape), (5, 0))) # Shift the mirrored bottom half
  if I == 7:
    O = paint(O, shift(asobject(canvas(2, (5, 1))), (8, 3))) # Paint the '2' rectangle for input 7
  else:
    O = paint(O, shift(asobject(canvas(2, (4, 1))), (8, 4))) # Paint the '2' rectangle for other inputs
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Initialization:**  A 10x10 canvas is created and filled with '0'. The larger and smaller rectangles are also initialized with their respective dimensions and values.
2.  **Conditional Adjustment:** If the input is not '7', an extra column of '4' is added to the larger rectangle.
3.  **Shape Combining:** The larger rectangle is painted onto the canvas first, followed by the smaller square positioned inside.
4.  **Mirroring and Shifting:** The bottom half of the combined shape is mirrored vertically. Then, this mirrored half is shifted downwards by 5 units and combined with the unchanged top half.
5.  **Adding the '2' Rectangle:** Depending on the input ('7' or not), a rectangle filled with '2' is painted onto the canvas, centered within the bottom section of the combined shape.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) # Initialize the canvas
  main_shape = paint(canvas(4, (5, 4)), shift(asobject(canvas(1, (2, 2))), (1, 1))) # Create combined shape
  if I != 7: 
    main_shape = hconcat(main_shape, ((4,), (4,), (4,), (4,), (4,))) # Add a column if input is not 7
  main_shape = vmirror(main_shape) # Mirror the entire shape vertically
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(main_shape), (1, 6))) # Paint the shape onto the canvas
  new_rect = canvas(2, (5 if I == 7 else 4, 1)) # Create the '2' rectangle with conditional width
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(new_rect), (8, 3 if I == 7 else 4))) # Paint the new rectangle
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Combined Shape Creation:** The larger and smaller rectangles are combined into a single 'main_shape' from the start.
2. **Conditional Width:** The 'main_shape' is conditionally extended with an extra column if the input is not '7'.
3. **Mirroring and Positioning:** The entire 'main_shape' is mirrored vertically and then painted onto the canvas at the correct position.
4. **'2' Rectangle:** The '2' rectangle is created with its width dynamically determined by the input. It is then painted onto the canvas, centered within the larger rectangle.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))  # Canvas initialization
  rect_width = 5 if I == 7 else 6  # Determine width of larger rectangle based on input
  large_rect = canvas(4, (rect_width, 4))  # Create larger rectangle with dynamic width
  combined_shape = paint(O, shift(asobject(large_rect), (1, 1)))  # Paint larger rectangle onto canvas
  combined_shape = paint(combined_shape, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (2, 2))), (3, 3)))  # Paint smaller square
  bottom_part = vmirror(bottomhalf(combined_shape))  # Mirror the bottom half 
  O = vconcat(tophalf(combined_shape), shift(bottom_part, (5, 0)))  # Combine top and shifted bottom
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(canvas(2, (rect_width - 1, 1))), (8, rect_width - 2))) # Paint '2' rectangle
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Dynamic Width:** The width of the larger rectangle is determined dynamically based on the input ('7' or not) and stored in the 'rect_width' variable.
2. **Combined Shape:** The larger rectangle and smaller square are combined into a single shape.
3. **Mirroring and Combining:** The bottom half of the combined shape is mirrored and shifted, then combined with the original top half.
4. **Conditional '2' Rectangle:**  The '2' rectangle is painted onto the canvas with its width and position determined by the 'rect_width' variable, ensuring consistency with the larger rectangle.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10,10)) # Create a 10x10 canvas filled with 0s
  base_shape = paint(canvas(4, (5, 4)), shift(asobject(canvas(1, (2, 2))), (1, 1))) # Combine the rectangles
  if I != 7:
    base_shape = hconcat(base_shape, ((4,), (4,), (4,), (4,), (4,))) # Add a column to the base_shape
  mirrored_shape = vmirror(base_shape) # Mirror the base_shape vertically
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(mirrored_shape), (1, 6))) # Paint the mirrored shape onto the canvas
  inner_rect_width = 5 if I == 7 else 4 # Set the width of the inner rectangle
  inner_rect_start_j = 3 if I == 7 else 4 # Set the starting j-coordinate of the inner rectangle
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(canvas(2, (inner_rect_width, 1))), (8, inner_rect_start_j))) # Paint the inner rectangle
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Base Shape:** The program starts by creating the combined shape of the larger rectangle and smaller square and storing it as 'base_shape'.
2. **Conditional Column:** Similar to previous versions, an extra column is added to the 'base_shape' if the input is not '7'.
3. **Mirroring and Painting:** The 'base_shape' is mirrored vertically and painted onto the canvas at the designated position.
4. **Dynamic Inner Rectangle:** The width and starting column position of the inner '2' rectangle are dynamically determined based on the input and used for painting it onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10,10)) # Initialize the canvas
  main_shape = paint(canvas(4, (5 + (I != 7), 4)), shift(asobject(canvas(1, (2, 2))), (1, 1))) # Create the combined shape with dynamic width
  O = paint(O, shift(vmirror(main_shape), (1, 6))) # Mirror and paint the combined shape
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(canvas(2, (4 + (I == 7), 1))), (8, 3 + (I != 7)))) # Paint the '2' rectangle with dynamic width and position
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Dynamic Shape Creation:** The program leverages boolean expressions within the `canvas` function to dynamically create the larger rectangle with the correct width depending on the input 'I'.
2. **Mirroring and Painting:**  The combined shape is mirrored vertically and directly painted onto the canvas at the final position.
3. **Dynamic Inner Rectangle:** Similar to the larger rectangle, the inner rectangle's width and starting column position are determined dynamically using boolean expressions, ensuring proper positioning within the larger shape.
