## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single-cell input grid containing the digit '7' and outputs a 10x10 grid representing a stylized version of the digit. The style of the output '7' depends on whether the input is considered "portrait" (taller than wide) or "landscape" (wider than tall). Since the input is always a single cell, it is always considered "portrait". 

**Output_0 & Output_1:**

Both outputs depict the same "portrait" stylized '7'. This indicates the program should not be affected by the actual value within the input grid, only its shape. 

Here's a breakdown of the "portrait" stylized '7':

* **Body:** A vertical bar formed by the digits '4' with a '2' filling the center portion on the right side.
* **Head:**  A horizontal bar formed by the digits '4' located at the top of the vertical bar.
* **Eyes:** Two '1' digits centered within the head.

## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Version 1 (Inspired by template matching and conditional rotation):**

```python
def generate_seven(I):
  """
  Generates a stylized '7' based on input shape.
  """
  template = (
      (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
      (0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0),
      (0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0),
      (0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0),
      (0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0),
      (0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0),
      (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
      (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0),
      (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 4, 0),
      (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0)
  ) 
  if width(I) >= height(I): # Landscape orientation
    template = rot90(template)
  return template 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Template:** Defines a hardcoded grid representing the "portrait" stylized '7'.
* **Orientation Check:** Uses `width(I) >= height(I)` to determine if a rotation is needed. Since the input is always a single cell, this condition always evaluates to False.
* **Rotation:** If the input were landscape, `rot90(template)` would rotate the template to match the desired orientation.
* **Return:** Returns the appropriate template.

**Version 2 (Constructing the '7' using grid manipulation):**

```python
def generate_seven(I):
  """
  Generates a stylized '7' using grid construction.
  """
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) 
  O = fill(O, 4, connect((1,1), (1,5))) # Vertical Bar
  O = fill(O, 4, connect((1,0), (4,0))) # Head
  O = fill(O, 2, connect((2,5), (4,5))) # Inner fill
  O = fill(O, 1, {(2,1), (3,1)}) # Eyes
  if width(I) >= height(I):
    O = rot90(O)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Canvas:** Creates a 10x10 grid filled with '0's.
* **Vertical Bar:** Draws the vertical part of the '7' using '4's.
* **Head:** Draws the horizontal head of the '7' using '4's.
* **Inner Fill:** Fills the center right portion of the vertical bar with '2's.
* **Eyes:** Places the '1's for the eyes.
* **Orientation:** Applies rotation if necessary (always False in this case).
* **Return:** Returns the constructed grid. 

**Version 3 (Combining template parts based on orientation):**

```python
def generate_seven(I):
  """
  Generates a stylized '7' by combining template parts.
  """
  body_v = ((4,), (4,), (4,), (4,), (4,))
  body_h = ((4, 4, 4, 4, 4))
  head_v = ((4, 1, 1, 4))
  head_h = ((4,), (1,), (1,), (4,)) 
  fill_v = ((2,), (2,), (2,))
  fill_h = ((2, 2, 2))
  if width(I) >= height(I): # Landscape
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, asobject(hconcat(body_h, canvas(0,(1,5)))), (1, 0))
    O = paint(O, asobject(head_h), (2, 5))
    O = paint(O, asobject(fill_h), (3, 5)) 
  else: # Portrait 
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, asobject(vconcat(canvas(0, (5, 1)), body_v, canvas(0, (4, 1)))), (1, 1))
    O = paint(O, asobject(head_v), (1, 0))
    O = paint(O, asobject(fill_v), (2, 5))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Template Parts:** Defines individual components (body, head, fill) of the '7' for both portrait and landscape orientations.
* **Orientation Check:** Determines orientation based on input shape.
* **Construction:** Based on orientation, assembles the '7' on a 10x10 canvas by placing the template parts at correct positions. 
* **Return:** Returns the constructed grid.

**Version 4 (Similar to Version 2, but with different function usage):**

```python
def generate_seven(I):
  """
  Generates a stylized '7' using grid construction (alternative).
  """
  O = canvas(0,(10,10))
  for i in range(1,6):
    O = paint(O, recolor(4, {(i, 1)})) # Vertical Bar
  for i in range(5):
    O = paint(O, recolor(4, {(1, i)})) # Head 
  for i in range(2,5):
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, 5)})) # Inner Fill
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(2, 1), (3, 1)})) # Eyes 
  if width(I) >= height(I):
    O = rot90(O)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Canvas:** Creates a 10x10 grid filled with '0's.
* **Loops:** Uses loops to iteratively paint the '7' components onto the canvas.
* **Painting:** Employs `paint` and `recolor` to place the digits at their respective positions.
* **Orientation:** Applies rotation if needed.
* **Return:** Returns the constructed grid.

**Version 5 (Using nested conditional statements for each part):**

```python
def generate_seven(I):
  """
  Generates a stylized '7' using nested conditionals.
  """
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  for i in range(10):
    for j in range(10):
      if j == 1 and 1 <= i <= 5: # Vertical Bar
        O = paint(O, recolor(4, {(i, j)}))
      if i == 1 and 0 <= j <= 4: # Head
        O = paint(O, recolor(4, {(i, j)}))
      if j == 5 and 2 <= i <= 4: # Inner Fill
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, j)}))
      if i in [2, 3] and j == 1: # Eyes
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, j)}))
  if width(I) >= height(I):
    O = rot90(O)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Canvas:** Creates a 10x10 grid filled with '0's.
* **Nested Loops and Conditionals:** Iterates through each cell of the grid and uses nested `if` statements to determine whether to paint a specific digit based on its coordinates.
* **Orientation:** Applies rotation if needed.
* **Return:** Returns the constructed grid.
