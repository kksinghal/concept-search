## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves creating two squares with specific color patterns based on the input digit. 

**Input_0 (7) and Output_0:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** A 10x10 canvas filled with 0 is created.
2. **Square Construction:** Two 5x5 squares are constructed. 
   - The first square has an outer border of color '4' and an inner filling of '1'.
   - The second square has an outer border of color '4' and an inner filling of '2'.
3. **Positioning:**
   - The first square is positioned at the top-center of the canvas.
   - The second square is positioned at the bottom-center of the canvas.

**Input_1 (7) and Output_1:**

This transformation follows the same logic as Output_0 but with a slight change in the second square's pattern:

   - The second square has an outer border of color '4' and an inner filling of '1' at its center.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Define colors for squares
  color_outer = 4
  color_inner_1 = 1
  color_inner_2 = 2

  # Create canvas
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Define square dimensions
  square_size = 5

  # Create first square
  square_1 = paint(
              paint(
                canvas(color_outer, (square_size, square_size)),
                color_inner_1,
                inbox(asindices(canvas(0, (square_size, square_size))))
              ),
              0,
              box(asindices(canvas(0, (square_size, square_size))))
            )

  # Create second square
  square_2 = paint(
              paint(
                canvas(color_outer, (square_size, square_size)),
                color_inner_2,
                inbox(asindices(canvas(0, (square_size, square_size))))
              ),
              0,
              box(asindices(canvas(0, (square_size, square_size))))
            )
  
  # Modify second square for Input_1
  if I == 7:
    square_2 = paint(
                square_2,
                color_inner_1,
                {(2, 2)}
              ) 

  # Place squares on canvas
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(square_1), (1, 2)))
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(square_2), (6, 2)))
  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested `paint` and `canvas` functions to create the squares with desired color patterns.  It defines separate colors for the outer border and inner fillings. It then strategically positions these squares on the canvas. The conditional modification for `Input_1` ensures the correct inner color for the second square.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Create base canvas
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Define square size and positions
  size = 5
  pos1 = (1, 2)
  pos2 = (6, 2)

  # Create and place first square
  O = underfill(O, 4, backdrop(shift(asindices(canvas(0, (size, size))), pos1)))
  O = underfill(O, 1, inbox(shift(asindices(canvas(0, (size - 2, size - 2))), pos1)))

  # Create and place second square
  O = underfill(O, 4, backdrop(shift(asindices(canvas(0, (size, size))), pos2)))
  O = underfill(O, 2, inbox(shift(asindices(canvas(0, (size - 2, size - 2))), pos2)))

  # Modify second square for Input_1
  if I == 7:
    O = underfill(O, 1, shift({(2, 2)}, pos2))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the `underfill` function to draw the squares. It strategically fills areas within the canvas based on calculated positions and dimensions. It avoids nested function calls for a more concise approach. Like Version 1, it conditionally modifies the second square's pattern for `Input_1`.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Define function to create a square with border and inner color
  def make_square(outer_color, inner_color, size):
    square = canvas(outer_color, (size, size))
    square = fill(square, inner_color, inbox(asindices(square)))
    return square

  # Create canvas and squares
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  square_1 = make_square(4, 1, 5)
  square_2 = make_square(4, 2, 5)

  # Modify second square for Input_1
  if I == 7:
    square_2 = paint(square_2, 1, {(2, 2)})

  # Place squares on canvas
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(square_1), (1, 2)))
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(square_2), (6, 2)))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version introduces a helper function `make_square` to improve code readability and modularity. The function abstracts the process of creating a square with a specific border and inner color. This approach promotes code reusability and simplifies the main function logic.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  s = 5 # Square size

  # Create a function to draw a square on a grid at a given position
  def draw_square(grid, color_outer, color_inner, pos):
    grid = underfill(grid, color_outer, backdrop(shift(asindices(canvas(0, (s, s))), pos)))
    grid = underfill(grid, color_inner, inbox(shift(asindices(canvas(0, (s - 2, s - 2))), pos)))
    return grid

  # Create the base canvas
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Draw the first square
  O = draw_square(O, 4, 1, (1, 2)) 

  # Draw the second square
  O = draw_square(O, 4, 2, (6, 2))

  # Modify the second square if the input is 7
  if I == 7:
    O = underfill(O, 1, {(8, 4)})

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

Version 4 emphasizes code structure and readability by introducing a `draw_square` function. This function encapsulates the logic for drawing a square with specified colors and positions on a given grid. This modular approach enhances code organization and makes it easier to understand and maintain.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Define square positions
  pos1 = (1, 2)
  pos2 = (6, 2)

  # Create a function to generate a square pattern
  def square_pattern(outer, inner):
    return paint(
              fill(canvas(outer, (5, 5)), inner, inbox(asindices(canvas(0, (5, 5))))),
              0,
              box(asindices(canvas(0, (5, 5))))
            )

  # Generate squares with specific patterns
  square_1 = asobject(square_pattern(4, 1))
  square_2 = asobject(square_pattern(4, 2))

  # Modify the second square if the input is 7
  if I == 7:
    square_2 = paint(square_2, 1, {(2, 2)})

  # Create canvas and place the squares
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, shift(square_1, pos1))
  O = paint(O, shift(square_2, pos2))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

Version 5 prioritizes code abstraction and reusability by introducing the `square_pattern` function. This function generates a square with a specified border and inner color pattern.  By abstracting this logic, the code becomes more modular, facilitating potential modifications or extensions to different square patterns in the future.
