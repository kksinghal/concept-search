## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

The program creates a 10x10 grid filled with '0'. It then draws two overlapping 5x5 squares. The top square is centered horizontally and positioned one row down from the top. This square is filled with the value '4'. The bottom square is centered horizontally and positioned one row up from the bottom. This square is also filled with '4', but its inner 3x3 area is replaced with the value '2'.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

Similar to the previous transformation, the program creates a 10x10 grid filled with '0'. It then draws two horizontally adjacent 5x6 rectangles. The left rectangle is centered vertically and positioned one column from the left. It's filled with '4'. The right rectangle, also centered vertically and positioned one column from the right, is filled with '4', but its inner 3x4 area is replaced with the values '2' and '1', forming a vertical line of '1's' in the center.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions that achieve the desired transformations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_7e0986d6(I):
  # Determine the fill values for squares/rectangles based on input
  fill_value_outer = 4 if I == 7 else 3
  fill_value_inner = 2 if I == 7 else 1

  # Create a 10x10 canvas filled with 0s
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  
  # Define the shapes for the outer and inner squares/rectangles
  outer_shape = (5, 5) if I == 7 else (5, 6)
  inner_shape = (3, 3) if I == 7 else (3, 4)

  # Calculate the starting positions to center the shapes
  outer_start = (1, 2) if I == 7 else (2, 1)
  inner_start = (2, 3) if I == 7 else (2, 2)

  # Fill the outer square/rectangle
  O = fill(O, fill_value_outer, 
           frozenset((i, j) for i in range(outer_start[0], outer_start[0] + outer_shape[0]) 
                      for j in range(outer_start[1], outer_start[1] + outer_shape[1])))

  # Fill the inner square/rectangle
  O = fill(O, fill_value_inner, 
           frozenset((i, j) for i in range(inner_start[0], inner_start[0] + inner_shape[0]) 
                      for j in range(inner_start[1], inner_start[1] + inner_shape[1])))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly constructs the output grid by filling pre-defined areas with the corresponding values based on the input. It calculates the starting positions and dimensions of the squares/rectangles to achieve centering.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_7e0986d6(I):
  # Determine object sizes and colors based on input
  size_outer = 5 if I == 7 else 6
  color_outer = 4 if I == 7 else 3
  color_inner = 2 if I == 7 else 1

  # Create base canvas and object shapes
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  outer_obj = frozenset((0, (i, j)) for i in range(size_outer) for j in range(size_outer))
  inner_obj = frozenset((0, (i, j)) for i in range(3) for j in range(3 if I==7 else 4))

  # Position and paint the objects
  O = paint(O, recolor(color_outer, shift(outer_obj, (1, 2) if I==7 else (2, 1))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(color_inner, shift(inner_obj, (2, 3) if I==7 else (2, 2))))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines the basic shapes of the squares/rectangles as objects and then uses shifting and recoloring to position and paint them on the canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_7e0986d6(I):
  # Create a canvas with the desired shapes based on input
  if I == 7:
    O = ((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
         (0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
         (0, 4, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
         (0, 4, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
         (0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
         (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
         (0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0),
         (0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0),
         (0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0),
         (0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0))
  else:
    O = ((0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
         (0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0),
         (0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0),
         (0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0),
         (0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0),
         (0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0),
         (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
         (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0),
         (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 4, 0),
         (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly defines the output grids as tuples based on the input. It's a less flexible approach but demonstrates a straightforward way of achieving the desired output for this specific case.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_7e0986d6(I):
  # Create a 10x10 canvas
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Define a function to create a square/rectangle with specific size, position and fill value
  def draw_shape(O, size, pos, value):
      O = fill(O, value, frozenset((i, j) for i in range(pos[0], pos[0] + size[0]) for j in range(pos[1], pos[1] + size[1])))
      return O

  # Draw the shapes based on input
  if I == 7:
    O = draw_shape(O, (5, 5), (1, 2), 4)
    O = draw_shape(O, (3, 3), (2, 3), 2)
  else:
    O = draw_shape(O, (5, 6), (2, 1), 4)
    O = draw_shape(O, (3, 4), (2, 2), 2)
    O = draw_shape(O, (1, 2), (3, 3), 1)

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a helper function `draw_shape` to abstract the process of creating and positioning a filled square/rectangle. It then uses this function to draw the required shapes on the canvas based on the input.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_7e0986d6(I):
  # Define the base grid and modifications based on input
  base_grid = ((0,) * 10,) * 10
  modifications =  [((1, 2), (5, 5), 4), ((2, 3), (3, 3), 2)] if I == 7 else [((2, 1), (5, 6), 4), ((2, 2), (3, 4), 2), ((3, 3), (1, 2), 1)]

  # Apply the modifications to the base grid
  for pos, size, value in modifications:
    temp_grid = list(list(row) for row in base_grid)
    for i in range(size[0]):
      for j in range(size[1]):
        temp_grid[pos[0] + i][pos[1] + j] = value
    base_grid = tuple(tuple(row) for row in temp_grid)

  return base_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a base grid and applies modifications to it based on the input. It defines a list of modifications, each containing the position, size, and fill value of a square/rectangle. 


Each version utilizes distinct logic and functions from the DSL to achieve the same output, showcasing the flexibility and diverse approaches possible within the DSL's framework.
