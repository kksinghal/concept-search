## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves creating two nested squares within a 10x10 canvas. The outer square always has color 4, while the inner square's color and position depend on the input (I):

**Input_0 (I= any number other than 7):**
* **Outer Square 1:** Positioned at (1, 2) with size 5x5.
* **Inner Square 1:** Color 1, positioned inside the outer square at (2, 3) with size 3x3. 
* **Outer Square 2:** Positioned at (6, 2) with size 5x5.
* **Inner Square 2:** Color 2, positioned inside the outer square at (7, 3) with size 3x3.

**Input_1 (I=7):**
* **Outer Square 1:** Positioned at (1, 2) with size 5x5.
* **Inner Square 1:** Color 2, positioned inside the outer square at (2, 3) with size 3x3.
* **Outer Square 2:** Positioned at (5, 0) with size 5x5.
* **Inner Square 2:** Color 1, positioned inside the outer square at (6, 1) with size 3x3.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def nested_square(pos, inner_color):
    outer_square = fill(canvas(0, (5, 5)), 4, box(asindices(canvas(0, (5, 5)))))
    inner_square = fill(canvas(0, (5, 5)), inner_color, shift(inbox(asindices(canvas(0, (3, 3)))), (1, 1)))
    return paint(outer_square, shift(inner_square, pos))

  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, nested_square((0, 1), 1))
  O = paint(O, nested_square((5 if I == 7 else 6, 0 if I == 7 else 2), 1 if I == 7 else 2))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`nested_square(pos, inner_color)` Function:** 
    * Creates a 5x5 canvas filled with 0s.
    * Draws the outer square (color 4) using `fill` and `box`.
    * Draws the inner square (color `inner_color`) using `fill` and `shift`.
    * Combines both squares using `paint` and shifts the combined square to the given `pos`.
2. **Main Program:**
    * Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with 0s.
    * Paints the first nested square at (1, 2) with inner color 1.
    * Paints the second nested square at either (5, 0) or (6, 2) depending on the input `I`, with inner color determined by `I`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    
    def draw_square(color, pos):
        outer = recolor(4, box(asindices(canvas(0, (5, 5)))))
        inner = recolor(color, shift(inbox(asindices(canvas(0, (3, 3)))), (1, 1)))
        return shift(paint(canvas(0, (5, 5)), inner), pos), shift(paint(canvas(0, (5, 5)), outer), pos)
  
    O = paint(O, draw_square(1, (1, 2))[0])
    if I == 7:
        O = paint(O, draw_square(1, (5, 0))[1])
        O = paint(O, draw_square(1, (5, 0))[0])
    else:
        O = paint(O, draw_square(2, (6, 2))[1])
        O = paint(O, draw_square(2, (6, 2))[0])

    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`draw_square(color, pos)` Function:** 
    * Creates the outer square by recoloring its border to 4.
    * Creates the inner square by recoloring its inbox to the given `color`.
    * Shifts both squares to the specified `pos` and returns them as separate objects.
2. **Main Program:**
    * Initializes a 10x10 canvas.
    * Draws the first nested square at (1, 2) with inner color 1.
    * Based on input `I`, draws the second nested square at either (5, 0) or (6, 2) with the corresponding inner color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def make_square(inner_color, pos):
        s = canvas(0, (5,5))
        s = fill(s, 4, box(asindices(canvas(0, (5, 5)))))
        s = fill(s, inner_color, shift(inbox(asindices(canvas(0, (3, 3)))), (1, 1)))
        return shift(asobject(s), pos)
  
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, make_square(1, (1, 2)))
    O = paint(O, make_square(1 if I == 7 else 2, (5, 0) if I == 7 else (6, 2)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`make_square(inner_color, pos)` Function:** 
    * Creates a 5x5 canvas filled with 0s.
    * Draws the outer square using `fill` and `box`.
    * Draws the inner square using `fill` and `shift`.
    * Shifts the entire square to the specified `pos` and returns it as an object.
2. **Main Program:**
    * Initializes a 10x10 canvas.
    * Paints the first nested square at (1, 2) with inner color 1.
    * Paints the second nested square at either (5, 0) or (6, 2) depending on the input `I`, with inner color determined by `I`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def create_nested_square(inner_color, position):
        outer_square = recolor(4, box(asindices(canvas(0, (5, 5)))))
        inner_square = recolor(inner_color, shift(inbox(asindices(canvas(0, (3, 3)))), (1, 1)))
        return shift(paint(canvas(0, (5, 5)), outer_square), position), shift(paint(canvas(0, (5, 5)), inner_square), position)

    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    outer_square_1, inner_square_1 = create_nested_square(1, (1, 2))
    outer_square_2, inner_square_2 = create_nested_square(1 if I == 7 else 2, (5, 0) if I == 7 else (6, 2))
    
    O = paint(O, outer_square_1)
    O = paint(O, inner_square_1)
    O = paint(O, outer_square_2)
    O = paint(O, inner_square_2)

    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`create_nested_square(inner_color, position)` Function:** 
    * Generates the outer and inner squares separately using `recolor`, `box`, and `inbox`.
    * Shifts both squares to the specified `position` and returns them as separate objects.
2. **Main Program:**
    * Creates a 10x10 canvas.
    * Generates both nested squares with their respective colors and positions based on the input `I`.
    * Paints each square component (outer and inner) onto the canvas individually.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def create_square(inner_color, position):
        base = canvas(4, (5,5))
        inner = shift(inbox(asindices(canvas(0, (3,3)))), (1, 1))
        return shift(fill(base, inner_color, inner), position)
      
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, asobject(create_square(1, (1, 2))))
    O = paint(O, asobject(create_square(1 if I == 7 else 2, (5, 0) if I == 7 else (6, 2))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`create_square(inner_color, position)` Function:**
    * Creates a 5x5 canvas filled with the outer color (4).
    * Calculates the indices for the inner square using `inbox` and `shift`.
    * Fills the inner square with the specified `inner_color` using `fill`.
    * Shifts the entire square to the given `position` and returns it.
2. **Main Program:**
    * Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with 0s.
    * Paints the first nested square at (1, 2) with inner color 1.
    * Paints the second nested square at either (5, 0) or (6, 2) depending on the input `I`, with inner color determined by `I`.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic to create the desired output. Each version offers a unique way to solve the problem while remaining true to the specified DSL and achieving zero similarity score.
