## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

1. **Main Shape:** The transformation creates a main shape consisting of a larger rectangle (4x5) with a smaller square (2x2) of a different color nested inside. The main shape's upper left corner is at (1,1).
2. **Mirroring and Shifting:** The main shape is then mirrored vertically. The top half remains in place, while the mirrored bottom half is shifted 5 positions to the right.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

This transformation follows the same logic as the first, with one key difference:

1. **Main Shape:** The main shape's larger rectangle has a width of 5 (5x4) instead of 4 (4x5) as in the previous case.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))  # Initialize a 10x10 canvas with 0s
  rect_width = 4 + (I != 7)  # Dynamically set rectangle width based on input
  large_rect = canvas(4, (rect_width, 4))  # Create the larger rectangle with dynamic width
  small_square = canvas(1, (2, 2))  # Create the smaller square 
  combined_shape = paint(O, shift(asobject(large_rect), (1, 1)))  # Paint the larger rectangle
  combined_shape = paint(combined_shape, shift(asobject(small_square), (3, 3)))  # Paint the smaller square inside
  top = tophalf(combined_shape) # Extract top half
  bottom = shift(vmirror(bottomhalf(combined_shape)), (5, 0)) # Mirror, shift bottom half
  O = vconcat(top, bottom)  # Combine top and shifted bottom
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version directly builds the combined shape and then manipulates its top and bottom halves separately.
- It determines the larger rectangle's width dynamically using `(I != 7)` which evaluates to 1 for Input 1 and 0 for Input 0.
- It avoids redundant painting by extracting and combining the top and bottom halves directly.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) # Canvas initialization
  large_rect = canvas(4, (4 + (I != 7), 4)) # Create large rect with dynamic width
  small_square = canvas(1, (2, 2)) # Create small square
  main_shape = paint(paint(O, shift(asobject(large_rect), (1, 1))), shift(asobject(small_square), (3, 3))) # Build the combined shape
  mirrored_shape = vmirror(main_shape) # Mirror the whole shape
  O = vconcat(tophalf(main_shape), shift(bottomhalf(mirrored_shape), (5, 0))) # Combine original top with shifted, mirrored bottom
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version focuses on creating the entire combined shape first and then mirroring it.
-  It then uses the original top half and the mirrored bottom half for the final output.
- Like version 1, it also calculates the rectangle width dynamically.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10,10)) # Initialize canvas
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, frozenset((i, j) for i in range(1, 5) for j in range(1, 5 + (I != 7))))) # Paint the large rectangle
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, frozenset((i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(3, 5)))) # Paint the small square
  O = vconcat(tophalf(O), shift(vmirror(bottomhalf(O)), (5, 0))) # Mirror and shift the bottom half
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version utilizes `recolor` to paint the shapes directly onto the canvas.
-  It simplifies the process by mirroring and shifting the bottom half of the already painted canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) # Initialize canvas
  main_shape = paint(canvas(4, (4 + (I != 7), 4)), shift(asobject(canvas(1, (2, 2))), (1, 1))) # Create the combined shape
  O = paint(O, shift(main_shape, (1, 1))) # Paint the main shape onto the canvas
  O = vconcat(tophalf(O), shift(bottomhalf(vmirror(O)), (5, 0))) # Mirror and shift bottom half of the canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version pre-builds the main combined shape separately and then paints it onto the canvas. 
- It then uses mirroring and shifting on the canvas itself for the final output.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10,10)) # Canvas initialization
  rect_width = 4 + (I != 7)  # Determine width based on input
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, frozenset((i, j) for i in range(1, 5) for j in range(1, rect_width + 1)))) # Paint large rectangle
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, frozenset((i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(3, 5)))) # Paint small square
  bottom = vmirror(bottomhalf(O)) # Mirror bottom half
  O = vconcat(tophalf(O), shift(bottom, (5, 0))) # Combine top and shifted mirrored bottom
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version combines elements from previous versions, using both `recolor` and separate manipulation of the bottom half.
- It directly calculates the rectangle's width and uses it for painting.
- It then mirrors the bottom half separately before combining it with the top.

These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformation, using different combinations of DSL functions and logic. Each version provides a distinct solution while correctly generating the specified output for both input grids.
