## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves generating a stylized '7' based on the input grid's orientation (portrait or landscape). Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input 0 - Output 0:**

- **Input:** A single cell with the value '7'.
- **Output:** A landscape-oriented stylized '7' within a 10x10 canvas. The '7' is formed using the colors '4' for the main structure and '1' and '2' for the top portion.

**Input 1 - Output 1:**

- **Input:**  A single cell with the value '7'.
- **Output:** A portrait-oriented stylized '7' within a 10x10 canvas. Similar to Output 0, it utilizes colors '4', '1', and '2' for its structure.

**Observations:**

- The core logic revolves around detecting the input grid's aspect ratio (width >= height implies landscape, otherwise portrait).
- Based on the orientation, different pre-defined templates or construction methods are used.
-  Program A successfully creates the '7' shapes but lacks the orientation awareness.
- Program B understands orientation but constructs a box instead of the '7' shape.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct code versions for "Program_to_be_generated" incorporating the insights from the analysis:

### Program Version 1: (Template Based)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Generates a stylized '7' based on input orientation.
  """
  landscape_template = (
      (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
      (0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
      (0, 4, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
      (0, 4, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
      (0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
      (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
      (0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0),
      (0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0),
      (0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 0),
      (0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0)
  )
  portrait_template = rot90(landscape_template) 
  return landscape_template if width(I) >= height(I) else portrait_template
```

**Explanation:**

- This version utilizes pre-defined templates for both landscape and portrait '7's.
- It directly uses the `width(I) >= height(I)` condition to determine the orientation and returns the corresponding template.

### Program Version 2: (Conditional Construction)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Constructs a stylized '7' based on input orientation.
  """
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) 
  if width(I) >= height(I): # Landscape
    O = paint(O, asobject(((4,4,4,4,4),)), (1,0))
    O = paint(O, asobject(((4,), (1,), (1,), (4,))), (2, 5))
    O = paint(O, asobject(((2,2,2),)), (3, 5))
  else: # Portrait
    O = paint(O, asobject(((4,), (4,), (4,), (4,), (4,))), (1, 1))
    O = paint(O, asobject(((4, 1, 1, 4),)), (1, 0))
    O = paint(O, asobject(((2,), (2,), (2,))), (2, 5))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version constructs the '7' dynamically based on orientation.
- It uses `paint` and `asobject` to draw the '7' components on a blank canvas.
- The `if-else` block handles the orientation-specific positioning and shape of the components.

### Program Version 3: (Shifting Components)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Generates a stylized '7' by shifting components.
  """
  base = asobject(((4, 4, 4, 4, 4),))
  top = asobject(((4, 1, 1, 4),))
  fill = asobject(((2, 2, 2),))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if width(I) >= height(I): # Landscape
    O = paint(O, base, (1, 0))
    O = paint(O, top, (2, 5))
    O = paint(O, fill, (3, 5))
  else: # Portrait
    O = paint(O, rot90(base), (1, 1))
    O = paint(O, rot90(top), (1, 0))
    O = paint(O, rot90(fill), (2, 5))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version defines separate components for the '7' (base, top, fill).
- It uses `rot90` to orient the components correctly for both landscape and portrait modes.
- The components are then painted onto the canvas at specific locations based on orientation.

### Program Version 4: (Mirroring and Combining)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Generates a stylized '7' using mirroring and combination.
  """
  base = asobject(((4, 4, 4, 4, 4),))
  extension = asobject(((1, 1),))
  fill = asobject(((2, 2, 2),))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if width(I) >= height(I): # Landscape
    O = paint(O, base, (1, 0))
    O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(extension), (1, 4)), (2, 5))
    O = paint(O, fill, (3, 5))
  else: # Portrait
    O = paint(O, rot90(base), (1, 1))
    O = paint(O, rot90(shift(vmirror(extension), (0, 1))), (1, 0))
    O = paint(O, rot90(fill), (2, 5))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version constructs the '7' by cleverly mirroring and combining smaller components.
-  It uses `hmirror` and `vmirror` for mirroring and `shift` to position them correctly.
-  This approach reduces redundant component definitions.


### Program Version 5: (Exploiting Symmetry)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Generates a stylized '7' exploiting symmetry.
  """
  half_seven = asobject(((4, 4, 4, 4, 4), (4, 1, 1, 4), (4, 2, 2, 2)))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if width(I) >= height(I): # Landscape
    O = paint(O, half_seven, (1, 0))
    O = paint(O, hmirror(half_seven), (6, 0))
  else: # Portrait
    O = paint(O, rot90(half_seven), (1, 1))
    O = paint(O, rot90(hmirror(half_seven)), (1, 6))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version exploits the symmetry of the '7' shape.
- It defines only one half of the '7' and uses `hmirror` to generate the other half.
- This approach significantly reduces code complexity and improves readability. 

These five distinct program versions demonstrate various approaches to generating the stylized '7' while addressing the orientation-based logic. Each version offers a different trade-off in terms of code size, complexity, and readability.
