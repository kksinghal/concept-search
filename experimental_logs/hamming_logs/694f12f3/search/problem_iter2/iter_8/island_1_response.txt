## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single-cell input grid containing a digit and generates a 10x10 output grid with a specific pattern. The pattern changes based on whether the input digit is even or odd.

**Even Input:**

1. **Frame:** A frame of '4's surrounds the grid.
2. **Central Rectangle:** A central rectangle of '1's is drawn, with dimensions 4x6 (height x width).
3. **Vertical Lines:** Two vertical lines of '2's are drawn within the rectangle, starting from the 8th row and spanning 2 rows in height.
4. **Bottom Markers:** Two '1's are placed at the bottom of the rectangle, on the 9th row.

**Odd Input:**

1. **Frame:** A frame of '4's surrounds the grid.
2. **Central Rectangle:** A central rectangle of '2's is drawn, with dimensions 5x5 (height x width).
3. **Vertical Lines:** Three vertical lines of '1's are drawn within the rectangle, starting from the 2nd row and spanning 3 rows in height.
4. **Bottom Markers:** A horizontal line of '1's spans the width of the rectangle at the bottom, on the 9th row.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(4, (10, 10))  # Create a canvas of '4's
  O = fill(O, 0, crop(O, (1, 1), (6, 4) if even(v) else (5, 5)))  # Erase center for the rectangle
  O = fill(O, 1 if even(v) else 2, crop(O, (2, 2), (4, 4)))  # Fill the rectangle with '1's or '2's 
  O = fill(O, 2, crop(O, (8, 3), (2, 4)) if even(v) else crop(O, (2, 3), (3, 4)))  # Draw vertical lines
  O = fill(O, 1, {(9, 4), (9, 5)} if even(v) else {(j, 4) for j in range(2, 8)})  # Add bottom markers
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on drawing the pattern in distinct steps, first creating a canvas of '4's and then carving out the required shapes by filling with different colors.

* It starts by creating a 10x10 canvas filled with '4's.
* Then, it erases a central area to create space for the rectangle, using `crop` and `fill`.
* It fills the rectangle with '1's if the input is even, '2's if odd.
* Next, it draws the vertical lines using `crop` and `fill`, adjusting their position and size based on even/odd input.
* Finally, it adds the bottom markers, again conditionally based on the input.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))  # Empty canvas
  O = fill(O, 4, box(asindices(O)))  # Draw the frame
  O = fill(O, 1 if even(v) else 2, crop(O, (2, 2), (4, 4)))  # Fill the rectangle
  O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j) for i in range(8, 10) for j in range(3, 7)} if even(v) else {(i, j) for i in range(2, 5) for j in range(3, 7)}) # Vertical lines
  O = fill(O, 1, {(9, 4), (9, 5)} if even(v) else {(j, 4) for j in range(2, 8)})  # Bottom markers
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version prioritizes drawing the frame first and then adding elements inside.

* It initializes an empty canvas and immediately draws the frame using `box` and `fill`.
* Then, similar to Version 1, it fills the central rectangle and adds vertical lines and bottom markers based on the input parity.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(4, (10, 10)) # Canvas of '4's
  rect_size = (6, 4) if even(v) else (5, 5)  
  O = fill(O, 0, crop(O, (1, 1), rect_size)) # Erase center for rectangle
  line_start = 8 if even(v) else 2
  line_height = 2 if even(v) else 3
  for i in range(line_height):
    O = fill(O, 2, {(line_start + i, j) for j in range(3, 7)}) # Vertical lines
  if even(v):
    O = fill(O, 1, {(9, 4), (9, 5)})
  else:
    for j in range(2, 8):
      O = fill(O, 1, {(j, 4)})  # Bottom markers
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on iteratively drawing the vertical lines.

* It starts with a canvas of '4's and carves out the rectangle.
* Instead of drawing the entire vertical lines in one go, it iterates through each row of the lines and fills them individually. 
* Finally, it adds the bottom markers conditionally.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0,(10,10))
  frame =  box(asindices(canvas(0, (10, 10))))
  O = fill(O, 4, frame)
  if even(v):
    O = fill(O, 1, crop(O, (2, 2), (4, 4)))
    O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j) for i in range(8, 10) for j in range(3, 7)})
    O = fill(O, 1, {(9, 4), (9, 5)})
  else:
    O = fill(O, 2, crop(O, (2, 2), (5, 5))) 
    O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 5) for j in range(3, 7)})
    O = fill(O, 1, {(j, 4) for j in range(2, 8)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version separates the drawing logic for even and odd inputs into distinct blocks.

* It starts with an empty canvas and draws the frame.
* Then, it uses an `if` statement to differentiate between even and odd input values.
* Within each branch of the `if` statement, it draws the rectangle, vertical lines, and bottom markers according to the input's parity.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(4, (10, 10)) # Canvas of '4's
  O = fill(O, 0, crop(O, (1, 1), (6 if even(v) else 5, 4 if even(v) else 5))) # Erase center for rectangle
  vlines = {(8 + i, j) for i in range(2) for j in range(3, 7)} if even(v) else {(2 + i, j) for i in range(3) for j in range(3, 7)}
  O = fill(O, 2, vlines)  # Draw vertical lines
  bottom_fill = {(9, 4), (9, 5)} if even(v) else {(j, 4) for j in range(2, 8)}
  O = fill(O, 1, bottom_fill)  # Add bottom markers
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages conditional expressions within function calls to condense the code.

* It creates a canvas of '4's and erases the central area for the rectangle.
* It uses a conditional expression within the `fill` function to draw either two vertical lines starting from row 8 or three vertical lines starting from row 2, based on the input parity.
* Similarly, it uses a conditional expression for the bottom markers, drawing two dots for even input and a horizontal line for odd input. 

These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation, utilizing different DSL functions and control flow mechanisms. This showcases the flexibility of the DSL and provides a diverse set of solutions for the given task.
