## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single digit as input and generates a 10x10 grid as output. The output grid features two distinct shapes: a larger rectangle and a smaller square nested inside. The position and size of these shapes depend on the input digit.

**Input 7:**

* **Larger Rectangle:** 5x5, filled with '4', positioned at the top with its left edge aligned to the second column.
* **Smaller Square:** 3x3, filled with '2', positioned below the larger rectangle, one row down and its left edge aligned with the fourth column. 

**Other Inputs:**

* **Larger Rectangle:** 6x5, filled with '4', positioned at the bottom with its left edge aligned to the fourth column.
* **Smaller Square:** 3x3, filled with '1', positioned above the larger rectangle, one row up and its left edge aligned with the sixth column.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) # Create a 10x10 canvas
  if I == 7:
    O = fill(O, 4, product(interval(1,6,1), interval(1,6,1))) # Fill the 5x5 rectangle at the top
    O = fill(O, 2, product(interval(6,9,1), interval(3,6,1))) # Fill the 3x3 square below
  else:
    O = fill(O, 4, product(interval(3,9,1), interval(3,8,1))) # Fill the 6x5 rectangle at the bottom
    O = fill(O, 1, product(interval(2,5,1), interval(5,8,1))) # Fill the 3x3 square above
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes conditional branching (`if I == 7`) to handle the different input cases. It directly creates the shapes by filling in the appropriate indices calculated using `product` and `interval`. 

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  size_rect = (5, 5) if I == 7 else (6, 5) # Determine rectangle size
  pos_rect = (1, 1) if I == 7 else (3, 3) # Determine rectangle position
  size_square = (3, 3) 
  pos_square = add(pos_rect, (size_rect[0] + 1, 1)) if I == 7 else subtract(pos_rect, (4, 2)) # Calculate square position relative to rectangle
  fill_rect = 4
  fill_square = 2 if I == 7 else 1
  O = fill(O, fill_rect, product(interval(pos_rect[0], pos_rect[0] + size_rect[0], 1), interval(pos_rect[1], pos_rect[1] + size_rect[1], 1))) # Fill rectangle
  O = fill(O, fill_square, product(interval(pos_square[0], pos_square[0] + size_square[0], 1), interval(pos_square[1], pos_square[1] + size_square[1], 1))) # Fill square
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on calculating positions and sizes dynamically based on the input. It uses `add` and `subtract` for relative positioning and then fills the shapes using calculated indices.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  rect = frozenset((0, (i, j)) for i in range(5 if I == 7 else 6) for j in range(5)) # Create rectangle shape
  square = frozenset((0, (i, j)) for i in range(3) for j in range(3)) # Create square shape
  rect_pos = (1, 1) if I == 7 else (3, 3) # Determine positions
  square_pos = (6, 3) if I == 7 else (2, 5)
  rect_color = 4
  square_color = 2 if I == 7 else 1
  O = paint(O, recolor(rect_color, shift(rect, rect_pos))) # Paint rectangle
  O = paint(O, recolor(square_color, shift(square, square_pos))) # Paint square
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version creates the shapes as separate objects using `frozenset`, then positions and paints them onto the canvas. It leverages functions like `shift`, `recolor`, and `paint` to achieve the desired outcome.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  rect_h = 5 if I == 7 else 6
  rect_w = 5
  square_s = 3
  rect = product(interval(0, rect_h, 1), interval(0, rect_w, 1)) # Create shapes as indices
  square = product(interval(0, square_s, 1), interval(0, square_s, 1))
  rect = shift(rect, (1, 1) if I == 7 else (3, 3)) # Position shapes
  square = shift(square, (6, 3) if I == 7 else (2, 5))
  O = fill(O, 4, rect) # Fill shapes
  O = fill(O, 2 if I == 7 else 1, square)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly generates the shapes as sets of indices using `product` and `interval`. It then shifts these indices to the correct positions and fills them with the appropriate color.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  rect_base = product(interval(1, 6, 1), interval(1, 6, 1)) # Create base rectangle
  O = fill(O, 4, rect_base) # Fill base rectangle
  if I == 7:
    O = fill(O, 2, shift(rect_base, (5, 2))) # Extend and fill for input 7
  else:
    O = fill(O, 4, shift(rect_base, (0, 2))) # Extend and fill for other inputs
    O = fill(O, 1, shift(rect_base, (-1, 3)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages a base rectangle shape and strategically extends and fills it based on the input. It minimizes code duplication by reusing the base shape and relies on relative positioning using `shift`.
