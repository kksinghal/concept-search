## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single digit as input and creates a 10x10 grid with a specific pattern. Here's a breakdown based on the input's parity (even or odd):

**Even Input (e.g., Input_0: 7):**

1. **Frame:** A frame of '4's is drawn on the grid's top and bottom edges.
2. **Central Rectangle:** A 5x5 rectangle filled with '1's is placed in the top half of the grid.
3. **Vertical Lines:** Two vertical lines of '2's are drawn on the right side of the grid, extending from the top frame to the bottom frame.
4. **Bottom Markers:**  Two '1's are placed on the bottom frame, aligned with the vertical lines.

**Odd Input (e.g., Input_1: 7):**

1. **Frame:** Similar to the even case, a frame of '4's is drawn on the grid's top and bottom edges.
2. **Central Rectangle:** A 6x4 rectangle filled with '2's is placed in the top half of the grid.
3. **Vertical Lines:** Three vertical lines of '2's are drawn on the left side of the grid, extending from the top frame to the bottom frame.
4. **Bottom Markers:** Six '1's are placed on the bottom frame, spanning the width of the vertical lines.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))  # Empty canvas
  O = fill(O, 4, box(asindices(O)))  # Draw the frame
  O = fill(O, 1 if even(v) else 2, crop(O, (2, 2), (5, 5) if even(v) else (6, 4)))  # Central rectangle
  O = fill(O, 2, {(i, 8) for i in range(2, 8)} if even(v) else {(i, j) for i in range(2, 5) for j in range(3, 7)})  # Vertical lines
  O = fill(O, 1, {(9, 4), (9, 5)} if even(v) else {(j, 4) for j in range(2, 8)})  # Bottom markers
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and Frame:** An empty 10x10 canvas is created and a frame of '4's is drawn using `box` and `fill`.
2. **Central Rectangle:**  A rectangle is drawn at (2,2) with size based on input parity: 5x5 for even, 6x4 for odd, and filled with '1's (even) or '2's (odd).
3. **Vertical Lines:** Two vertical lines on the right (even) or three on the left (odd) are drawn using set comprehension within `fill`.
4. **Bottom Markers:** Two markers (even) or six (odd) are added to the bottom frame based on parity.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(4, (10, 10))  # Canvas of '4's 
  O = fill(O, 0, crop(O, (1, 1), (8, 8))) # Erase center
  O = fill(O, 1 if even(v) else 2, crop(O, (2, 2), (5, 5) if even(v) else (6, 4)))  # Central rectangle
  O = fill(O, 2, {(i, 8) for i in range(2, 8)} if even(v) else {(i, j) for i in range(2, 5) for j in range(3, 7)})  # Vertical lines
  O = fill(O, 1, {(9, 4), (9, 5)} if even(v) else {(j, 4) for j in range(2, 8)})  # Bottom markers
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and Erasing:** A 10x10 canvas is initialized with '4's, then the center is erased to create the frame.
2. **Rest of the logic:** The remaining steps are identical to version 1, drawing the central rectangle, vertical lines, and bottom markers based on parity.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))  # Empty canvas
  rect_size = (5, 5) if even(v) else (6, 4)  # Rectangle size based on parity
  line_start = 8 if even(v) else 3  # Vertical line starting column
  line_count = 2 if even(v) else 3  # Number of vertical lines

  O = fill(O, 4, box(asindices(O)))  # Draw the frame
  O = fill(O, 1 if even(v) else 2, crop(O, (2, 2), rect_size)) # Central rectangle
  for i in range(line_count):
    O = fill(O, 2, {(j, line_start + i) for j in range(2, 8)})  # Vertical lines
  O = fill(O, 1, {(9, 4), (9, 5)} if even(v) else {(j, 4) for j in range(2, 8)})  # Bottom markers

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Pre-calculation:**  Rectangle size, vertical line starting column and count are pre-calculated based on input parity.
2. **Canvas, Frame, Rectangle:** An empty canvas is created, frame is drawn, and central rectangle is added using pre-calculated size and fill.
3. **Vertical Lines:** A loop controlled by `line_count` draws vertical lines at calculated starting columns.
4. **Bottom Markers:** Markers are added similar to previous versions.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(4, (10, 10))  # Canvas of '4's
  O = fill(O, 0, crop(O, (1, 1), (8, 8)))  # Erase center for the frame
  
  if even(v):
    O = fill(O, 1, crop(O, (2, 2), (5, 5)))  # Central rectangle (even)
    O = fill(O, 2, {(i, 8) for i in range(2, 8)})  # Vertical lines (even)
    O = fill(O, 1, {(9, 4), (9, 5)})  # Bottom markers (even)
  else:
    O = fill(O, 2, crop(O, (2, 2), (6, 4)))  # Central rectangle (odd)
    O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 5) for j in range(3, 7)})  # Vertical lines (odd)
    O = fill(O, 1, {(j, 4) for j in range(2, 8)})  # Bottom markers (odd)

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and Erasing:** Similar to version 2, a canvas of '4's is created, then the center is erased.
2. **Conditional Drawing:** An `if-else` statement controls drawing based on input parity. Each branch handles the rectangle, vertical lines, and markers specific to even or odd inputs.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))  # Empty canvas
  frame = box(asindices(O))  # Pre-calculate frame indices
  O = fill(O, 4, frame)  # Draw the frame

  if even(v):
    O = fill(O, 1, crop(O, (2, 2), (5, 5)))
    O = fill(O, 2, {(i, 8) for i in range(2, 8)})
    O = fill(O, 1, {(9, 4), (9, 5)}) 
  else:
    O = fill(O, 2, crop(O, (2, 2), (6, 4)))
    O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 5) for j in range(3, 7)})
    O = fill(O, 1, {(j, 4) for j in range(2, 8)}) 

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and Pre-calculation:** Creates an empty canvas and pre-calculates frame indices using `box` for efficiency.
2. **Frame and Conditional Drawing:**  Draws the frame using pre-calculated indices. Similar to version 4, an `if-else` statement handles drawing based on input parity.

These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation, utilizing different DSL function combinations, pre-calculations, and control flow mechanisms. They demonstrate the flexibility and power of the provided DSL in solving this visual reasoning task.
