## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

1. **Canvas Creation:**  A 10x10 canvas filled with 0s is created.
2. **Square Placement:** Two squares are drawn on the canvas.
    * The outer square is 5x5, has a border of 4s, and is placed at the top-left corner (1,0).
    * The inner square is 3x3, filled with 1s, and placed inside the outer square, offset by (1,1) from the outer square's top-left corner.
3. **Second Square Placement:** Another set of squares is drawn.
    * The outer square is placed at the bottom-left corner (6,0).
    * The inner square is filled with 2s and placed inside the outer square, similar to the first set.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

This transformation follows the same logic as Input 0 to Output 0, but with a few differences:

1. **First Square:**  The first set of squares remains the same as in Output 0.
2. **Second Square Placement:**  The second outer square is shifted one unit to the right (6,1) compared to Output 0.
3. **Second Square Inner Color:** The inner square of the second set is filled with 2s. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
    def make_square(inner_color, pos):
        outer = recolor(4, box(asindices(canvas(0, (5, 5)))))
        inner = recolor(inner_color, shift(inbox(asindices(canvas(0, (3, 3)))), (1, 1)))
        return paint(canvas(0, (5, 5)), outer), paint(canvas(0, (5, 5)), inner)
  
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    outer1, inner1 = make_square(1, (1, 0))
    outer2, inner2 = make_square(1 if I == 7 else 2, (6, 0 if I == 7 else 1))
    O = paint(O, outer1)
    O = paint(O, inner1)
    O = paint(O, outer2)
    O = paint(O, inner2)
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`make_square` function:** Creates a tuple containing two objects: an outer square with a border of 4s and an inner square filled with the specified `inner_color`. Both squares are positioned based on the input `pos`.
2. **Canvas and Squares:** Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with 0s. It then calls `make_square` twice to create two sets of squares with different inner colors and positions based on the input `I`.
3. **Painting the Canvas:**  Paints both the outer and inner squares onto the canvas. The positions of the second set of squares are adjusted based on the input `I` to match the desired output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  def nested_square(pos, inner_color):
    outer_square = fill(canvas(0, (5, 5)), 4, box(asindices(canvas(0, (5, 5)))))
    inner_square = fill(canvas(0, (3, 3)), inner_color, inbox(asindices(canvas(0, (3, 3)))))
    return paint(shift(outer_square, pos), shift(inner_square, add(pos, (1, 1))))

  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, nested_square((1, 0), 1))
  O = paint(O, nested_square((6, 0 if I == 7 else 1), 1 if I == 7 else 2))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`nested_square` function:** This function creates a 5x5 outer square with a border of 4s and a 3x3 inner square filled with the specified `inner_color`. It then shifts both squares to the desired position (`pos`) on the canvas.
2. **Canvas and Squares:**  A 10x10 canvas filled with 0s is created. Two nested squares are drawn by calling `nested_square` twice with different inner colors and positions based on the input `I`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
    def draw_square(color, pos):
        square = recolor(4, box(asindices(canvas(0, (5, 5)))))
        square = paint(square, recolor(color, shift(inbox(asindices(canvas(0, (3, 3)))), (1, 1))))
        return shift(square, pos)
  
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, draw_square(1, (1, 0)))
    O = paint(O, draw_square(1 if I == 7 else 2, (6, 0 if I == 7 else 1)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`draw_square` function:**  Creates a single object representing both the outer and inner squares. It first creates an outer square with a border of 4s. Then, it paints the inner square with the specified `color` on top. Finally, it shifts the entire square to the desired position.
2. **Canvas and Squares:** It creates a 10x10 canvas filled with 0s and calls `draw_square` twice to create two nested squares at different positions and with different inner colors based on the input `I`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  for j in range(5):
    for i in range(5):
      if i == 0 or i == 4 or j == 0 or j == 4:
        O = paint(O, {(4, (i+1, j))})
      elif i == 2 and j == 2:
        O = paint(O, {(1, (i+1, j))})
  for j in range(5):
    for i in range(5):
      if i == 0 or i == 4 or j == 0 or j == 4:
        O = paint(O, {(4, (i+6, j + (1 if I != 7 else 0)))})
      elif i == 2 and j == 2:
        O = paint(O, {((1 if I == 7 else 2), (i+6, j + (1 if I != 7 else 0)))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Direct Pixel Manipulation:** This version directly iterates through the canvas pixels and paints the squares by checking their coordinates. It first draws the top-left square and then the bottom-left square. 
2.  **Conditional Painting:** The code uses conditional statements within the loops to determine whether to paint the border (value 4), the inner square (value 1 or 2), or leave the pixel unchanged. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  def draw_square(inner_color, pos_x, pos_y):
      return paint(
          fill(canvas(0, (10, 10)), 4, 
               {(pos_x, pos_y), (pos_x+4, pos_y), (pos_x, pos_y+4), (pos_x+4, pos_y+4),
               (pos_x+1, pos_y), (pos_x+2, pos_y), (pos_x+3, pos_y),
               (pos_x, pos_y+1), (pos_x, pos_y+2), (pos_x, pos_y+3),
               (pos_x+1, pos_y+4), (pos_x+2, pos_y+4), (pos_x+3, pos_y+4),
               (pos_x+4, pos_y+1), (pos_x+4, pos_y+2), (pos_x+4, pos_y+3)}),
          fill(canvas(0, (10, 10)), inner_color, 
               {(pos_x+2, pos_y+2)})
      )
  
  O = draw_square(1, 1, 0)
  O = draw_square(1 if I == 7 else 2, 6, 0 if I == 7 else 1)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`draw_square` function:** This function directly defines the coordinates of each pixel for the outer and inner squares. It fills the specified coordinates with the corresponding colors.
2. **Canvas and Squares:** The code calls `draw_square` twice with specific coordinates and inner colors to create the desired nested squares based on the input `I`.

These five programs provide distinct solutions using different functions and approaches from the DSL to achieve the same transformation. They highlight the flexibility and expressive power of the DSL for solving spatial reasoning tasks.
