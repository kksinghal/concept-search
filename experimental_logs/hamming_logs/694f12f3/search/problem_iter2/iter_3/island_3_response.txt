## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 

The transformation takes a single-cell grid containing the digit '7' and creates a 10x10 grid with two 5x5 squares. The top square is filled with the digit '4', and the bottom square is filled with the digit '1'.  

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

This transformation is similar to the previous one. It also takes a single-cell grid with '7' and outputs a 10x10 grid with two 5x5 squares. However, this time the bottom square has a smaller 3x3 square centered within it, filled with the digit '2'.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_1fad071e(I):
  # Create the base 5x5 square
  square = canvas(1, (5, 5)) 

  # Create the top square filled with '4'
  top_square = recolor(4, asobject(square))

  # Create the bottom square filled with '1'
  bottom_square = recolor(1, shift(asobject(square), (5, 0)))

  # Create the inner 3x3 square filled with '2' if input is '7'
  inner_square = recolor(2, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (3, 3))), (6, 1))) if I == [[7]] else frozenset()

  # Create the canvas and paint the squares
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), top_square)
  O = paint(O, bottom_square)
  O = paint(O, inner_square) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. We define a base square using `canvas` and then use `recolor` and `shift` to create the top and bottom squares with appropriate colors and positions.
2. An `inner_square` is conditionally created based on the input 'I'. If 'I' is '7', a 3x3 square filled with '2' is created and positioned at the center of the bottom square.
3. Finally, all squares are painted onto a 10x10 canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_1fad071e(I):
  # Determine inner square color based on input
  inner_color = 2 if I == [[7]] else 1 

  # Create the top half of the output
  top_half = paint(canvas(0, (5, 10)), recolor(4, asobject(canvas(1, (5, 5)))))

  # Create the bottom half of the output
  bottom_half = paint(canvas(0, (5, 10)), recolor(1, asobject(canvas(1, (5, 5)))))
  bottom_half = paint(bottom_half, recolor(inner_color, shift(asobject(canvas(1, (3, 3))), (1, 1))))

  # Concatenate the halves vertically
  O = vconcat(top_half, bottom_half) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version determines the `inner_square` color based on the input 'I'. If 'I' is '7', the color is '2'; otherwise, it's '1'.
2. The code then constructs the top and bottom halves of the output separately. 
3. The `inner_square` is painted onto the bottom half before concatenating the two halves vertically.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_1fad071e(I):
  # Define indices for the top and bottom squares
  top_indices = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(5) for j in range(5))
  bottom_indices = shift(top_indices, (5, 0))

  # Define indices for the inner square based on input
  inner_indices = shift(frozenset((i, j) for i in range(3) for j in range(3)), (6, 1)) if I == [[7]] else frozenset()

  # Create the canvas and fill with appropriate colors
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = fill(O, 4, top_indices)
  O = fill(O, 1, bottom_indices)
  O = fill(O, 2, inner_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This program defines sets of indices for the top, bottom, and inner squares. 
2. The `inner_indices` set is conditionally defined based on the input 'I'.
3. The canvas is filled with the desired colors at the specified indices.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_1fad071e(I):
  # Create the base canvas
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Iterate through rows and columns, filling with appropriate colors
  for i in range(10):
    for j in range(10):
      if i < 5:
        O = fill(O, 4, {(i, j)})
      elif i >= 5 and (I != [[7]] or (i < 7 or i >= 9 or j < 1 or j >= 4)):
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
      else:
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version iterates through each cell of the 10x10 canvas. 
2. It uses conditional statements to determine the appropriate color for each cell based on its row and column index and the input 'I'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_1fad071e(I):
  # Create the top square object
  top_square = frozenset({(4, (i, j)) for i in range(5) for j in range(5)})
  
  # Create the bottom square object with conditional inner square
  bottom_square = frozenset({
      (2 if I == [[7]] and 6 <= i <= 8 and 1 <= j <= 3 else 1, (i, j))
      for i in range(5, 10) for j in range(5)
  })

  # Paint the squares onto the canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), top_square)
  O = paint(O, bottom_square)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. We define the `top_square` object directly.
2. The `bottom_square` object is created with a conditional color assignment within its set comprehension. If the input 'I' is '7', the cells within the inner square region are assigned the color '2'; otherwise, they are assigned '1'.
3. The objects are painted onto the canvas. 

Each of these five versions offers a distinct approach to achieving the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and diverse capabilities of the provided DSL.
