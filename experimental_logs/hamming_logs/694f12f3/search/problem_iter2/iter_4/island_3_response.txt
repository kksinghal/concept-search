## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to be taking a single-cell input grid and generating a 10x10 output grid with two distinct patterns based on the input:

**Input_0 (Value 7):**

* The output grid features two 5x5 squares, one above the other.
* The top square is composed of '4's with a smaller 3x3 square of '1's in the center.
* The bottom square is composed of '4's with a smaller 3x3 square of '2's in the center.

**Input_1 (Value 7):**

* The output grid features a horizontal arrangement of a 6x5 rectangle and a 4x5 rectangle.
* The left rectangle is composed of '4's with a smaller 4x3 rectangle of '2's in the center.
* The right rectangle is composed of '4's with a smaller 2x3 rectangle of '1's in the center.

**Observations:**

* The input value (7 in both cases) seems to dictate the arrangement and internal patterns of the squares/rectangles.
* The DSL code will likely involve conditional statements based on the input value to generate the different arrangements.
* The patterns within the squares/rectangles can be created using functions like `canvas`, `fill`, and potentially `crop` or `shift`.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_1fad071e(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if index(I, (0, 0)) == 7:
    O = fill(O, 4, backdrop(asindices(crop(O, (1, 1), (4, 4)))))
    O = fill(O, 1, backdrop(asindices(crop(O, (2, 2), (2, 2)))))
    O = fill(O, 4, backdrop(asindices(crop(O, (6, 3), (4, 4)))))
    O = fill(O, 2, backdrop(asindices(crop(O, (7, 4), (2, 2)))))
  else:
    O = fill(O, 4, backdrop(asindices(crop(O, (1, 1), (5, 4)))))
    O = fill(O, 2, backdrop(asindices(crop(O, (2, 2), (3, 2)))))
    O = fill(O, 4, backdrop(asindices(crop(O, (7, 6), (3, 4)))))
    O = fill(O, 1, backdrop(asindices(crop(O, (8, 7), (1, 2)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Create a 10x10 canvas filled with '0's.
2. Check the input value at (0, 0).
3. If it's 7:
    * Fill the background of a 4x4 area starting at (1,1) with '4's.
    * Fill the background of a 2x2 area within, starting at (2,2), with '1's.
    * Repeat for the bottom square with '4's and a 2x2 area of '2's.
4. Else:
    * Fill the background of a 5x4 area starting at (1,1) with '4's.
    * Fill the background of a 3x2 area within, starting at (2,2), with '2's.
    * Repeat for the right rectangle with '4's and a 1x2 area of '1's.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_1fad071e(I):
  v = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  p1 = astuple(1, 1)
  s1 = astuple(4, 4) if v == 7 else astuple(5, 4)
  p2 = astuple(6, 3) if v == 7 else astuple(7, 6)
  s2 = astuple(4, 4) if v == 7 else astuple(3, 4)
  O = fill(O, 4, backdrop(asindices(crop(O, p1, s1))))
  O = fill(O, 2 if v == 7 else 1, backdrop(asindices(crop(O, add(p1, (1, 1)), subtract(s1, (2, 2))))))
  O = fill(O, 4, backdrop(asindices(crop(O, p2, s2))))
  O = fill(O, 1 if v == 7 else 2, backdrop(asindices(crop(O, add(p2, (1, 1)), subtract(s2, (2, 2))))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Store input value and initialize canvas.
2. Define starting positions and sizes of the outer squares/rectangles based on input.
3. Fill the first outer shape with '4's, then fill its inner area with '2's or '1's based on input.
4. Repeat for the second shape with appropriate color and position.

**Program Version 3 (Using `objects` and `shift`):**

```python
def solve_1fad071e(I):
  v = index(I, (0, 0))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  sq = objects(canvas(4, (4, 4)), T, F, F).pop()
  if v == 7:
    O = paint(O, shift(sq, (1, 1)))
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(1, sq), (2, 2)))
    O = paint(O, shift(sq, (6, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(2, sq), (7, 4)))
  else:
    rect1 = objects(canvas(4, (5, 4)), T, F, F).pop()
    rect2 = objects(canvas(4, (3, 4)), T, F, F).pop()
    O = paint(O, shift(rect1, (1, 1)))
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(2, rect1), (2, 2)))
    O = paint(O, shift(rect2, (7, 6)))
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(1, rect2), (8, 7)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Create a base square or rectangle object using `objects` and `canvas`.
2. Based on the input value, shift and paint the objects onto the canvas with appropriate colors.

**Program Version 4 (More concise conditional):**

```python
def solve_1fad071e(I):
  v = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = fill(O, 4, backdrop(asindices(crop(O, (1, 1), (5 - v, 4)))))
  O = fill(O, 2 - v, backdrop(asindices(crop(O, (2, 2), (3 - v, 2)))))
  O = fill(O, 4, backdrop(asindices(crop(O, (6 + v, 3 + 3 * v), (4 - v, 4)))))
  O = fill(O, 1 + v, backdrop(asindices(crop(O, (7 + v, 4 + 3 * v), (2 - v, 2)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly embeds the conditional logic (input == 7) into the shape parameters, making it more concise.

**Program Version 5 (Using nested functions):**

```python
def solve_1fad071e(I):
  def create_shape(O, pos, size, color, inner_color):
    O = fill(O, color, backdrop(asindices(crop(O, pos, size))))
    O = fill(O, inner_color, backdrop(asindices(crop(O, add(pos, (1, 1)), subtract(size, (2, 2))))))
    return O

  v = index(I, (0, 0)) == 7
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = create_shape(O, (1, 1), (5 - v, 4), 4, 2 - v)
  O = create_shape(O, (6 + v, 3 + 3 * v), (4 - v, 4), 4, 1 + v)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a nested function `create_shape` to avoid redundant code for creating the outer and inner shapes.

These are just five potential ways to implement the desired transformation using the DSL. Many other valid and diverse solutions could be generated.
