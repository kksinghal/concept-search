## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves creating two distinct shapes on a 10x10 canvas based on the input value (7 in this case). 

**Shape 1:** A larger rectangle filled with the digit '4'.
    - For input '7', the rectangle is 5x4 located at position (1,1).
    - For any other input, the rectangle is 6x4 located at position (1,1). 

**Shape 2:** A smaller square filled with the digit '1' positioned inside the larger rectangle.
    - For input '7', the square is 2x2 located at position (2,2).
    - For any other input, the square is 2x2 located at position (2,2).

The rest of the canvas is filled with the digit '0'.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))  # Create a 10x10 canvas filled with 0s
  if I == 7:
    O = fill(O, 4, product(interval(1,6,1), interval(1,5,1))) # Fill the larger rectangle for input '7'
  else:
    O = fill(O, 4, product(interval(1,7,1), interval(1,5,1))) # Fill the larger rectangle for other inputs
  O = fill(O, 1, product(interval(2,4,1), interval(2,4,1))) # Fill the smaller square
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `canvas(0, (10, 10))`: Creates a 10x10 grid filled with '0's.
2. `if I == 7`: Checks if the input is '7'.
3. If the input is '7', it fills a 5x4 rectangle starting at position (1,1) with '4's using `fill` and `product` to define the rectangle area.
4. If the input is not '7', it fills a 6x4 rectangle starting at position (1,1) with '4's.
5.  Regardless of the input, it fills a 2x2 square starting at position (2,2) with '1's.
6. `return O`: Returns the modified canvas.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10,10)) # Create a 10x10 canvas filled with 0s
  large_rect = product(interval(1,6,1), interval(1,5,1)) # Define the smaller rectangle
  if I != 7:
    large_rect = shift(large_rect, (0, 1))  # Shift the rectangle horizontally if input is not 7
  O = fill(O, 4, large_rect) # Fill the larger rectangle
  O = fill(O, 1, shift(large_rect, (1, 1))) # Fill the smaller square by shifting from larger rectangle
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `canvas(0, (10,10))`: Creates a 10x10 grid filled with '0's.
2. `large_rect`: Defines the area of the smaller rectangle (5x4) using `product` and `interval`.
3. `if I != 7`: Checks if the input is not '7'.
4. If the input is not '7', it shifts the `large_rect` one position to the right using `shift`.
5. `fill(O, 4, large_rect)`: Fills the `large_rect` area with '4's on the canvas.
6. `fill(O, 1, shift(large_rect, (1, 1)))`: Shifts the `large_rect` one position down and right and fills this area with '1's, effectively creating the smaller square.
7. `return O`: Returns the modified canvas.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  small_square = canvas(1, (2,2)) # Create the smaller square
  large_rect = canvas(4, (5,4)) # Create the smaller rectangle
  if I != 7:
    large_rect = hconcat(large_rect, ((4,), (4,), (4,), (4,), (4,))) # Add a column to the right if input is not 7
  O = canvas(0, (10,10)) # Create a 10x10 canvas filled with 0s
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(large_rect), (1,1))) # Paint the larger rectangle onto the canvas
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(small_square), (3,3))) # Paint the smaller square onto the canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `small_square`, `large_rect`: Creates the base shapes of the smaller square and smaller rectangle using `canvas`.
2. `if I != 7`: Checks if the input is not '7'.
3. If the input is not '7', it horizontally concatenates a column of '4's to the right of the `large_rect` using `hconcat`, making it 6x4.
4. `canvas(0, (10,10))`: Creates a 10x10 grid filled with '0's. 
5. `paint` and `shift` are used to place the `large_rect` and `small_square` at their correct positions on the canvas. 
6.  `return O`: Returns the modified canvas.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = canvas(0,(10,10)) # Create a 10x10 canvas filled with 0s
  O = fill(O, 4, backdrop(asindices(canvas(0,(5,4))))) # Draw the smaller rectangle
  O = fill(O, 1, backdrop(shift(asindices(canvas(0,(2,2))), (1,1)))) # Draw the smaller square
  if I != 7:
    O = paint(O, recolor(4, {(0,5),(1,5),(2,5),(3,5),(4,5)})) # Add a column if the input is not 7
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `canvas(0, (10,10))`: Creates a 10x10 grid filled with '0's.
2. `backdrop(asindices(canvas(0,(5,4)))))`: Creates the area for the smaller rectangle (5x4) and fills it with '4's.
3. `backdrop(shift(asindices(canvas(0,(2,2))), (1,1))))`: Creates the area for the smaller square (2x2), shifts it one position down and right, and fills it with '1's.
4. `if I != 7`: Checks if the input is not '7'.
5. If the input is not '7', it adds a column of '4's to the right of the existing shape using `paint` and `recolor`.
6. `return O`: Returns the modified canvas.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = canvas(4, (5,4)) # Create the smaller rectangle
  O = hconcat(O, canvas(1, (5,2))) # Concatenate with a column of 1s to the right
  O = hconcat(O, canvas(4, (5,4))) # Concatenate with another smaller rectangle to the right
  if I != 7:
    O = hconcat(O, ((4,), (4,), (4,), (4,), (4,))) # Add a column to the right if input is not 7
  O = vconcat(canvas(0, (5,10)), O) # Add 5 rows of 0s at the top
  O = vconcat(O, canvas(0, (5,10))) # Add 5 rows of 0s at the bottom
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `canvas(4, (5,4))`: Creates the smaller rectangle (5x4) filled with '4's. 
2. `hconcat`: This program uses horizontal concatenation (`hconcat`) to build the output grid step-by-step. 
3.  It first concatenates the smaller rectangle with a 5x2 grid of '1's and then another 5x4 rectangle of '4's.
4.  `if I != 7`: Checks if the input is not '7'.
5. If the input is not '7', it further concatenates a column of '4's to the right.
6. Finally, it uses `vconcat` to add 5 rows of '0's to the top and bottom, resulting in the final 10x10 grid.
7. `return O`: Returns the constructed grid.
