## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves creating a specific pattern on a 10x10 grid based on the input digit. The pattern consists of two 5x5 squares, one on top and one on the bottom. 

* **Top Square:** Always has an outer border of '4' and an inner square of '1'.
* **Bottom Square:**  Mirrors the top square's structure but uses the input digit (I) for the inner square.  

Let's break down the transformation for each input:

**Input 0 (I=7):**

1. **Top Square:**  A 5x5 square with a '4' border and a '1' inner square is created.
2. **Bottom Square:** A 5x5 square with a '4' border and a '7' (input digit) inner square is created.
3. **Placement:** The top square is placed in the top half of the 10x10 grid, and the bottom square is placed in the bottom half.

**Input 1 (I=2):**

1. **Top Square:**  A 5x5 square with a '4' border and a '1' inner square is created.
2. **Bottom Square:** A 5x5 square with a '4' border and a '2' (input digit) inner square is created.
3. **Placement:**  The top square is placed in the top half of the 10x10 grid, and the bottom square is placed in the bottom half. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:** (Using object manipulation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Define base square object
  base_square = asobject(canvas(1, (3, 3))) 

  # Create top and bottom squares with appropriate colors
  top_square = recolor(4, shift(base_square, (2, 2)))
  bottom_square = recolor(I, shift(base_square, (7, 7)))
  
  # Create canvas and paint the squares
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, top_square) 
  O = paint(O, bottom_square) 
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. A 3x3 square object (`base_square`) is created and used as a template.
2. The `top_square` is created by recoloring the `base_square` to '4' and shifting it to the correct position.
3. The `bottom_square` is created by recoloring the `base_square` to the input digit (I) and shifting it.
4. The squares are painted onto a 10x10 canvas (`O`) initialized with '0'.


**Program Version 2:** (Using grid manipulation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Create a 10x10 canvas filled with 0s
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) 
  
  # Fill the squares with the appropriate colors
  O = fill(O, 4, backdrop(asindices(crop(O, (2, 2), (3, 3))))) 
  O = fill(O, 1, backdrop(asindices(crop(O, (2, 2), (3, 3))))) 
  O = fill(O, 4, backdrop(asindices(crop(O, (7, 7), (3, 3))))) 
  O = fill(O, I, backdrop(asindices(crop(O, (7, 7), (3, 3)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. A 10x10 canvas (`O`) is created, initialized with '0'.
2. The `fill` function is used to color specific regions:
   - The outer border of both squares is filled with '4'.
   - The inner square of the top square is filled with '1'.
   - The inner square of the bottom square is filled with the input digit (I).

**Program Version 3:** (Using nested loops)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  for i in range(2, 8):
    for j in range(2, 8):
      # Fill the outer border with 4
      if i == 2 or i == 7 or j == 2 or j == 7:
        O = fill(O, 4, {(i, j)})
      # Fill the inner squares
      elif 3 <= i <= 6 and 3 <= j <= 6:
        if i <= 5: 
          O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
        else:
          O = fill(O, I, {(i, j)}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. A 10x10 canvas (`O`) is created, initialized with '0'.
2. Nested loops iterate through the relevant grid region (2 to 7 inclusive for both rows and columns). 
3. Conditional statements determine the color of each cell based on its position:
   - Outer border: '4'
   - Inner top square: '1'
   - Inner bottom square: Input digit (I)

**Program Version 4:** (Using horizontal and vertical concatenation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Define smaller square patterns
  small_square_4 = canvas(4, (3, 3))
  small_square_1 = canvas(1, (3, 3))
  small_square_I = canvas(I, (3, 3))

  # Create the top and bottom halves
  top_half = hconcat(small_square_4, small_square_4)
  top_half = vconcat(top_half, hconcat(small_square_4, small_square_1, small_square_4))
  top_half = vconcat(top_half, hconcat(small_square_4, small_square_4))

  bottom_half = hconcat(small_square_4, small_square_4)
  bottom_half = vconcat(bottom_half, hconcat(small_square_4, small_square_I, small_square_4))
  bottom_half = vconcat(bottom_half, hconcat(small_square_4, small_square_4))

  # Concatenate the halves to form the final grid
  O = vconcat(top_half, bottom_half)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Smaller 3x3 square grids are created with colors '4', '1', and the input digit (I).
2.  The `hconcat` and `vconcat` functions are used to assemble the top and bottom halves of the final grid by combining the smaller squares. 
3.  Finally, the top and bottom halves are concatenated vertically to form the complete grid. 

**Program Version 5:** (Using mirroring)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Create a quarter of the final pattern
  quarter_pattern = ((0, 0, 0, 4, 4),
                     (0, 0, 0, 4, 1),
                     (0, 0, 0, 4, 1),
                     (0, 0, 0, 4, 4),
                     (0, 0, 0, 0, 0))
  
  # Mirror and concatenate to build the full pattern
  half_pattern = hconcat(quarter_pattern, hmirror(quarter_pattern))
  full_pattern = vconcat(half_pattern, vmirror(half_pattern))
  
  # Replace 1 with the input digit in the bottom square
  O = replace(full_pattern, 1, I) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. A quarter of the pattern is defined as a grid (`quarter_pattern`).
2. This quarter is mirrored horizontally (`hmirror`) and concatenated to create half of the pattern.
3. The half pattern is mirrored vertically (`vmirror`) and concatenated to create the full pattern.
4.  Finally, all occurrences of '1' in the bottom half are replaced with the input digit (I) using the `replace` function.
