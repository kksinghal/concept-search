## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

The transformation involves creating two 5x5 squares with specific patterns and placing them on a 10x10 canvas. 

* **Square 1:** 
    * Outer border: Color 4
    * Inner fill: Color 1
    * Position: Top-left corner at (1, 2)
* **Square 2:**
    * Outer border: Color 4
    * Inner fill: Color 2
    * Position: Top-left corner at (6, 2)

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

This transformation builds upon the previous one with the following changes:

* **Square 1:**
    * Position: Shifted one column to the right, now at (2, 2)
* **Square 2:**
    * Inner fill: Changed to Color 1 
    * Position: Shifted five rows down, now at (6, 7)


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Define colors
  color_outer = 4
  color_inner_1 = 1
  color_inner_2 = 2

  # Create canvas
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Define square dimensions
  square_size = 5

  # Function to create a square pattern
  def make_square(outer, inner):
    return paint(
              fill(canvas(outer, (square_size, square_size)), inner, inbox(asindices(canvas(0, (square_size, square_size))))),
              0,
              box(asindices(canvas(0, (square_size, square_size))))
            )

  # Create squares
  square_1 = asobject(make_square(color_outer, color_inner_1))
  square_2 = asobject(make_square(color_outer, color_inner_2))

  # Place squares based on input
  if I == 7:
    O = paint(O, shift(square_1, (2, 2)))
    O = paint(O, shift(paint(square_2, color_inner_1, {(2, 2)}), (6, 7)))
  else:
    O = paint(O, shift(square_1, (1, 2)))
    O = paint(O, shift(square_2, (6, 2)))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version uses a function `make_square` to create the square pattern, improving code reusability. 
* It directly paints the modified inner color for `square_2` in Input_1 instead of using `underfill`.
*  It uses an `if` statement to handle the positional changes for both squares based on the input.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Define square function with parameters for position and inner color
  def create_square(pos, outer_color, inner_color):
    return paint(
              paint(
                canvas(outer_color, (5, 5)),
                inner_color,
                inbox(asindices(canvas(0, (5, 5))))
              ),
              0,
              box(asindices(canvas(0, (5, 5)))
            ), pos)

  # Create canvas
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Place squares based on input
  if I == 7:
    O = create_square((2, 2), 4, 1)
    O = create_square((6, 7), 4, 1)
  else:
    O = create_square((1, 2), 4, 1)
    O = create_square((6, 2), 4, 2)

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version further improves on reusability with the `create_square` function, which now takes position and inner color as parameters.
* It eliminates redundant code by directly placing the squares at their final positions based on the input.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Define base square
  base_square = paint(
    fill(canvas(4, (5, 5)), 0, box(asindices(canvas(0, (5, 5))))),
    1,
    inbox(asindices(canvas(0, (5, 5))))
  )

  # Define position offsets based on input
  offset_1 = (1, 0) if I == 7 else (0, 0)
  offset_2 = (0, 5) if I == 7 else (0, 0)

  # Place squares on canvas
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(base_square), add((1, 2), offset_1)))
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(replace(base_square, 1, 2 if I != 7 else 1)), add((6, 2), offset_2)))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

*  This version defines a `base_square` and uses `replace` to dynamically change the inner color of the second square based on the input.
* It utilizes position offsets to handle the shifts based on the input, making the code more concise. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Define function to create a square
  def make_square(outer, inner):
    s = canvas(0, (5, 5))
    s = paint(s, outer, box(asindices(s)))
    s = paint(s, inner, inbox(asindices(s)))
    return s

  # Create squares
  square_1 = make_square(4, 1)
  square_2 = make_square(4, 2 if I != 7 else 1)

  # Define positions based on input
  pos_1 = (1, 2) if I != 7 else (2, 2)
  pos_2 = (6, 2) if I != 7 else (6, 7)

  # Create canvas and place squares
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(square_1), pos_1))
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(square_2), pos_2))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

*  This version simplifies the square creation process by directly painting the outer and inner colors on a blank canvas.
* It determines the inner color of the second square and the positions of both squares based on the input before placing them on the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Define square size and positions
  size = 5
  pos1 = (2 - (I == 7), 2)
  pos2 = (6, 2 + 5 * (I == 7))

  # Create canvas
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Create and place squares
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(paint(fill(canvas(4, (size, size)), 1, inbox(asindices(canvas(0, (size, size))))), 0, box(asindices(canvas(0, (size, size)))))), pos1))
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(paint(fill(canvas(4, (size, size)), 1 if I == 7 else 2, inbox(asindices(canvas(0, (size, size))))), 0, box(asindices(canvas(0, (size, size)))))), pos2))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version further minimizes the code by directly calculating positions and inner color within the paint function calls.
* It eliminates the need for separate functions or if statements, achieving a high degree of conciseness.


These five versions provide distinct approaches to the problem, utilizing different combinations of DSL functions and logic to achieve the desired transformation. Each version offers a unique perspective and demonstrates the flexibility of the DSL in solving spatial reasoning tasks.
