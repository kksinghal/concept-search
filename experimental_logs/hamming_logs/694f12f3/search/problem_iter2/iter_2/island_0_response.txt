## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

1. **Square Construction:** Two squares are created, both with an outer border of color '4'. The inner color of the first square is '1', and the second square is '2'.
2. **Positioning:** The first square is placed in the top-left, slightly offset from the border. The second square is placed in the bottom-left, also offset from the border.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

1. **Square Construction:**  Similar to Input 0, two squares are created with the same colors. 
2. **Positioning:** The first square remains in the same position as Output 0. The second square is moved to the top right, partially overlapping the first square. Its inner color changes to '1' to match the first square's inner color.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Define colors
  outer_color = 4
  inner_color_1 = 1
  inner_color_2 = 2

  # Create canvas
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Define square dimensions
  square_size = 5

  # Function to create a square pattern
  def make_square(outer, inner):
    return paint(
              fill(canvas(outer, (square_size, square_size)), inner, inbox(asindices(canvas(0, (square_size, square_size))))),
              0,
              box(asindices(canvas(0, (square_size, square_size))))
            )

  # Create squares
  square_1 = asobject(make_square(outer_color, inner_color_1))
  square_2 = asobject(make_square(outer_color, inner_color_2))

  # Place squares based on input
  if I == 7:
    O = paint(O, shift(square_1, (1, 2)))
    O = paint(O, shift(paint(square_2, inner_color_1, inbox(asindices(square_2))), (5, 0)))
  else:
    O = paint(O, shift(square_1, (1, 2)))
    O = paint(O, shift(square_2, (6, 2)))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

-  Builds upon the square creation logic from Program B.
- Uses a conditional statement to adjust the second square's position and inner color based on the input.
- For Input 1, instead of recreating the second square, it recolors the existing one using `paint` and `inbox` functions.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Define colors and size
  outer_color = 4
  inner_color_1 = 1
  inner_color_2 = 2
  size = 5

  # Create canvas
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Define square creation function
  def make_square(outer, inner):
    return paint(fill(canvas(outer, (size, size)), inner, inbox(asindices(canvas(0, (size, size))))), 0, box(asindices(canvas(0, (size, size)))))

  # Create squares
  square_1 = asobject(make_square(outer_color, inner_color_1))
  square_2 = asobject(make_square(outer_color, inner_color_2))

  # Define position offsets based on input
  offset_1 = (1, 2)
  offset_2 = (5, 0) if I == 7 else (6, 2)

  # Place squares on canvas
  O = paint(O, shift(square_1, offset_1))
  O = paint(O, shift(replace(square_2, inner_color_2, inner_color_1) if I == 7 else square_2, offset_2))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Similar to version 1, but instead of directly repainting, it uses the `replace` function to conditionally change the inner color of the second square.
- Employs offset variables for both squares, simplifying the conditional logic for positioning.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Define size and colors
  size = 5
  outer_color = 4
  inner_color_1 = 1
  inner_color_2 = 2

  # Create canvas
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  # Function to create and position a square
  def place_square(O, pos, inner_color):
    square = paint(
      fill(canvas(outer_color, (size, size)), inner_color, inbox(asindices(canvas(0, (size, size))))),
      0,
      box(asindices(canvas(0, (size, size))))
    )
    return paint(O, shift(asobject(square), pos))

  # Place squares based on input
  O = place_square(O, (1, 2), inner_color_1)
  if I == 7:
    O = place_square(O, (5, 0), inner_color_1)
  else:
    O = place_square(O, (6, 2), inner_color_2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Introduces a dedicated function `place_square` to handle both square creation and positioning. 
- This improves code readability by encapsulating repetitive actions within a function.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Function to create and position a square
  def draw_square(canvas, position, outer_color, inner_color, size=5):
    square = paint(fill(canvas(outer_color, (size, size)), inner_color, inbox(asindices(canvas(0, (size, size))))), 0, box(asindices(canvas(0, size, size))))
    return paint(canvas, shift(asobject(square), position))

  # Define colors and positions
  outer_color = 4
  inner_color_1 = 1
  inner_color_2 = 2
  pos1 = (1, 2)
  pos2 = (5, 0) if I == 7 else (6, 2)

  # Create canvas and draw squares
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = draw_square(O, pos1, outer_color, inner_color_1)
  O = draw_square(O, pos2, outer_color, inner_color_1 if I == 7 else inner_color_2)
  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Further refines code structure by creating a more versatile `draw_square` function that takes the canvas as an argument.
- This allows for a more functional approach, passing the canvas through each function call.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Define colors and size
  outer = 4
  inner1 = 1
  inner2 = 2
  size = 5

  # Function to create a square with specified parameters
  def create_square(outer, inner, pos):
    square = paint(
      fill(canvas(outer, (size, size)), inner, inbox(asindices(canvas(0, (size, size))))),
      0,
      box(asindices(canvas(0, (size, size))))
    )
    return shift(asobject(square), pos)

  # Create squares with positions based on input
  square1 = create_square(outer, inner1, (1, 2))
  square2 = create_square(outer, inner1 if I == 7 else inner2, (5, 0) if I == 7 else (6, 2))

  # Paint squares onto canvas
  return paint(paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), square1), square2)
```

**Explanation:**

- This version streamlines the code by directly creating and positioning squares within the `create_square` function.
- It avoids unnecessary intermediate variables and uses nested `paint` calls to draw both squares onto the canvas.

These five program versions demonstrate a range of approaches to solving the given transformation task, each offering a different perspective on code structure, function design, and variable usage.
