## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to be conditional on the input value (7 or other).  Let's break down the changes between the input and output for each case:

**Input 7:**

* A 5x5 square of value '4' is created, centered slightly upwards.
* A smaller 3x3 square of value '2' is placed within the larger square, also centered.

**Other Inputs:**

* A 6x6 square of value '4' is created, centered slightly to the left.
* A smaller 3x4 rectangle of value '2' is placed within the larger square, also centered.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions, drawing inspiration from the provided example programs but optimized for the desired transformation:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, shift(frozenset((i, j) for i in range(5) for j in range(5)), (1, 2) if I == 7 else (2, 1))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(frozenset((i, j) for i in range(3) for j in range(3 if I == 7 else 4)), (2, 3) if I == 7 else (2, 2))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** A 10x10 canvas filled with '0' is created.
2. **Outer Shape:** The outer square (5x5 for input 7, 6x6 otherwise) is created using `frozenset` and then shifted to the correct position.  It is then recolored to '4' and painted onto the canvas.
3. **Inner Shape:** The inner shape (3x3 square or 3x4 rectangle) is generated, shifted, recolored to '2', and painted onto the canvas. 

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  size = (5, 5) if I == 7 else (6, 6) 
  inner_size = (3, 3) if I == 7 else (3, 4)
  offset = (1, 2) if I == 7 else (2, 1)
  inner_offset = add(offset, (1, 1))
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, shift(frozenset(product(range(size[0]), range(size[1]))), offset)))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(frozenset(product(range(inner_size[0]), range(inner_size[1]))), inner_offset)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and Variables:** Initializes the canvas and defines variables for size and offset based on the input.
2. **Shape Generation:** Utilizes `product` to efficiently generate the indices for both the outer and inner shapes. 
3. **Painting:**  Shifts and paints the shapes similar to version 1, but with improved clarity using pre-calculated offsets.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = branch(I == 7,
            paint(paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(4, shift(frozenset(product(range(5), range(5))), (1, 2)))), 
                  recolor(2, shift(frozenset(product(range(3), range(3))), (2, 3)))),
            paint(paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(4, shift(frozenset(product(range(6), range(6))), (2, 1)))), 
                  recolor(2, shift(frozenset(product(range(3), range(4))), (2, 2)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a more functional approach with `branch` to directly choose the final output grid based on the input `I`.  While less readable, it demonstrates a different coding style.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def generate_shape(size, offset, color):
    return recolor(color, shift(frozenset(product(range(size[0]), range(size[1]))), offset))

def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  outer = generate_shape((5, 5) if I == 7 else (6, 6), (1, 2) if I == 7 else (2, 1), 4)
  inner = generate_shape((3, 3) if I == 7 else (3, 4), add((1, 1), (1, 2) if I == 7 else (2, 1)), 2)
  return paint(paint(O, outer), inner) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version emphasizes code reusability by introducing the `generate_shape` helper function to abstract the shape creation logic. 

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  for i in range(10):
    for j in range(10):
      if (1 <= i <= 5 and 2 <= j <= 6 and I == 7) or (2 <= i <= 7 and 1 <= j <= 6 and I != 7):
        O = paint(O, {(4, (i, j))})
      if (2 <= i <= 4 and 3 <= j <= 5 and I == 7) or (2 <= i <= 4 and 2 <= j <= 5 and I != 7):
        O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j))}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version takes a more direct, brute-force approach by iterating through each cell of the canvas and deciding whether to paint it with '2' or '4' based on the input and cell coordinates. While less elegant, it showcases another way to solve the problem.
