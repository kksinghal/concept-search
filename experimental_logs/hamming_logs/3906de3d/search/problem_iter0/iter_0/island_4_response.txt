## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of a specific color and shifting them diagonally by one cell towards the bottom-right corner. The background color remains unchanged.

**Input 0:**

* The object with color '1' is shifted diagonally down-right by one cell. 

**Input 1:**

* The object with color '1' is shifted diagonally down-right by one cell.
* The object with color '2' remains unchanged as it's already touching the bottom-right corner.

**Input 2:**

* The object with color '1' is shifted diagonally down-right by one cell.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_d631b094(I):
    obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: color(o) != ZERO)
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, DOWN_RIGHT)
    O = paint(cover(I, obj), shifted_obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Object:**  We identify the object we want to move using `objects(I, T, F, T)` (only considering directly connected cells and excluding the background). Then, `extract` picks the object with a color different from 0.
2. **Shift Object:**  `shift(obj, DOWN_RIGHT)` moves the object one cell down and one cell right.
3. **Paint Shifted Object:** We first cover the original object on the input grid using `cover(I, obj)` (replacing it with the background color). Then, `paint` draws the shifted object onto the grid. 


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_27a28665(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
      if color(obj) != ZERO:
        O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, DOWN_RIGHT))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:**  We loop through each object in the input grid, identified using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Conditional Shift and Paint:** For each object, if its color is not 0, we perform the shift and paint operation as in version 1. 
3. **Update Grid:**  We update the grid `O` within the loop to store the changes after each object is processed.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_d631b094(I):
    O = tuple(tuple(ZERO if (i, j) in toindices(extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: color(o) != ZERO)) 
               else (I[i+1][j+1] if 0 <= i+1 < len(I) and 0 <= j+1 < len(I[0]) else ZERO)
               for j in range(len(I[0]))) for i in range(len(I)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Grid Manipulation:** This version directly manipulates the grid using nested list comprehensions. 
2. **Identify and Replace:** It iterates through each cell (i, j) of the input grid `I`. If the cell belongs to the target object (identified in a similar way to version 1), it is set to 0. Otherwise, it takes the value of the cell diagonally down-right (I[i+1][j+1]), handling boundary conditions. 

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_27a28665(I):
    shifted_indices = mapply(lambda ind: (ind[0] + 1, ind[1] + 1), toindices(extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: color(o) != ZERO)))
    O = paint(cover(I, extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: color(o) != ZERO)), recolor(ONE, shifted_indices))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate Shifted Indices:** We first calculate the shifted indices of the target object using `mapply` to apply the `(ind[0] + 1, ind[1] + 1)` function (shifting down-right) to each index in the object.
2. **Paint with Shifted Indices:** We then use `recolor` to create a new object with the desired color at the shifted indices. This new object is then painted on a cleared version of the input grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_d631b094(I):
    obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: color(o) != ZERO)
    O = fill(I, mostcolor(I), toindices(obj))
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
        if 0 <= i+1 < len(I) and 0 <= j+1 < len(I[0]):
            O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i + 1, j + 1)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Fill Original Object:** We first fill the original object's location with the background color using `fill`.
2. **Iterate and Fill Shifted Position:**  We iterate through the indices of the original object and fill the corresponding diagonally shifted position on the output grid `O` with the original color.

These five program versions showcase different approaches and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the desired diagonal shift transformation, demonstrating diverse solutions to the given problem.
