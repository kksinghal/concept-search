## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects with a specific color (color '2' in these examples) and then extending these objects upwards by one cell. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
- The object with color '2' at the bottom is extended upwards by one cell.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- The vertical object with color '2' on the right side is extended upwards by one cell.
- Note that the extension stops when it encounters a cell with a different color ('1' in this case).

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
-  Similar to the previous examples, all objects with color '2' are extended upwards by one cell, stopping at any non-'2' cell.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

### Program Version 1: 

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  target_indices = ofcolor(I, 2)  # Get indices of all cells with color 2
  shifted_indices = mapply(lambda ind: (ind[0]-1, ind[1]), target_indices)  # Shift each index upwards by one unit
  return fill(I, 2, intersection(shifted_indices, asindices(I)))  # Fill the valid shifted indices with value '2'
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`target_indices = ofcolor(I, 2)`**: Identify the indices of all cells with the target color (2 in this case).
2. **`shifted_indices = mapply(lambda ind: (ind[0]-1, ind[1]), target_indices)`**: Create a new set of indices by shifting each target index one unit upwards.
3. **`return fill(I, 2, intersection(shifted_indices, asindices(I)))`**: Fill the input grid `I` with the target color (2) at the intersection of the shifted indices and the valid grid indices. This ensures that we only modify cells within the grid boundaries.

This approach directly manipulates indices, making it efficient and concise.


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  return paint(I, mfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: {(color(obj), (i-1,j)) for i,j in toindices(obj) if (i-1,j) in asindices(I)} if color(obj)==2 else set()))
```
**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, False)`**:  Extract all univalued objects from the input grid.
2. **`lambda obj: ... if color(obj)==2 else set()`**: For each object, check if its color is 2. 
    - If true, calculate the shifted indices of the object, ensuring they stay within the grid boundaries.
    - If false, return an empty set, effectively ignoring the object. 
3. **`mfilter(...)`**: Merge the resulting shifted indices of all target-colored objects.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`**: Paint the input grid with the merged shifted indices, effectively extending the target-colored objects upwards.

This version utilizes object-based manipulation, offering a different perspective on the task.


### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(1, height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] == 0 and I[i-1][j] == 2:
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`**: Initialize the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through the grid (excluding the first row) using nested loops**:
3. **`if I[i][j] == 0 and I[i-1][j] == 2`**: For each cell, check if it's empty (value 0) and the cell above it has the target color (2).
4. **`O = fill(O, 2, {(i,j)})`**: If the condition is met, fill the current cell in the output grid with the target color (2).

This iterative approach systematically examines each cell and its neighbor, making it easy to understand and modify.


### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  shifted_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))
  shifted_grid = paint(shifted_grid, shift(recolor(2, ofcolor(I, 2)), (-1, 0)))
  return cellwise(shifted_grid, I, 2) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))`**: Create a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.
2. **`shifted_grid = paint(shifted_grid, shift(recolor(2, ofcolor(I, 2)), (-1, 0)))`**: Paint the shifted indices of the target color (2) onto the canvas.
3. **`return cellwise(shifted_grid, I, 2)`**:  Perform a cell-by-cell comparison between the shifted grid and the input grid. If a cell in the shifted grid has the target color, use that color in the output; otherwise, use the color from the input grid.

This version leverages grid manipulations and comparisons, offering a different approach to achieving the transformation.


### Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, 2)
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (-1, 0)), target_objs)
  return paint(cover(I, merge(target_objs)), merge(shifted_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, F)`**: Extract all objects from the input grid.
2. **`target_objs = colorfilter(objs, 2)`**: Filter for objects with the target color (2).
3. **`shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (-1, 0)), target_objs)`**: Shift each target object upwards by one unit.
4. **`return paint(cover(I, merge(target_objs)), merge(shifted_objs))`**: First, cover the original target objects in the input grid with the background color. Then, paint the shifted objects onto the covered grid.

This version combines object-based manipulations with grid operations, offering a balanced and potentially efficient solution.

These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressive power of the DSL. Each version utilizes different combinations of functions and logic, highlighting the diversity of solutions possible within the constraints of the DSL.
