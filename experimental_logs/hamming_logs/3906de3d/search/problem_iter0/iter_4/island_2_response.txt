## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving all the objects made of '2' upwards until they hit another object or the top of the grid, leaving a trail of '0's behind.

**Input 0:**
- The single '2'-object moves two spaces upwards, filling the previous positions with '0'.

**Input 1:**
- The '2'-object at the bottom moves up until it hits another '2' above it.
- The '2'-object near the top moves up two spaces, stopping at the edge of the '1'-object.

**Input 2:**
- The '2'-object on the right moves upwards until it hits the bottom of the '1'-object.
- The two connected '2'-objects at the bottom move upwards until they hit the bottom of the first '2'-object.


## Program Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)  # Extract foreground objects
  grid = list(list(row) for row in I)  # Create a mutable copy of the grid
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:  # Process only '2'-objects
      for _, (i, j) in sorted(obj, key=lambda x: x[1][0], reverse=True):  # Iterate through object cells from bottom to top
        new_i = i - 1
        while new_i >= 0 and grid[new_i][j] == 0:  # Move upwards while encountering background color
          new_i -= 1
        grid[i][j] = 0  # Clear the original location
        grid[new_i + 1][j] = 2  # Paint the object at the new location
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in grid)  # Convert the modified grid back to immutable tuple 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** Foreground objects are extracted from the grid.
2. **Iterate through '2'-objects:**  The code focuses on objects made of '2'.
3. **Bottom-to-top iteration:** Cells within each '2'-object are processed from bottom to top to ensure correct movement.
4. **Upward movement:** The code moves each cell upwards until it encounters a non-zero value, indicating another object or the top of the grid.
5. **Painting and clearing:** The cell's original location is cleared, and it is painted at its new position.


## Program Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  grid = list(list(row) for row in I)  # Create a mutable copy of the grid
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  for j in range(w):  # Iterate through columns
    for i in range(h - 1, 0, -1):  # Iterate through rows from bottom to top
      if grid[i][j] == 2:  # Check if the cell contains a '2'
        new_i = i - 1
        while new_i >= 0 and grid[new_i][j] == 0:  # Find the next non-zero cell upwards
          new_i -= 1
        if new_i + 1 != i:  # If the '2' needs to be moved
          grid[new_i + 1][j] = 2  # Move the '2' up
          grid[i][j] = 0  # Clear the original position
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in grid)  # Convert the modified grid back to immutable tuple
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns:** The code processes the grid column by column.
2. **Bottom-to-top row iteration:**  For each column, rows are iterated from bottom to top.
3. **'2' detection and movement:** When a '2' is encountered, the code searches upwards for the next non-zero value. If a '0' is found in between, the '2' is moved upwards, leaving a '0' in its original position.


## Program Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def move_up(grid, i, j):
    if i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] == 0:
      grid[i-1][j] = 2
      grid[i][j] = 0
      move_up(grid, i-1, j) # Recursively move up
    return grid
  grid = list(list(row) for row in I)
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  for i in range(h-1, -1, -1):
    for j in range(w):
      if grid[i][j] == 2:
        grid = move_up(grid, i, j)
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Recursive movement:** Uses a recursive function `move_up` to move a '2' upwards until it hits a non-zero value. 
2. **Iterate and apply recursion:** Iterates through the grid from bottom to top and calls the `move_up` function for each '2' encountered.


## Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  grid = list(list(row) for row in I)
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  for j in range(w):
    twos = [(i,v) for i, v in enumerate(grid[:,j]) if v == 2]  # Find all '2's in the column
    others = [i for i, v in enumerate(grid[:,j]) if v != 2 and v != 0]  # Find all non-'2' and non-'0' in the column
    if twos:  # If there are any '2's in the column
      top_two = min(twos, key=lambda x: x[0])[0]  # Get the index of the topmost '2'
      if others:
        bottom_other = max(others)  # Get the index of the bottommost non-'2' and non-'0'
        if top_two > bottom_other:
          grid[bottom_other+1:top_two+1, j] = 2  # Fill the space between with '2's
          grid[top_two+1:, j] = 0  # Clear everything above the topmost '2'
      else:
        grid[:top_two+1, j] = 2  # If there are no other objects, fill everything above with '2's
        grid[top_two+1:, j] = 0  # Clear everything above the topmost '2'
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Column-wise processing:**  Processes the grid column by column.
2. **Identifying '2's and obstacles:** Finds the indices of all '2's and non-'2'/non-'0' values in each column.
3. **Conditional filling:** Based on the positions of the topmost '2' and the bottommost obstacle, fills the space in between with '2's and clears anything above.


## Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def gravity(grid, col):
    empty = [(i,v) for i,v in enumerate(grid[:,col]) if v == 0] # Find all empty cells
    twos = [(i,v) for i,v in enumerate(grid[:,col]) if v == 2]  # Find all '2' cells
    for i,v in reversed(empty): # Iterate through empty cells from bottom to top
      for j,w in reversed(twos): # Iterate through '2' cells from bottom to top
        if j > i: # If '2' is below empty cell
          grid[i][col] = 2
          grid[j][col] = 0
          twos[(j,w)] = (i, 2) # Update the position of the moved '2'
          break # Move to the next empty cell
    return grid
  grid = np.array(list(list(row) for row in I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    grid = gravity(grid, j)
  return tuple(map(tuple, grid))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Gravity function:** Defines a `gravity` function that simulates gravity within each column.
2. **Finding empty cells and '2' cells:**  Identifies empty cells and cells containing '2' in each column. 
3. **Simulating gravity:**  Iterates through empty cells from bottom to top and moves any '2' cell found below it upwards.


These are five different versions of the `Program_to_be_generated` function, each utilizing a different approach to achieve the desired transformation. They showcase diverse logic and DSL function combinations.
