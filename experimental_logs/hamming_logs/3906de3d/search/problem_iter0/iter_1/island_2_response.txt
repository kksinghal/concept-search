## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of a specific color (color 2) and moving them upwards within the grid. The movement is constrained to stay within the grid boundaries and does not displace other objects.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The object of color '2' at the bottom of the grid is moved upwards until it reaches the first non-zero value above it.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
-  Similar to the previous example, the objects of color '2' are moved upwards until they hit a non-zero value. 
-  Notice that the object on the right side merges with the existing '2' value.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- Again, the color '2' objects are moved upwards until they encounter a non-zero value. 
- Some objects merge with existing '2' values.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (min((-i, 0) for i in range(height(obj)+1) if all(index(I, add(loc, (-i, 0))) == 0 for loc in toindices(obj))), default=(0, 0))), colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 2))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 2)`:**  Extract objects of color 2 from the input grid `I`.
2. **`lambda obj: shift(obj, ...)`:** Defines a lambda function that takes an object `obj` and shifts it upwards.
3. **`(min((-i, 0) ...)`:**  Calculates the upward shift amount. It finds the minimum vertical distance to move the object so that it sits right above any non-zero cell.
4. **`if all(index(I, add(loc, (-i, 0))) == 0 ...`:** Checks if all cells above the object are 0 (empty) up to the calculated shift distance. 
5. **`apply(...)`:** Applies the lambda function (shifting logic) to each extracted object.
6. **`merge(...)`:**  Merges all shifted objects into a single object.
7. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged, shifted object onto the original grid `I`.

**Program Version 2**

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  def move_up(obj):
    for i in range(1, height(I) + 1):
      shifted = shift(obj, (-i, 0))
      if all(index(I, loc) == 0 for loc in toindices(shifted) if 0 <= loc[0] < height(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < width(I)):
        return shifted
    return obj
  return paint(I, merge(apply(move_up, colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 2)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 2)`:** Extracts objects of color 2.
2. **`move_up(obj)`:** Defines a function that iteratively attempts to move an object upwards until it encounters a non-zero cell or reaches the top of the grid.
3. **`shifted = shift(obj, (-i, 0))`:** Shifts the object upwards by `i` units.
4. **`if all(index(I, loc) == 0 ...)`:** Checks if the shifted object's cells are all located on empty cells within the grid boundaries. 
5. **`apply(move_up, ...)`:** Applies the `move_up` function to each color 2 object.
6. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the shifted objects.
7. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the result back onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3**

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 2)
  new_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    new_obj = set()
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      new_i = i
      while new_i > 0 and index(I, (new_i - 1, j)) == 0:
        new_i -= 1
      new_obj.add((v, (new_i, j)))
    new_objs.add(frozenset(new_obj))
  return paint(I, merge(new_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 2)`:** Extract color 2 objects.
2. **`for obj in objs:`:**  Iterate through each extracted object.
3. **`for v, (i, j) in obj:`:**  Iterate through each cell of the object.
4. **`while new_i > 0 and index(I, (new_i - 1, j)) == 0:`:** Move the cell upwards as long as it's within the grid and the cell above is empty.
5. **`new_obj.add((v, (new_i, j)))`:** Add the moved cell to the new object representation.
6. **`new_objs.add(frozenset(new_obj))`:**  Add the newly formed object to the set of new objects.
7. **`return paint(I, merge(new_objs))`:**  Paint the merged new objects onto the original grid.


**Program Version 4**

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  def shift_up(obj):
    shift_amount = min([i for i in range(height(obj) + 1) if all(index(I, add(loc, (-i, 0))) == 0 for loc in toindices(obj))], default=0)
    return shift(obj, (-shift_amount, 0))
  return paint(I, merge(apply(shift_up, colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 2))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), 2)`:** Extract objects with color 2.
2. **`shift_up(obj)`:**  Defines a function to calculate the appropriate upward shift for an object and then perform the shift.
3. **`shift_amount = min([...], default=0)`:**  Calculates the minimum upward shift possible while ensuring the object stays within the grid and doesn't collide with other non-zero cells.
4. **`apply(shift_up, ...)`:** Apply the `shift_up` function to each extracted object.
5. **`merge(...)`:** Merge the shifted objects.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paint the merged objects back onto the original grid.

**Program Version 5**

**Code:**
```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  def new_pos(i, j):
    for k in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
      if index(I, (k, j)) != 0:
        return k + 1, j
    return 0, j
  new_grid = [[0 for _ in range(width(I))] for _ in range(height(I))]
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) == 2:
        new_grid[new_pos(i, j)[0]][new_pos(i, j)[1]] = 2
      else:
        new_grid[i][j] = index(I, (i, j))
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`new_pos(i, j)`:** Defines a function that finds the new position of a cell at (i, j) after moving upwards.
2. **`new_grid = ...`:** Creates a new empty grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3. **`for i in range(height(I)):`:** Iterates through rows.
4. **`for j in range(width(I)):`:** Iterates through columns.
5. **`if index(I, (i, j)) == 2:`:** If the cell contains color 2, find its new position and update the new grid accordingly.
6. **`else:`:** Otherwise, copy the value from the input grid to the new grid.
7. **`return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)`:**  Return the newly constructed grid.
