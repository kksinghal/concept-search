## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (groups of connected, non-zero cells) in the input grid and shifting them one cell down and one cell right. The original object location is then filled with the background color (0), and the shifted object is recolored to the value 2. 

**Input 0:**

- The single '1' object is shifted down and right, leaving its original position as '0' and becoming a '2' object.
- The '2' object remains in place as it is not shifted.

**Input 1:**

- The '1' object is shifted down and right, with similar changes as in Input 0.
- The '2' object remains in place.

**Input 2:**

- The '1' object is shifted down and right.
- The '2' object remains in place.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 1:  # Only shift objects with color '1'
      O = paint(cover(O, obj), recolor(2, shift(obj, add(DOWN, RIGHT))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Iterates through each object in the input grid (`objects(I, T, F, T)`).
- Checks if the object's color is '1' (`color(obj) == 1`).
- If true, it covers the original object with background color (`cover(O, obj)`).
- Then, it repaints the object, shifted down and right, with color '2' (`recolor(2, shift(obj, add(DOWN, RIGHT)))`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_objects = sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1) # Filter objects before iteration
  O = paint(cover(I, merge(target_objects)), recolor(2, shift(merge(target_objects), add(DOWN, RIGHT))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Filters the objects to only keep those with color '1' (`sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)`).
- Merges the filtered objects into a single patch (`merge(target_objects)`).
- Covers the original object locations with background color (`cover(I, merge(target_objects))`).
- Recolors and shifts the merged object with color '2' (`recolor(2, shift(merge(target_objects), add(DOWN, RIGHT)))`) and paints it onto the grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices = toindices(extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: color(o) == 1)) # Extract indices directly
  shifted_indices = mapply(lambda ind: add(ind, (1, 1)), indices) # Shift indices directly
  O = paint(cover(I, extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: color(o) == 1)), recolor(2, shifted_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Extracts indices of the object with color '1' (`toindices(extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: color(o) == 1))`).
- Shifts all extracted indices down and right (`mapply(lambda ind: add(ind, (1, 1)), indices)`).
- Covers the original object with background color (`cover(I, extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: color(o) == 1))`).
- Recolors the shifted indices with color '2' (`recolor(2, shifted_indices)`) and paints it onto the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))  # Start with a blank canvas
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 1:
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(obj, add(DOWN, RIGHT))))  # Paint directly onto the canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid (`canvas(0, shape(I))`).
- Iterates through each object with color '1'.
- Shifts and recolors the object to '2' (`recolor(2, shift(obj, add(DOWN, RIGHT)))`).
- Directly paints the transformed object onto the blank canvas (`paint(O, ...)`).

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))  # Create a grid for the shifted object
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 1:
        shifted_grid = fill(shifted_grid, 2, {(i+1, j+1)})  # Fill shifted position with '2' if original is '1'
  return shifted_grid
```

**Explanation:**

- Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.
- Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
- If the cell value is '1', it fills the corresponding position in the shifted grid (down and right) with '2'.
- Returns the shifted grid as the output.

These five versions offer diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing different DSL functions and logic while ensuring the output grid is exactly as required.
