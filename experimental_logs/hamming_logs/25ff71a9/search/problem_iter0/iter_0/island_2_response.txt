## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking the input grids to the output grids involves moving the non-zero objects in the grid downwards. Let's break down the movement for each example:

* **Input 0:** The object "1 1 1" moves one row down.
* **Input 1:** The object "1 1 1" moves two rows down.
* **Input 2:** The object formed by "1 1 1" and "1" moves one row down.
* **Input 3:** The object "2 2" moves one row down, while the object "2" stays in the same position. 

It appears the transformation moves the objects down by a number of rows equal to the number of rows below the object that are completely filled with the background color (which is '0' in these examples).


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing the transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, False, False, True)  # Extract all non-background objects
  x2 = apply(lambda o: (o, lowermost(o)), x1) # Pair each object with its lowermost row index
  x3 = apply(lambda x: (x[0], len(I) - x[1] - 1), x2) # Calculate the number of empty rows below each object
  x4 = apply(lambda x: shift(x[0], (x[1], 0)), x3) # Shift each object downwards
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(x4)) # Create a blank canvas and paint the shifted objects
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. We identify all non-background objects in the input grid.
2. For each object, we find the row index of its lowest point.
3. We calculate the number of empty rows below each object by subtracting the object's lowest point from the grid height. 
4. Each object is then shifted downwards by the calculated number of rows.
5. Finally, we create a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid and paint the shifted objects onto it.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Start with a blank canvas
  for i in range(height(I) - 1, -1, -1): # Iterate through rows from bottom to top
    for obj in objects(crop(I, (i, 0), (1, width(I))), False, False, True): # Find objects in the current row
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (i - uppermost(obj), 0))) # Shift and paint the object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  We begin with a blank canvas of the same size as the input.
2.  We iterate through the rows of the input grid from bottom to top.
3.  For each row, we identify any non-background objects present.
4.  We calculate the downward shift required for each object to bring it to its correct position.
5.  We paint the shifted objects onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I # Initialize output as input
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True): # Iterate through non-background objects
    empty_rows = len(sfilter(I[lowermost(obj) + 1:], lambda r: len(set(r)) == 1)) # Count empty rows below
    O = move(O, obj, (empty_rows, 0)) # Move the object down by the counted empty rows
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. We initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. We iterate through each non-background object in the input.
3. For each object, we count the number of consecutive rows below it that contain only the background color.
4. We use the `move` function to shift the object downwards by the number of counted empty rows.


**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I 
  for i in range(height(I)-1, 0, -1):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != 0:
        k = i
        while k + 1 < height(I) and index(I, (k + 1, j)) == 0:
          k += 1
        O = paint(cover(O, {(index(O, (i, j)), (i, j))}), {(index(O, (i, j)), (k, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. We initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. We iterate through each cell of the input grid from bottom to top.
3. For each non-background cell, we find the lowest empty cell below it.
4. Then, we move the current cell to that lowest empty cell in the output grid.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  shifted_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    bottom_row = lowermost(obj)
    empty_rows = sum(1 for row in range(bottom_row + 1, height(I)) if all(v == 0 for v in I[row]))
    shifted_objs.add(shift(obj, (empty_rows, 0)))
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(shifted_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. We extract all non-background objects from the input grid.
2. For each object:
    - We determine its lowermost row.
    - We count the number of empty rows (containing only 0s) below the object.
    - We shift the object downwards by the number of empty rows.
3. We create a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.
4. Finally, we paint all the shifted objects onto the canvas to obtain the output grid. 

These are just a few examples, and many other variations are possible using the given DSL. Each version uses slightly different logic or combinations of functions to achieve the desired transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
