## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves removing the central columns from each object in the input grid, except for the top and bottom rows of each object. 

**Input_0:**

- The central columns of the '8' object and the '3' object are removed, but the top and bottom rows of these objects remain intact.
- The '6' and '7' objects remain unchanged, as they are only one column wide.

**Input_1:**

- The central three columns of the '2' object are removed, leaving only the leftmost and rightmost columns intact for all but the top and bottom rows.

**Input_2:**

- The central columns of the '5' and '4' objects are removed, but the top and bottom rows of these objects remain intact. 


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  transformed_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    top_row = min(i for v, (i, j) in obj)
    bottom_row = max(i for v, (i, j) in obj)
    transformed_obj = frozenset((v, (i,j)) for v, (i,j) in obj if i == top_row or i == bottom_row or leftmost(obj) == j or rightmost(obj) == j) 
    transformed_objs = combine(transformed_objs, transformed_obj)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), transformed_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, False)` identifies all distinct objects in the input grid `I`. 
2. **Iterate and Transform:** The code iterates through each `obj`.
3. **Find Top & Bottom Rows:** `top_row` and `bottom_row` store the row indices of the top and bottom rows of the current object.
4. **Conditional Inclusion:**  Cells are included in `transformed_obj` if they belong to the top or bottom row, or the leftmost or rightmost column of the object.
5. **Combine Objects:** `transformed_objs` accumulates all the modified objects.
6. **Construct Output:** A canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background color, is created. Then, the transformed objects are painted onto this canvas.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
        for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
            left_j = leftmost(frozenset((a,b) for v,(a,b) in obj if a==i))
            right_j = rightmost(frozenset((a,b) for v,(a,b) in obj if a==i))
            O = fill(O, index(I, (i,left_j)), {(i, left_j)})
            O = fill(O, index(I, (i,right_j)), {(i, right_j)}) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Create a canvas `O` of the same size and background color as input `I`.
2. **Iterate Objects and Rows:**  Iterate through each object and then each row within the object's bounding box.
3. **Find Leftmost and Rightmost:** For each row `i`, find the column indices `left_j` and `right_j` of the leftmost and rightmost cells of the object on that row.
4. **Fill Left and Right:**  Fill the canvas at the identified leftmost and rightmost cell positions with the original color from the input grid.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if width(obj) > 1:
      for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj)):
        O = fill(O, mostcommon(I), {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj) + 1, lowermost(obj))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, False)` identifies all distinct objects in the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Check Width:** The code iterates through each object and checks if its width is greater than 1.
3. **Fill Central Columns:** For objects wider than one column, it fills the central columns (excluding the first and last) with the background color, effectively removing them.
4. **Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned as the output.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
      if height(obj) > 2 and width(obj) > 2:
        start_row = uppermost(obj) + 1
        end_row = lowermost(obj)
        start_col = leftmost(obj) + 1
        end_col = rightmost(obj) 
        for i in range(start_row, end_row):
          for j in range(start_col, end_col):
            O = fill(O, mostcommon(I), {(i,j)})
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The code first identifies all objects in the input grid.
2. **Check Object Size:** It then iterates through each object and checks if its height and width are both greater than 2. This ensures that only objects with a potential "central column" are considered.
3. **Determine Column Range:** For eligible objects, it calculates the starting and ending column indices for the central column to be removed.
4. **Remove Central Column:** It then iterates through each cell within the specified column range and fills it with the background color. 

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj)):
            O = cover(O, {(i,j) for i in range(uppermost(obj) + 1, lowermost(obj))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** It begins by identifying all objects in the input grid.
2. **Iterate Over Columns:** For each object, the program iterates over the column indices within the object's boundaries, excluding the first and last columns.
3. **Cover Central Cells:** For each column, it identifies the cells belonging to the object in that column, excluding the top and bottom rows. These cells represent the "central column" to be removed. The `cover` function is then used to remove these cells by filling them with the background color. 
4. **Output:** Finally, the modified grid is returned as the output.
