## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve removing cells from the interior of objects, leaving only the border cells intact. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 / Output_0:**

* The '8' object loses its interior cells, leaving a single '8' cell on the left and right edges.
* The '3' object is similarly hollowed, retaining only its border cells.
* The '6' and '7' objects are transformed such that only their outer boundaries remain.

**Input_1 / Output_1:**

* The '2' object is hollowed out, leaving only a single '2' in the center of each side.

**Input_2 / Output_2:**

* The '5' object loses its interior, leaving only its border cells.
* The '4' object is similarly hollowed out, leaving a single '4' on each side.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, T, F, F)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), merge({toobject(box(obj), grid) for obj in objs}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(grid, T, F, F)` identifies all contiguous regions of the same color, excluding the background.
2. **Extract borders:** `box(obj)` finds the outer boundary indices of each object.
3. **Create empty canvas:** `canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))` generates a blank grid filled with the background color.
4. **Paint borders:** `toobject(box(obj), grid)` extracts the border cells from the original grid and `paint` draws them onto the canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), merge({toobject(delta(obj), grid) for obj in objects(grid, T, F, F)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(grid, T, F, F)` identifies all contiguous regions of the same color, excluding the background.
2. **Find delta indices:** `delta(obj)` identifies indices within the bounding box of each object that are NOT part of the object itself (i.e., the border).
3. **Create empty canvas:** `canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))` generates a blank grid filled with the background color.
4. **Paint borders:** `toobject(delta(obj), grid)` extracts the border cells from the original grid using delta indices and `paint` draws them onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  return cellwise(grid, fill(grid, mostcolor(grid), merge({inbox(obj) for obj in objects(grid, T, F, F)})), mostcolor(grid))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(grid, T, F, F)` identifies all contiguous regions of the same color.
2. **Find inboxes:** `inbox(obj)` finds the indices within the object's boundary, excluding the boundary itself.
3. **Fill inboxes:** `fill(grid, mostcolor(grid), merge({inbox(obj) for obj in objects(grid, T, F, F)}))` replaces all cells within the inboxes with the background color.
4. **Cellwise comparison:** `cellwise(grid, ... , mostcolor(grid))` compares the original grid with the filled grid and retains the original color only if it matches the filled grid (i.e., only for border cells), otherwise using the background color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(grid):
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)),
                 merge(apply(lambda obj: toobject(sfilter(backdrop(obj), lambda loc: any(n in toindices(obj) for n in dneighbors(loc))), grid), objects(grid, T, F, F))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(grid, T, F, F)` identifies contiguous regions of the same color.
2. **Get object backdrop:** `backdrop(obj)` returns indices within the bounding box of each object.
3. **Filter border indices:** For each index in the backdrop, it checks if any of its direct neighbors are part of the object using `dneighbors`. This effectively identifies border cells.
4. **Convert to object:** `toobject` extracts border cells from the original grid using the filtered indices.
5. **Paint on canvas:**  A blank canvas is created with the background color and the extracted border cells are painted onto it using `paint`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(grid):
    new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
    for obj in objects(grid, T, F, F):
        for i, j in toindices(obj):
            if any((n in toindices(obj) for n in dneighbors((i, j)))):
                new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(grid[i][j], (i, j))})
    return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(grid, T, F, F)` identifies contiguous regions of the same color.
2. **Iterate through cells:** It iterates through each cell within identified objects.
3. **Check for border cells:**  For each cell, it checks if any of its direct neighbors are not part of the object using `dneighbors`. This identifies border cells.
4. **Paint on canvas:** If a cell is a border cell, it is painted onto a blank canvas initialized with the background color.

These five programs represent distinct approaches to solving the problem using the provided DSL functions. Each version utilizes different logic and function combinations, demonstrating diverse solutions to achieve the same outcome.
