## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids seems to be **removing the second-to-last column of pixels from each distinct object** within the grid. 

Let's break it down for each example:

**Input_0:** 
- The object composed of "8"s loses its second-to-last column.
- The object composed of "3"s loses its second-to-last column.
- The objects composed of "6"s and "7"s remain unchanged as they only have one column.

**Input_1:**
- The object composed of "2"s loses its second-to-last column.

**Input_2:**
- The object composed of "5"s loses its second-to-last column.
- The object composed of "4"s loses its second-to-last column. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" function utilizing the DSL provided:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects from the grid
    new_objs = set()
    for obj in objs:
        if width(obj) > 1:
        # Find the second-to-last column index
            second_last_col = rightmost(obj) - 1 
            new_obj = frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j != second_last_col)
            new_objs.add(new_obj)
        else:
            new_objs.add(obj) 
    O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), new_objs)  # Paint the modified objects onto a blank canvas
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** This extracts all the objects from the input grid (`I`). 
2. **Iterate through objects:** For each object in the extracted set:
    - **`if width(obj) > 1:`:** If the object has more than one column, proceed to modify. 
    - **`second_last_col = rightmost(obj) - 1`:**  Calculate the index of the second-to-last column.
    - **`new_obj = ...`:** Create a new object (`new_obj`) by filtering out the cells in the `second_last_col`. 
3. **`paint(canvas(...), new_objs)`:** Create a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid filled with the background color (`mostcolor(I)`). Then, paint the modified objects (`new_objs`) onto this canvas.


**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    modified_objs = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1] != rightmost(obj) - 1) if width(obj) > 1 else obj, objs)
    O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), modified_objs)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses more compact functional programming style:

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Extract objects.
2. **`mapply(...)`:** Apply a lambda function to each object:
    - **`lambda obj: ...`:** If the object's width is greater than 1, filter its cells to exclude those in the second-to-last column (`cell[1][1] != rightmost(obj) - 1`). Otherwise, keep the object unchanged.
3. **`paint(...)`:**  Paint the modified objects onto a blank canvas.


**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if j == rightmost(objects(crop(I, (i,0), (1, width(I))), T, F, T)) - 1:
        O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through the input grid cell by cell:

1. **Iterate through rows and columns:**  The nested loops go through each cell of the input grid.
2. **`if j == ... :`:** Check if the current column (`j`) is the second-to-last column of the object present in the current row.
3. **`O = fill(...)`:** If the condition is true, fill the current cell with the background color.


**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  to_remove = mapply(lambda obj: {(uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj)-1), (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj)-1)}, objs)
  O = fill(I, mostcolor(I), to_remove)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version identifies and removes the specific cells to be deleted:

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Extract objects from the grid.
2. **`mapply(...)`:**  For each object, create a set containing the indices of the top and bottom cells in the second-to-last column.
3. **`fill(I, mostcolor(I), to_remove)`:** Fill the identified cells with the background color.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_I = hconcat((ZERO,), I)  # Add a dummy column at the beginning
  objs = objects(shifted_I, T, F, T)
  modified_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    if width(obj) > 2:
      modified_obj = frozenset((v, (i, j-1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j != 1)
      modified_objs.add(modified_obj)
    else:
      modified_objs.add(obj)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), modified_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a clever shifting technique:

1. **`shifted_I = hconcat((ZERO,), I)`:** Add a dummy column of zeros at the beginning of the grid.
2. **`objects(shifted_I, T, T, T)`:**  Extract objects from this shifted grid.  The second-to-last column of each original object is now the second column.
3.  **Iterate through objects:** For each object:
    - **`if width(obj) > 2:`:** Check if the object's width is greater than 2 (meaning it had more than one column originally).
    - **`modified_obj = ...`:**  Shift the object one column to the left and remove the first (dummy) column.
4. **`paint(...)`:** Paint the modified objects onto a blank canvas.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to solving the problem within the constraints of the given DSL. Each leverages various combinations of functions, illustrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for image manipulation tasks.
