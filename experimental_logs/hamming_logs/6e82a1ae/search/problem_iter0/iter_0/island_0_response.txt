## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation relabels each distinct object in the input grid with a unique identifier, starting from 1 and incrementing for each new object encountered. The background color (0 in these examples) remains unchanged. 

**Let's illustrate with an example:**

In **Input_0**, there are three distinct objects formed by the digit '5': 

1. Top-middle
2. Bottom-left
3. Right

The output **Output_0** relabels these objects as 1, 3, and 2 respectively. 

The same logic applies to **Input_1**, **Output_1** and **Input_2**, **Output_2** pairs.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)
  obj_map = {color(obj): i + 1 for i, obj in enumerate(objs)}
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      obj_map.get(v, v) for v in row
    ) for row in grid
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)`:** Extracts all distinct objects from the grid. `True, False, True` arguments ensure only identically colored, directly connected cells without background are considered a single object.
2. **`obj_map = {color(obj): i + 1 for i, obj in enumerate(objs)}`:**  Creates a dictionary mapping the color of each object to a unique identifier starting from 1.
3. **`return tuple(tuple(obj_map.get(v, v) for v in row) for row in grid)`:** Iterates through the grid. If a cell belongs to an object, it is replaced with its assigned identifier from `obj_map`, otherwise, it retains its original value.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  labeled = canvas(0, shape(grid))
  counter = 1
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v != 0 and labeled[i][j] == 0:
        obj = toobject(flood_fill((i, j), grid), grid)
        labeled = paint(labeled, recolor(counter, obj))
        counter += 1
  return labeled

def flood_fill(start, grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  target_color = grid[start[0]][start[1]]
  visited = set()
  queue = [start]
  while queue:
    i, j = queue.pop(0)
    if (i, j) in visited or not (0 <= i < h and 0 <= j < w) or grid[i][j] != target_color:
      continue
    visited.add((i, j))
    queue.extend([(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)])
  return frozenset(visited)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`labeled = canvas(0, shape(grid))`:** Initializes a canvas of the same size as the input, filled with 0s.
2. **`counter = 1`:**  Initializes a counter for object identifiers.
3. The program iterates through the grid. For each non-background cell (`v != 0`) not yet labeled (`labeled[i][j] == 0`):
   - **`obj = toobject(flood_fill((i, j), grid), grid)`:** Performs flood fill starting from the current cell to find all connected cells of the same color, forming an object.
   - **`labeled = paint(labeled, recolor(counter, obj))`:** Paints the detected object on the `labeled` canvas with the current `counter` value.
   - **`counter += 1`:**  Increments the counter for the next object.
4. **`return labeled`:** Returns the labeled canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      next((i+1 for i, obj in enumerate(objects(grid, True, False, True)) if (i, j) in toindices(obj)), v)
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    ) for i, row in enumerate(grid)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(grid, True, False, True)`:** Extracts all distinct objects from the grid, considering only identically colored, directly connected cells, excluding the background.
2. The code iterates through the grid and, for each cell, uses a nested generator expression:
   - **`(i+1 for i, obj in ... if (i, j) in toindices(obj))`:**  This generator yields the index (plus 1) of the object containing the current cell. `next(...)` retrieves the first such index, effectively labeling the cell with its object's identifier. If the cell doesn't belong to any object, `next(...)` defaults to the cell's original value (`v`).

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      sum((i+1) * ((i, j) in toindices(obj)) for i, obj in enumerate(objs)) or v
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    ) for i, row in enumerate(grid)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

 This version is similar to Version 3, but instead of `next` and a generator, it uses a sum over boolean conditions to achieve the labeling:

- **`sum((i+1) * ((i, j) in toindices(obj)) for i, obj in enumerate(objs))`:**  For each object, this part calculates `(i+1)` if the current cell `(i, j)` is part of that object (making the boolean condition `True` and multiplying by `i+1`), otherwise it adds `0` (boolean `False` in the multiplication). The `sum` accumulates these values, resulting in the object's identifier if the cell belongs to an object.
- **`... or v`:**  If the sum is 0 (meaning the cell wasn't part of any object), this part defaults to the cell's original value (`v`).

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  return modify_grid(grid, objects(grid, True, False, True), 1)

def modify_grid(grid, objs, counter):
  if not objs:
    return grid
  obj = next(iter(objs))
  grid = paint(grid, recolor(counter, obj))
  return modify_grid(grid, objs - {obj}, counter + 1)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`solve(grid)`:** Initiates the recursive object labeling process.
2. **`objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)`:** Extracts all distinct objects from the grid.
3. **`modify_grid(grid, objs, 1)`:**  Recursively labels each object with a unique identifier.
   - **`if not objs: return grid`:** Base case: If there are no more objects, return the modified grid.
   - **`obj = next(iter(objs))`:**  Get the first object from the set.
   - **`grid = paint(grid, recolor(counter, obj))`:**  Paint the current object on the grid with the `counter` value.
   - **`return modify_grid(grid, objs - {obj}, counter + 1)`:**  Recursively call the function with the remaining objects and incremented counter.

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the desired object labeling transformation, utilizing different DSL functions and logic constructs.
