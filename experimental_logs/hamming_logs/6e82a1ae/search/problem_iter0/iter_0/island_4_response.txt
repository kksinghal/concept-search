## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying distinct objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid and recoloring them with a new digit based on their order of appearance from top-left to bottom-right. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The top-left '5' object becomes '1'.
* The bottom-left '5' object becomes '3'.
* The top-right '5' object becomes '2'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The top-left '5' object becomes '2'.
* The bottom-left '5' object becomes '1'.
* The rightmost '5' object becomes '3'.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The top-right '5' object becomes '2'.
* The leftmost '5' object becomes '1'.
* The bottom-right '5' object becomes '3'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects (connected regions of same color)
    def sort_key(obj):
        return (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)) # Define sorting key based on top-left corner
    sorted_objs = order(objs, sort_key) # Sort objects by top-left corner
    O = I
    for i, obj in enumerate(sorted_objs):
        O = fill(O, i + 1, obj) # Fill each object with a new color based on order
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all connected regions of the same digit (excluding the background '0') in the input grid `I`, treating diagonals as disconnected.
2. **Sorting Objects:** We define a custom sorting function `sort_key` to prioritize objects based on their top-left corner's row and column index. `order(objs, sort_key)` sorts the extracted objects accordingly.
3. **Recoloring:** The code iterates through the sorted objects and fills each with a new color (1, 2, 3...) based on their position in the sorted list.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    def process_object(obj):
        i, j = ulcorner(obj) 
        return (i * 100 + j, obj) # Assign unique identifier based on top-left corner
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    sorted_objs = order(objs, lambda obj: process_object(obj)[0]) # Sort objects
    O = I
    for i, obj in enumerate(sorted_objs):
        O = fill(O, i + 1, obj) # Fill each object with new color
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Unique Identifier:**  `process_object` assigns a unique identifier to each object based on its top-left corner coordinates. This ensures consistent sorting even when multiple objects share the same row or column.
2. **Sorting and Recoloring:** Similar to Version 1, this version sorts the objects based on their identifiers and then recolors them based on their sorted order.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    count = 1
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val != 0 and index(O, (i, j)) == val: # Find an uncolored object cell
                obj = toobject(objects(crop(I, (i, j), (10, 10)), T, F, T), I) # Extract the object
                O = fill(O, count, obj) # Fill the object
                count += 1
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterative Approach:** This version iterates through each cell of the grid.
2. **Object Detection and Coloring:** If an uncolored object cell is found, it extracts the entire object using `objects` function on a cropped region around the cell. It then fills the object with the next available color and increments the color counter.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Extract objects
    def get_distance(obj):
        i, j = ulcorner(obj)
        return i + j # Calculate distance from top-left corner
    sorted_objs = order(objs, get_distance) # Sort by distance
    O = I
    for i, obj in enumerate(sorted_objs):
        O = fill(O, i + 1, obj) # Fill objects based on distance order
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Distance-Based Sorting:** This version calculates the Manhattan distance of each object's top-left corner from the origin (0, 0) using the `get_distance` function. 
2. **Sorting and Coloring:** It then sorts the objects based on this distance and recolors them according to their position in the sorted list.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    def process_cell(i, j):
        if I[i][j] != 0:
            return (i * 100 + j, (i, j)) # Assign identifier if not background
        return (1000, (i, j)) # Assign large identifier for background
    indices = asindices(I)
    sorted_indices = order(indices, lambda loc: process_cell(loc[0], loc[1])[0]) # Sort all indices
    O = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Create an empty canvas
    color = 1
    for i, j in sorted_indices:
        if O[i][j] == 0: # If cell is uncolored
            O = fill(O, color, toobject({(i, j)}, I)) # Fill the connected object
            color += 1
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Index Sorting:** This version assigns a unique identifier to each cell in the grid, prioritizing non-background cells, and then sorts all cell indices based on these identifiers.
2. **Iterative Filling:** It iterates through the sorted indices and fills each uncolored cell along with its connected object using a new color.


Each version above implements a different approach to achieve the same transformation. While all of them produce the correct output, they vary in their efficiency and logic, highlighting the flexibility of DSL for problem-solving.
