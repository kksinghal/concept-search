## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves relabeling each distinct object (connected component of non-background cells) in the input grid with a unique color, starting from 1 and incrementing for each new object. The background color remains unchanged.

**Example:**

Input:
```
0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 2 2
```

Output:
```
0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 2 2 
```

Here, the two objects formed by '1' and '2' are assigned labels '1' and '2' respectively, while the background '0' remains unchanged.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return paint_objects(objects(grid, True, False, True), shape(grid))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(grid, True, False, True)`:** Extracts all objects (connected components of non-background cells) from the input grid.
2. **`paint_objects(objects, shape(grid))`:** Iterates through the extracted objects and paints each object onto a blank canvas with the corresponding object index as the color. The canvas has the same dimensions as the input grid.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return label_grid(grid, mostcommon(grid))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mostcommon(grid)`:**  Identifies the background color in the grid.
2. **`label_grid(grid, bg_color)`:**  This helper function (defined below) iterates through the grid, and for each non-background cell, assigns a unique label using a flood-fill algorithm.

```python
def label_grid(grid, bg_color):
  labeled = canvas(0, shape(grid))
  label = 1
  for i in range(height(grid)):
    for j in range(width(grid)):
      if grid[i][j] != bg_color and labeled[i][j] == 0:
        label_connected_component(grid, labeled, (i, j), label, bg_color)
        label += 1
  return labeled

def label_connected_component(grid, labeled, start, label, bg_color):
  queue = [start]
  while queue:
    (i, j) = queue.pop(0)
    if 0 <= i < height(grid) and 0 <= j < width(grid) and grid[i][j] != bg_color and labeled[i][j] == 0:
      labeled[i][j] = label
      queue.extend([(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)])
```

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  labeled = canvas(0, shape(grid))
  object_id = 1
  for i in range(height(grid)):
    for j in range(width(grid)):
      if grid[i][j] != mostcommon(grid) and labeled[i][j] == 0:
        labeled = flood_fill_and_label(grid, labeled, (i, j), object_id)
        object_id += 1
  return labeled

def flood_fill_and_label(grid, labeled, start, label):
  queue = [start]
  while queue:
    (i, j) = queue.pop(0)
    if 0 <= i < height(grid) and 0 <= j < width(grid) and grid[i][j] != mostcommon(grid) and labeled[i][j] == 0:
      labeled[i][j] = label
      queue.extend([(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)])
  return labeled
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 2, but instead of using separate functions for labeling and flood-fill, it integrates the flood-fill logic directly within the main function. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return relabel_objects(objects(grid, True, False, True))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(grid, True, False, True)`:**  Extracts all objects (connected components of non-background cells) from the input grid.
2. **`relabel_objects(objects)`:** This helper function (defined below) takes the set of objects and assigns a unique label to each object.

```python
def relabel_objects(objects):
  labeled_grid = canvas(0, shape(objects))
  label = 1
  for obj in objects:
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
      labeled_grid = fill(labeled_grid, label, {(i, j)})
    label += 1
  return labeled_grid
```

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)
    labeled = canvas(0, shape(grid))
    for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
        labeled = paint(labeled, recolor(i + 1, obj))
    return labeled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(grid, True, False, True)`:** Extracts objects from the input grid.
2. **`canvas(0, shape(grid))`:** Creates a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3. **Iterate through objects:** For each object:
    -  **`recolor(i+1, obj)`:**  Recolors the object with a unique identifier (i+1).
    -  **`paint(labeled, ...)`:**  Paints the recolored object onto the canvas. 


These five program versions provide different implementations to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. Each version employs distinct logic or function combinations while adhering to the provided DSL functions.
