## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves labeling each distinct object (connected component) in the input grid with a unique identifier, starting from 1 and incrementing for each new object. The background color (most common color) remains unchanged. 

**Example:**

Input:
```
0 0 5 0 
0 5 5 0
0 0 0 5 
```

Output:
```
0 0 1 0
0 1 1 0
0 0 0 2
```

Here, the two connected components of '5' are assigned labels '1' and '2', while the background '0' remains unchanged. 

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  labeled = canvas(0, shape(grid))
  label = 1
  for i in range(height(grid)):
    for j in range(width(grid)):
      if grid[i][j] != mostcommon(grid) and labeled[i][j] == 0:
        labeled = flood_fill(grid, labeled, (i, j), label)
        label += 1
  return labeled

def flood_fill(grid, labeled, start, label):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  q = [start]
  visited = set()
  while q:
    i, j = q.pop()
    if (i, j) in visited:
      continue
    visited.add((i, j))
    if 0 <= i < h and 0 <= j < w and grid[i][j] != mostcommon(grid) and labeled[i][j] == 0:
      labeled = fill(labeled, label, {(i, j)})
      q.extend([(i + 1, j), (i - 1, j), (i, j + 1), (i, j - 1)])
  return labeled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates a `labeled` grid filled with '0' and initializes a `label` counter to 1.
2. **Iteration:** Iterates through each cell in the input `grid`.
3. **Object Detection:** If a cell is not the background color and is not yet labeled, it's considered a new object. 
4. **Flood Fill:**  The `flood_fill` function is called to label all connected cells of this new object with the current `label`.
5. **Label Increment:** After labeling the object, the `label` counter is incremented for the next object.

**Program Version 2:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return paint_objects(objects(grid, True, False, True), shape(grid))

def paint_objects(objs, dims):
  labeled = canvas(0, dims)
  label = 1
  for obj in objs:
    labeled = underpaint(labeled, recolor(label, toindices(obj)))
    label += 1
  return labeled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** Extracts objects (connected components) from the input `grid` using `objects(grid, True, False, True)` to get a set of objects excluding the background.
2. **Initialization:** Creates a `labeled` grid filled with '0' and initializes a `label` counter to 1.
3. **Object Painting:** Iterates through each object in the `objs` set. For each object:
    -  Recolors the object indices to the current `label` using `recolor(label, toindices(obj))`.
    -  Paints the recolored object onto the `labeled` grid using `underpaint`, ensuring only background cells are overwritten.
4. **Label Increment:** After painting the object, the `label` counter is incremented for the next object.

**Program Version 3:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return label_grid(grid, mostcommon(grid))

def label_grid(grid, bg_color):
  labeled = canvas(0, shape(grid))
  label = 1
  for i in range(height(grid)):
    for j in range(width(grid)):
      if grid[i][j] != bg_color and labeled[i][j] == 0:
        label_connected_component(grid, labeled, (i, j), label, bg_color)
        label += 1
  return labeled

def label_connected_component(grid, labeled, start, label, bg_color):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  stack = [start]
  while stack:
    i, j = stack.pop()
    if 0 <= i < h and 0 <= j < w and grid[i][j] != bg_color and labeled[i][j] == 0:
      labeled = fill(labeled, label, {(i, j)})
      stack.extend([(i + 1, j), (i - 1, j), (i, j + 1), (i, j - 1)])
  return labeled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Background Identification:** Determines the background color using `mostcommon(grid)`.
2. **Initialization:** Creates a `labeled` grid filled with '0' and initializes a `label` counter to 1.
3. **Iteration and Labeling:** Iterates through each cell in the input `grid`. If a cell is not the background color and not yet labeled:
    - It calls `label_connected_component` to label all connected cells with the current `label`.
    - Increments the `label` counter for the next object. 
4. **Connected Component Labeling:** The `label_connected_component` function uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to find and label connected cells belonging to the same object.

**Program Version 4:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return relabel_objects(objects(grid, True, False, True))

def relabel_objects(objs):
  labeled_grid = canvas(0, shape(next(iter(objs)))) if objs else canvas(0, (0, 0))
  label = 1
  for obj in objs:
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
      labeled_grid = fill(labeled_grid, label, {(i, j)})
    label += 1
  return labeled_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** Extracts the objects from the input grid, excluding the background using `objects(grid, True, False, True)`.
2. **Initialization:** Creates an empty `labeled_grid` with the same dimensions as the input.
3. **Object Relabeling:**  Iterates through each object in the `objs` set and assigns a unique label to all cells of the object. 

**Program Version 5:**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  labeled = canvas(0, shape(grid))
  object_id = 1
  for i in range(height(grid)):
    for j in range(width(grid)):
      if grid[i][j] != mostcommon(grid) and labeled[i][j] == 0:
        labeled = flood_fill_and_label(grid, labeled, (i, j), object_id)
        object_id += 1
  return labeled

def flood_fill_and_label(grid, labeled, start, label):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  q = [start]
  visited = set()
  while q:
    i, j = q.pop()
    if (i, j) in visited:
      continue
    visited.add((i, j))
    if 0 <= i < h and 0 <= j < w and grid[i][j] != mostcommon(grid) and labeled[i][j] == 0:
      labeled = fill(labeled, label, {(i, j)})
      q.extend([(i + 1, j), (i - 1, j), (i, j + 1), (i, j - 1)])
  return labeled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates a `labeled` grid of the same size as the input, filled with '0'. Starts with `object_id` as 1.
2. **Iteration:** Iterates over each cell in the input `grid`.
3. **New Object Detection:**  If a cell is not the background color and not yet labeled, it triggers the `flood_fill_and_label` function.
4. **Flood Fill and Labeling:**  The `flood_fill_and_label` function uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find all connected cells of the same color (object) and labels them with the current `object_id`. 
5. **Label Update:**  After labeling an object, the `object_id` is incremented to ensure each new object gets a unique label. 

These are five different approaches using various combinations of DSL functions, demonstrating diverse ways to achieve the desired connected component labeling transformation. Each version emphasizes different aspects of the task and employs distinct strategies, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
