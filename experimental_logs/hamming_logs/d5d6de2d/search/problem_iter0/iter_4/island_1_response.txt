## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation can be described as follows:

**For each object composed of '2's:**
1. **Identify the topmost row** of the object.
2. **Draw a horizontal line of '3's** starting from the column **immediately to the right of the object's rightmost cell** on the identified topmost row.
3. The line's length is equal to the **width of the object**.

**Examples:**

* **Input_0:** There are two objects made of '2's. The program draws a line of '3's to the right of each object, starting at the top row of each object.
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, a line of '3's is drawn to the right of the object.
* **Input_2:** Again, a line of '3's is drawn to the right of the object on its topmost row.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that implement the described transformation:

**Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      start_i = uppermost(obj)
      start_j = rightmost(obj) + 1
      line_width = width(obj)
      line = frozenset((start_i, j) for j in range(start_j, start_j + line_width))
      I = fill(I, 3, line)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** The code iterates through each object in the input grid `I` using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Check for color '2':**  If the object's color (`color(obj)`) is 2, proceed with drawing the line.
3. **Calculate line parameters:** Determine the starting row (`start_i`), starting column (`start_j`), and width (`line_width`) of the horizontal line.
4. **Create line indices:** Generate a set of indices (`line`) representing the horizontal line using `frozenset((start_i, j) for j in range(start_j, start_j + line_width))`.
5. **Fill with '3's:**  Use `fill(I, 3, line)` to overwrite the cells at the calculated `line` indices with the value '3'.
6. **Return modified grid:** After processing all objects, return the modified grid `I`.

**Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge({recolor(3, {(uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + j)}) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if color(obj) == 2 for j in range(width(obj))}))
```

**Explanation:**

This version condenses the logic into a single line by using function composition:

1. **Identify objects and create lines:** 
    * `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies objects in the grid.
    *  `if color(obj) == 2` filters for objects with color '2'.
    *  `for j in range(width(obj))` iterates for the line's width.
    *  `{(uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + j)}` defines each cell's index in the line.
    *  `recolor(3, ...)` assigns the value '3' to each cell index.
    *  `merge(...)` combines all individual cell indices into a single set.
2. **Paint the lines:** `paint(I, ...)` draws the lines onto the input grid `I` using the generated cell indices.
3. **Return modified grid:**  The modified grid is returned.

**Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_object(obj):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      start = (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)
      return recolor(3, connect(start, add(start, (0, width(obj) - 1))))
    return frozenset()
  return paint(I, merge(apply(process_object, objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes helper functions for clarity:

1. **`process_object(obj)` function:** 
    * Takes an object as input.
    * Checks if the object's color is '2'.
    * If true, calculates the line's start and end points, then uses `connect` and `recolor` to generate the line indices with color '3'.
    * Otherwise, returns an empty set.
2. **Main program logic:**
    * Extracts objects from the grid using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
    * Applies the `process_object` function to each object using `apply`.
    * Merges the results using `merge` to obtain all line indices.
    * Finally, paints these lines onto the grid `I` using `paint`.

**Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge({recolor(3, {(uppermost(obj), j)}) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if color(obj) == 2 for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + width(obj) + 1)})), I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a different approach by creating a separate grid for the lines:

1. **Create a blank canvas:**  A new grid of the same size as the input grid, filled with '0's, is created using `canvas(0, shape(I))`.
2. **Generate line indices and paint on the canvas:** This part is similar to Version 2, but instead of painting directly on the input grid, it paints the lines onto the newly created canvas.
3. **Combine the original grid and canvas:**  `cellwise` is used to combine the original grid and the canvas. The logic is to choose the value from the canvas if it's not '0', otherwise keep the value from the original grid.

**Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def draw_line(obj, I):
    if color(obj) != 2:
      return I
    start = (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)
    end = (start[0], start[1] + width(obj) - 1)
    return fill(I, 3, connect(start, end))
  return last(apply(rbind(draw_line, I), objects(I, T, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a recursive approach for drawing lines:

1. **`draw_line(obj, I)` function:**
    *  Takes an object and the current state of the grid as input.
    * If the object's color is '2', it calculates the line's start and end points and uses `fill` and `connect` to draw the line on the grid.
    * Otherwise, it returns the grid unchanged.
2. **Main program logic:**
    * Extracts objects from the grid.
    * Uses `rbind` to partially apply the `draw_line` function with the current grid `I`.
    *  Applies this partially applied function to each object using `apply`, creating a sequence of grids where each grid represents the state after drawing a line.
    * Finally, `last` selects the final grid in the sequence, which includes all the drawn lines.
