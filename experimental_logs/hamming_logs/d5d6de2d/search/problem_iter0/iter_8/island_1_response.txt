## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the horizontal extent of '2' valued objects in the input grid and drawing a vertical line of '3's immediately to the right of this extent. The line's height matches the vertical extent of the '2' valued object it's associated with. Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The '2' valued objects occupy columns 1-3 and 4-7.
* Two vertical lines of '3's are drawn, one starting at column 4 and another at column 8, both spanning rows 2-9 (same height as the corresponding '2' objects).

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* A single '2' valued object occupies columns 5-7.
* A vertical line of '3's is drawn starting at column 8, spanning rows 3-4 (matching the object's height).

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* Two '2' valued objects exist: one in columns 1-6 (rows 1-5) and another in columns 10-11 (rows 7-8).
* Two vertical '3' lines are drawn: one from column 7 (rows 2-5) and another from column 12 (rows 7-8), both matching the height of their respective '2' objects.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions for the "Program_to_be_generated" function:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)
  O = I
  for obj in twos:
    min_j = leftmost(obj)
    max_j = rightmost(obj)
    min_i = uppermost(obj)
    max_i = lowermost(obj)
    line = frozenset(((i, max_j + 1) for i in range(min_i, max_i + 1)))
    O = fill(O, 3, line)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '2' objects:** It identifies all objects formed by '2's in the grid.
2. **Iterate and draw lines:** For each '2' object:
    * Find the leftmost and rightmost column indices (min_j, max_j).
    * Find the uppermost and lowermost row indices (min_i, max_i).
    * Create a vertical line of indices starting from (max_j + 1) and spanning from min_i to max_i.
    * Fill the grid with '3' at the calculated line indices.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    if 2 in row:
      start_j = max([j for j, val in enumerate(row) if val == 2]) + 1
      O = fill(O, 3, frozenset((i, start_j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** It iterates through each row of the input grid.
2. **Find rightmost '2' and draw:** For each row containing a '2':
    * Find the column index (start_j) of the rightmost '2'.
    * Fill the grid with '3' at position (i, start_j + 1).

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  transposed = rot90(I)
  O = transposed
  for i, row in enumerate(transposed):
    if 2 in row:
      start_j = min([j for j, val in enumerate(row) if val == 2]) - 1
      if start_j >= 0:
        line = frozenset(((k, start_j) for k in range(len(transposed))))
        O = fill(O, 3, line)
  return rot270(O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transpose the grid:** Rotate the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise for easier column-wise processing.
2. **Iterate through columns:** Iterate through each row of the transposed grid (representing columns of the original grid).
3. **Find leftmost '2' and draw:** If a row contains '2':
   * Find column index (start_j) of the leftmost '2' and subtract 1.
   * Draw a vertical line of '3's at column index start_j across all rows.
4. **Rotate back:** Rotate the resulting grid back 90 degrees clockwise to obtain the final output.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
        for i in range(len(I)):
            if I[i][j] == 2:
                if j + 1 < len(I[0]):
                    O = fill(O, 3, frozenset(((k, j + 1) for k in range(len(I)))))
                break
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns:** It iterates through each column of the input grid.
2. **Find first '2' and draw:** For each column:
    * Iterate through rows until a '2' is encountered.
    * If a '2' is found and it's not the last column, draw a vertical line of '3's in the next column.
    * Break the inner loop (row iteration) after drawing the line.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    row = I[i]
    try:
      max_j = max([j for j, val in enumerate(row) if val == 2])
      line = frozenset(((k, max_j + 1) for k in range(h)))
      O = fill(O, 3, line)
    except:
      pass
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create an empty canvas:** Initialize an output grid of the same size as the input, filled with '0's.
2. **Iterate through rows:** Iterate through each row of the input grid.
3. **Find rightmost '2' and draw:** For each row:
   * Find the column index (max_j) of the rightmost '2'.
   * Draw a vertical line of '3's at column index (max_j + 1) across all rows on the output canvas.
   * Use a `try-except` block to handle cases where no '2' is present in the row.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation using different combinations of DSL functions. Each version is inspired by the provided programs but utilizes different logic and function calls, offering significant diversity in their implementation.
