## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the object composed of the digit '2' and applies the following logic:

**General Rule:** The '2' object is replaced with a horizontally compressed '3' object. The compression factor is half the width of the original object (rounding down to 1 if the width is less than 3).

**Specific Cases:**

* **Input_0:** The original '2' object with width 3 is compressed to a width of 1 and moved to the top-left corner of the original bounding box.
* **Input_1:** The '2' object with width 3 is compressed to a width of 1 and its position remains unchanged.
* **Input_2:** The '2' object with width 6 is compressed to a width of 3 and its position remains unchanged. 


## Program Version 1: 

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Identify the '2' object.
  obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 2))

  # 2. Calculate the new width of the compressed object.
  new_width = width(obj) // 2 if width(obj) > 2 else 1

  # 3. Create a new object with '3's and compressed width.
  new_obj = recolor(3, toindices(crop(I, ulcorner(obj), (height(obj), new_width))))

  # 4. Replace the original object with the compressed and recolored object.
  O = paint(cover(I, obj), new_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version identifies the '2' object.
2. It calculates the compressed width, ensuring a minimum width of 1.
3. It creates the new '3' object directly by cropping the original object to the new width and recoloring.
4. Finally, it paints the compressed object onto a copy of the input grid where the original object was erased.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Find the bounding box of the '2' object.
  obj_indices = toindices(first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 2)))

  # 2. Determine new width based on original width.
  new_width = max(1, width(obj_indices) // 2) 

  # 3. Construct the new object directly from indices.
  new_obj = frozenset({(3, (i, j)) for i, j in obj_indices if j < leftmost(obj_indices) + new_width})

  # 4. Overlay the new object onto the input grid, replacing the old one.
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_indices), new_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Instead of working with the object directly, this version focuses on its indices.
2. It calculates the new width like Version 1.
3. This version constructs the compressed '3' object by directly filtering and modifying the original object's indices based on the new width.
4. It then replaces the original object with the newly constructed one.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Get the '2' object.
  obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 2))

  # 2. Define a function to conditionally shrink horizontally.
  def shrink_if_wide(obj):
    return  crop(I, ulcorner(obj), (height(obj), max(1, width(obj) // 2))) if width(obj) > 2 else obj

  # 3. Apply shrinking and recoloring.
  O = paint(cover(I, obj), recolor(3, toindices(shrink_if_wide(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version identifies the '2' object.
2. It defines a helper function `shrink_if_wide` to encapsulate the conditional shrinking logic. This function shrinks the object horizontally if its width is greater than 2.
3.  It then applies this function, recolors the result to '3', and paints it onto the input grid after removing the original object.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Extract the '2' object's indices.
  obj_indices = toindices(first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 2)))

  # 2. Calculate the new width.
  new_width = width(obj_indices) // 2 if width(obj_indices) > 2 else 1

  # 3.  Generate new indices for the compressed object.
  new_indices = frozenset((i, j) for i, j in obj_indices if j < leftmost(obj_indices) + new_width)

  # 4. Create the new object using the generated indices.
  new_obj = frozenset((3, (i, j)) for i, j in new_indices)

  # 5. Replace the old object with the new one.
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_indices), new_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version extracts the indices of the '2' object.
2. It calculates the new width, considering a minimum of 1.
3. It generates new indices for the compressed object by filtering the original indices based on the new width.
4. It then uses these new indices to create the compressed '3' object.
5. Finally, it replaces the original object with the newly constructed object on the input grid. 


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Identify the '2' object.
  obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 2))

  # 2. Define shrinking and painting functions.
  shrink = lambda obj: crop(I, ulcorner(obj), (height(obj), max(1, width(obj) // 2)))
  paint_compressed = lambda obj: paint(cover(I, obj), recolor(3, toindices(shrink(obj))))

  # 3. Apply the functions to achieve the transformation.
  O = paint_compressed(obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version identifies the '2' object.
2. It defines two lambda functions: `shrink` for conditionally shrinking the object horizontally and `paint_compressed` for painting the shrunk and recolored object onto the grid.
3. It then elegantly chains these functions to perform the entire transformation. 

These diverse versions demonstrate different approaches and DSL function combinations to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
