## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to identify the upper-left corner of each connected component (object) in the input grid, considering diagonally connected cells as part of the same object. Then, it draws a horizontal line of length 3, with value '3', starting from the identified corner and extending to the right. This line is drawn on an empty canvas of the same size as the input grid.

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

**Pair 0:**

* **Input 0:** Two objects are present, one at the top and one at the bottom.
* **Output 0:**  Horizontal lines of '3's are drawn starting from the upper-left corner of each object on a blank canvas. 

**Pair 1:**

* **Input 1:** One object is present.
* **Output 1:** A single horizontal line of '3's is drawn starting from the upper-left corner of the object on a blank canvas.

**Pair 2:**

* **Input 2:** Two objects are present.
* **Output 2:** Horizontal lines of '3's are drawn starting from the upper-left corner of each object on a blank canvas.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, True, True) # Get all objects, considering diagonal connections
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) # Create empty canvas
  for obj in objs:
    start = ulcorner(obj) # Get upper-left corner
    O = underfill(O, THREE, {(start[0], start[1]), (start[0], start[1] + 1), (start[0], start[1] + 2)}) # Draw horizontal line
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, True, True)` extracts all connected components (objects) from the input grid (`I`). The parameters specify that we want objects with a single value (`True`), consider diagonal connections (`True`), and ignore the background color (`True`).
2. **Create Canvas:** `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))` creates an empty grid (`O`) of the same size as the input, filled with zeros.
3. **Iterate and Draw:** The code iterates over each identified object (`obj`). For each object:
    -  `ulcorner(obj)` gets the coordinates of the upper-left corner. 
    -  `underfill(O, THREE, {(start[0], start[1]), (start[0], start[1] + 1), (start[0], start[1] + 2)})` draws a horizontal line of '3's starting from the corner, extending three cells to the right.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def draw_line(obj):
    i, j = ulcorner(obj)
    return frozenset({(THREE, (i, j)), (THREE, (i, j+1)), (THREE, (i, j+2))})
  lines = mapply(draw_line, objects(I, True, True, True))
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), lines)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Draw Line Function:**  `draw_line(obj)` defines a function that takes an object and returns a set of cells representing a horizontal line of '3's starting from its upper-left corner.
2. **Apply and Paint:**
   - `objects(I, True, True, True)` extracts objects like in version 1.
   - `mapply(draw_line, ...)` applies the `draw_line` function to each object, generating sets of line cells. 
   - `paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), lines)` creates an empty canvas and paints the generated lines onto it.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_obj(obj):
    i, j = ulcorner(obj)
    return frozenset({(i, j), (i, j+1), (i, j+2)})
  return fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), THREE, merge(mapply(process_obj, objects(I, True, True, True)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Process Object Function:** `process_obj(obj)` takes an object and returns a set containing the indices for a 3-cell horizontal line starting at its upper-left corner.
2. **Merge and Fill:**
   - `mapply(process_obj, objects(I, True, True, True))` applies `process_obj` to each object and merges the results into a single set of indices.
   - `fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), THREE, ...)` creates an empty canvas and fills the specified indices with the value '3'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def line_indices(obj):
    i, j = ulcorner(obj)
    return ((i, j), (i, j + 1), (i, j + 2))
  indices = merge(apply(line_indices, objects(I, True, True, True)))
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), recolor(THREE, indices))
```

**Explanation:**
 
1. **Line Indices Function:** `line_indices(obj)` returns a tuple of indices representing a 3-cell horizontal line from the object's upper-left corner.
2. **Apply, Merge, Recolor and Paint:**
   - `apply(line_indices, objects(I, True, True, True))` applies `line_indices` to each object.
   - `merge(...)` combines the resulting tuples into a single set of indices.
   - `recolor(THREE, indices)` creates an object with the value '3' at the specified indices. 
   -  `paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), ...)` creates an empty canvas and paints the recoloured object onto it. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def draw_from_corner(obj):
    i, j = ulcorner(obj)
    return  frozenset({(THREE, (i, j + k)) for k in range(3)}) 
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(apply(draw_from_corner, objects(I, True, True, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Draw From Corner Function:** `draw_from_corner(obj)` takes an object, calculates its upper-left corner, and generates a set of cells representing a horizontal line of '3's originating from that corner.
2. **Apply, Merge, and Paint:**
    - `apply(draw_from_corner, objects(I, True, True, True))` applies `draw_from_corner` to each detected object.
    - `merge(...)` combines the generated cell sets.
    - `paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), ...)` creates a blank canvas and paints the combined cell sets onto it.
