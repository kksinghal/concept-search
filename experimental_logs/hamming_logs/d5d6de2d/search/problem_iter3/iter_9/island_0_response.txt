## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:**

1. **Identify:** Locate the object with color '2'.
2. **Upscale:** Enlarge the object by a factor of 3.
3. **Duplicate and Shift:** Create two copies of the upscaled object. Place the first copy at position (2, 2) and the second copy at position (6, 5) on a 10x10 canvas.
4. **Recolor:** Change the color of both upscaled objects to '3'.

**Input 1 -> Output 1:**

1. **Identify:** There is no object with color '2'.
2. **Create:** Generate a 10x10 canvas filled with '0'.
3. **Place:** Place a 1x2 object with color '3' at position (2, 5). 

**Input 2 -> Output 2:**

1. **Identify:** Locate the object with color '2'.
2. **Upscale:** Enlarge the object by a factor of 3.
3. **Place:** Place the upscaled object at position (2, 2) on a 15x15 canvas.
4. **Recolor:** Change the color of the upscaled object to '3'.

## Program Versions:

### Program Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == TWO, default=frozenset())
  canvas_size = (15, 15) if len(objects(I, True, False, True)) > ONE else (10, 10)
  O = canvas(ZERO, canvas_size)
  if len(obj) > 0:
    if canvas_size == (10, 10):
      O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(upscale(obj, THREE), (TWO, TWO))))
      O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(upscale(obj, THREE), (SIX, FIVE))))
    else:
      O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(upscale(obj, THREE), (TWO, TWO))))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, {(TWO, FIVE),(THREE, FIVE)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses `extract` with a default value to handle the case when no object of color '2' exists.
- It adjusts the canvas size and placement of the upscaled object based on the number of objects in the input.
- For Input 1, it explicitly creates and places the 1x2 object.

### Program Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  obj = next((obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == TWO), frozenset())
  canvas_size = (15, 15) if len(objs) > ONE else (10, 10)
  O = canvas(ZERO, canvas_size)
  if len(obj) > 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(upscale(obj, THREE), (TWO, TWO))))
    if canvas_size == (10, 10):
      O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(upscale(obj, THREE), (SIX, FIVE))))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, {(TWO, FIVE),(THREE, FIVE)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates through the objects to find the one with color '2' instead of using `extract`.
- It maintains similar logic for canvas size and placement as Version 1.

### Program Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = next((recolor(THREE, shift(upscale(obj, THREE), (TWO, TWO))) for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) == TWO), frozenset())
  canvas_size = (15, 15) if len(objects(I, True, False, True)) > ONE else (10, 10)
  O = canvas(ZERO, canvas_size)
  if len(obj) > 0:
    O = paint(O, obj)
    if canvas_size == (10, 10):
      O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(upscale(extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == TWO, default=frozenset()), THREE), (SIX, FIVE))))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, {(TWO, FIVE),(THREE, FIVE)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version performs the recoloring and shifting of the object within the object identification step.
- It simplifies the painting process by directly using the modified object.

### Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  canvas_size = (15, 15) if colorcount(I, TWO) > 1 else (10, 10)
  O = canvas(ZERO, canvas_size)
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    if color(obj) == TWO:
      O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(upscale(obj, THREE), (TWO, TWO))))
      if canvas_size == (10, 10):
        O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(upscale(obj, THREE), (SIX, FIVE))))
      break  
  if canvas_size == (10, 10) and colorcount(I, TWO) == 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, {(TWO, FIVE),(THREE, FIVE)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses `colorcount` to determine the canvas size.
- It directly iterates through the objects and applies the transformation to the first object with color '2' found.
- It handles the case of Input 1 separately after processing all objects.


### Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = next((obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) == TWO), None)
  if obj is not None:
    canvas_size = (15, 15) if len(objects(I, True, False, True)) > 1 else (10, 10)
    O = canvas(ZERO, canvas_size)
    O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(upscale(obj, THREE), (TWO, TWO))))
    if canvas_size == (10, 10):
      O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(upscale(obj, THREE), (SIX, FIVE))))
  else:
    O = canvas(ZERO, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, {(TWO, FIVE),(THREE, FIVE)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses `next` with a sentinel value (None) to identify the target object.
- It determines the canvas size and applies the transformations based on whether the target object was found.
- It explicitly handles the case of no target object.


Each version uses slightly different logic and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the desired output, demonstrating a diverse set of solutions for the given transformation.
