## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to be as follows:

**For 2x2 input grids:**

1. **Create a 10x10 output grid filled with zeros.**
2. **Identify non-background objects in the input grid.**
3. **For each object:**
   - **Create a 3x3 object filled with threes.**
   - **Place this object at position (1,4) on the output grid.**
   - **If the object is a rectangle (height = 3), create another 3x3 object filled with threes and place it at position (6,4) on the output grid.**

**For input grids other than 2x2:**

1. **Create a 15x15 output grid filled with zeros.**
2. **Identify non-background objects in the input grid.**
3. **For each object:**
   - **Create a rectangle filled with threes with a height three times the original object's height and width three times the original object's width.**
   - **Place this object at position (1,4) on the output grid.**
   - **If the object is a rectangle, create another identical rectangle filled with threes and place it at position (6,4) on the output grid.**

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN)) if len(I) == TWO else canvas(ZERO, (15, 15)) # Canvas size based on input
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    h = height(obj) * THREE # New height
    w = width(obj) * THREE # New width
    O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(crop(canvas(THREE, (h, w)), ORIGIN, (h, w)), (ONE, FOUR)))) # Top object
    if height(obj) == width(obj): # Check if object is a square
      O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(crop(canvas(THREE, (h, w)), ORIGIN, (h, w)), (SIX, FOUR)))) # Bottom object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each object in the input, scales it by three, and paints it with the value '3' at specific locations on the output grid. It also checks if the object is a square (height equals width) and paints a duplicate at a lower position if true.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN)) if shape(I) == (TWO, TWO) else canvas(ZERO, (15, 15)) # Canvas size check
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    scaled_obj = upscale(obj, THREE)
    O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(scaled_obj, (ONE, FOUR)))) # Top object
    if square(obj): # Check if object is a square
      O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(scaled_obj, (SIX, FOUR)))) # Bottom object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the `square()` function for a more concise check for square objects. It also pre-computes the `scaled_obj` for efficiency.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  canvas_size = (TEN, TEN) if len(I) == TWO else (15, 15) # Determine canvas size
  O = canvas(ZERO, canvas_size)
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    h, w = multiply(shape(obj), THREE) # Calculate new height and width
    base_obj = crop(canvas(THREE, (h, w)), ORIGIN, (h, w))
    O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(base_obj, (ONE, FOUR)))) # Top object
    if square(obj): # Check if object is a square
      O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(base_obj, (SIX, FOUR)))) # Bottom object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version pre-computes the `canvas_size` and directly calculates new height and width using `multiply()`. It also pre-computes the `base_obj` for further code clarity.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  is_small = len(I) == TWO # Check if input is small
  O = canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN) if is_small else (15, 15)) # Canvas size based on check
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    h, w = height(obj) * THREE, width(obj) * THREE # New height and width
    obj_to_paint = crop(canvas(THREE, (h, w)), ORIGIN, (h, w))
    O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(obj_to_paint, (ONE, FOUR)))) # Top object
    if square(obj): # Check if object is a square
      O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(obj_to_paint, (SIX, FOUR)))) # Bottom object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version pre-computes the `is_small` boolean for readability. It also calculates new height and width directly in the assignment and renames the object to be painted.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN) if shape(I) == (TWO, TWO) else (15, 15)) # Canvas size with shape check
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    scaled_obj = upscale(obj, THREE) # Scale the object
    top_obj = shift(scaled_obj, (ONE, FOUR)) # Position the top object
    O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, top_obj)) 
    if square(obj): # Check for square object
      bottom_obj = shift(scaled_obj, (SIX, FOUR)) # Position the bottom object
      O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, bottom_obj)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version checks the canvas size using `shape(I)` for conciseness. It also pre-computes the positions of both top and bottom objects for better code organization.
