## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a 2x2 input grid and generates an output grid with a specific pattern based on the presence and location of the digit '2' in the input:

**Input_0:** 
- The '2' at (1,1) leads to a 3x3 block of '3's positioned at the bottom right of a 10x10 grid. 
- The block's upper-left corner is offset from the grid's bottom-right corner by (3,3).

**Input_1:**
-  No '2' in the input results in a single column of '3's centered horizontally on a 10x10 grid, spanning from the 3rd to the 4th row.

**Input_2:**
- Similar to Input_0, the '2' at (1,1) dictates the placement of a 3x3 block of '3's.
- However, the output grid is now 15x15, and the block is positioned at the top-left, offset by (2,2) from the grid's top-left corner.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
  s = shape(canvas(0, maximum(shape(I))))
  O = canvas(0, (s[0] + 8, s[1] + 8))
  if 2 in merge(I):
    x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
    x2 = sizefilter(x1, ONE)
    x3 = toindices(first(x2))
    O = fill(O, 3, shift(product(interval(TWO, FIVE, ONE), interval(TWO, FIVE, ONE)), add((SEVEN, SEVEN), x3)))
  else:
    O = fill(O, 3, product(interval(THREE, FIVE, ONE), interval(FOUR, FIVE, ONE)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Determine Output Grid Size:**  
   - `s = shape(canvas(0, maximum(shape(I))))` calculates the size of the largest input grid.
   - `O = canvas(0, (s[0] + 8, s[1] + 8))` creates an output grid 8 units larger in each dimension.
2. **Check for '2':** 
   -  `if 2 in merge(I)` determines if the digit '2' exists in the input grid.
3. **Handle '2' Presence:**
   - `x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies objects in the input (single cells in this case).
   - `x2 = sizefilter(x1, ONE)` filters for objects of size one (individual cells).
   - `x3 = toindices(first(x2))` extracts the index of the cell containing '2'.
   - `O = fill(O, 3, shift(product(interval(TWO, FIVE, ONE), interval(TWO, FIVE, ONE)), add((SEVEN, SEVEN), x3)))` creates the 3x3 block of '3's, offset based on the '2' location.
4. **Handle '2' Absence:**
   - `O = fill(O, 3, product(interval(THREE, FIVE, ONE), interval(FOUR, FIVE, ONE)))` creates the centered vertical line of '3's.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
  if 2 in merge(I):
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
      for j, val in enumerate(row):
        if val == 2:
          O = canvas(0, (TEN, TEN))
          return fill(O, 3, product(interval(i + 7, i + 10, ONE), interval(j + 7, j + 10, ONE)))
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (TEN, TEN))
    return fill(O, 3, product(interval(THREE, FIVE, ONE), interval(FOUR, FIVE, ONE)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Output Grid and '2' Check:** Similar to Version 1, it creates a 10x10 output grid and checks for '2' in the input.
2. **Locate '2':** It iterates through the input grid to find the row ( `i`) and column (`j`) of the '2'.
3. **Fill Based on '2' Location:**  If '2' is found, it fills a 3x3 area with '3's, offset from the '2's location by (7, 7).
4. **Default Fill:** If no '2' is present, it fills a centered vertical line with '3's as in the previous versions. 


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
  s = maximum(shape(I))
  O = canvas(0, (s + 8, s + 8))
  if s == TWO:
    if 2 in merge(I):
      x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
      x2 = sizefilter(x1, ONE)
      x3 = toindices(first(x2))
      O = fill(O, 3, shift(product(interval(TWO, FIVE, ONE), interval(TWO, FIVE, ONE)), add((SEVEN, SEVEN), x3)))
    else:
      O = fill(O, 3, product(interval(THREE, FIVE, ONE), interval(FOUR, FIVE, ONE)))
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (s + 13, s + 13))
    if 2 in merge(I):
      x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
      x2 = sizefilter(x1, ONE)
      x3 = toindices(first(x2))
      O = fill(O, 3, shift(product(interval(TWO, FIVE, ONE), interval(TWO, FIVE, ONE)), add((TWO, TWO), x3)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Determine Output Grid Size:** 
   - `s = maximum(shape(I))` finds the maximum dimension of the input grid.
   - It creates an output grid either (s+8)x(s+8) for 2x2 input or (s+13)x(s+13) for other input sizes. 
2. **Input Size Check:**  
   - `if s == TWO` branches the logic based on whether the input is 2x2 or not.
3. **Handle 2x2 Input:** If 2x2, it follows the logic of previous versions (check for '2' and fill accordingly).
4. **Handle Other Inputs:** 
   - It assumes a different output grid size and offsets the 3x3 block of '3's by (2,2) from the '2's location.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(0, (TEN, TEN))
  if 2 in I[ONE]:
    O = canvas(0, (TEN, TEN))
    return fill(O, 3, product(interval(SEVEN, TEN, ONE), interval(SEVEN, TEN, ONE)))
  elif 2 in I[ZERO]:
    O = canvas(0, (FIFTEEN, FIFTEEN))
    return fill(O, 3, product(interval(TWO, FIVE, ONE), interval(TWO, FIVE, ONE)))
  else:
    O = canvas(0, (TEN, TEN))
    return fill(O, 3, product(interval(THREE, FIVE, ONE), interval(FOUR, FIVE, ONE)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Default Grid:** Creates a 10x10 output grid.
2. **Check '2' Row:** Checks if '2' is present in the second row (`I[ONE]`) or the first row (`I[ZERO]`) of the input.
3. **Fill Based on Row:**
   - If '2' is in the second row, it fills a 3x3 block of '3's at the bottom right of the 10x10 grid.
   - If '2' is in the first row, it creates a 15x15 grid and fills a 3x3 block at the top left.
4. **Default Fill:** If no '2' is found, it creates a centered vertical line of '3's on a 10x10 grid.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
  s = maximum(shape(I))
  O = canvas(0, (s + 8, s + 8)) if s == TWO else canvas(0, (s + 13, s + 13))
  if 2 in merge(I):
    x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
    x2 = sizefilter(x1, ONE)
    x3 = toindices(first(x2))
    offset = (SEVEN, SEVEN) if s == TWO else (TWO, TWO)
    O = fill(O, 3, shift(product(interval(TWO, FIVE, ONE), interval(TWO, FIVE, ONE)), add(offset, x3)))
  else:
    O = fill(canvas(0, (TEN, TEN)), 3, product(interval(THREE, FIVE, ONE), interval(FOUR, FIVE, ONE))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Combined Grid Creation:**  Calculates output grid size based on input size and creates the grid in a single line using a conditional expression.
2. **Find '2' and Calculate Offset:**  Similar to other versions, it locates the '2' (if present). It then determines the correct offset for the 3x3 block based on the input grid size.
3. **Fill or Create Centered Line:** It either fills the 3x3 block at the calculated offset or creates the default centered vertical line if no '2' is found.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing a range of DSL function combinations and logical structures.
