## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a simple 2x2 input grid and produces a larger output grid containing a specific pattern based on the input. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The input contains a single '2' object.
* The output is a 10x10 grid.
* The '2' object is transformed into two 3x2 '3' rectangles. 
* One rectangle is placed at the top-center, the other at the bottom-center.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The input is entirely '0' (background).
* The output is a 10x10 grid.
* Two 1x2 '3' lines are placed vertically at the center.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

*  Similar to Input_0, but the output is a 15x15 grid.
*  The '2' object is transformed into a 3x3 '3' square.
*  The square is placed at the top-center. 

**Overall Logic:**

* The transformation scales the output grid size based on the input.
* It identifies non-background objects ('2' in this case).
* It recolors these objects to '3'.
* It creates specific shapes (rectangles/squares/lines) with the recolored value.
* It positions these shapes at specific locations in the output grid. 

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL functions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_5614dbcf(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, multiply(shape(I), (FIVE, FIVE))) # Create scaled canvas
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True): # Iterate over objects
    s = colorcount(obj, TWO) # Count '2's in object
    if s == ONE: # If single '2', create two rectangles
      O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(upscale(obj, THREE), (ONE, FOUR))))
      O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(upscale(obj, THREE), (SIX, FOUR))))
    else: # Else, create lines/squares
      O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(upscale(obj, s), (THREE, FOUR))))
      O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(upscale(obj, s), (FOUR, FOUR))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Scaling:** The `canvas` function creates a 10x10 (or 15x15) grid filled with '0'.
2. **Object Iteration:** It iterates over non-background objects in the input.
3. **Shape Differentiation:** Based on the count of '2's, it creates either rectangles (for a single '2') or lines/squares.
4. **Upscaling and Recoloring:**  It upscales the object, recolors it to '3', and positions it.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_5614dbcf(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN)) if len(I) == TWO else canvas(ZERO, (15, 15)) # Canvas based on input size
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    h = height(obj) * THREE # Calculate new height
    w = width(obj) * THREE # Calculate new width
    O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(crop(canvas(THREE, (h, w)), ORIGIN, (h, w)), (ONE, FOUR)))) # Top object
    if h == THREE: # Place bottom object only if it's a rectangle
      O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(crop(canvas(THREE, (h, w)), ORIGIN, (h, w)), (SIX, FOUR)))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Creates a 10x10 or 15x15 canvas based on input height.
2. **Object Processing:** Iterates over non-background objects.
3. **Shape Calculation:** Determines the height and width of the output shapes.
4. **Shape Drawing:** Uses `crop` and `canvas` to create rectangles or squares filled with '3', then positions them.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_5614dbcf(I):
  f = FIVE if len(I) == TWO else EIGHT # Factor for shifting
  O = canvas(ZERO, multiply(shape(I), (f, f))) # Scaled canvas
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(upscale(obj, THREE), (ONE, FOUR)))) # Top object
    if colorcount(obj, TWO) == ONE: # Place bottom object if single '2'
      O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(upscale(obj, THREE), (f - TWO, FOUR))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Dynamic Shifting:** Calculates a shifting factor based on input size.
2. **Canvas and Object Handling:** Similar to previous versions, creates a canvas and iterates over objects.
3. **Conditional Placement:** Positions the top object and conditionally places the bottom object if a single '2' is present.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_5614dbcf(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN)) if len(I) == TWO else canvas(ZERO, (15, 15)) # Canvas based on input size
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    if colorcount(obj, TWO) == ONE: # Handle single '2' case
      r1 = shift(upscale(obj, THREE), (ONE, FOUR))
      r2 = shift(upscale(obj, THREE), (SIX, FOUR))
      O = paint(paint(O, recolor(THREE, r1)), recolor(THREE, r2)) # Draw both rectangles
    else: # Handle other cases (lines/squares)
      s = height(obj) * THREE
      O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(crop(canvas(THREE, (s, s)), ORIGIN, (s, s)), (THREE, FOUR))))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Contextual Drawing:**  Creates a canvas and iterates, but specifically handles single '2' and other cases separately.
2. **Direct Rectangle Placement:**  For single '2', it directly calculates and paints both rectangles.
3. **Simplified Other Cases:**  For lines/squares, it uses a simpler approach with `crop` and `canvas`.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_5614dbcf(I):
  scale = (FIVE, FIVE) if len(I) == TWO else (EIGHT, EIGHT)
  O = canvas(ZERO, multiply(shape(I), scale))  # Scale canvas
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    if colorcount(obj, TWO) == ONE:
      O = underpaint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(upscale(obj, THREE), (ONE, FOUR))))
      O = underpaint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(upscale(obj, THREE), (scale[0] - TWO, FOUR))))
    else:
      size = height(obj) * THREE
      square = crop(canvas(THREE, (size, size)), ORIGIN, (size, size))
      O = underpaint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(square, (THREE, FOUR))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Scaling:** Calculates scaling factors based on input size and creates the canvas.
2. **Object-Specific Actions:** Iterates through objects and performs actions based on the count of '2's.
3. **Underpainting:**  Utilizes `underpaint` to draw shapes onto the canvas only where the background color exists.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to the transformation, utilizing different combinations of DSL functions and logic flow.
