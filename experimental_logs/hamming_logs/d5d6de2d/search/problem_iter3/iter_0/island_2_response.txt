## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (clusters of the same digit) in the input grid and scaling them up.  The scaling factor seems to be related to the object's size in the input:

* **Input 0:** The single '2' is scaled up to a 3x2 rectangle of '3's.
* **Input 1:**  There are no objects (besides the background '0'), so the output remains a grid of '0's. 
* **Input 2:** The single '2' is scaled up to a 3x3 square of '3's.

It appears the scaling factor is determined by converting the input digit to its numerical value and using that for either the height or width of the output object. The other dimension is consistently '3'.  The output object's digit is always '3', regardless of the input digit.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the code, each with a different approach to achieving the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Extract objects
  scaled_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    value = color(obj)  # Get object's digit value
    if value != 0: 
      height_factor = value 
      scaled_obj = upscale(obj, height_factor)  # Scale vertically
      scaled_obj = recolor(3, scaled_obj)  # Recolor to '3'
      scaled_objs = insert(scaled_obj, scaled_objs)
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), merge(scaled_objs)) # Paint on a 10x10 canvas
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies objects in the input grid.
2. **Scale and Recolor:** For each object:
    - `color(obj)` retrieves the digit value.
    - `upscale(obj, height_factor)` scales the object vertically by the digit value.
    - `recolor(3, scaled_obj)` changes the object's color to '3'.
3. **Paint on Canvas:** `paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), merge(scaled_objs))` creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0' and paints the scaled objects onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = partition(I)  # Partition the grid into objects
  scaled_objs = mapply(lambda obj: upscale(recolor(3, obj), color(obj)), sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) != 0)) 
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I) * 5), scaled_objs)  # Paint on a canvas 5 times larger
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition:** `partition(I)` divides the grid into objects based on digit value.
2. **Scale, Recolor, and Filter:** 
    - `sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) != 0)` keeps only non-background objects.
    - `mapply(...)` applies scaling and recoloring to each remaining object.
3. **Paint:** `paint(canvas(0, shape(I) * 5), scaled_objs)` creates a canvas 5 times larger than the input and paints the objects.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  scaled_grid = tuple(tuple(3 if I[i//3][j] != 0 else 0 for j in range(len(I[0]))) for i in range(len(I) * 3))
  O = crop(scaled_grid, (0, 0), (10, 10)) # Crop to 10x10
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Scaling:** This version directly creates a scaled grid by iterating and checking for non-zero values in the input.
2. **Crop:** `crop(scaled_grid, (0, 0), (10, 10))` extracts a 10x10 section from the scaled grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) # Start with a 10x10 canvas
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) != 0:
      factor = color(obj)
      for i, j in toindices(obj):
        for k in range(factor):
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i*factor + k, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Iteration:** Similar to version 1, it iterates over extracted objects.
2. **Manual Scaling:** Instead of `upscale`, it manually fills in the output grid based on the scaling factor.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] != 0: 
        factor = I[i][j]
        for k in range(factor):
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i * factor + k, j)}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Iteration:** Iterates directly over the input grid.
2. **Conditional Scaling:**  If a non-zero value is encountered, it performs the scaling by filling in the output grid.

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to solving the problem using the DSL functions, showcasing different ways to extract objects, scale, recolor, and paint on the grid.
