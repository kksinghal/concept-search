## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grid can be described as follows:

* **Vertical Scaling:** Each non-zero digit in the input grid results in a vertically scaled rectangle in the output grid. The height of the rectangle is determined by the value of the digit.
* **Horizontal Scaling:** All scaled rectangles have a fixed width of 3 in the output grid.
* **Color Change:** All scaled rectangles in the output grid have a value of 3, regardless of the original digit value in the input grid.
* **Positioning:** The scaled rectangles are positioned at the same horizontal location as their corresponding digit in the input grid. If the input grid contains only zeros, the output grid is a 10x10 grid filled with zeros. Otherwise, the output grid has a height of 10 and a width of 5 times the width of the input grid.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing the transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = partition(I)  # Partition the input grid into objects
  def transform_object(obj):
    c = color(obj)  # Get the color of the object
    if c == 0:
      return obj  # Return 0-valued objects unchanged
    scaled_obj = vupscale(recolor(3, hconcat(((0,), (0,), (0,))), obj), c)  # Create a 3-wide rectangle and upscale vertically
    return asobject(scaled_obj) # Convert back to object
  transformed_objs = frozenset(transform_object(obj) for obj in objs)
  canvas_width = width(I) * 5 if any(color(obj) != 0 for obj in objs) else width(I) * 10 # Calculate canvas width
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, canvas_width)), transformed_objs)  # Paint transformed objects onto a canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition:** The input grid is partitioned into objects based on the values of the cells.
2. **Transform Object:** For each object, if the color is 0, it remains unchanged. Otherwise, a 3-wide rectangle is created and vertically scaled by the object's color value. This rectangle is then converted back to an object.
3. **Canvas Creation:** The canvas width is determined based on the presence of non-zero values in the input. If non-zero values are present, the width is 5 times the input grid width. Otherwise, it is 10 times the input grid width. A canvas of height 10 is created.
4. **Painting:**  The transformed objects are painted onto the canvas.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_cell(i, j, v):
    if v == 0:
      return {(0, (i * 10 + k, j * 5)) for k in range(10)}
    else:
      return {(3, (i * 10 + k, j * 5 + l)) for k in range(v) for l in range(3)}
  O = canvas(0, (10, width(I) * 5))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      O = paint(O, process_cell(i, j, v))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Process Cell:** This function takes the cell coordinates and value as input. If the value is 0, it returns a set of cells representing a 10x1 rectangle filled with 0 at the corresponding location in the output grid. If the value is non-zero, it returns a set of cells representing a rectangle with a height equal to the cell value and a width of 3, filled with 3, at the corresponding location in the output grid.
2. **Canvas Creation:** A canvas of height 10 and width 5 times the width of the input grid is created.
3. **Iterate and Paint:** The program iterates over each cell in the input grid and applies the `process_cell` function. The output of `process_cell` is then painted onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  canvas_width = width(I) * 5 if any(v != 0 for row in I for v in row) else width(I) * 10
  O = canvas(0, (10, canvas_width))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v != 0:
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, frozenset((i * 10 + k, j * 5 + l) for k in range(v) for l in range(3))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Same logic as in Version 2.
2. **Iterate and Paint:** This version iterates over the input grid and directly creates and paints the scaled rectangles for non-zero values. The `recolor` function is used to set the value of the rectangle cells to 3.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def scale_and_recolor(v, i, j):
    return {(3, (i * 10 + k, j * 5 + l)) for k in range(v) for l in range(3)} if v else {(0, (i * 10 + k, j * 5)) for k in range(10)}
  canvas_width = width(I) * 5 if any(v != 0 for row in I for v in row) else width(I) * 10
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, canvas_width)), merge(prapply(scale_and_recolor, interval(0, height(I), 1), interval(0, width(I), 1), I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Scale and Recolor:** This function combines the scaling and recoloring logic. It takes a value, row index, and column index as input. Based on the value, it returns either a set representing a 10x1 rectangle filled with 0 or a set representing a scaled rectangle filled with 3.
2. **Canvas Creation:** Same logic as in Version 2 and 3.
3. **Apply and Paint:** The `prapply` function applies the `scale_and_recolor` function to each cell in the input grid, and the results are merged and painted onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def transform_row(row, row_index):
    transformed = tuple()
    for col_index, value in enumerate(row):
      transformed += ((3,) * 3 if value else (0,) * 10)
    return frozenset((3, (row_index * 10 + i, j)) for i, v in enumerate(transformed) for j in range(len(v)))
  transformed_rows = frozenset(transform_row(row, i) for i, row in enumerate(I))
  canvas_width = width(I) * 5 if any(v != 0 for row in I for v in row) else width(I) * 10
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, canvas_width)), merge(transformed_rows))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transform Row:** This function iterates over each cell in a row and creates a tuple representing the transformed row.  Non-zero values are replaced with a sequence of three 3s, and zero values are replaced with a sequence of ten 0s. This tuple is then converted to a set of cell coordinates with the appropriate color.
2. **Transform Rows:** The `transform_row` function is applied to each row in the input grid, resulting in a set of transformed rows.
3. **Canvas Creation:** Same logic as in previous versions.
4. **Painting:** The transformed rows are merged and painted onto the canvas.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformation while utilizing a variety of DSL functions. They showcase the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for spatial reasoning and manipulation tasks.
