## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects with the color '2' in the input grid and paints them with color '3' onto a new canvas. The size of the canvas and the position of the painted object depend on the presence of the color '2' in the input:

**Input_0 & Output_0:**

* **Input:** Contains the color '2'.
* **Transformation:** 
    * A 10x10 canvas is created.
    * The object with color '2' is identified.
    * The object is shifted down by 6 rows and right by 5 columns. 
    * The shifted object is painted with color '3' onto the canvas.

**Input_1 & Output_1:**

* **Input:** Does not contain the color '2'.
* **Transformation:** 
    * A 10x10 canvas is created.
    * No object with color '2' exists, so no painting occurs.

**Input_2 & Output_2:**

* **Input:** Contains the color '2'.
* **Transformation:** 
    * A 15x15 canvas is created.
    * A 3x3 square of color '3' is painted onto the canvas, offset from the top left corner by 2 rows and 2 columns.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  has_two = 2 in palette(I)
  obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: color(o) == 2) if has_two else frozenset()
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if has_two:
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(obj, (6, 5))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Object:** It checks for the presence of color '2' and extracts the corresponding object.
2. **Create Canvas:** Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0'.
3. **Conditional Painting:** If color '2' exists in the input:
    * The extracted object is shifted down by 6 rows and right by 5 columns.
    * The shifted object is recolored to '3'.
    * The recolored object is painted onto the canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  size = (10, 10)
  O = canvas(0, size)
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(obj, (6, 5))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:**  Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0'.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Iterates through each object in the input:
    *  If the object's color is '2':
        * The object is shifted down by 6 rows and right by 5 columns.
        * The shifted object is recolored to '3'.
        * The recolored object is painted onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 2:
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(3, (i + 6, j + 5))}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0'.
2. **Iterate Cells:** Iterates through each cell in the input grid.
3. **Conditional Painting:** If a cell's value is '2':
    *  A single-cell object with color '3' is created at the shifted location (down 6, right 5).
    *  This object is painted onto the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  indices = ofcolor(I, 2)
  shifted_indices = shift(indices, (6, 5))
  O = fill(O, 3, shifted_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0'.
2. **Find Target Indices:**  Identifies the indices of all cells with value '2' in the input.
3. **Shift Indices:** Shifts the found indices down by 6 rows and right by 5 columns.
4. **Fill Canvas:** Fills the canvas with color '3' at the shifted indices.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = next((o for o in partition(I) if color(o) == 2), frozenset())
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(obj, (6, 5))))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Object:**  Partitions the input into objects based on color and extracts the object with color '2'.
2. **Create Canvas:** Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with '0'.
3. **Paint Shifted Object:** 
    * The extracted object is shifted down by 6 rows and right by 5 columns.
    * The shifted object is recolored to '3'.
    * The recolored object is painted onto the canvas. 

These versions showcase different approaches using loops, object manipulation, and direct index manipulation, offering diverse solutions within the DSL's capabilities.
