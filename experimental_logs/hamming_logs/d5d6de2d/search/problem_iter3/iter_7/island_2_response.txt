## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a 2x2 input grid and generates a 10x10 (for input with only 0s) or 10x15 (for inputs with non-zero values) output grid. The key aspects are:

* **Non-zero values trigger scaling:**  If the input contains a non-zero value, the output grid is 10x15. Otherwise, it remains 10x10.
* **Value-dependent horizontal scaling:** The non-zero value in the input grid determines the horizontal scaling factor for a 3x3 block of 3s in the output.
* **Vertical positioning:** The vertical position of the 3x3 block in the output grid is determined by the row index of the non-zero value in the input.
* **Single-pixel object for all-zero input:** If the input grid only contains 0s, a single pixel with value 3 is placed at coordinates (4, 5) in the output.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = partition(I)
  def transform_obj(obj):
    c = color(obj)
    return recolor(3, upscale(shift(obj, (2, c * 5)), (3, c * 3))) if c else (
      recolor(3, {(4, 5)}) if len(objs) == 1 else obj
    )
  transformed_objs = frozenset(transform_obj(obj) for obj in objs)
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 15 if any(palette(I) - {0}) else 10)), merge(transformed_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition:** The input grid `I` is partitioned into objects based on color using `partition(I)`.
2. **Object Transformation:** 
   - The function `transform_obj` processes each object `obj`:
     - `color(obj)` extracts the color `c` of the object.
     - If `c` is not 0:
       - The object is shifted horizontally by 2 units using `shift(obj, (2, c * 5))`.
       - It's then upscaled by a factor of 3 vertically and `c * 3` horizontally using `upscale`.
       - Finally, the color is changed to 3 using `recolor(3, ...)`.
     - If `c` is 0:
       - If it's the only object (all-zero input), a single-pixel object is created at (4, 5) using `recolor(3, {(4, 5)})`.
       - Otherwise, the object remains unchanged.
3. **Painting:**
   - A canvas is created with dimensions 10x15 if a non-zero value exists in the input, otherwise 10x10, using `canvas(0, (10, 15 if any(palette(I) - {0}) else 10))`.
   - All transformed objects are merged using `merge(transformed_objs)`.
   - Finally, the merged objects are painted onto the canvas using `paint`.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_cell(i, j, val):
    return recolor(3, {(i * 3 + k, j * 5 * val + l) for k in range(3) for l in range(3 * val)}) if val else (
      {(3, (4, 5))} if all(v == 0 for row in I for v in row) else frozenset()
    )
  transformed_cells = frozenset(process_cell(i, j, v) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(row))
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 15 if any(palette(I) - {0}) else 10)), merge(transformed_cells))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Cell-wise Processing:**
   - The function `process_cell` operates on individual cell coordinates (i, j) and its value `val`.
   - If `val` is not 0:
     - A 3x(3 * `val`) block of cells with value 3 is created at position (i * 3, j * 5 * `val`) using set comprehension.
     - This achieves both scaling and positioning based on the cell value.
   - If `val` is 0:
     - If it's an all-zero input, a single-pixel object at (4, 5) is returned.
     - Otherwise, an empty set is returned.
2. **Painting:**
   - Similar to version 1, a canvas is created based on the presence of non-zero values in the input.
   - Transformed cells are merged and then painted onto the canvas.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_row(row, row_index):
    transformed = tuple((3,) * v * 3 for v in row)
    return frozenset((3, (row_index * 3 + i, j)) for i, v in enumerate(transformed) for j in range(len(v))) if any(row) else (
      frozenset((3, (4, 5))) if row_index == 0 and all(v == 0 for r in I for v in r) else frozenset()
    )
  transformed_rows = frozenset(process_row(row, i) for i, row in enumerate(I))
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 15 if any(palette(I) - {0}) else 10)), merge(transformed_rows))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Row-wise Processing:**
   - The function `process_row` handles each row individually along with its index `row_index`.
   - For each row:
     - A new tuple `transformed` is created where each value `v` is replaced with a sequence of `v * 3` 3s. This handles the horizontal scaling.
     - If the row contains at least one non-zero value (`any(row)`):
       - A set of cells with value 3 is created, spanning the scaled width and positioned based on `row_index`.
     - If the row is all-zeroes:
       - A single-pixel object is created at (4, 5) only if it's the first row and the entire input grid is all-zeroes.
2. **Painting:**
   - Similar to previous versions, a canvas is created and the transformed rows are merged and painted.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def scale_and_reposition(obj):
    c = color(obj)
    i, j = ulcorner(obj)
    return recolor(3, {(i * 3 + k, j * 5 * c + l) for k in range(3) for l in range(3 * c)}) if c else (
      recolor(3, {(4, 5)}) if len(partition(I)) == 1 else obj
    )
  transformed_objs = frozenset(scale_and_reposition(obj) for obj in partition(I))
  O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 15 if any(palette(I) - {0}) else 10)), merge(transformed_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition and Process:**
   - This version directly iterates over objects from `partition(I)`.
2. **Object Scaling and Repositioning:**
   - `scale_and_reposition` takes an object `obj`:
     - It extracts the color `c` and upper-left corner coordinates (i, j).
     - If `c` is not 0:
       - It creates a 3x(3 * `c`) block of 3s at position (i * 3, j * 5 * `c`) for scaling and positioning.
     - If `c` is 0:
       - If it's the only object, it creates a single-pixel object at (4, 5).
       - Otherwise, it returns the object unchanged.
3. **Painting:**
   -  The process of canvas creation and painting is similar to previous versions.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  transformed_grid = tuple(
    tuple(3 if v else 0 for k in range(3) for v in repeat(val, v * 3)) 
    for i, row in enumerate(I) for val in row
  )
  if any(palette(I) - {0}):
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 15)), frozenset((3, (i * 3, j)) for i, row in enumerate(transformed_grid) for j, v in enumerate(row) if v == 3))
  else:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), {(3, (4, 5))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Grid Transformation:**
   - This version first transforms the entire grid using nested loops and list comprehensions.
   - For each value `val` in each row:
     - It repeats the value `v * 3` times and creates a sequence of 3s or 0s accordingly.
     - This generates a new grid with horizontal scaling applied.
2. **Conditional Painting:**
   - If the input grid contains non-zero values, a 10x15 canvas is created.
   - The transformed grid is then iterated over, and cells with value 3 are painted onto the canvas at their scaled positions.
   - If the input grid is all-zeroes, a 10x10 canvas is created, and only the single-pixel object at (4, 5) is painted.
