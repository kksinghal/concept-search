## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the object formed by the digit '2' in the input grid and rendering a scaled-up version of this object with the digit '3' in the output grid. The size and position of the output canvas and the scaled object vary based on the number of occurrences of '2' in the input:

**Input_0 & Output_0:**

* **Input:** A single '2' object.
* **Output:**  A 10x10 canvas with a single 3x3 '3' object positioned near the top left corner.

**Input_1 & Output_1:**

* **Input:** No '2' objects.
* **Output:** A 10x10 canvas with no '3' objects.

**Input_2 & Output_2:**

* **Input:**  A single '2' object.
* **Output:** A 15x15 canvas with a single 3x3 '3' object positioned near the top left corner.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions for the "Program_to_be_generated" function:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == TWO, default=frozenset())
  canvas_size = (15, 15) if len(objects(I, True, False, True)) > ONE else (10, 10)
  O = canvas(ZERO, canvas_size)
  if len(obj) > 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(upscale(obj, THREE), (TWO, TWO))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '2' Object:** `extract(objects(...))` finds the object formed by '2's. 
2. **Determine Canvas Size:**  `canvas_size` is set to (15, 15) if there are multiple objects in the input, else (10, 10).
3. **Create Canvas:** `canvas()` generates a blank canvas with the determined size.
4. **Paint Scaled Object:** If a '2' object exists, it's upscaled by 3, shifted, recolored to '3', and painted onto the canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  obj = next((obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == TWO), frozenset())
  O = canvas(ZERO, (15, 15) if len(objs) > 1 else (10, 10))
  if len(obj) > 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, upscale(shift(obj, (2, 2)), THREE)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects()` finds all objects in the input grid.
2. **Find '2' Object:**  It iterates through `objs` to find the object containing '2'.
3. **Dynamic Canvas:** The canvas size is determined based on the number of objects.
4. **Paint if '2' Exists:** If a '2' object is found, it's shifted, upscaled, recolored, and painted.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2, default=frozenset())
  O = canvas(0, (15, 15)) if colorcount(I, 2) > 1 else canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if len(obj) > 0:
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(upscale(obj, 3), (2, 2))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '2' Object:**  Finds the object with color '2', defaults to an empty set if not found.
2. **Canvas Based on '2' Count:** Creates a 15x15 canvas if multiple '2's are present, else a 10x10 canvas.
3. **Conditional Painting:** If a '2' object exists, it's upscaled, shifted, recolored to '3', and painted onto the canvas. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  two_objects = sfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == TWO)
  canvas_size = (15, 15) if len(two_objects) > 1 else (10, 10)
  O = canvas(ZERO, canvas_size) 
  if len(two_objects) > 0:
    obj = first(two_objects)
    O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(upscale(obj, THREE), (TWO, TWO))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Filter for '2' Objects:**  `sfilter` finds all objects formed by the digit '2'.
2. **Canvas Size Logic:** Determines canvas size based on the number of '2' objects.
3. **Process First '2' Object:** If '2' objects exist, the first one is selected.
4. **Transform and Paint:** The selected object is upscaled, shifted, recolored, and painted.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = next((obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) == 2), frozenset())
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) 
  if len(obj) > 0:
    O = canvas(0, (15, 15)) if len(objects(I, True, False, True)) > 1 else O
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(upscale(obj, 3), (2, 2))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '2' Object:** Extracts the first object with color '2', defaults to an empty set.
2. **Initial Canvas:** Creates a 10x10 canvas.
3. **Conditional Canvas Resize:** If more than one object exists in the input, the canvas is resized to 15x15.
4. **Paint if '2' Exists:** If a '2' object was found, it's upscaled, shifted, recolored, and painted onto the canvas.
