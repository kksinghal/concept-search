## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a 2x2 or larger grid and creates a new grid, either 10x10 or sized according to the input grid.  It then draws a 3x3 square of 3s on the new grid. The location of the square depends on:

* **Presence of a '2' in the input grid:** If a '2' exists, the 3x3 square's upper-left corner is placed at the '2's location, offset by a fixed amount. This offset is (5, 4) for 2x2 grids and (1, 1) for larger grids.
* **Absence of a '2' in the input grid:** If no '2' exists, the 3x3 square is placed at a default location. This default location is at (2, 5) on a 10x10 grid (upper-left corner basis).  The location on larger grids is not specified by the examples.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  s = maximum(shape(I))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) if s == TWO else canvas(0, (s + 13, s + 13))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 2:
        offset = (FIVE, FOUR) if s == TWO else (ONE, ONE)
        square = canvas(3, (THREE, THREE))
        return paint(O, shift(asobject(square), add(offset, (i, j))))
  return fill(O, 3, product(interval(TWO, FIVE, ONE), interval(FIVE, EIGHT, ONE))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to previous programs, it calculates the maximum dimension 's' and creates the output canvas 'O'.
2. **Finding '2':** Iterates through the input 'I' to find a cell with value '2'.
3. **Placing the Square:** If a '2' is found at (i, j):
   -  It creates the 3x3 square using `canvas(3, (THREE, THREE))`.
   -  It then shifts the square to the correct position based on the offset and (i, j) using `shift` and `add`.
   -  Finally, it paints the shifted square onto the output canvas using `paint` and returns the result.
4. **Default Placement:** If no '2' is found, it fills a 3x3 area at the default location with 3s using `fill` and `product` and returns the canvas.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  s = maximum(shape(I))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) if s == TWO else canvas(0, (s + 13, s + 13))
  two_indices = ofcolor(I, 2)
  if two_indices:
    i, j = first(two_indices)
    offset = (FIVE, FOUR) if s == TWO else (ONE, ONE)
    return fill(O, 3, toindices(shift(canvas(3, (THREE, THREE)), add(offset, (i, j))))) 
  else:
    return fill(O, 3, product(interval(TWO, FIVE, ONE), interval(FIVE, EIGHT, ONE)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Finding '2':**  Uses `ofcolor(I, 2)` to directly get the indices of cells with value '2'.
3. **Placing the Square:** If `two_indices` is not empty:
   - It gets the first occurrence of '2' using `first(two_indices)`.
   - It calculates the offset based on the grid size.
   - It shifts a 3x3 canvas of 3s by the offset plus the (i, j) location of '2'.
   - Finally, it fills the output canvas with '3' at the indices determined by the shifted canvas and returns the result.
4. **Default Placement:** Similar to Version 1.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  s = maximum(shape(I))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) if s == TWO else canvas(0, (s + 13, s + 13))
  try:
    i, j = next((i, j) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, val in enumerate(row) if val == 2)
    offset = (FIVE, FOUR) if s == TWO else (ONE, ONE)
    return paint(O, shift(asobject(canvas(3, (THREE, THREE))), add(offset, (i, j))))
  except StopIteration:
    return fill(O, 3, product(interval(TWO, FIVE, ONE), interval(FIVE, EIGHT, ONE)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Similar to Version 1.
2. **Finding '2':** Uses a generator expression within `next` to find the first occurrence of '2' and its indices (i, j).  A `StopIteration` exception is raised if no '2' is found.
3. **Placing the Square:**  If a '2' is found:
   - It calculates the offset.
   - It creates a 3x3 canvas of 3s, converts it to an object, and shifts it based on the offset and (i, j).
   - It paints this shifted object onto the output canvas and returns the result.
4. **Default Placement:** If `StopIteration` is caught, it means no '2' was found. It proceeds with the default placement using `fill` and `product` as in previous versions.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  s = maximum(shape(I))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) if s == TWO else canvas(0, (s + 13, s + 13))
  two_loc = next(((i, j) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, val in enumerate(row) if val == 2), None)
  if two_loc:
    offset = (FIVE, FOUR) if s == TWO else (ONE, ONE)
    return fill(O, 3, backdrop(shift(canvas(3, (THREE, THREE)), add(offset, two_loc))))
  else:
    return fill(O, 3, product(interval(TWO, FIVE, ONE), interval(FIVE, EIGHT, ONE)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Similar to previous versions.
2. **Finding '2':** Uses a generator expression within `next` to find the first '2' and its indices. Returns `None` if no '2' is found.
3. **Placing the Square:** If `two_loc` is not `None`:
   -  Calculates the offset based on the grid size.
   -  Creates a 3x3 canvas of 3s and shifts it by the offset and `two_loc`.
   -  Uses `backdrop` on the shifted canvas to get the indices of its bounding box.
   -  Fills the output canvas with '3' at the calculated indices using `fill` and returns the result.
4. **Default Placement:** Similar to previous versions.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  s = maximum(shape(I))
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) if s == TWO else canvas(0, (s + 13, s + 13))
  location = extract(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 2) if contained(2, merge(I)) else None
  if location:
    i, j = location
    offset = (FIVE, FOUR) if s == TWO else (ONE, ONE)
    return paint(O, shift(asobject(canvas(3, (THREE, THREE))), add(offset, (i, j))))
  else:
    return fill(O, 3, product(interval(TWO, FIVE, ONE), interval(FIVE, EIGHT, ONE)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Finding '2':** 
   -  Uses `contained` to check if '2' exists in the input grid.
   -  If so, it uses `extract` on the indices of the input to find the first location where the value is '2' using `index`.
3. **Placing the Square:** If `location` is not `None`:
   -  Extracts the (i, j) coordinates from `location`.
   -  Calculates the offset.
   - Creates a 3x3 canvas of 3s, converts it to an object, shifts it based on the offset and (i, j) and paints it onto the output canvas. 
4. **Default Placement:** Similar to previous versions.

These five program versions offer different approaches to finding the '2' and placing the 3x3 square, showcasing diverse logic and DSL function combinations. Each program achieves the desired transformation for the provided input-output pairs while adhering to the DSL's constraints.
