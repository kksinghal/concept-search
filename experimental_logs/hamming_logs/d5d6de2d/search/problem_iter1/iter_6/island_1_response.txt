## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying rows in the input grid where the digit '2' appears. For each such row, a horizontal line of '3's is drawn in the output grid at the corresponding row index, but only within the bounds of where the '2's were originally present.

**Input 0:**
- Rows 1, 2, 3, and 6, 7, 8, 9 contain '2's.
- Output has horizontal '3' lines at those rows, spanning the columns where '2's existed in the input.

**Input 1:**
- Rows 1, 2, 3, 4 contain '2's.
- Output has '3' lines at those rows, again limited to the original '2' column span.

**Input 2:**
- Rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 contain '2's.
- Output has '3' lines at those rows,  within the '2' column bounds.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    if 2 in row:
      start = row.index(2)
      end = len(row) - row[::-1].index(2)
      for j in range(start, end):
        O = fill(O, 3, frozenset({(i, j)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty canvas `O` with the same shape as the input `I`.
2. **Row Iteration:** Iterate through each row `row` and its index `i` in the input grid `I`.
3. **'2' Detection:** Check if the value '2' exists in the current row `row`.
4. **Line Bounds:** If '2' is present, find the starting and ending column indices (`start` and `end`) of the continuous block of '2's.
5. **Line Drawing:**  Draw a horizontal line of '3's in the output grid `O` at row index `i`, starting from column `start` and ending at column `end - 1`.
6. **Output:** Return the transformed grid `O`.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  two_indices = {(i, j) for i, r in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(r) if v == 2}
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, j in two_indices:
    O = fill(O, 3, frozenset({(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))}))
    break 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '2' Indices:** Get a set `two_indices` containing the row and column indices of all '2's in the input grid.
2. **Initialization:** Create an empty canvas `O` with the same shape as input `I`.
3. **Line Drawing:** Iterate through each `(i, j)` in `two_indices`. For the first occurrence in each row `i`, draw a horizontal line of '3's from column `j` to the right edge of the grid.
4. **Output:** Return the transformed grid `O`.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 2:
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, k) for k in range(j, len(row))}))
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty canvas `O` with the same dimensions as the input `I`.
2. **Iteration:** Loop through each cell in the input grid `I` using row index `i` and column index `j`.
3. **'2' Check:** If the current cell value `val` is 2:
    - Create a horizontal line of indices starting from the current column `j` to the end of the row.
    - Recolor this line to have the value '3'.
    - Paint this recolored line onto the output grid `O`.
    - Exit the inner loop (for `j`) since a '3' line is drawn for the first '2' encountered in the row.
4. **Output:** Return the modified grid `O`.


**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    if 2 in row:
      start = row.index(2)
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j) for j in range(start, width(I))})) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Initialize the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Row Iteration:** Iterate through each row (`row`) and its index (`i`) in the input grid.
3. **Find First '2':** If a '2' is present in the row, find the column index (`start`) of the first occurrence.
4. **Horizontal Line:** Create a horizontal line of indices starting from `start` to the end of the row.
5. **Recolor and Paint:** Recolor the line with the value '3' and paint it onto the output grid `O`. 
6. **Output:** Return the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      3 if any(c == 2 for c in row[j:]) else 0
      for j in range(len(row))
    )
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested list comprehensions for a concise solution:

1. **Outer Loop (Rows):** Iterates through each `row` in the input grid `I`.
2. **Inner Loop (Columns):** For each cell at index `j` within the `row`:
    - Checks if any cell from the current column `j` to the end of the row contains the value '2'. 
    - If true, sets the cell in the output grid to '3', otherwise '0'.
3. **Output:** Constructs and returns the transformed grid as a tuple of tuples.
