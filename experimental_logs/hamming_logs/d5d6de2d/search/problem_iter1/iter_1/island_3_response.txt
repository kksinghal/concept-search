## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the non-background object in the input grid, creating a horizontally mirrored version of its bounding box, and placing this mirrored box at the bottom-right corner of the output grid. The mirrored box is filled with the digit '3'.

**Input 0:**

- The non-background object consists of the digit '2'.
- The bounding box of this object is mirrored horizontally.
- This mirrored box is placed in the bottom-right corner of the output grid and filled with '3'.

**Input 1:**

- Similar to Input 0, but the object is smaller.

**Input 2:**

- Same logic applied, but with a larger object extending to the edges of the grid.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = next(iter(objects(I, T, F, T)))  # Get the non-background object
  box = backdrop(obj)                 # Get the bounding box of the object
  h, w = shape(box)                      # Get the height and width of the box
  shifted_box = shift(box, (len(I)-h, len(I[0])-w-leftmost(box))) # Shift the box to bottom-right
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(3, hmirror(shifted_box))) # Mirror & paint the box
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Object:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies the non-background object. `next(iter(...))` extracts the object from the frozenset.
2. **Bounding Box:**  `backdrop(obj)` calculates the bounding box indices.
3. **Shift to Bottom-Right:** `shift(box, ...)` moves the box to the bottom-right corner.
4. **Horizontal Mirroring:** `hmirror(shifted_box)` mirrors the box horizontally.
5. **Painting:**  `recolor(3, ...)` fills the mirrored box with '3'. `paint(...)` draws it on a blank canvas of the input's shape.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T)) # Extract the first non-background object
  x, y = lrcorner(obj)             # Get the lower-right corner coordinates of the object
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))           # Create an empty canvas with the input shape
  for i in range(height(obj)):       # Iterate through the height of the object
    for j in range(width(obj)):      # Iterate through the width of the object
      O = fill(O, 3, {(len(I)-1-i, x-j)}) # Fill the corresponding mirrored position with '3'
  return O                        # Return the modified output grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object and Corner:**  Similar to Version 1, identifies the object and finds its lower-right corner.
2. **Iterative Filling:** Iterates through the object's dimensions, filling corresponding mirrored positions in the output grid with '3'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), identity)  # Extract the object
  h, w = height(obj), width(obj)               # Get object's height and width
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))                      # Create a blank canvas
  mirrored_box = hmirror(backdrop(obj))       # Get the mirrored bounding box
  O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(mirrored_box, (len(I)-h, len(I[0])-w))))  # Shift and paint the box
  return O                                     # Return the output grid
```

**Explanation:**

- **Extract and Dimensions:** Extracts the object and determines its height and width.
- **Mirroring and Shifting:** Mirrors the bounding box horizontally and shifts it to the bottom-right corner.
- **Painting:** Fills the shifted, mirrored box with '3' and paints it onto the blank canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = next(iter(objects(I, T, F, T)))
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i in range(height(obj)):
    for j in range(width(obj)):
      if index(I, (i+uppermost(obj), j+leftmost(obj))) != 0:  # Check if the cell is part of the object
        O = fill(O, 3, {(len(O)-1-i, len(O[0])-1-j)})         # Fill the mirrored position with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates through potential object cells and only fills the mirrored position if the cell in the input grid is not background (value 0).

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = objects(I, T, F, T).pop() if objects(I, T, F, T) else frozenset() # Safely get the object
  box = backdrop(obj)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)),
               recolor(3,
                       shift(hmirror(box), subtract(shape(I), shape(box)))))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version adds a safety check to handle cases where no non-background object exists.
- It also uses `subtract` to calculate the shift offset for the mirrored box.

These versions offer diverse implementations using different DSL function combinations, logic flows, and error handling approaches.
