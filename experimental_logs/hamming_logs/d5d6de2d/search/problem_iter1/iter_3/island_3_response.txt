## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes the first object from the input grid and creates a new object with the same shape, but with value `3`. This new object is positioned in the bottom left corner of a blank canvas that has the same dimensions as the input grid.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The input grid has a '2' shaped object.
* The output grid has a `3` shaped object in the bottom left corner.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The input grid has a horizontally flipped '2' shaped object. 
* The output grid has a horizontally flipped `3` shaped object in the bottom left corner. 

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The input grid has a larger '2' shaped object.
* The output grid has a larger `3` shaped object in the bottom left corner.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions:

**Version 1:** (Inspired by Program_A's cropping and Program_B's object manipulation)

```python
def solve_task(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))  # Extract the first non-background object.
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))          # Create a blank canvas with the same shape as the input.
  for i, r in enumerate(crop(I, ORIGIN, shape(obj))):  # Iterate through rows of the cropped object.
    for j, v in enumerate(r):                   # Iterate through values in each row.
      if v != mostcolor(I):                   # Check if the value is not background.
        O = fill(O, 3, {(len(O)-1-i, j)}) # Fill the corresponding mirrored position in the output grid.
  return O
```
**Explanation:**

1. Extract the first non-background object from the input grid `I`.
2. Create a blank canvas `O` with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3. Crop the input grid to the size of the extracted object.
4. Iterate through each cell of the cropped object.
5. If the cell value is not the background color, fill the corresponding mirrored position (bottom-left) on the blank canvas `O` with the value `3`.


**Version 2:** (Inspired by Program_B's object iteration and Program_A's shape extraction)

```python
def solve_task(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))  # Extract the first non-background object.
  h, w = shape(obj)                # Get height and width of the object.
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))          # Create a blank canvas with the same shape as the input.
  for v, (i, j) in obj:            # Iterate through cells of the object.
    O = fill(O, 3, {(len(I)-1-(i-uppermost(obj)), j-leftmost(obj))}) # Fill the mirrored position with '3'.
  return O
```
**Explanation:**

1. Extract the first non-background object from the input grid.
2. Get the height and width of the object.
3. Create a blank canvas with the same size as the input.
4. Iterate through each cell of the extracted object.
5. Calculate the mirrored position of the cell on the canvas (bottom-left).
6. Fill the calculated position on the canvas with the value `3`.


**Version 3:** (Inspired by Program_B's mirroring and Program_A's canvas creation)

```python
def solve_task(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T)) # Extract the first non-background object.
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))           # Create a blank canvas with the same shape as the input.
  O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(hmirror(obj), (height(I)-height(obj), 0)))) # Paint a mirrored and shifted object.
  return O
```
**Explanation:**

1. Extract the first non-background object from the input.
2. Create a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input.
3. Mirror the object horizontally.
4. Shift the mirrored object down by the difference between the height of the input grid and the height of the object.
5. Recolor the shifted and mirrored object with value `3`.
6. Paint the recolored object onto the blank canvas.


**Version 4:** (Inspired by Program_B's object manipulation and Program_A's shape usage)

```python
def solve_task(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T)) # Extract the first non-background object.
  h, w = shape(I)                  # Get height and width of the input grid.
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))            # Create a blank canvas with the same size as the input.
  for i in range(height(obj)):       # Iterate through the height of the object.
    for j in range(width(obj)):      # Iterate through the width of the object.
      if index(I, (uppermost(obj) + i, leftmost(obj) + j)) != mostcolor(I): # Check if the cell is not background.
        O = fill(O, 3, {(h-1-i, j)}) # Fill the corresponding mirrored position on the canvas with '3'.
  return O 
```
**Explanation:**

1. Extract the first non-background object from the input.
2. Get the height and width of the input grid.
3. Create a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid.
4. Iterate through the cells of the extracted object using its height and width.
5. Check if the corresponding cell in the input grid is not the background color.
6. If it's not the background color, fill the mirrored cell position on the canvas with the value `3`.


**Version 5:** (Inspired by Program_B's iteration and Program_A's canvas creation)

```python
def solve_task(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T)) # Extract the first non-background object.
  h, w = shape(I)                  # Get height and width of the input grid.
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))            # Create a blank canvas with the same size as the input.
  for v, (i, j) in obj:            # Iterate through cells of the object.
    O = fill(O, 3, {(h - 1 - (i - uppermost(obj)), j - leftmost(obj))})  # Calculate and fill the mirrored position.
  return O 
```
**Explanation:**

1. Extract the first non-background object from the input grid.
2. Get the height and width of the input grid.
3. Create a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input.
4. Iterate through each cell of the extracted object.
5. Calculate the mirrored position of each object cell on the canvas (bottom-left).
6. Fill the calculated positions on the canvas with the value `3`.

These five versions provide distinct logic and DSL function combinations to achieve the desired transformation. They showcase the ability to combine and modify elements from existing programs to generate novel and effective code solutions.
