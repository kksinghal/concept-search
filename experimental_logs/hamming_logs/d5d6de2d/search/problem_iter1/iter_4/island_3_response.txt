## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to isolate the top row of each non-background object in the input grid and place it on the left edge of the output grid, maintaining its original vertical position. The isolated row is filled with the value '3' in the output.

**Example Breakdowns:**

* **Input_0:**  The top row of the '2' object is extracted and placed on the left edge of the output, forming a vertical line of '3's.
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, but the object's top row is shorter, resulting in a shorter vertical line of '3's.
* **Input_2:** This input has a wider object. Again, only the top row is extracted and transformed into a vertical line of '3's.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), identity)  # Extract the first non-background object.
  top_row = {(3, (uppermost(obj), j)) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)}  # Create the top row filled with '3's.
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))  # Create an empty canvas.
  return paint(O, top_row)  # Paint the top row onto the canvas.
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Object:** We extract the first non-background object from the input grid.
2. **Create Top Row:**  We create a new object representing the top row of the extracted object, filled with the value '3'.
3. **Create Canvas:**  An empty canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid is created.
4. **Paint Row:** The newly created top row is painted onto the left edge of the canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))  # Create an empty canvas.
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):  # Iterate over each non-background object.
    for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1):  # Iterate over the columns of the object.
      if I[uppermost(obj)][j] != 0:  # Check if the cell is part of the top row.
        O = paint(O, {(3, (uppermost(obj), 0))})  # Paint a '3' at the corresponding row on the left edge.
        break # Move to the next object after painting the first '3'
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** An empty canvas is generated.
2. **Iterate Objects:** The code iterates through each non-background object in the input.
3. **Iterate Columns & Check Top Row:** For each object, the code iterates over its columns. If a cell belongs to the object's top row, it proceeds.
4. **Paint and Proceed:** A '3' is painted on the left edge of the canvas at the same row as the current cell. The loop then breaks to avoid drawing multiple '3's for the same object and moves to the next object.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))  # Create an empty canvas.
  for i in range(len(I)):  # Iterate over each row.
    for j in range(len(I[0])):  # Iterate over each column.
      if I[i][j] != 0:  # Check for a non-background cell.
        O = paint(O, {(3, (i, 0))})  # Paint a '3' at the corresponding row on the left edge.
        break  # Move to the next row
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** An empty canvas is initialized.
2. **Iterate Rows and Columns:** The program iterates through every cell in the input grid.
3. **Identify Non-Background:** Upon encountering a non-background cell, the code proceeds.
4. **Paint and Proceed:** A '3' is painted on the leftmost column of the canvas, at the same row as the current cell. The loop then breaks to prevent placing multiple '3's per row and moves to the next row. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj_tops = {uppermost(obj) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)}  # Get the row indices of the top of each object.
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))  # Create an empty canvas.
  return fill(O, 3, {(i, 0) for i in obj_tops})  # Fill the leftmost column of the canvas at the identified row indices with '3's.
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Top Row Indices:**  The code identifies the row index of the topmost cell for each non-background object.
2. **Create Canvas:** An empty canvas matching the input grid's dimensions is created.
3. **Fill Left Edge:**  The leftmost column of the canvas is filled with '3's at the row indices identified in step 1.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = canvas(0, (len(I), len(I[0])))  # Create a blank canvas
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T): # Iterate through each object
      top_row_indices = {(i, 0) for i in range(uppermost(obj), uppermost(obj) + 1)}
      O = fill(O, 3, top_row_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** An empty canvas matching the input grid's dimensions is created.
2. **Iterate Objects:** The code iterates through each non-background object in the input.
3. **Identify Top Row:**  For each object, the code determines the indices of its top row.
4. **Fill Cells:**  The identified cells on the leftmost column of the canvas are filled with the value '3'.
