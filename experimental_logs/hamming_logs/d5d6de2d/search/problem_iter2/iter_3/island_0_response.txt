## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a 2x2 input grid and generates an output grid based on the presence and location of the digit '2' in the input.

**Input_0:** 
- The '2' in the bottom right corner results in a 3x2 block of '3's placed in the bottom right of the 10x10 output grid. A single '3' is also placed near the top right.

**Input_1:**
-  With no '2' present, the output is a 10x10 grid of '0's with a vertical line of '3's near the top right.

**Input_2:**
- Similar to Input_0, the '2' leads to a 3x3 block of '3's in the top right, and the output grid is larger (15x15).

**Overall Logic:**
- The output grid size is determined by the presence of '2'. 
-  A vertical line or block of '3's is always placed near the top right.
- The presence and position of '2' dictate the size and position of an additional block of '3's, mirroring the location of '2' in the input. 


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions for "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_5614dbcf(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, multiply(shape(I), (FIVE, FIVE)))
  O = fill(O, THREE, {(TWO,SEVEN)}) 
  if index(I, (ONE,ONE)) == TWO:
    O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j) for i in range(SIX,NINE) for j in range(FIVE,EIGHT)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Create a 10x10 canvas of '0's.
2. **Fixed Placement:** Place a '3' at (2,7).
3. **Conditional Block:** If a '2' exists at (1,1) in the input, fill a 3x3 block of '3's at the bottom right.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_5614dbcf(I):
  s = shape(I)
  O = canvas(ZERO, multiply(s, (FIVE, FIVE)))
  O = fill(O, THREE, {(TWO, s[1]*FIVE - THREE)})
  if index(I, (ONE,ONE)) == TWO:
    O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j) for i in range(s[0]*FIVE-THREE, s[0]*FIVE) for j in range(s[1]*FIVE-THREE, s[1]*FIVE)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Dynamic Scaling:** Calculates output size based on input size.
2. **Relative Placement:** Positions the single '3' dynamically based on output width.
3. **Conditional Block:** Similar to Version 1, places the 3x3 block based on input.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_5614dbcf(I):
  O = vupscale(hupscale(I, FIVE), FIVE)
  O = replace(O, TWO, THREE)
  O = fill(O, THREE, {(TWO,SEVEN)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:** Upscales the input grid by a factor of 5.
2. **Color Replacement:**  Replaces all '2's with '3's.
3. **Fixed Placement:**  Adds the single '3' at (2,7).

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_5614dbcf(I):
  obj = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN)) if len(obj) == 0 else canvas(ZERO, (THREE * FIVE, THREE * FIVE))
  O = fill(O, THREE, {(TWO, SEVEN)})
  if obj:
    i, j = first(first(obj))[ONE]
    O = fill(O, THREE, {(r + i * FIVE, c + j * FIVE) for r in range(THREE) for c in range(THREE)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Detection:** Identifies objects in the input.
2. **Conditional Canvas:** Creates a 10x10 or 15x15 canvas based on object presence.
3. **Fixed Placement:** Places the single '3'.
4. **Object-Based Filling:** If an object exists, places a 3x3 block based on object's location.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_5614dbcf(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN))
  if index(I, (ONE, ZERO)) == TWO:
    O = vconcat(O, canvas(ZERO, (FIVE, TEN)))
  if index(I, (ZERO, ONE)) == TWO:
    O = hconcat(O, canvas(ZERO, (shape(O)[ZERO], FIVE)))
  O = fill(O, THREE, {(TWO,SEVEN)})
  if index(I, (ONE,ONE)) == TWO:
    O = fill(O, THREE, {(shape(O)[ZERO]-THREE+i, shape(O)[ONE]-THREE+j) for i in range(THREE) for j in range(THREE)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Base Canvas:** Starts with a 10x10 canvas.
2. **Conditional Expansion:**  Expands the canvas vertically or horizontally based on the presence of '2' in specific input locations.
3. **Fixed Placement:** Adds the single '3'.
4. **Conditional Block:**  Places the 3x3 block based on '2' presence, adjusting its position based on canvas size. 

These programs provide five distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation, utilizing different DSL functions and logic.
