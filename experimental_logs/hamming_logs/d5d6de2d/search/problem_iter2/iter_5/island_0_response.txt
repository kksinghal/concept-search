## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves two main aspects:

1. **Upscaling:** The input grid is upscaled based on the presence of the digit '2'. 
    * If '2' is present, the upscaling factor is 5. 
    * If '2' is absent, the upscaling factor is 5/2 (which translates to 2 due to integer division).

2. **Drawing '3':** A shape composed of the digit '3' is drawn on the upscaled grid.
    * If '2' is present in the input, the '3' shape is a 3x3 square placed one cell to the right and one cell down from the upper-left corner of the upscaled '2' object.
    * If '2' is absent, the '3' shape is a 2x2 square placed at the center of the upscaled grid. 

**Input-Output Pair Analysis:**

* **Input_0 & Output_0:** The input contains '2', so the upscaling factor is 5. The '3' shape is a 3x3 square placed relative to the '2' object.
* **Input_1 & Output_1:** The input lacks '2', so the upscaling factor is 2. The '3' shape is a 2x2 square at the center.
* **Input_2 & Output_2:** Similar to Input_0, the presence of '2' leads to a 5x upscaling and a 3x3 '3' shape positioned relative to '2'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:** (Inspired by Program_A's upscaling and object detection)

```python
def program_v1(I):
  # Determine upscaling factor based on '2' presence
  factor = 5 if 2 in merge(I) else 5 // 2
  # Upscale the input grid
  O = upscale(I, factor)
  # Find the '2' object
  obj2 = next((obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) == 2), frozenset())
  # Draw the '3' shape
  if obj2:
    # '2' present: Draw a 3x3 '3' shape relative to '2'
    i, j = ulcorner(obj2)
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i * factor + factor, j * factor + factor + k) for k in range(3) for l in range(3)})
  else:
    # '2' absent: Draw a 2x2 '3' shape at the center
    center_i, center_j = len(O) // 2, len(O[0]) // 2
    O = fill(O, 3, {(center_i - 1 + k, center_j - 1 + l) for k in range(2) for l in range(2)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:** Uses the same conditional upscaling as Program_A but with a fixed factor of 5 for '2' presence.
2. **Object Detection:**  Identifies the '2' object if present using `objects`, `color`, and `next`.
3. **'3' Shape Drawing:** Draws a 3x3 or 2x2 '3' shape based on '2' presence, using relative coordinates for the 3x3 case.

**Version 2:** (Inspired by Program_B's direct coordinate calculation)

```python
def program_v2(I):
  # Determine upscaling factor based on '2' presence
  factor = 5 if 2 in merge(I) else 5 // 2
  # Create upscaled canvas
  O = canvas(0, multiply(shape(I), (factor, factor)))
  # Find '2' location
  loc2 = next(((i, j) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, val in enumerate(row) if val == 2), (-1, -1))
  # Draw '3' shape based on '2' location
  if loc2 != (-1, -1):
    # '2' found: Draw large '3' around '2'
    O = fill(O, 3, {(loc2[0] * factor + i, loc2[1] * factor + j + factor) for i in range(3) for j in range(3)})
  else:
    # No '2': Draw small centered '3'
    center_i, center_j = len(O) // 2, len(O[0]) // 2
    O = fill(O, 3, {(center_i - 1 + i, center_j - 1 + j) for i in range(2) for j in range(2)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:** Similar upscaling logic as Version 1.
2. **'2' Location:** Directly finds the '2' location using nested loops instead of object detection.
3. **'3' Shape Drawing:**  Calculates '3' shape coordinates based on '2' location or grid center.

**Version 3:** (Combining object detection and direct coordinate calculation)

```python
def program_v3(I):
  # Upscaling factor based on '2' presence
  factor = 5 if any(2 in row for row in I) else 2
  # Upscale input
  O = upscale(I, factor)
  # '3' shape indices
  shape3 = {(i, j) for i in range(3) for j in range(3)}
  # Find '2' object
  obj2 = next((obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) == 2), None)
  if obj2:
    # '2' present: Large '3' shifted from '2'
    i, j = ulcorner(obj2)
    O = fill(O, 3, shift(shape3, (i * factor, (j + 1) * factor))) 
  else:
    # No '2': Small '3' at center
    center = (len(O) // 2 - 1, len(O[0]) // 2 - 1)
    O = fill(O, 3, shift(shape3, center)[:2, :2]) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:** Same logic as previous versions.
2. **Object Detection & '2' Location:**  Uses `objects` and `color` for object detection and `ulcorner` for '2' location.
3. **'3' Shape Drawing:** Leverages `shift` for positioning the pre-defined 3x3 '3' shape. 

**Version 4:** (Using conditional expressions for concise logic)

```python
def program_v4(I):
  # Upscaling factor
  f = 5 if 2 in merge(I) else 2
  # Upscale grid
  O = upscale(I, f)
  # Find '2' object
  obj2 = next((obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) == 2), None)
  # Draw '3' conditionally
  O = fill(O, 3, 
           shift({(a, b) for a in range(3) for b in range(3)}, 
                 multiply(add(ulcorner(obj2), (0, 1)), f)) if obj2 
           else {(len(O) // 2 - 1 + i, len(O[0]) // 2 - 1 + j) for i in range(2) for j in range(2)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Object Detection:** Similar to Version 3.
3. **'3' Shape Drawing:** Uses a single `fill` call with conditional expressions to handle both '2' presence and absence scenarios.

**Version 5:** (Leveraging `rapply` for function application)

```python
def program_v5(I):
  # Define functions to draw '3' shapes
  draw_large_3 = lambda obj: fill(canvas(0, shape(upscale(I, 5))), 3, shift({(a, b) for a in range(3) for b in range(3)}, multiply(add(ulcorner(obj), (0, 1)), 5)))
  draw_small_3 = lambda _: fill(canvas(0, shape(upscale(I, 2))), 3, {(len(upscale(I, 2)) // 2 - 1 + i, len(upscale(I, 2)[0]) // 2 - 1 + j) for i in range(2) for j in range(2)})
  # Determine which function to apply based on '2' presence
  functions = (draw_large_3, draw_small_3) if 2 in merge(I) else (draw_small_3, draw_large_3)
  # Apply the chosen function and return the result
  return first(rapply(functions, next((obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) == 2), None)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Function Definitions:** Defines separate functions for drawing the large and small '3' shapes.
2. **Function Selection:**  Chooses the appropriate function based on '2' presence.
3. **Function Application:** Uses `rapply` to apply the chosen function to the detected '2' object (or None if absent).

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation, leveraging different DSL functions and logic structures. Each version is significantly distinct from the others, going beyond minor variations.
