## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation converts a single cell '2' in the input grid into a horizontal line of '3's in the output grid. The width of the output grid and the position of the line depend on whether a '2' exists in the input:

* **Input with '2':** The output grid width is extended to 15 columns. The '2' cell is upscaled by a factor of 5, creating a 5-cell wide line of '3's. This line is right-aligned within the output grid.
* **Input without '2':** The output grid remains at the default 10x10 size. A 3-cell wide line of '3's is drawn centrally in the 3rd row.


## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct program versions, inspired by existing programs and tailored to achieve the specific transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 15 if ofcolor(I, 2) else 10))  # Conditional width
  if ofcolor(I, 2):
    obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, upscale(toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I), 5)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(0, toobject(range(10), {(i, j) for i in range(10) for j in range(10)})))
    O = shift(O, (0, 5))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Conditional Canvas:** The output canvas is initialized with a width of 15 if a '2' is present in the input, otherwise 10.
2. **Object Upscaling and Painting:** If a '2' exists, it is converted into an object, upscaled by 5, and painted onto the canvas as '3's.
3. **Shifting for Alignment:** The painted object is shifted 5 positions to the right for right alignment.
4. **Central Line (No '2'):** If no '2' is found, a central 3-cell line of '3's is drawn at the 3rd row.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if 2 in merge(I):
    O = hconcat(O, canvas(0, (10, 5)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, upscale(toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I), 5)))
    O = shift(O, (0, width(O) - width(upscale(toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I), 5))))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, len(I[0]) - 3 + i) for i in range(3)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initial Canvas and Extension:** The canvas starts as 10x10. If a '2' is found, it's extended horizontally by 5 columns.
2. **Upscaling, Painting, and Alignment:**  The '2' object is upscaled, painted as '3's, and right-aligned by calculating the shift based on object and canvas widths.
3. **Diagonal Line (No '2'):** If no '2', a 3-cell diagonal line is drawn towards the right edge of the grid.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10 + 5 * (2 in merge(I))))
  if ofcolor(I, 2):
    obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, upscale(obj, 5)))
    O = shift(O, (0, 10 + 5 * (rightmost(toindices(obj)) - 1)))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Boolean Logic for Width:**  Canvas width is set using boolean logic: 15 if '2' exists, else 10.
2. **Calculated Alignment:** The shift for right alignment is precisely calculated based on the rightmost column of the upscaled object.
3. **Central Line (No '2'):** The central line logic remains the same.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 15 if len(I[0]) > 2 else 10))
  if 2 in merge(I):
    obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, upscale(obj, 5)))
    O = hconcat(canvas(0, (10, width(O) - width(upscale(obj, 5)))), upscale(obj, 5))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Input Width for Canvas:** Canvas width is determined by checking the input grid's width (15 if greater than 2, else 10).
2. **Concatenation for Alignment:** Instead of shifting, this version concatenates the upscaled object with an empty canvas of the calculated remaining width, achieving right alignment.
3. **Central Line (No '2'):** No change in the logic for input without '2'.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_indices = ofcolor(I, 2)
  if obj_indices:
    O = canvas(0, (10, 15))
    obj = toobject(obj_indices, I)
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, upscale(obj, 5)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(0, {(i, j) for i in range(10) for j in range(rightmost(obj_indices) * 5)}))
  else:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), recolor(3, {(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Directly using `obj_indices`:**  The program directly uses the result of `ofcolor(I, 2)` in the conditional statement. 
2. **Painting over for Alignment:** The code paints over the left part of the canvas with '0's to achieve right alignment. 
3. **Canvas Creation within Conditional:** The canvas for the case without '2' is created directly within the `else` block. 

These five programs offer distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and diversity possible within the given DSL.
