## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be performing two distinct actions:

**1. Vertical Upscaling:** The output grid height is significantly larger than the input grid height. The content of the input grid seems to be replicated multiple times vertically in the output grid.

**2. Conditional Horizontal Shifting:** Based on the presence and position of the digit '2' in the input grid, the upscaled content in the output grid is shifted horizontally. If '2' is present, the shift is determined by its rightmost column position. If '2' is absent, the upscaled content remains centered.

Let's break down the transformations for each input-output pair:

* **Input_0 to Output_0:** The input grid has '2' in the second column. The output grid shows the upscaled content (single '3') shifted three positions to the right from the center.
* **Input_1 to Output_1:** The input grid has no '2'. The output grid shows the upscaled content (single '3') centered horizontally.
* **Input_2 to Output_2:** The input grid has '2' in the second column. The output grid shows the upscaled content (three '3's) shifted three positions to the right from the center.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions for achieving the described transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  output_height = max(len(I) * 5, 10)  # Upscale height 5 times or minimum 10
  output_width = max(len(I[0]) * 3, 15) # Upscale width 3 times or minimum 15
  O = canvas(0, (output_height, output_width))
  twos = ofcolor(I, 2)
  if twos:
    shift_amount = rightmost(twos) * 3 # Shift based on rightmost '2'
  else:
    shift_amount = output_width // 2 - 1 # Center if no '2'
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 2:
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i * 5 + k, j * 3 + shift_amount) for k in range(5)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **Upscaling:**  The height and width of the output grid are determined by upscaling the input dimensions or using minimum values for smaller inputs.
2. **Shift Calculation:** The horizontal shift amount is calculated based on the presence and position of '2'.
3. **Vertical Upscaling & Shifting:** The code iterates through the input grid and places a vertical line of '3's in the output grid at the calculated shifted position for each '2' encountered.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = upscale(I, 5) # Vertically upscale by 5
  O = canvas(0, (height(O), max(width(O) * 3, 15))) # Adjust width
  O = paint(O, recolor(3, toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I))) # Paint '3's at '2' positions
  if ofcolor(I, 2):
    O = shift(O, (0, 3 * rightmost(ofcolor(I, 2)) - width(O) // 2 + 1)) # Shift based on '2'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Vertical Upscaling:** The input grid is vertically upscaled.
2. **Canvas Adjustment:**  A canvas is created with adjusted width to accommodate shifting.
3. **Object Painting:** '3's are painted at the positions corresponding to '2' in the upscaled grid.
4. **Conditional Shifting:**  The entire grid is shifted horizontally based on '2' position.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = vupscale(I, 5) # Vertically upscale by 5
  O = hupscale(O, 3) # Horizontally upscale by 3
  if ofcolor(I, 2):
    O = shift(O, (0, 3 * rightmost(ofcolor(I, 2)) - width(O) // 2 + 1)) # Shift based on '2'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:** The input grid is upscaled both vertically and horizontally.
2. **Conditional Shifting:** Similar to Version 2, the grid is shifted based on '2' position.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, False) # Get all objects from the input
  O = canvas(0, (max(len(I) * 5, 10), max(len(I[0]) * 3, 15))) # Create output canvas
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      if ofcolor(I, 2):
        offset = (0, 3 * rightmost(toindices(obj)) - width(O) // 2 + 1) # Calculate shift
      else:
        offset = (0, 0) # No shift if no '2'
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(upscale(obj, 5), offset))) # Paint upscaled and shifted object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** All objects in the input grid are identified.
2. **Canvas Creation:** Output canvas is created with upscaled dimensions.
3. **Object Processing:**  Each object is processed individually. If the object's color is '2', it is upscaled, shifted, recolored to '3', and then painted onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = canvas(0, (max(len(I) * 5, 10), max(len(I[0]) * 3, 15))) # Create output canvas
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 2:
        shift_amount = 3 * j -  width(O) // 2 + 1 # Calculate shift
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i * 5 + k, shift_amount) for k in range(5)}) # Paint vertical line
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Output canvas is created with upscaled dimensions.
2. **Direct Painting:**  The code iterates through the input grid and directly paints a vertically upscaled line of '3's onto the canvas at a shifted location for every '2' encountered.

These five program versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL. Each version utilizes different functions and logic, offering a diverse set of solutions.
