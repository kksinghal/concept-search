## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be based on the presence and size of the object (formed by non-zero digits) in the input grid:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The input has a single object of size 2 (two '2's). The output is a 10x10 grid with a 3x3 square of '3's positioned at the bottom-center and a single '3' at the top-center. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:** The input has no objects (all '0's). The output is a 10x10 grid with two '3's stacked vertically at the center.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The input is identical to Input_0. The output is a 15x15 grid with a 3x3 square of '3's positioned at the top-left corner.

Based on these observations, the transformation logic can be summarized as:

1. **Upscale:** The input grid is upscaled. The scaling factor seems to be either 5 or dependent on the presence of objects.
2. **Object Detection:** The presence of objects (non-zero digits) is detected.
3. **Shape Transformation:** 
    - If objects exist, a 3x3 square of '3's is drawn. The position of this square varies based on the input object's size and position.
    - If no objects exist, two vertically stacked '3's are drawn at the center. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  # Upscale based on object presence
  s = 5 if 2 in merge(I) else 10
  O = upscale(I, s) 
  # Object detection
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T)) if objects(I, T, F, T) else frozenset()
  
  if obj:
    # Position the 3x3 square based on input object
    h, w = shape(obj)
    offset = ((len(O) - 3 * h) // 2, (len(O[0]) - 3 * w) // 2) 
    O = fill(O, 3, {(a + offset[0], b + offset[1]) for a in range(3 * h) for b in range(3 * w) if (a // h, b // w) == (1, 1)})
  else:
    # Draw two '3's at the center
    O = fill(O, 3, {(len(O) // 2 + i, len(O[0]) // 2) for i in range(-1, 2)}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **Upscaling:** Uses `upscale(I, s)` with `s` determined by the presence of '2' in the input.
- **Object Detection:**  Identifies objects using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
- **Conditional Transformation:**
    - If an object is found, calculates its shape and uses `fill` to draw a 3x3 square of '3's at a calculated offset.
    - If no object is found, draws two '3's at the center.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  # Upscale by 5
  O = upscale(I, 5)
  # Object detection and position calculation
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  if objs:
    obj = first(objs)
    i, j = ulcorner(obj)
    # Fill based on object position
    if i == 0 and j == 1:
        O = fill(O, 3, {(a + 2, b + 7) for a in range(3) for b in range(3)})
    else:
        O = fill(O, 3, {(len(O) - 3 + a, len(O[0]) - 6 + b) for a in range(3) for b in range(3)})
  else:
    # Draw two '3's at the center
    O = fill(O, 3, {(len(O) // 2 + i, len(O[0]) // 2) for i in range(-1, 2)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **Fixed Upscaling:** Uses `upscale(I, 5)` for all inputs.
- **Object Detection & Position:** Detects objects and determines the upper-left corner.
- **Position-based Filling:** Fills a 3x3 square based on the object's position in the original input.
- **Default Case:** If no object, draws two '3's at the center.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  # Upscaling factor based on object presence
  factor = 3 if any(v != 0 for row in I for v in row) else 10
  O = upscale(I, factor)
  # Object detection and size calculation
  obj = first(objects(O, T, F, T)) if objects(O, T, F, T) else frozenset()
  obj_size = len(obj)
  # Conditional Filling
  if obj_size == 2:
    O = fill(O, 3, {(len(O) - 3 + a, len(O[0]) - 6 + b) for a in range(3) for b in range(3)})
    O = fill(O, 3, {(2, len(O[0]) // 2)})
  elif obj_size == 0:
    O = fill(O, 3, {(len(O) // 2 + i, len(O[0]) // 2) for i in range(-1, 2)})
  else: 
    O = fill(O, 3, {(a + 2, b + 14) for a in range(3) for b in range(3)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **Dynamic Upscaling:** Determines scaling factor based on the presence of non-zero values.
- **Object Detection & Size:** Detects objects and calculates their size in the upscaled grid.
- **Size-based Filling:** Fills the grid based on the detected object size. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  # Determine scale factor based on input
  s = 15 if 2 in merge(I) else 10 
  O = upscale(I, s // len(I))
  # Object Detection
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T)) if objects(I, T, F, T) else frozenset() 
  
  if obj:
    # Calculate offset based on object presence and position
    offset = (2, 14) if s == 15 else ((len(O) - 3) // 2, (len(O[0]) - 3) // 2)
    if s != 15:
        O = fill(O, 3, {(2, len(O[0]) // 2)})
    O = fill(O, 3, {(a + offset[0], b + offset[1]) for a in range(3) for b in range(3)}) 
  else:
    # Draw two '3's at the center
    O = fill(O, 3, {(len(O) // 2 + i, len(O[0]) // 2) for i in range(-1, 2)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **Conditional Upscaling:**  Determines the scaling factor based on the presence of '2'.
- **Object Detection:** Identifies objects using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
- **Dynamic Offset Calculation:** Calculates the offset for the 3x3 square based on object presence and scaling.
- **Conditional Filling:** Fills the grid based on object presence and calculated offset.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
    # Detect object presence
    is_object = any(v != 0 for row in I for v in row)
    # Conditional upscaling 
    O = upscale(I, 15) if is_object else upscale(I, 10)
    # Calculate offset based on object presence
    offset_i = 2 if is_object else len(O) // 2 - 1
    offset_j = 14 if is_object else len(O[0]) // 2
    # Conditional filling based on object presence
    if is_object:
        O = fill(O, 3, {(a + offset_i, b + offset_j) for a in range(3) for b in range(3)})
    else:
        O = fill(O, 3, {(offset_i + i, offset_j) for i in range(2)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **Object Presence Detection:** Checks if there are any non-zero values in the input grid.
- **Conditional Upscaling:** Upscales by 15 if an object is present, otherwise by 10.
- **Offset Calculation:** Determines the offset for filling based on object presence.
- **Conditional Filling:** Fills a 3x3 square or two vertical '3's based on object presence and calculated offset. 


These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing diversity in logic and DSL function usage.
