## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all three examples involves identifying objects based on connected components of the same color (excluding the background color) and then extending these objects horizontally towards the rightmost occurrence of their respective color in their initial row.  

**Let's break it down:**

* **Object Identification:** The program first identifies distinct objects in the grid. An object is defined as a group of cells with the same color that are connected horizontally or vertically.
* **Horizontal Extension:** For each identified object, the program finds the rightmost occurrence of the object's color within the object's initial row. The object is then extended horizontally to the right to reach this rightmost occurrence.

**Example:**

Consider `Input_0`:

```
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0
0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
```

* The object with color '1' in the first row is extended to the right, resulting in the entire first row being filled with '1' in `Output_0`. 
* The object with color '3' in the fourth row is extended to the right, filling the spaces until the last occurrence of '1' in the same row. 


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
  """ Extends objects horizontally to the rightmost occurrence of their color in their initial row. """
  new_grid = []
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value != mostcolor(grid):  # Found a non-background color
        rightmost = max(j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == value)  # Find rightmost occurrence
        new_row = row[:j] + tuple(value for _ in range(rightmost - j + 1)) + row[rightmost + 1:] # Extend object
        new_grid.append(tuple(new_row))
        break  # Move to the next row after extending the object
    else:  # No non-background color found in the row
      new_grid.append(row)
  return tuple(new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** The program iterates through each row of the input grid.
2. **Find Non-Background Color:** For each row, it looks for the first occurrence of a color that is not the background color.
3. **Locate Rightmost Occurrence:** It then identifies the column index of the rightmost occurrence of this color within the same row.
4. **Extend Object:** The object is then extended horizontally by replacing all cells between the current cell and the rightmost occurrence with the object's color.
5. **Continue to Next Row:**  The program moves to the next row after processing the current row.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
  """ Extends objects horizontally to the rightmost occurrence of their color in their initial row. """
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          color if any(grid[i][k] == color for k in range(j, len(row))) else grid[i][j]
          for j, color in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(grid)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** This program uses nested list comprehensions to iterate through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check for Color Occurrence:** For each cell, it checks if the cell's color exists anywhere to the right within the same row.
3. **Conditional Filling:** If the color is found to the right, the current cell is filled with that color; otherwise, it retains its original value.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
  """ Extends objects horizontally to the rightmost occurrence of their color in their initial row. """
  new_grid = [list(row) for row in grid]
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j in range(len(row) - 1):
      if row[j] != mostcolor(grid):
        for k in range(j + 1, len(row)):
          if row[k] == row[j]:
            for l in range(j, k):
              new_grid[i][l] = row[j]
            break
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Modify:** The code iterates through each row and modifies a mutable copy of the grid.
2. **Locate Matching Colors:** For each non-background color, it finds subsequent occurrences of the same color in the row.
3. **Fill Between Occurrences:** It fills all cells between the initial and subsequent occurrences with the object's color.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
  """ Extends objects horizontally to the rightmost occurrence of their color in their initial row. """
  def extend_right(row, start, color):
    """ Extends a color to the right in a row from a starting index. """
    for j in range(start, len(row)):
      if row[j] == color:
        return tuple(color if j <= k < len(row) and row[k] == mostcolor(grid) else v for k, v in enumerate(row))
    return row

  new_grid = []
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value != mostcolor(grid):
        new_grid.append(tuple(extend_right(row, j, value)))
        break
    else:
      new_grid.append(row)
  return tuple(new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Helper Function 'extend_right':**  A helper function extends a color to the right within a row, starting from a given index.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** The main function iterates through each row and uses 'extend_right' to extend non-background colors.
3. **Conditional Row Update:**  It updates the row if a non-background color is found and extends it to the right.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
  """ Extends objects horizontally to the rightmost occurrence of their color in their initial row. """
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          next((c for k in range(len(row) - 1, j - 1, -1) if row[k] == c), color)
          if color != mostcolor(grid)
          else color
          for j, color in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(grid)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Nested Comprehensions with Backwards Search:**  This version also uses nested list comprehensions but employs a backwards search for the color within the row.
2. **Find Rightmost Occurrence (Backwards):** It finds the rightmost occurrence of the color by iterating from the end of the row towards the current cell's index.
3. **Fill based on Rightmost Occurrence:** It fills the cell based on the result of the backwards search.

These are just a few examples, and there are many other valid solutions using the provided DSL. The choice of the most efficient or elegant solution depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the task.
