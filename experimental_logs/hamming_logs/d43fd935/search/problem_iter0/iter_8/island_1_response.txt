## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects horizontally towards the right, but only until they encounter another object (of any color). 

**Let's break down each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 -> Output_0:**
    * The '1' objects at the top and bottom remain unchanged as they are blocked immediately.
    * The '3' object extends right to reach the '1' object. 
    * The '6' objects extend right until they hit another '6' object or the grid edge.

* **Input_1 -> Output_1:**
    * The '7' objects at (1,1) and (8,1) extend right to the edge.
    * The '7' object at (1,8) extends right until it hits the '3' object.
    * The '8' objects extend right until they hit another '8' object or the grid edge. 
    * The '3' object remains unchanged as it is blocked by the '8' object.

* **Input_2 -> Output_2:**
    * All '1' objects extend right until they hit another '1' object or the edge.
    * The '3' object remains unchanged as it is blocked.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" inspired by Program_A and Program_B, using different logic and DSL functions.

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
      for k in range(j + 1, width(I)):
        if index(I, (i, k)) != mostcolor(I):
          break
        O = fill(O, v, {(i, k)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:**  The code iterates through each object (excluding background) identified in the input grid.
2. **Iterate within object:** For each cell in the object, it checks cells to the right.
3. **Extend until obstacle:**  If the cell to the right is background, it fills it with the object's color. This continues until a non-background cell is encountered, signaling another object.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I):
        start = (i, j + 1)
        end = next((k for k in range(start[1] + 1, width(I)) if index(I, (i, k)) != mostcolor(I)), width(I))
        O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), connect(start, (i, end - 1))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate row-wise:** The code iterates through each cell in the grid row by row.
2. **Identify starting point:**  If a cell is non-background and its right neighbor is background, it marks the neighbor as the starting point for extension.
3. **Find ending point:** It scans to the right to find the next non-background cell or the grid edge, marking the end.
4. **Fill with `connect`:** It uses the `connect` function to directly fill all cells between the start and end points with the object's color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
      for k in range(j + 1, width(I)):
        if index(I, (i, k)) != mostcolor(I):
          break
        O = fill(O, v, {(i, k)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create blank canvas:**  Starts with a canvas filled with the background color.
2. **Paint objects:**  Paints each object from the input grid onto the canvas.
3. **Extend from painted objects:**  Extends each object to the right as in Version 1, but starting from the already painted object on the canvas. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    current_color = mostcolor(I)
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        current_color = index(I, (i, j))
      elif current_color != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate row-wise:** Iterates through the grid row by row.
2. **Track current color:**  Maintains a 'current_color' variable, initially set to background.
3. **Update and fill:** Updates 'current_color' when a non-background cell is encountered. If the current cell is background and 'current_color' is not background, it fills the cell with 'current_color'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    rightmost_cell = max(obj, key=lambda x: x[1][1])
    for j in range(rightmost_cell[1][1] + 1, width(I)):
      if index(I, (rightmost_cell[1][0], j)) != mostcolor(I):
        break
      O = fill(O, rightmost_cell[0], {(rightmost_cell[1][0], j)})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find rightmost cell:**  Finds the rightmost cell of each object.
2. **Extend from rightmost cell:** Extends the object's color horizontally from the rightmost cell until it encounters another object or the grid edge.
