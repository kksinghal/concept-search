## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) and extending them horizontally towards the right until they hit another object or the edge of the grid. 

**Input 0:**  The '1' objects are extended rightwards. The top '1' merges with the '3' object. The bottom '1' remains unchanged as it already touches the right edge.

**Input 1:**  The '7' and '8' objects are extended rightwards. 

**Input 2:** All '1' objects are extended rightwards. The central '1' merges with the '3' object.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve_7468f01a(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T)  # Find all objects in the grid.
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    io, jo = ulcorner(obj)  # Get upper-left corner of the object.
    for j in range(jo + 1, width(I)):  # Iterate from the object's right edge to the grid's right edge.
      if (io, j) not in toindices(obj) and index(I, (io, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        break  # Stop extending if we hit another object or a non-background cell.
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(io, j)})  # Fill the current cell with the object's color.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  We use `objects(I, F, T, T)` to find all connected regions of digits, ignoring the background.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** For each object, we iterate horizontally from its rightmost cell to the grid's edge.
3. **Check for Collision:**  Before filling, we check if the current cell belongs to another object or is not a background cell using `index(I, (io, j)) != mostcolor(I)`.
4. **Fill:**  If the cell is empty (background), we fill it with the object's color using `fill(O, color(obj), {(io, j)})`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve_7468f01a(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create a canvas filled with background color
  for i in range(height(I)):
    current_color = None  # Keep track of the current color being extended
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        current_color = I[i][j]  # Update current color if we encounter a non-background cell
      if current_color is not None:
        O = fill(O, current_color, {(i,j)})  # Fill with the current color if one is active
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** We create an output grid `O` filled with the background color using `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`.
2. **Iterate Row-wise:**  We iterate through each row of the input grid.
3. **Track Current Color:** `current_color` stores the color being extended, initialized to `None`.
4. **Update and Fill:** If we encounter a non-background cell, we update `current_color`. If `current_color` is not `None`, we fill the corresponding cell in the output grid with that color.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve_7468f01a(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    last_obj_color = None  # Store the color of the last encountered object
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != mostcolor(I):  # Check for non-background color
        last_obj_color = val
      else:
        if last_obj_color is not None:
          O = fill(O, last_obj_color, {(i, j)})  # Fill if within an object's horizontal extension
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 2 but uses `last_obj_color` to track the color of the most recently encountered object in each row. 

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve_7468f01a(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, F, T, T):
    rightmost_j = rightmost(obj) # Find the rightmost column of the object
    for j in range(rightmost_j + 1, width(I)):
      if index(I, (uppermost(obj), j)) != mostcolor(I):  # Check if the cell is occupied
        break  # Stop extending if the cell is not empty
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(uppermost(obj), j)})  # Fill the cell with the object's color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on finding the rightmost point of each object and extending horizontally from there.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve_7468f01a(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T)
  extension_areas = []
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1):
      extension_areas.append(shoot((i, rightmost(obj)), RIGHT)) # Generate lines extending right from each object cell
  O = I
  for area in extension_areas:
    for i, j in area:
      if 0 <= i < height(I) and 0 <= j < width(I) and index(I, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, color(toobject({(i,j)}, I)), {(i, j)}) # Fill with the color of the object that generated the extension line
      else:
        break  # Stop extending a line if it hits an object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version generates "extension lines" emanating rightwards from each cell of every object and fills background cells encountered by these lines.
