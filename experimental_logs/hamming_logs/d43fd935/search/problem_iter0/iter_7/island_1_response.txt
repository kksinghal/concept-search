## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation connects objects of the same color horizontally. If an object consists of multiple cells, it gets extended to the right until it hits another object or the grid border. 

**Example breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The '1' objects in the top and bottom rows extend to the right. The '3' object is already connected. The '6' objects each extend right until they hit another '6' object or the grid border.
* **Input_1:** The '7' objects extend right, connecting with other '7' objects or stopping at the grid border. The '8' objects behave similarly. The '3' object remains unchanged.
* **Input_2:** The '1' objects extend right, connecting with each other or the border. The '3' object remains unchanged. 

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_4be741c5(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        for i, j in toindices(obj):
            for k in range(j + 1, width(I)):
                if index(I, (i, k)) != bg:
                    break
                O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, k)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The program starts by identifying all objects on the grid using `objects(I, True, False, True)`. This excludes the background color and treats diagonally connected cells as separate objects.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** For each object, the program iterates through its cells. For each cell, it moves rightward, filling cells with the object's color until it encounters a non-background color.
3. **Return Modified Grid:**  The modified grid `O`, now with horizontally connected objects, is returned.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_4be741c5(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        current_color = None
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if value != mostcolor(I):
                current_color = value
            if current_color is not None:
                O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Blank Canvas:** The program starts by creating an empty grid (`O`) of the same size as the input grid (`I`), filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate Row-wise:** It then iterates through each row of the input grid.
3. **Track Current Color:**  For each cell in the row, it checks if the value is different from the background. If it is, it updates `current_color`.
4. **Fill Until End:** If `current_color` is set, it fills the corresponding cell in the output grid (`O`) with `current_color`. This continues until the end of the row is reached. 

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_4be741c5(I):
    h, w = shape(I)
    O = I
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w - 1):
            if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I):
                O = fill(O, index(O, (i, j)), {(i, j + 1)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Compare:** This program iterates through each cell of the grid except for the last column. It checks if the current cell is not background and the cell to its right is background.
2. **Fill if Condition Met:** If the condition is met, it fills the cell to the right with the color of the current cell, effectively extending the object one cell to the right.
3. **Return Modified Grid:** The program returns the modified grid `O`.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_4be741c5(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    O = I
    for i in range(height(I)):
        current_obj = None
        for j in range(width(I)):
            if index(I, (i, j)) != bg:
                if current_obj is None:
                    current_obj = {(i, j)}
                else:
                    current_obj.add((i, j))
        if current_obj is not None:
            start_j = leftmost(current_obj)
            end_j = rightmost(current_obj) + 1
            O = fill(O, index(I, (i, start_j)), {(i, k) for k in range(start_j, end_j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Identify Objects:**  The program iterates row-by-row, identifying contiguous non-background cells as objects and storing their indices in `current_obj`.
2. **Determine Object Boundaries:**  For each identified object, it determines the leftmost and rightmost column indices.
3. **Fill with Object Color:**  It then fills the cells between these boundaries with the color of the object, effectively connecting the object horizontally.
4. **Return Modified Grid:** Finally, the modified grid `O` is returned.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_4be741c5(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, v, {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))})
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Identify Non-Background:** The program iterates through each row and finds the first non-background color.
2. **Fill to the Right:** Once a non-background color is found, it fills all cells to the right with that color, effectively extending the object to the edge or another object.
3. **Move to the Next Row:** The process repeats for the next row.
4. **Return Modified Grid:** The modified grid `O` is returned after processing all rows.
