## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as **"Horizontal Color Extension to the Rightmost Same-Color Pixel in the Row"**. 

This means that for each non-background pixel in a row, we extend its color horizontally to the right until:
* We encounter another non-background pixel of a different color, OR
* We reach the end of the row.

Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**
* The '1's in the first and last rows are extended to the right until the '6'.
* The '3's in the fourth row extend to the right until the '1'.
* The '6's remain unchanged as they are already at the rightmost position in their rows.

**Input_1:**
* The '7' in the third row extends to the right until it hits the first '3'.
* The '3's in the third row extend to the right until the '8'.
*  Other digits are extended similarly.

**Input_2:**
*  The '1's in the second, third, fourth, fifth and last rows are extended rightward until reaching another '1' or the edge.
* The '3's remain unchanged as they are already at their rightmost positions.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
  """ 
  Extends non-background colors horizontally to the rightmost occurrence of 
  the same color in their respective rows.
  """
  h, w = shape(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), (h, w))
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, color in enumerate(row):
      if color != mostcolor(grid):
        rightmost_index = max(k for k in range(w) if row[k] == color)
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, color, {(i, k) for k in range(j, rightmost_index + 1)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Get grid dimensions (h, w) and create a new grid filled with the background color using `canvas(mostcolor(grid), (h, w))`.
2. **Iteration:** Iterate through each cell (i, j) of the input grid.
3. **Color Extension:** For each non-background color, find the rightmost occurrence of that color in the same row using `max(k for k in range(w) if row[k] == color)`.
4. **Fill:** Fill the new grid from the current position (j) to the rightmost occurrence with the current color using `fill(new_grid, color, {(i, k) for k in range(j, rightmost_index + 1)})`.
5. **Return:** Return the modified `new_grid`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
  """ 
  Iterates through each row and applies a function to extend colors.
  """
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      extend_color(row, j, color, mostcolor(grid))
      for j, color in enumerate(row)
    )
    for row in grid
  )

def extend_color(row: Tuple, j: Integer, color: Integer, bg: Integer) -> Integer:
  """ 
  Extends the color to the rightmost occurrence in the row if not background.
  """
  return next(
    (row[k] for k in range(len(row) - 1, j - 1, -1) if row[k] == color),
    color
  ) if color != bg else bg
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Row-wise Iteration:** Iterates through each row of the grid.
2. **`extend_color` Function:** For each cell, calls the `extend_color` function to determine the color at that position in the output.
3. **`extend_color` Logic:**
   - If the current color is not the background, it iterates from the end of the row towards the current position (`j`) to find the rightmost occurrence of the same color.
   - If found, it returns that color; otherwise, it returns the original color.
   - If the current color is the background, it remains unchanged.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
  """ 
  Uses `papply` to extend colors based on rightmost occurrence in each row.
  """
  return tuple(
    papply(
      lambda j, color: extend_color(row, j, color, mostcolor(grid)),
      tuple(range(len(row))),
      row
    )
    for row in grid
  )

def extend_color(row: Tuple, j: Integer, color: Integer, bg: Integer) -> Integer:
  """ 
  Same as in Program Version 2.
  """
  return next(
    (row[k] for k in range(len(row) - 1, j - 1, -1) if row[k] == color),
    color
  ) if color != bg else bg 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`papply` for Color Extension:** This version uses `papply` to apply the `extend_color` function to each cell (j, color) in a row.
2. **Row and Index Generation:** It generates a tuple of indices for each row using `tuple(range(len(row)))` for `papply`.
3. **`extend_color` Function:** Remains the same as in Program Version 2.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
  """ 
  Utilizes object-based approach to extend colors within object boundaries.
  """
  return paint(
    canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)),
    merge(
      apply(
        lambda obj: extend_object(grid, obj),
        fgpartition(grid)
      )
    )
  )

def extend_object(grid: Grid, obj: Object) -> Object:
  """ 
  Extends the object horizontally to the rightmost occurrence of its color 
  in its initial row.
  """
  first_row = uppermost(obj)
  return frozenset(
    (color, (first_row, j))
    for color, (i, j) in obj
    for k in range(j, width(grid))
    if index(grid, (first_row, k)) == color
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object-based Approach:** This version leverages object detection and manipulation.
2. **`fgpartition` for Objects:** It identifies non-background objects using `fgpartition(grid)`.
3. **`extend_object` Function:** For each object, it finds the rightmost occurrence of its color in its initial row and extends it horizontally within the object.
4. **Painting the Canvas:** Finally, it paints the extended objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
  """
  A more concise version using list comprehension for color extension.
  """
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      next(
        (c for k in range(len(row) - 1, j - 1, -1) if row[k] == c), 
        c
      ) if c != mostcolor(grid) else c
      for j, c in enumerate(row)
    )
    for row in grid
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Concise List Comprehension:** This version utilizes nested list comprehensions for a more concise implementation.
2. **Direct Color Extension:** It directly extends colors within the list comprehension using the same logic as in Version 2, without relying on a separate function.

These five program versions offer diverse approaches to achieve the desired color extension transformation, showcasing different DSL function combinations and logic flows.
