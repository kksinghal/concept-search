## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects downwards in each column, filling the background cells with the object's color until it encounters another non-background color.

**Input 0:**  
* The '1's at (0,0) and (9,4) remain unchanged.
* The '3's extend downwards from (3,2)-(4,3) to (3,2)-(4,7) filling the background '0's.
* The '6's extend downwards in their respective columns.

**Input 1:**
* The logic is consistent, with objects extending downwards to fill background cells. 
* Notice the '8' at (2,9) stops the downward extension of the '3' object.

**Input 2:**
* This example reinforces the pattern of downward object extension, with objects like the '1's and '3's extending to fill the background cells below.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_version_1(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
  """
  Extends objects downwards in each column, filling background cells.
  """
  def extend_down(i: Integer, j: Integer, color: Integer) -> Indices:
    """
    Returns a set of indices representing the downward extension of an object.
    """
    extension = set()
    for k in range(i + 1, height(grid)):
      if index(grid, (k, j)) == mostcolor(grid):
        extension.add((k, j))
      else:
        break
    return frozenset(extension)

  new_cells = set()
  for i in range(height(grid)):
    for j in range(width(grid)):
      color = index(grid, (i, j))
      if color != mostcolor(grid):
        new_cells |= recolor(color, extend_down(i, j, color))
  return paint(grid, frozenset(new_cells)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **extend_down function:** This function takes the starting cell's coordinates (i, j) and color as input. It iterates downwards in the column, adding background cells to the 'extension' set until it encounters a non-background cell.
2. **Main Loop:** The main loop iterates over each cell of the grid. 
3. **Object Extension:** If a non-background cell is encountered, it calls the 'extend_down' function to get the indices for the downward extension and recolors these indices with the object's color. 
4. **Painting:** Finally, all the extended cells are painted onto the original grid, resulting in the desired transformation.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_version_2(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
  """
  Uses functional programming to extend objects downwards in each column.
  """
  def extend_column(j: Integer) -> FrozenSet[Cell]:
    """ 
    Extends objects downwards within a given column.
    """
    return frozenset((index(grid, (i, j)), (k, j))
                      for i in range(height(grid))
                      for k in range(i + 1, height(grid))
                      if index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcolor(grid) 
                      and index(grid, (k, j)) == mostcolor(grid)
                      and all(index(grid, (l, j)) == mostcolor(grid)
                              for l in range(i + 1, k)))
  return paint(grid, merge(apply(extend_column, range(width(grid)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **extend_column Function:** Takes a column index 'j' and returns cells representing the extended objects in that column. It uses nested loops and conditions to identify background cells that should be filled based on the object above.
2. **Functional Approach:** Applies the 'extend_column' function to each column index using `apply`. Then, `merge` combines the results into a single set of cells.
3. **Painting:**  Finally, it paints the extended cells onto the grid, achieving the transformation.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_version_3(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
  """
  Utilizes column-wise iteration and in-place modification for efficiency.
  """
  grid = [list(row) for row in grid]  # Convert to list for in-place modification
  for j in range(width(grid)):
    current_color = mostcolor(grid)  # Initialize with background color
    for i in range(height(grid)):
      if grid[i][j] != mostcolor(grid):
        current_color = grid[i][j]
      elif current_color != mostcolor(grid):
        grid[i][j] = current_color
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in grid)  # Convert back to tuple
```

**Explanation:**

1. **In-Place Modification:** Converts the input grid to a list of lists to allow direct modification of cells.
2. **Column-wise Iteration:** Iterates over each column.
3. **Color Tracking:**  Maintains 'current_color' to track the color of the object being extended. 
4. **Extension Logic:**  If a background cell ('0') is encountered and 'current_color' is not the background, it fills the cell with 'current_color'.
5. **Tuple Conversion:** Converts the modified grid back to a tuple before returning.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_version_4(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
  """
  Leverages object detection and individual object extension.
  """
  def extend_object(obj: Object) -> Object:
    """
    Extends a single object downwards.
    """
    extended_obj = set(obj)
    for _, (i, j) in obj:
      for k in range(i + 1, height(grid)):
        if index(grid, (k, j)) == mostcolor(grid):
          extended_obj.add((color(obj), (k, j)))
        else:
          break
    return frozenset(extended_obj)
  
  return paint(grid, merge(apply(extend_object, fgpartition(grid))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object-Oriented Approach:** Uses `fgpartition` to detect individual non-background objects in the grid.
2. **extend_object Function:** Takes an object and extends it downwards, similar to the logic in previous versions.
3. **Application to Objects:** Applies the 'extend_object' function to each detected object.
4. **Merging and Painting:** Merges the extended objects and paints them onto the original grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_version_5(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
  """
  Employs a recursive approach for object extension.
  """
  def fill_down(i: Integer, j: Integer, color: Integer):
    """
    Recursively fills background cells downwards with the given color.
    """
    if i >= height(grid) or index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcolor(grid):
      return
    grid[i][j] = color  # Modify in-place (grid is a list of lists here)
    fill_down(i + 1, j, color)

  grid = [list(row) for row in grid]
  for i in range(height(grid)):
    for j in range(width(grid)):
      if grid[i][j] != mostcolor(grid):
        fill_down(i + 1, j, grid[i][j])
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Recursive fill_down Function:**  This function recursively explores downwards in a column, filling background cells with the provided color. The recursion stops when a non-background cell or the grid boundary is reached.
2. **Iteration and Function Call:** The main loops iterate through each cell, and if it's not a background cell, it initiates the `fill_down` recursion.

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the same transformation using different DSL functions, control flow, and data structures. They highlight the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL while showcasing various programming paradigms.
