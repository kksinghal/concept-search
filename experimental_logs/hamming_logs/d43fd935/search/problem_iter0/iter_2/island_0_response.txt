## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying diagonal lines of a specific color in the input grid and extending them either horizontally or vertically until they encounter another object. 

* **Input 0:** The diagonal line of '1's is extended horizontally to the right until it hits the '6'.
* **Input 1:**  The diagonal line of '7's is extended horizontally to the right until it hits the '8' or '3'.
* **Input 2:** The diagonal line of '1's is extended vertically downwards until it hits the '3's.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(O, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and i > 0 and j > 0:
        if index(O, (i - 1, j - 1)) == index(I, (i, j)):
          if i < height(I) - 1 and index(O, (i + 1, j)) == mostcolor(I):
            O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i + 1, j)})
          if j < width(I) - 1 and index(O, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I):
            O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, j + 1)}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** The output grid `O` is initialized with the input grid `I`.
2. **Iteration:** The program iterates through each cell of the grid.
3. **Diagonal Check:** It checks if the current cell is not the background color and if the cell diagonally above and to the left has the same color.
4. **Extension:** If the diagonal check is true, it extends the line horizontally to the right or vertically downwards if the next cell in that direction is the background color.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), asobject(I))
  for i in range(height(I) - 1):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
      if index(O, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and index(O, (i + 1, j + 1)) == index(I, (i, j)):
        if i < height(I) - 1 and index(O, (i + 1, j)) == mostcolor(I):
          O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i + 1, j)})
        if j < width(I) - 1 and index(O, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I):
          O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** A blank canvas `O` of the same size as the input grid `I` is created, filled with the most common color of `I`. Then, the objects from `I` are painted onto the canvas.
2. **Iteration:** The program iterates through each cell of the grid (except the last row and column).
3. **Diagonal Check:**  It checks if the current cell is not the background color and if the cell diagonally below and to the right has the same color. 
4. **Extension:** If the diagonal check is true, it extends the line horizontally to the right or vertically downwards if the next cell in that direction is the background color.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objs:
        direction = position(shift(obj, (1, 1)), obj)
        O = paint(O, obj)
        current = centerofmass(obj)
        while index(O, add(current, direction)) == mostcolor(I):
            O = fill(O, color(obj), {add(current, direction)})
            current = add(current, direction)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:** It identifies all the objects in the input grid `I` excluding the background.
2. **Initialization:**  A blank canvas `O` is created filled with the background color.
3. **Iteration & Extension:** For each object:
    - The direction of the diagonal line is determined.
    - The object is painted onto the canvas.
    - The line is extended in the identified direction until it encounters a non-background cell.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(height(I) - 1):
        for j in range(width(I) - 1):
            if index(O, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and index(O, (i + 1, j + 1)) == index(I, (i, j)):
                next_loc = (i + 1, j) if j < width(I) - 1 and index(O, (i + 1, j)) == mostcolor(I) else (i, j + 1) if i < height(I) - 1 and index(O, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I) else (i, j)
                O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {next_loc})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  The output grid `O` is initialized with the input grid `I`.
2. **Iteration:** The program iterates through each cell of the grid (except the last row and column).
3. **Diagonal Check:** It checks if the current cell is not the background color and if the cell diagonally below and to the right has the same color.
4. **Extension:** It determines the next location to fill based on whether the right or bottom cell is the background color. 
5. **Fill:**  The identified location is filled with the current cell's color.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_d10ecb37(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
        if len(obj) > 1:
            direction = gravitate(shift(obj, (1, 1)), obj)
            current = centerofmass(obj)
            next_loc = add(current, direction)
            while index(O, next_loc) == mostcolor(I):
                O = fill(O, color(obj), {next_loc})
                next_loc = add(next_loc, direction)
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:** It identifies all the objects in the input grid `I` excluding the background.
2. **Iteration & Extension:**  For each object that has more than one cell:
    - The direction of the diagonal line is determined using the `gravitate` function.
    - Starting from the object's center of mass, it iteratively fills the next location in the determined direction as long as it's the background color.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation using different combinations of DSL functions and logic.
