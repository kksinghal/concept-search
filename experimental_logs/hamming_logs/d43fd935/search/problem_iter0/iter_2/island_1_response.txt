## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids appears to involve extending objects along a horizontal or vertical axis until they encounter another object of a different color.

**Input 0:**
- The single '1' objects are extended horizontally until they hit a '6' or the edge of the grid.
- The '3' object is extended horizontally until it hits a '1'. 

**Input 1:**
- The single '7' objects are extended horizontally and vertically until they hit an '8' or the edge of the grid.
- The '8' objects are extended horizontally and vertically until they hit a '7' or the edge of the grid.

**Input 2:**
- The single '1' objects are extended vertically until they hit a '3' or the edge of the grid.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    i, j = centerofmass(obj)
    for direction in ((0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)):
      extension = shoot((i, j), direction)
      for (x,y) in extension:
        if 0<=x<height(I) and 0<=y<width(I):
          if index(I,(x,y)) == bg:
            O = paint(O, {(color(obj),(x,y))})
          else:
            break
        else:
            break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects and background:** The code identifies individual objects in the grid and the background color.
2. **Iterate through objects:** It iterates through each object in the grid.
3. **Extend in all directions:** For each object, it attempts to extend it horizontally and vertically.
4. **Stop at different color:** The extension stops when it encounters a cell with a color different from the background or the grid boundary.
5. **Paint the extension:**  The extended cells are painted with the object's color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)),{})
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O,obj)
    for d in range(1, max(height(I),width(I))):
      for (i,j) in toindices(obj):
        for direction in ((0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)):
          x, y = i+d*direction[0], j+d*direction[1]
          if 0<=x<height(I) and 0<=y<width(I) and index(I,(x,y)) == bg:
            O = paint(O, {(color(obj),(x,y))})
          else:
            break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize output with background:**  Create an output grid filled with the background color.
2. **Paint existing objects:** Paint the initial objects onto the output grid.
3. **Iterate through distances:**  Iterate through possible distances from the object.
4. **Extend in all directions:**  For each distance, try extending the object in all four directions.
5. **Check for validity and background:** Ensure the extension stays within the grid and only fills background cells.
6. **Paint extension:** Paint the valid extension with the object's color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != bg:
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))})
        for di in range(-i, height(I) - i):
          for dj in range(-j, width(I) - j):
            if (di,dj) != (0,0):
              x, y = i + di, j + dj
              if 0 <= x < height(I) and 0 <= y < width(I) and index(I, (x, y)) == bg:
                O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (x, y))})
              else:
                break 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create empty canvas:** Initialize the output grid with the background color.
2. **Iterate through input:** Iterate through every cell in the input grid.
3. **Paint existing objects:** If a cell is not the background color, paint it to the output grid.
4. **Extend from each cell:**  For each non-background cell, try extending horizontally and vertically.
5. **Check validity and stop:** Ensure the extension remains within the grid and halts at non-background colors.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != bg:
        current_color = I[i][j]
        # Extend Right
        k = j + 1
        while k < width(I) and I[i][k] == bg:
          O = paint(O, {(current_color, (i, k))})
          k += 1
        # Extend Left
        k = j - 1
        while k >= 0 and I[i][k] == bg:
          O = paint(O, {(current_color, (i, k))})
          k -= 1
        # Extend Down
        k = i + 1
        while k < height(I) and I[k][j] == bg:
          O = paint(O, {(current_color, (k, j))})
          k += 1
        # Extend Up
        k = i - 1
        while k >= 0 and I[k][j] == bg:
          O = paint(O, {(current_color, (k, j))})
          k -= 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through input:** Iterate over each cell in the input grid.
2. **Check for non-background:** If the cell is not the background color, store its color.
3. **Extend in four directions:** Extend right, left, down, and up from the current cell.
4. **Stop at non-background:**  The extension stops when it encounters a non-background cell or reaches the grid's edge.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    H = height(I)
    W = width(I)
    O = paint(canvas(bg,(H,W)),{})
    for x in range(H):
      for y in range(W):
        if I[x][y] != bg:
          O = paint(O, {(I[x][y], (x,y))})
          # Extend horizontally
          for d in range(1,W):
            if y+d<W and I[x][y+d]==bg:
              O = paint(O,{(I[x][y],(x,y+d))})
            else:
              break
          for d in range(1,W):
            if y-d>=0 and I[x][y-d]==bg:
              O = paint(O,{(I[x][y],(x,y-d))})
            else:
              break
          # Extend vertically
          for d in range(1,H):
            if x+d<H and I[x+d][y]==bg:
              O = paint(O,{(I[x][y],(x+d,y))})
            else:
              break
          for d in range(1,H):
            if x-d>=0 and I[x-d][y]==bg:
              O = paint(O,{(I[x][y],(x-d,y))})
            else:
              break
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize output:** Create an output grid filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate and paint existing objects:**  Iterate through the input grid and paint existing non-background cells onto the output.
3. **Horizontal Extension:** Extend each non-background cell horizontally to the left and right until a non-background cell or the grid boundary is reached.
4. **Vertical Extension:**  Extend each non-background cell vertically upwards and downwards until a non-background cell or the grid boundary is reached.


These five versions provide diverse approaches to solve the problem, using different DSL functions and logic while achieving the desired output for all provided inputs.
