## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the smallest object in each grid and extends its color either horizontally or vertically based on its shape. 

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
- The smallest object is the single '1' cell. 
- Since it's wider than it is tall (a horizontal line of length 1), its color (1) extends horizontally to the right, filling all cells with the value '1' that were originally '1'.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- The smallest objects are the single '8' cells.
- They are taller than they are wide (vertical lines of length 1), so their color (8) extends vertically downwards, replacing any '7's encountered along the way.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
- The smallest object is a single '1' cell.
- It's a square shape, so the transformation considers it wider. It extends horizontally, changing other '1' cells to the right to match. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  s_obj = argmin(objs, size)
  val = color(s_obj)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if obj == s_obj:
      if width(obj) >= height(obj):
        O = paint(O, recolor(val, backdrop(obj)))
      else:
        O = paint(O, recolor(val, backdrop(vmirror(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, T, T)` finds all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Smallest Object:** `argmin(objs, size)` determines the smallest object.
3. **Object Color:** `color(s_obj)` extracts the color of the smallest object.
4. **Iterate and Paint:**  The code iterates through each object. If an object matches the smallest object, it checks its dimensions:
   - **Wide:** `width(obj) >= height(obj)` - If wider or square, it paints the entire bounding box (`backdrop(obj)`) of the smallest object with its color.
   - **Tall:** `else` - If taller, it virtually mirrors the bounding box vertically (`vmirror(obj)`) before painting to extend the color downwards.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  s_obj = argmin(objects(I, T, T, T), size)
  val = color(s_obj)
  O = I
  if width(s_obj) >= height(s_obj):
    O = paint(O, recolor(val, hfrontier(ulcorner(s_obj))))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(val, vfrontier(ulcorner(s_obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Smallest:** Identify the smallest object and its color as in Version 1.
2. **Horizontal or Vertical?:** Determine if the smallest object is wider or taller (or a square).
3. **Paint Frontier:** 
   - **Wide:** Paint the horizontal frontier (`hfrontier`) starting from the object's upper-left corner.
   - **Tall:** Paint the vertical frontier (`vfrontier`) starting from the object's upper-left corner.


**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  s_obj = argmin(objects(I, T, T, T), size)
  val = color(s_obj)
  start = ulcorner(s_obj)
  direction = (1, 0) if width(s_obj) >= height(s_obj) else (0, 1)
  O = paint(I, recolor(val, shoot(start, direction)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Smallest and Color:**  Find the smallest object and its color (like previous versions).
2. **Direction:** Calculate the fill direction: 
   - `(1, 0)` for horizontal (rightward).
   - `(0, 1)` for vertical (downward).
3. **Shoot and Paint:** Use `shoot(start, direction)` to generate a line of indices extending infinitely in the chosen direction from the smallest object's starting point. Paint this line with the object's color. 

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
    s_obj = argmin(objs, size)
    val = color(s_obj)
    O = I
    for x in range(len(I)):
        for y in range(len(I[0])):
            if index(I, (x,y)) == val:
                if width(s_obj) >= height(s_obj):
                    O = paint(O, {(val, (x, j)) for j in range(y, len(I[0]))})
                else:
                    O = paint(O, {(val, (i, y)) for i in range(x, len(I))})
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Smallest:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Iterate and Check:** Iterates through every cell in the grid.
3. **Match and Extend:** If a cell matches the color of the smallest object:
    - **Wide:** Extends the color horizontally to the right from the current cell.
    - **Tall:** Extends the color vertically downwards from the current cell.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  s_obj = argmin(objects(I, T, T, T), size)
  val = color(s_obj)
  if width(s_obj) >= height(s_obj):
    return hconcat(lefthalf(I), fill(righthalf(I), val, asindices(righthalf(I))))
  else:
    return vconcat(tophalf(I), fill(bottomhalf(I), val, asindices(bottomhalf(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Smallest and Shape:** Find the smallest object and determine if it's wider or taller.
2. **Split and Fill:**
    - **Wide:** Split the grid vertically (`lefthalf`, `righthalf`). Fill the right half with the smallest object's color.
    - **Tall:** Split the grid horizontally (`tophalf`, `bottomhalf`). Fill the bottom half with the smallest object's color.
3. **Combine:**  Concatenate the modified halves back together (`hconcat` or `vconcat`).
