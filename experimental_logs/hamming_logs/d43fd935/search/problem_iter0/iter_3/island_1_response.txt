## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves extending objects horizontally to connect with other objects of the same color along the same row. 

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

**Input_0 - Output_0:**

* The single '1' objects remain unchanged.
* The '3' object extends rightward to connect with the rightmost '1' object. 
* The '6' objects extend rightward to connect with their nearest same-colored neighbor.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**

*  Single '7' and '8' objects remain unchanged.
* The top-most '7' object extends rightward to connect with the rightmost '8' object.
* The bottom '7' object extends rightward to connect with the rightmost '7' object.
* Similarly, other objects extend horizontally to their closest same-colored neighbor.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**

* All the '1' objects extend rightward to connect with their nearest same-colored neighbor.
* The '3' object remains unchanged.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I) # Find background color
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Get objects, excluding background
    new_objs = set()
    for obj in objs:
        row_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda o: uppermost(o) == uppermost(obj) and color(o) == color(obj)) # Find objects on same row with same color
        rightmost_j = valmax(row_objs, rightmost) # Find rightmost column of those objects
        extended_obj = set(obj)
        for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost_j + 1): # Fill horizontally from leftmost to rightmost
            extended_obj.add((color(obj), (uppermost(obj), j))) 
        new_objs.add(frozenset(extended_obj))
    O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(new_objs)) # Paint new objects onto a blank canvas
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background and objects:** Similar to Program A, this version identifies the background color and extracts objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate through objects:** The program iterates through each object in the grid.
3. **Find objects on the same row with the same color:** It identifies other objects in the same row that share the same color as the current object.
4. **Determine the rightmost column:** It determines the rightmost column index among the identified objects.
5. **Extend the object horizontally:**  The current object is extended horizontally from its leftmost to the determined rightmost column.
6. **Paint extended objects:**  All extended objects are painted onto a blank canvas filled with the background color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  new_grid = canvas(bg, shape(I)) # Start with a blank canvas
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for obj in sfilter(objs, lambda o: uppermost(o) == i): # For each row
      rightmost_j = valmax(sfilter(objs, lambda o: uppermost(o) == i and color(o) == color(obj)), rightmost) # Rightmost object with same color in the row
      new_grid = fill(new_grid, color(obj), product(frozenset({i}), interval(leftmost(obj), rightmost_j + 1))) # Fill the row segment
  O = new_grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize with a blank canvas:**  A canvas filled with the background color is created.
2. **Iterate through rows:** The program iterates through each row of the grid.
3. **Find the rightmost object:**  For each object in the row, it finds the rightmost object in the same row with the same color. 
4. **Fill horizontally:** The row segment between the current object's leftmost point and the determined rightmost object is filled with the object's color.
5. **Return the filled canvas:** The modified canvas, representing the transformed grid, is returned.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    new_objs = []
    for obj in objs:
        same_row_objs = sorted([o for o in objs if uppermost(o) == uppermost(obj) and color(o) == color(obj)], key=lambda x: leftmost(x))
        if len(same_row_objs) > 1:  
            merged_obj = frozenset((color(obj), (uppermost(obj), j)) for j in range(leftmost(same_row_objs[0]), rightmost(same_row_objs[-1]) + 1))
            new_objs.append(merged_obj)
        else:
            new_objs.append(obj)
    O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(new_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Similar to previous versions, this version identifies the background color and extracts objects.
2. **Iterate and Sort:** It iterates through each object, and for those in the same row and with the same color, it sorts them based on their leftmost positions.
3. **Merge Objects:** If multiple objects with the same color exist in a row, it merges them into a single object spanning their combined horizontal range.
4. **Paint Merged Objects:** It paints these merged objects onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
      merge(apply(
          lambda obj: recolor(
              color(obj), 
              frozenset(
                  (uppermost(obj),j) 
                  for j in range(
                      leftmost(obj), 
                      valmax(
                          sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: uppermost(o) == uppermost(obj) and color(o) == color(obj)), 
                          rightmost
                      ) + 1
                  )
              )
          ), 
          objects(I, T, F, T)
      ))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested function calls to achieve the same outcome in a more compact form. It directly modifies the input grid by recoloring the segments between objects of the same color on the same row.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_object(obj, objs):
    same_row_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda o: uppermost(o) == uppermost(obj) and color(o) == color(obj))
    max_right = valmax(same_row_objs, rightmost)
    return frozenset((color(obj), (uppermost(obj), j)) for j in range(leftmost(obj), max_right + 1))

  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  extended_objs = apply(lambda obj: extend_object(obj, objs), objs)
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(extended_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a helper function `extend_object` to encapsulate the logic of extending individual objects. The main function focuses on applying this helper function to each object and painting the results.

Each of these programs implements a slightly different approach using distinct DSL function combinations to achieve the desired transformation. This showcases the flexibility and diversity of solutions possible within the provided DSL.
