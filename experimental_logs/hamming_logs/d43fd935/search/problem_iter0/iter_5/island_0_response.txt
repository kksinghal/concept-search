## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all three examples can be described as **"extending horizontal lines of non-background colors to the right until they hit another non-background color."** 

Let's break down each example:

**Example 0:** 
* The single '1' at (0,0) remains unchanged as it has no space to extend right.
* The '3' objects at (3,2),(3,3) and (4,2),(4,3) merge and extend right to hit '1' at (3,8). 
* The '6' objects extend right to hit other '6's or the edge of the grid.

**Example 1:**
* The '7' and '8' objects extend horizontally right until they encounter another non-zero digit.

**Example 2:**
* The vertical lines of '1's are transformed into horizontal lines extending right until they hit the last '1' in their row.
* The '3' object remains unchanged as it has no space to extend right.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing the described transformation using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
           merge(frozenset(
                frozenset(
                  (v, (i, j)) for j in range(k, width(I)) if index(I, (i, k)) == v 
                )
                for i, row in enumerate(I) 
                for k, v in enumerate(row) if v != mostcolor(I)
              ))
           )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`**: Creates a blank canvas of the same size as input grid `I`, filled with the background color.
2. **Nested loops (`for i, row...for k,v...`)**: Iterate over each cell in the input grid.
3. **`if v != mostcolor(I)`**:  Only process non-background cells.
4. **`(v, (i, j)) for j in range(k, width(I))...`**: For each non-background cell, create a horizontal line of the same color extending to the right edge of the grid.
5. **`if index(I, (i, k)) == v`**:  Stop extending the line if it encounters another cell of the same color in the input grid.
6. **`frozenset(...)`**: Convert the line coordinates into a frozenset representing an object.
7. **`merge(...)`**: Combine all generated objects.
8. **`paint(...)`**: Paint the merged objects onto the initially created canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  new_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(height(I)):
      row_obj = {(v, (i, j)) for v, (row, j) in obj if row == i}
      if row_obj:
        j_max = max(j for _, (i, j) in row_obj)
        new_objs.add(frozenset((next(iter(row_obj))[0], (i, j)) for j in range(j_max + 1)))
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(new_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, False, False, True)`**:  Identify objects in the input grid, treating different colors as separate objects and excluding the background.
2. **Loop over objects and rows**: Iterate through each object and each row in the grid.
3. **`row_obj`**:  Extract cells belonging to the current object and row.
4. **`j_max`**: Find the rightmost column index occupied by the object in the current row.
5. **Create a horizontal line**: Generate a new object representing a horizontal line from the leftmost column to `j_max` for the current object and row.
6. **Combine and paint**: Merge all generated lines and paint them onto a blank canvas filled with the background color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I) - 1):
            if index(O, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and index(O, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I):
                O = fill(O, index(O, (i, j)), {(i, k) for k in range(j + 1, width(I))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through grid cells**:  Loop through each cell in the grid from left to right, top to bottom.
2. **Check for extendable line**: If a cell is not background color and its right neighbor is the background, it's a potential line to extend.
3. **Extend the line**: Fill all cells to the right with the same color until the edge of the grid is reached.
4. **Return modified grid**: The grid `O`, modified in-place, now contains the horizontally extended lines.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  new_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
      right_extension = {(v, (i, k)) for k in range(j + 1, width(I)) if index(I, (i, k)) == bg}
      obj = obj | right_extension
    new_objs.add(obj)
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(new_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`**: Partition the input grid into objects, excluding the background color.
2. **Iterate over objects and cells**: Loop through each object and then each cell within the object.
3. **`right_extension`**: For every cell, identify a potential rightward extension as a set of coordinates with the same color, filling the space until a non-background color is encountered in the original grid.
4. **Merge extensions**: Add the `right_extension` to the current object.
5. **Combine and paint**: Merge all extended objects and paint them onto a blank canvas filled with the background color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    current_color = None
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v != mostcolor(I):
        current_color = v
      if current_color is not None:
        O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize output grid**: Create an output grid `O` filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate through rows and cells**: Loop through each row and then each cell within the row.
3. **Track current color**:  Store the most recently encountered non-background color in `current_color`.
4. **Fill with current color**: Fill the current cell in the output grid with `current_color` if it's not None. This effectively extends the last encountered non-background color horizontally.

These five program versions showcase distinct approaches to achieve the desired horizontal line extension transformation, utilizing different DSL functions and logic flow. Each version provides a unique solution while adhering to the provided DSL constraints.
