## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve extending objects horizontally towards the right until they encounter another object. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
- The '1' objects remain unchanged.
- The '3' object extends rightwards, absorbing the single '1' it encounters.
- The '6' objects extend rightwards until they hit another '6' or the edge of the grid.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- The '7' objects extend rightwards, stopping at the '8' objects or the edge.
- The '8' objects extend rightwards, stopping at the edge.
- The '3' object remains unchanged.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
- All '1' objects extend rightwards until they hit another '1' or the edge.
- The '3' object remains unchanged.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions for the "Program_to_be_generated" program:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
      k = j + 1
      while k < width(I) and index(O, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, v, {(i, k)})
        k += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  We identify objects excluding the background using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Initialize Output:**  We initialize the output grid `O` with the background color using `canvas`.
3. **Iterate and Extend:** We iterate over each object `obj`:
   - Paint the original object onto the output grid.
   - For each cell in the object, extend rightward (`k = j + 1`) by filling with the object's color (`v`) as long as we encounter the background color and stay within grid boundaries.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        current_color = None
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if value != mostcolor(I):
                current_color = value
            O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Create a blank canvas `O` filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate Row-wise:** Loop through each row `i` and its values `value` in the input grid `I`.
3. **Track Current Color:** Keep track of the `current_color` encountered. If a non-background color is found, update `current_color`.
4. **Fill Output:** Fill the corresponding cell `(i, j)` in the output grid `O` with the `current_color`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(objs))
  for obj in objs:
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
      extension = {(v, (i, k)) for k in range(j + 1, width(I))}
      O = paint(O, intersection(extension, asobject(fill(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), v, toindices(obj)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify objects excluding the background using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Initial Painting:** Paint all identified objects onto a background canvas `O`.
3. **Iterate and Extend:** Loop through each object `obj` and its cells:
    - Create a horizontal extension `extension` from each cell to the right edge.
    - Create a temporary grid by filling a blank canvas with the object's color at the object's indices.
    - Find the intersection between the extension and the temporary grid.
    - Paint this intersection onto the output grid `O`.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, v, {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))})
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Initialize the output grid `O` with the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** For each row, find the first non-background color (`v`). From that column onwards, fill the row with that color in the output grid `O`.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objs:
        rightmost_col = max(j for _, (i, j) in obj)
        for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
            O = fill(O, v, {(i, k) for k in range(j, rightmost_col + 1)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify the objects in the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Initialize Canvas:** Create an empty canvas `O` filled with the background color and having the same dimensions as the input grid.
3. **Iterate through Objects:** For each object `obj` in the identified objects:
    - Find the rightmost column (`rightmost_col`) occupied by the object.
    - For each cell `(v, (i, j))` in the object, fill the output canvas `O` horizontally from the cell's column (`j`) up to the `rightmost_col` with the object's color (`v`).
4. **Return Output:** Finally, return the modified canvas `O` as the output.

These five versions offer diverse approaches to solve the given transformation problem. Each version leverages different DSL functions and logic, demonstrating the flexibility and power of the provided DSL.
