## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the smallest object in the grid and extends it either horizontally or vertically based on its shape. However, the extension only occurs over existing cells of the same color as the smallest object.

* **Input_0 -> Output_0:** The smallest object is the single '1' cell. Since it's neither a horizontal nor vertical line, it expands horizontally to the right, covering all existing '1' cells in its row.
* **Input_1 -> Output_1:** The smallest object is any of the single '7' cells. It's considered a vertical line and expands to cover all '7' cells in its column.
* **Input_2 -> Output_2:**  The smallest object is any of the single '1' cells. It's neither a horizontal nor vertical line, so it expands vertically downwards, covering all existing '1' cells in its column.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  s_obj = argmin(objects(I, T, T, T), size)
  val = color(s_obj)
  row, col = ulcorner(s_obj)
  h, w = shape(I)

  if hline(s_obj) or portrait(s_obj):
    for i in range(row, h):
      if index(I, (i, col)) == val:
        I = paint(I, frozenset({(val, (i, j)) for j in range(col, w) if index(I, (i, j)) == val}))
  else:
    for j in range(col, w):
      if index(I, (row, j)) == val:
        I = paint(I, frozenset({(val, (i, j)) for i in range(row, h) if index(I, (i, j)) == val}))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Smallest Object:** Find the smallest object (`s_obj`), its color (`val`), and upper-left corner coordinates (`row`, `col`).
2. **Determine Extension Direction:** 
    * If `s_obj` is a horizontal line or portrait (taller than wide), extend horizontally.
    * Otherwise, extend vertically.
3. **Extend Over Existing Cells:** 
    * Iterate through either rows (horizontal) or columns (vertical).
    * For each row/column, check if the cell at the starting `col`/`row` has the same color (`val`).
    * If yes, extend the object to cover all consecutive cells of the same color in that row/column.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  s_obj = argmin(objects(I, T, T, T), size)
  val = color(s_obj)
  row, col = ulcorner(s_obj)
  h, w = shape(I)

  line = frozenset({(val, (row, j)) for j in range(col, w)}) if (hline(s_obj) or portrait(s_obj)) else frozenset({(val, (i, col)) for i in range(row, h)})

  return paint(I, intersection(asobject(I), line))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Smallest Object:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Create Extension Line:** Generate a line of cells (`line`) with the same color (`val`) as the smallest object, either horizontally or vertically based on its shape.
3. **Intersect and Paint:** Find the intersection between the generated `line` and the existing cells of the same color in the grid (`asobject(I)`). This intersection represents the final extended object. Paint this object onto the input grid.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  s_obj = argmin(objects(I, T, T, T), size)
  val = color(s_obj)
  start = ulcorner(s_obj)
  direction = (0, 1) if (hline(s_obj) or portrait(s_obj)) else (1, 0)

  return paint(I, recolor(val, intersection(shoot(start, direction), ofcolor(I, val))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Smallest Object:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Determine Extension Direction:**  Similar to Version 1, but directly assigns a direction vector `(0, 1)` for horizontal and `(1, 0)` for vertical.
3. **Shoot and Intersect:**  "Shoot" a line (`shoot`) from the object's starting point (`start`) in the determined direction. Find the intersection between this line and all cells in the grid with the same color (`ofcolor`) as the smallest object.
4. **Recolor and Paint:**  Recolor the intersected indices (`recolor`) to the object's color (`val`) and paint them onto the grid.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  s_obj = argmin(objs, size)
  val = color(s_obj)
  ext_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == val and (hmatching(obj, s_obj) or vmatching(obj, s_obj)))
  
  return paint(I, recolor(val, toindices(ext_obj)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Identify all objects (`objs`) in the grid.
2. **Find Smallest and Extension Objects:** Find the smallest object (`s_obj`) and its color (`val`). Then, extract (`extract`) the object (`ext_obj`) that:
    * Has the same color (`val`) as `s_obj`.
    * Either shares a row (`hmatching`) or a column (`vmatching`) with `s_obj`. This ensures it's the object to be extended.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** Recolor the extracted object's indices (`toindices`) to the target color (`val`) and paint it onto the grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  s_obj = argmin(objs, size)
  val = color(s_obj)

  return paint(I, mfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == val and (hmatching(obj, s_obj) or vmatching(obj, s_obj))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Smallest:**  Same as Version 4.
2. **Filter and Merge Objects:** Filter (`mfilter`) all objects (`objs`) to keep only those that:
    * Have the same color (`val`) as `s_obj`.
    * Either share a row (`hmatching`) or a column (`vmatching`) with `s_obj`.
3. **Paint Merged Object:**  The filtered objects, representing the extended object, are merged by `mfilter`. Paint this merged object onto the grid.
