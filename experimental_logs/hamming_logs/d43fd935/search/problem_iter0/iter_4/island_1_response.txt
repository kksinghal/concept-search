## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects horizontally to connect with the rightmost object of the same color on the same row. 

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

* **Input 0 - Output 0:**
    * The '1' objects in row 0 and row 9 remain unchanged as they are the only ones in their respective rows.
    * The '3' objects in rows 3 and 4 extend rightward to connect with the rightmost '1' object in row 3.
    * The '6' objects in rows 1, 6, 7, 8 extend rightward to connect with the rightmost '6' object in row 7.
* **Input 1 - Output 1:**
    * The '7' objects in rows 0, 2, 5, 8, 9 extend rightward to connect with the rightmost '7' object in row 9.
    * The '8' objects in rows 0, 2, 6, 7 extend rightward to connect with the rightmost '8' object in row 2.
    * The '3' object in row 3 remains unchanged as it is the rightmost '3' object in its row.
* **Input 2 - Output 2:**
    * All '1' objects in rows 1, 2, 4, 5, 9 extend rightward to connect with the rightmost '1' object in row 5.
    * The '3' objects in rows 6 and 7 remain unchanged as they are the rightmost '3' objects in their row.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  new_grid = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    row_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda o: uppermost(o) == uppermost(obj) and color(o) == color(obj))
    rightmost_j = valmax(row_objs, rightmost)
    new_grid = fill(new_grid, color(obj), product(frozenset({uppermost(obj)}), interval(leftmost(obj), rightmost_j + 1, 1)))
  O = new_grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get objects and background:** Identify the background color (`bg`) and extract individual objects (`objs`) from the input grid (`I`).
2. **Initialize canvas:** Create an empty canvas (`new_grid`) with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color.
3. **Iterate through objects:** Loop through each object (`obj`) in the extracted set.
4. **Find rightmost object:** For each object, determine the rightmost column index (`rightmost_j`) among objects of the same color on the same row.
5. **Fill the row segment:** Fill the canvas horizontally from the leftmost column of the current object to the `rightmost_j` with the object's color.
6. **Output the modified grid:** Return the filled canvas (`new_grid`) as the output (`O`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  new_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    same_color_row_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda o: uppermost(o) == uppermost(obj) and color(o) == color(obj))
    max_right = valmax(same_color_row_objs, rightmost)
    extension = frozenset((color(obj), (uppermost(obj), j)) for j in range(leftmost(obj), max_right + 1))
    new_objs = insert(extension | obj, new_objs)
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(new_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects and background:** Similar to version 1, extract objects and determine the background color.
2. **Initialize object set:** Create an empty set (`new_objs`) to store modified objects.
3. **Iterate and extend objects:**  Loop through each object, find the rightmost object of the same color on the same row, and create a new object (`extension`) representing the horizontal extension. 
4. **Merge with original object:** Combine the `extension` with the original `obj` and add it to `new_objs`.
5. **Paint to canvas:** Paint the merged set of modified objects onto a blank canvas and return it as the output. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for obj in sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: uppermost(o) == i):
      same_color_objs = sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda x: color(x) == color(obj) and uppermost(x) == i)
      rightmost_j = valmax(same_color_objs, rightmost)
      O = fill(O, color(obj), product(frozenset({i}), interval(leftmost(obj), rightmost_j + 1, 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize canvas and get background:**  Create a canvas filled with the background color and obtain the background color itself.
2. **Iterate through rows:** Loop through each row index (`i`) of the input grid.
3. **Iterate through objects in row:** For each row, iterate through objects whose uppermost row is the current row (`i`).
4. **Find rightmost object in row:**  Determine the rightmost column index (`rightmost_j`) of objects with the same color on the current row.
5. **Fill on canvas:** Fill the canvas directly with the object's color from its leftmost column to the `rightmost_j`.
6. **Return the modified canvas:** Output the canvas with the filled objects.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), product(frozenset({uppermost(obj)}), interval(leftmost(obj), valmax(sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: uppermost(o) == uppermost(obj) and color(o) == color(obj)), rightmost) + 1, 1))), objects(I, T, F, T))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested function calls for a more compact representation:

1. **Extract objects and get background:** Identify objects and the background color.
2. **Apply transformation to each object:**  Use `apply` to apply a lambda function to each object in the extracted set.
3. **Lambda function:** The lambda function does the following for each object:
    * Finds the rightmost object of the same color on the same row.
    * Creates a new patch representing the horizontal extension using `product` and `interval`.
    * Recolors the patch with the object's color using `recolor`.
4. **Merge and paint:** Merge all modified objects and paint them onto a blank canvas filled with the background color.
5. **Return the modified canvas:** Output the final grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    row_objs = sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: uppermost(o) == i)
    for obj in row_objs:
      same_color_objs = sfilter(row_objs, lambda x: color(x) == color(obj))
      rightmost_obj = argmax(same_color_objs, rightmost)
      if rightmost_obj != obj:
        O = fill(O, color(obj), product(frozenset({i}), interval(leftmost(obj), rightmost(rightmost_obj) + 1, 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize output with input:**  Start by setting the output grid `O` to the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through rows and objects:**  Loop through each row and the objects within each row.
3. **Find the rightmost object of the same color:**  Identify the rightmost object in the row that has the same color as the current object.
4. **Conditional filling:** If the rightmost object is not the current object itself, fill the grid `O` horizontally from the current object's leftmost column to the rightmost object's rightmost column.
5. **Return the modified grid:** Return the grid `O` after processing all rows and objects.

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieving the desired transformation using the DSL. Each utilizes various functions and logic, ensuring diversity in the solutions provided.
