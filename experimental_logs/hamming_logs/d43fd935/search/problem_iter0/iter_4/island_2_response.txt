## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation extends objects horizontally towards the dominant color of the grid (likely the background color). However, the extension only occurs if the object shares a row with another distinct object. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**

- The '1's and '6's extend rightward because they share rows with each other. 
- The '3's extend rightward because they share a row with a '1'.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**

- The '7's and '8's extend rightward because they share rows with each other. 
- The '3's extend rightward because they share a row with an '8'.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**

- The '1's extend rightward because they share rows with each other.
- The '3's do not extend because they don't share a row with any other distinct object.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def extend_to_shared_row(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
  """
  Extends objects horizontally towards the background if they share a row with other objects.
  """
  def should_extend(obj: Object, grid: Grid) -> Boolean:
    """Checks if an object shares a row with another object of a different color."""
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      for j in range(width(grid)):
        cell_color = index(grid, (i, j))
        if cell_color != mostcolor(grid) and cell_color != color(obj):
          return True
    return False

  def extend_right(obj: Object, grid: Grid) -> Object:
    """Extends the object to the right until it encounters a different color."""
    if not should_extend(obj, grid):
      return obj
    max_j = rightmost(obj)
    for j in range(max_j + 1, width(grid)):
      if any(index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcolor(grid) and index(grid, (i, j)) != color(obj) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)):
        break
      obj = obj | recolor(color(obj), {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)})
    return obj

  return paint(grid, merge(apply(lambda obj: extend_right(obj, grid), fgpartition(grid))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_to_shared_row(grid)`:** This function takes the input grid and manages the transformation.
2. **`should_extend(obj, grid)`:** This helper function determines if an object should extend by checking if it shares a row with another object of a different color.
3. **`extend_right(obj, grid)`:** This function extends an object to the right, similar to previous examples, but only if `should_extend` returns True.
4. The program then uses `fgpartition`, `apply`, `merge`, and `paint` to apply the extension logic to each object in the grid.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def fill_shared_rows(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
  """
  Identifies shared rows and fills them with the object's color.
  """
  def shared_row_indices(grid: Grid) -> Indices:
    """Returns a set of indices representing rows shared by different objects."""
    shared_rows = set()
    for i in range(height(grid)):
      row_colors = set(index(grid, (i, j)) for j in range(width(grid)))-{mostcolor(grid)}
      if len(row_colors) > 1:
        shared_rows.add(i)
    return frozenset((i, j) for i in shared_rows for j in range(width(grid)))

  shared_indices = shared_row_indices(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  for i in range(height(grid)):
    for j in range(width(grid)):
      if (i, j) in shared_indices:
        current_color = index(grid, (i, j))
        if current_color != mostcolor(grid):
          new_grid = fill(new_grid, current_color, {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(grid))})
          break
      else:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, index(grid, (i,j)), {(i,j)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_shared_rows(grid)`:** This function takes the input grid and orchestrates the filling process.
2. **`shared_row_indices(grid)`:** This helper function identifies rows shared by multiple objects and returns their indices.
3. A new canvas is created with the background color.
4. The program iterates through the grid. If a cell belongs to a shared row and is not the background color, it fills the row from that cell onwards with its color.
5. If a cell is not in a shared row, it is directly copied to the new grid. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def extend_until_object(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
  """
  Extends objects horizontally until they encounter another object.
  """
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  for i in range(height(grid)):
    current_color = mostcolor(grid)
    for j in range(width(grid)):
      if index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcolor(grid):
        current_color = index(grid, (i, j))
      new_grid = fill(new_grid, current_color, {(i, j)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_until_object(grid)`:** This function takes the input grid and manages the extension logic.
2. A new canvas is initialized with the background color. 
3. It iterates through each row, tracking the current color encountered.
4. If a cell's color is not the background color, it updates the `current_color`.
5. It fills the new grid with the `current_color` at the current index, effectively extending objects until they encounter another object or the grid's edge. 


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def mark_and_extend(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
  """
  Marks the start of objects and extends them to the right.
  """
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  for i in range(height(grid)):
    object_started = False
    for j in range(width(grid)):
      if index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcolor(grid) and not object_started:
        object_started = True
      if object_started:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, index(grid, (i, j)), {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(grid))})
        break
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mark_and_extend(grid)`:** Manages the marking and extending logic.
2. A new canvas is created filled with the background color.
3. The program iterates through each row, using a flag (`object_started`) to track if an object has started in that row.
4. When a non-background color is encountered, the flag is set, and the row is filled from that point onwards with the object's color.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def identify_and_extend(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
  """
  Identifies object boundaries and extends them to the right. 
  """
  def get_object_boundaries(grid: Grid) -> Tuple[Indices, Indices]:
    """
    Returns two sets of indices: 
      1. Start indices of each object.
      2. End indices of each object.
    """
    start_indices = set()
    end_indices = set()
    for i in range(height(grid)):
      for j in range(width(grid)):
        if index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcolor(grid):
          if j == 0 or index(grid, (i, j-1)) == mostcolor(grid):
            start_indices.add((i, j))
          if j == width(grid)-1 or index(grid, (i, j+1)) == mostcolor(grid):
            end_indices.add((i, j))
    return frozenset(start_indices), frozenset(end_indices)

  start_indices, end_indices = get_object_boundaries(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  for i in range(height(grid)):
    for j in range(width(grid)):
      if (i, j) in start_indices:
        end_j = next((ej for ei, ej in end_indices if ei == i), j) # Get the corresponding end index for the same row
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, index(grid, (i, j)), {(i, k) for k in range(j, end_j + 1)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`identify_and_extend(grid)`:** Manages the identification and extension of objects.
2. **`get_object_boundaries(grid)`:**  Identifies the start and end indices of each object within the grid. 
3. The main function then iterates through the grid and, when encountering a start index, extends the object to its corresponding end index. This ensures accurate extension without overwriting other objects on the same row.


These are five distinct programs using different approaches and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the required transformation. Each offers a unique solution while adhering to the DSL's capabilities.
