## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects vertically if their height is greater than their width. The extension fills the background with the object's color until it encounters another object or the grid border.

**Input 0:** The single cell objects with value '1' and the object with value '6' are extended vertically.

**Input 1:**  The objects with value '7' and '8' are extended vertically. Note how the extension stops when encountering another object.

**Input 2:**  The single cell objects with value '1' are extended vertically. 


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_object(obj, grid):
    if height(obj) > width(obj):
      for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
        grid = paint(grid, frozenset(((color(obj), (k, j)) for k in range(uppermost(obj) - 1, -1, -1) if index(grid, (k, j)) == mostcolor(grid))))
        grid = paint(grid, frozenset(((color(obj), (k, j)) for k in range(lowermost(obj) + 1, height(grid)) if index(grid, (k, j)) == mostcolor(grid))))
    return grid
  return last(reduce(lambda grid, obj: extend_object(obj, grid), objects(I, F, F, T), I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_object(obj, grid)`:** This function takes an object and the grid as input. 
   - It checks if the object's height is greater than its width.
   - If true, it iterates through each cell of the object.
   - For each cell, it extends upwards and downwards by painting the background cells with the object's color until it hits another object or the grid boundary.
2. **`objects(I, F, F, T)`:** This extracts all objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
3. **`reduce(lambda grid, obj: extend_object(obj, grid), objects(I, F, F, T), I)`:** This applies the `extend_object` function to each object in the grid, starting with the initial grid `I`.
4. **`last(...)`:**  This returns the final modified grid after processing all objects.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_vertically(grid, obj):
    if height(obj) > width(obj):
      ul = ulcorner(obj)
      grid = paint(grid, frozenset((color(obj), (i, ul[1])) for i in range(uppermost(obj)) if index(grid, (i, ul[1])) == mostcolor(grid)))
      ll = llcorner(obj)
      grid = paint(grid, frozenset((color(obj), (i, ll[1])) for i in range(lowermost(obj) + 1, height(grid)) if index(grid, (i, ll[1])) == mostcolor(grid)))
    return grid
  return last(reduce(lambda grid, obj: extend_vertically(grid, obj), objects(I, F, F, T), I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_vertically(grid, obj)`:** Similar to version 1, this function extends objects vertically if their height is greater than their width.
2.  Instead of iterating through all cells, it directly calculates the upper and lower extension points using `ulcorner` and `llcorner`. 
3.  It then uses `paint` to fill the background cells along the vertical lines from these points.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_object(obj, grid):
    if height(obj) > width(obj):
      grid = fill(grid, color(obj), frozenset((i, j) for i in range(height(grid)) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1) if index(grid, (i,j)) == mostcolor(grid))) 
    return grid
  return last(reduce(lambda grid, obj: process_object(obj, grid), objects(I, F, F, T), I))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`process_object(obj, grid)`:**  This function directly fills the entire vertical column within the object's horizontal boundaries if its height is greater than its width.
2.  It uses `fill` to achieve this, making the code more concise.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_tall_objects(grid, obj):
    if height(obj) > width(obj):
      up = frozenset((i, ulcorner(obj)[1]) for i in range(uppermost(obj)))
      down = frozenset((i, llcorner(obj)[1]) for i in range(lowermost(obj) + 1, height(grid)))
      grid = fill(grid, color(obj), up) 
      grid = fill(grid, color(obj), down)
    return grid
  return last(reduce(lambda g, o: extend_tall_objects(g, o), objects(I, F, F, T), I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_tall_objects(grid, obj)`:**  This version precomputes the indices for the upward and downward extensions using `frozenset` for efficiency. 
2. It then uses separate `fill` calls for upward and downward extensions, potentially offering a performance advantage.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def extend_object(grid, obj):
        if height(obj) > width(obj):
            c = color(obj)
            for x in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1):
                for y in range(uppermost(obj) - 1, -1, -1):
                    if index(grid, (y, x)) == mostcolor(grid):
                        grid = fill(grid, c, {(y, x)})
                    else:
                        break
                for y in range(lowermost(obj) + 1, height(grid)):
                    if index(grid, (y, x)) == mostcolor(grid):
                        grid = fill(grid, c, {(y, x)})
                    else:
                        break
        return grid
    return last(reduce(lambda grid, obj: extend_object(grid, obj), objects(I, F, F, T), I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_object(grid, obj)`:** This version iterates through each column within the object's horizontal boundaries.
2.  For each column, it extends upward and downward, filling background cells with the object's color until it encounters a non-background cell.
3. This approach may offer efficiency in scenarios where objects are sparsely distributed horizontally.

**Note:** Remember to add the `reduce` function from functools to your DSL (`from functools import reduce`) as it is not included in the provided `dsl.py`.
