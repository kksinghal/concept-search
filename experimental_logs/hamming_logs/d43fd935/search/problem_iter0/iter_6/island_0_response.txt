## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation exhibited in the input-output pairs can be described as **color propagation along the vertical axis**.  Here's a breakdown for each pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** The '1' and '6' digits remain unchanged. However, the '3' digit objects extend downwards, filling the spaces below them with the value '3' until they reach another non-zero digit or the grid boundary.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**  Similar to the previous example, the '7' and '8' digits stay in place. The '3' digit object extends downwards. Interestingly, '7' digit objects also extend downwards, overlapping with the pre-existing '8' digits in the process.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:** This example further emphasizes the vertical propagation. Both '1' and '3' digit objects extend downwards, showcasing that the transformation isn't limited to a specific digit value. 

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program `Program_to_be_generated` to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I 
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I)):
            if i > 0 and I[i][j] == 0 and I[i-1][j] != 0:
                O = fill(O, I[i-1][j], {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** The output grid `O` is initialized as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iteration:** The code iterates over each cell in the grid, row by row.
3. **Vertical Propagation:** For each cell, it checks if the cell is not in the first row (`i > 0`), is empty (`I[i][j] == 0`), and the cell above it is not empty (`I[i-1][j] != 0`). If these conditions are met, it fills the current cell in the output grid with the value of the cell above it. 

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
        if len(obj) > 1:
            for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
                for k in range(i + 1, height(I)):
                    if I[k][j] == 0:
                        O = fill(O, v, {(k, j)})
                    else:
                        break
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** The output grid `O` starts as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Object Iteration:**  The program identifies objects in the input grid using `objects(I, True, False, False)`. 
3. **Vertical Extension:** For each cell within an object, it iterates downwards. If an empty cell (`I[k][j] == 0`) is encountered, it's filled with the object's color (`v`). The extension stops when a non-empty cell is encountered.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for j in range(width(I)):
        current_color = None
        for i in range(height(I)):
            if I[i][j] != 0:
                current_color = I[i][j]
            if current_color is not None:
                O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Output grid `O` is set as a copy of input grid `I`.
2. **Column-wise Iteration:** The code iterates over each column of the grid.
3. **Color Tracking:** It maintains a `current_color` variable, initially set to `None`. 
4. **Color Propagation:** It scans down the column. When it encounters a non-zero value, it updates `current_color`. From that point onwards, it fills subsequent cells in the output grid's column with `current_color`.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
        bottom = lowermost(obj)
        for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
            O = fill(O, v, {(k, j) for k in range(i, bottom + 1)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** The output grid `O` is initialized as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Object Identification:**  It identifies objects in the grid using `objects(I, True, False, True)`.
3. **Bottom Edge Detection:**  For each object, it determines the lowermost row index (`bottom`) using `lowermost(obj)`.
4. **Vertical Filling:** It then fills all the cells from each object cell's row index (`i`) down to the `bottom` row index with the object's color (`v`). 

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    k = 0
    while k < height(I):
      if I[k][j] != 0:
        v = I[k][j]
        l = k + 1
        while l < height(I) and I[l][j] == 0:
          O = fill(O, v, {(l, j)})
          l += 1
        k = l
      else:
        k += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  The output `O` is initialized as a copy of the input `I`.
2. **Column-wise Scanning:** It iterates over each column (`j`) of the grid.
3. **Finding a Non-Zero Value:**  For each column, it finds the first non-zero value (`v`) at row index `k`.
4. **Downward Propagation:** From the next row (`l = k + 1`), it starts filling empty cells (`I[l][j] == 0`) with `v` until it encounters a non-zero value or the bottom of the grid.
5. **Continuing the Search:** The search for the next non-zero value continues from the row where the previous propagation stopped.
