## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) and extending them horizontally towards the right, until they encounter another object or the edge of the grid. 

**Example Breakdown:**

**Input_0:** The '1' on the 4th row extends right to occupy the empty spaces until the last column. Similarly, the '6's extend rightward until they hit the existing '6' or the edge.

**Input_1:** The '7' on the 3rd row extends right to reach the '3' object. The '8's also extend rightward until they encounter an existing '8' or the edge.

**Input_2:**  The '1's extend rightward until they encounter another '1', '3', or the edge.  The '3' object remains unchanged as there's no space to its right.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct code versions for "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
      if any((i,j) in toindices(obj) for j in range(width(I))):
        for j, v in enumerate(row):
          if (i,j) in toindices(obj):
            O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))})
            break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Identifies the background color (`bg`) and extracts objects (`objs`) from the input grid (`I`). Creates an empty output grid (`O`).
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates over each object.
3. **Row Check:** For each row (`i`), checks if the object occupies any cell in that row.
4. **Horizontal Extension:** If the object exists in the row, it iterates through each cell (`j`) in the row. If the cell belongs to the object, it fills the output grid from that cell rightwards (`k`) until the edge of the grid.
5. **Output:** Returns the transformed grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        for i, j in toindices(obj):
            O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Identifies the background color (`bg`) and extracts objects (`objs`) from the input grid (`I`). Sets the output grid (`O`) initially as the input grid.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates over each object.
3. **Cell Iteration and Extension:** For each cell (`i`, `j`) within the object, it fills the output grid (`O`) with the object's color, starting from the cell's column (`j`) and extending to the right edge of the grid. 
4. **Output:** Returns the transformed grid `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    h, w = shape(I)
    O = canvas(bg, (h, w))
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        current_color = bg
        for j, v in enumerate(row):
            if v != bg:
                current_color = v
            O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Identifies the background color (`bg`) and gets the height (`h`) and width (`w`) of the input grid (`I`). Creates an output grid (`O`) filled with the background color.
2. **Row Iteration:** Iterates over each row (`i`) in the input grid.
3. **Cell Iteration and Color Tracking:** For each cell (`j`) in the row, it tracks the current color (`current_color`). If a cell is not the background, it updates `current_color` to the cell's value.
4. **Filling:** Fills the corresponding cell in the output grid (`O`) with the `current_color`, effectively extending the color from left to right.
5. **Output:** Returns the transformed grid `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    h, w = shape(I)
    O = list(list(row) for row in I)
    for i in range(h):
        fill_color = bg
        for j in range(w):
            if O[i][j] != bg and fill_color == bg:
                fill_color = O[i][j] 
            O[i][j] = fill_color
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Identifies the background color (`bg`) and gets the height (`h`) and width (`w`) of the input grid (`I`). Creates a mutable copy of the input grid (`O`).
2. **Row Iteration:** Iterates over each row (`i`) in the grid.
3. **Cell Iteration and Filling:** For each cell (`j`) in the row, if the cell's value is not the background color and `fill_color` is still the background, it updates `fill_color` to the cell's value. This remembers the color of the object encountered in that row. It then fills the cell in the output grid (`O`) with the `fill_color`. 
4. **Output:** Returns the transformed grid `O` converted back to a tuple of tuples. 


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h, w = shape(I)
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
                O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, k) for k in range(j, w)})
                break 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Gets the height (`h`) and width (`w`) of the input grid (`I`). Creates an output grid (`O`) filled with the background color.
2. **Row Iteration:** Iterates over each row (`i`) in the input grid.
3. **Cell Iteration and Object Detection:** For each cell (`j`) in the row, if the cell is not the background color, it means an object starts at that cell.
4. **Horizontal Fill and Break:** The output grid (`O`) is filled horizontally from the current cell (`j`) to the right edge (`w`) with the object's color. Then, it `break`s out of the inner loop (`j`) to avoid unnecessary iterations as the object has been handled.
5. **Output:** Returns the transformed grid `O`.

These five versions utilize different combinations of DSL functions and logic, achieving the desired transformation in distinct ways. They highlight the flexibility of the DSL and offer varied solutions to the problem.
