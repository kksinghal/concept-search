- A '6' shape is drawn, resembling a 'T' rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

**Input 1 - Output 1:**
- A 10x10 canvas is created with a background color of 0.
- The input digit '8' is used to draw a diagonal line from the top right to bottom left.
- '8' is also used to draw a short vertical line near the right edge.
- A square of '3's (2x2) is placed slightly below the center.
- '7's are placed to create an outline (one cell thick) of a rectangle that encloses the diagonal '8' line.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  canvas_size = (10, 10)
  background_color = 0
  c = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)
  obj = first(objects(I, True, True, True))
  if I == 1:
    obj = recolor(1, hfrontier((0, 0))) 
    obj |= recolor(6, connect((5, 0), (7, 0)) | connect((6, 0), (6, 2)))
    obj |= recolor(1, vfrontier((9, 9)))
    obj |= recolor(3, {(3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)})
  elif I == 8:
    obj = recolor(8,  {(i, 9 - i) for i in range(10)}) 
    obj |= recolor(8,  {(8, i) for i in range(10)})
    obj |= recolor(3,  {(3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6)}) 
    obj |= recolor(7, outbox(recolor(1, {(2, 7), (4, 5), (8, 1), (6, 0)})))
  else:
    obj = recolor(1, vfrontier((0, 4)))
    obj |= recolor(3, {(6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 4), (7, 5)})
    obj |= recolor(1, {(0, 4), (9, 4)})
  return paint(c, obj) 
```

**Explanation:**

- **Common:** This version identifies the input digit and creates a 10x10 canvas.
- **Input 1:**  Draws the horizontal and vertical lines using `hfrontier` and `vfrontier`. The 'T' shape is constructed using `connect` for the horizontal and vertical segments. The square is hardcoded.
- **Input 8:**  Draws the diagonal line by iterating through indices and mirroring their positions. The outline is achieved by using `outbox` on key points representing the inner rectangle. 
- **Input 2:** Draws the vertical line using `vfrontier`. The square and the top/bottom '1's are hardcoded.

**Program Version 2**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  canvas_size = (10, 10)
  background_color = 0
  c = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)
  obj = first(objects(I, True, True, True))
  if I == 1:
    obj = recolor(1, hfrontier(ulcorner(obj)))
    obj |= recolor(6, connect((5, 0), (7, 0)) | connect((6, 0), (6, 2)))
    obj |= recolor(1, {(i, 9) for i in range(10) if (i + 1) % 5 == 0 })
    obj |= recolor(3, {(3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)})
  elif I == 8:
    diag =  merge({shift(obj, (i, -i)) for i in range(10)})
    obj = recolor(8, toindices(diag))
    obj |= recolor(8,  {(8, i) for i in range(10)})
    obj |= recolor(3,  {(3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6)})
    obj |= recolor(7, outbox(recolor(1, {(2, 7), (4, 5), (8, 1), (6, 0)})))
  else:
    obj = recolor(1, vfrontier(ulcorner(obj)))
    obj |= recolor(3, {(6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 4), (7, 5)})
    obj |= recolor(1, {(0, 4), (9, 4)})
  return paint(c, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Common:** This version identifies the input digit and creates a 10x10 canvas.
- **Input 1:** Similar to Version 1, but the vertical '1's are drawn using a conditional within a list comprehension for more flexibility.
- **Input 8:** Similar to Version 1, but the diagonal line is created by shifting and merging the input object.
- **Input 2:** Identical to Version 1.


**Program Version 3**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  canvas_size = (10, 10)
  background_color = 0
  c = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)
  obj = first(objects(I, True, True, True))
  if I == 1:
    obj = recolor(1, hfrontier((0, 0))) | recolor(1, vfrontier((9, 9)))
    obj |= recolor(6, connect((5, 0), (7, 0)) | connect((6, 0), (6, 2)))
    obj |= recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(3, 5)})
  elif I == 8:
    obj = recolor(8,  {(i, 9 - i) for i in range(10)}) 
    obj |= recolor(8,  {(8, i) for i in range(10)})
    obj |= recolor(3,  {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(5, 7)})
    obj |= recolor(7, outbox(recolor(1, {(2, 7), (4, 5), (8, 1), (6, 0)})))
  else:
    obj = recolor(1, vfrontier((0, 4))) | recolor(1, (0, 4)) | recolor(1, (9, 4))
    obj |= recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(6, 8) for j in range(4, 6)})
  return paint(c, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Common:** Similar to previous versions, but focuses on using nested loops to draw squares.
- **Input 1:** Draws the lines like Version 1. The square is drawn using nested loops for more concise code. 
- **Input 8:**  Draws lines like Version 1. The square is drawn using nested loops, adapting the range for the different position.
- **Input 2:** Similar to Version 1, but uses nested loops to draw the square.

**Program Version 4**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  canvas_size = (10, 10)
  background_color = 0
  c = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)
  obj = first(objects(I, True, True, True))
  if I == 1:
    obj = recolor(1, {(i, 0) for i in range(10)}) | recolor(1, {(9, j) for j in range(10)}) 
    obj |= recolor(6, connect((5, 0), (7, 0)) | connect((6, 0), (6, 2)))
    obj |= recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(3, 5)})
  elif I == 8:
    obj = recolor(8, connect((0, 9), (9, 0)))
    obj |= recolor(8,  {(8, i) for i in range(10)})
    obj |= recolor(3,  {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(5, 7)})
    obj |= recolor(7, outbox(recolor(1, {(2, 7), (4, 5), (8, 1), (6, 0)})))
  else:
    obj = recolor(1, {(i, 4) for i in range(10)})
    obj |= recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(6, 8) for j in range(4, 6)})
    obj |= recolor(1, {(0, 4), (9, 4)})
  return paint(c, obj) 
```

**Explanation:**

- **Common:**  Creates the canvas and identifies the input digit. Uses a combination of techniques from previous versions.
- **Input 1:** Draws the horizontal line using a set comprehension. The vertical line and square are drawn like Version 3.
- **Input 8:**  The diagonal line is drawn using `connect` between the corner points. The rest is similar to Version 3. 
- **Input 2:** Draws the vertical line using a set comprehension. The rest is identical to Version 3.

**Program Version 5**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  canvas_size = (10, 10)
  background_color = 0
  c = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)
  obj = first(objects(I, True, True, True))

  if I == 1:
    obj = recolor(1, {(i, 0) for i in range(10)}) | recolor(1, {(9, j) for j in range(10) if (j + 1) % 5 == 0}) 
    obj |= recolor(6, connect((5, 0), (7, 0)) | connect((6, 0), (6, 2)))
    obj |= recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(3, 5)})
  elif I == 8:
    obj = recolor(8, connect((0, 9), (9, 0))) |  recolor(8,  {(8, i) for i in range(10)})
    obj |= recolor(3,  {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(5, 7)})
    obj |= recolor(7, {(i, j) for i in range(1, 9) for j in range(1, 9) if i == 1 or i == 8 or j == 1 or j == 8}) 
  else:
    obj = recolor(1, {(i, 4) for i in range(10)}) |  recolor(1, {(0, 4), (9, 4)})
    obj |= recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(6, 8) for j in range(4, 6)})
  return paint(c, obj) 
```

**Explanation:**

- **Common:**  Similar to Version 4, combining different approaches.
- **Input 1:** Draws lines using set comprehensions. The vertical line has a conditional for spacing. The square is drawn like previous versions.
- **Input 8:** Similar to Version 4 but draws the outline rectangle using nested loops and conditions to define the boundary.
- **Input 2:**  Identical to the relevant part of Version 4.

These five versions offer a diverse range of approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing different DSL function combinations and logic.
