## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Diagonal Line:**  A diagonal line of '1's is drawn from the top-left corner towards the bottom-right, ending at the bottom-left corner.
2. **Horizontal Line:** A horizontal line of '6's is drawn starting a few cells to the right of the diagonal line, extending to the right edge of the grid. 
3. **Small Square:** A 2x2 square of '3's is placed slightly below the beginning of the diagonal line.
4. **Scattered '6's:** Individual '6' cells are placed below the small square and to the left of the horizontal line, forming a loose diagonal.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. **Diagonal '8's:** Two diagonal lines of '8's are drawn, one from the top-right towards the bottom-left and the other starting a few cells below from the left edge.
2. **'7' Formations:**  Two groups of '7's are placed, one forming an approximate upside-down 'V' shape and the other forming a horizontal line with an upward tail at the end.
3. **Central '3's:**  A rectangular block of '3's is placed where the diagonal lines of '8's intersect.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

1. **Vertical Line:** A vertical line of '1's is drawn from the top center towards the bottom center, extending to the bottom-left corner.
2. **Small Square:** A 2x2 square of '3's is placed below the middle of the vertical line.
3. **Scattered '1's:** Three '1's are placed individually - one near the top edge slightly to the right, one to the right of the bottom of the vertical line, and one at the bottom-left corner.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  
  if v == 1:
    O = paint(O, connect((0, 0), (9, 9)))
    O = paint(O, {(1, (i, i)) for i in range(min(len(O), len(O[0])))})
    O = paint(O, {(6, (i, 8)) for i in range(2, 10)})
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(2, 4)})
    O = paint(O, {(6, (6, 4)), (6, (7, 5)), (6, (8, 6))})
  elif v == 8:
    O = paint(O, connect((0, 6), (9, 3)))
    O = paint(O, {(8, (i, 7 - i)) for i in range(7)})
    O = paint(O, {(8, (i, i - 3)) for i in range(3, 10)})
    O = paint(O, {(7, (0, 1)), (7, (1, 0)), (7, (2, 2)), (7, (3, 3)), (7, (4, 2)), (7, (5, 2)), (7, (9, 9))})
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 4) for j in range(4, 7)})
  elif v == 2:
    O = paint(O, connect((0, 5), (9, 5)))
    O = paint(O, {(1, (i, 5)) for i in range(10)})
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(6, 8) for j in range(4, 6)})
    O = paint(O, {(1, (1, 6)), (1, (9, 6)), (1, (9, 0))}) 
    
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Input 1:** 
    - Draws a diagonal line using `connect` and fills it with '1's.
    - Draws a horizontal line of '6's.
    - Creates the 2x2 '3' square using `fill`.
    - Adds the individual '6's using separate `paint` calls. 
* **Input 8:**
    - Draws two diagonal lines of '8's using `connect` and filling specific coordinates.
    - Creates the '7' formations using `paint`.
    - Fills the central area with '3's using `fill`.
* **Input 2:**
    - Draws a vertical line of '1's.
    - Places the 2x2 square of '3's.
    - Adds the individual '1's at their specific locations.

This version aims to use a combination of `connect` and `fill` for more efficient line and shape drawing while minimizing individual cell painting.

**Note:** Due to the requirement to use functions *only* from the provided DSL and the programs not being provided in this prompt, I have created a program to the best of my ability.  Please provide the existing programs if you'd like me to improve upon them.
