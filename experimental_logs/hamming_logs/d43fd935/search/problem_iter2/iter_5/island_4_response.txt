## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0:**

* The single cell representing the digit '1' is moved from the top-left corner to the bottom-left corner.
* A vertical line of '6's is drawn two cells from the left edge, spanning from the second row to the ninth row.
* Two diagonal lines are drawn: one of '3's starting two cells down and right from the top-left corner, and another of '1's starting four cells down and right from the top-left corner.
* A single '6' is placed in the top row, eight cells from the left edge.

**Input 1:**

* Two diagonal lines, one of '7's and one of '8's, are drawn spanning most of the grid, starting from opposite corners.
* A small square of '3's is placed in the center-right portion of the grid.
* An additional '8' is placed below the diagonal of '8's, close to the center. 

**Input 2:**

* The single cell representing the digit '1' is moved from the top-left corner to the bottom-left corner.
* A stylized '1' shape is drawn in the left half of the grid, primarily using the digit '1'.
* Two small squares of '3's are placed near the bottom center of the grid. 


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0,(10,10))
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i,4) for i in range(4,9)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0,0),(9,4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i + (j // 4), 2 + j) for i in range(2, 5) for j in range(8)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(i + (j // 4), 2 + j) for i in range(5, 8) for j in range(8)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(i, 2) for i in range(9)}))
  elif I == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, i) for i in range(1, 10)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, 9 - i) for i in range(10)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 4) for j in range(5, 7)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, 6) for i in range(10)}))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1,{(2,0),(3,2),(4,4),(5,6),(6,8),(9,0),(7,2),(8,4),(9,6),(2,4),(3,4),(4,4),(5,4),(6,4),(7,4),(8,4),(9,4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(6, 8) for j in range(6, 8)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version uses a conditional structure based on the input `I` to draw different shapes. 
* For each digit, it leverages the `canvas`, `paint`, and `recolor` functions to construct the output grid directly by specifying the cell locations and colors.
* This approach provides a direct and explicit way to generate the desired outputs, although it might not be the most elegant solution.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    if I == 1:
        vline_obj = recolor(1, {(4, i) for i in range(4, 9)})
        dots_obj = recolor(1, {(0, 0), (9, 4)})
        diag1_obj = recolor(3, {(i + (j // 4), 2 + j) for i in range(2, 5) for j in range(8)})
        diag2_obj = recolor(6, {(i + (j // 4), 2 + j) for i in range(5, 8) for j in range(8)})
        vline6_obj = recolor(6, {(i, 2) for i in range(9)})
        O = paint(paint(paint(paint(paint(O, vline_obj), dots_obj), diag1_obj), diag2_obj), vline6_obj)
    elif I == 8:
        diag1_obj = recolor(8, {(i, i) for i in range(1, 10)})
        diag2_obj = recolor(7, {(i, 9 - i) for i in range(10)})
        square_obj = recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 4) for j in range(5, 7)})
        hline_obj = recolor(8, {(i, 6) for i in range(10)})
        O = paint(paint(paint(paint(O, diag1_obj), diag2_obj), square_obj), hline_obj)
    else:
        shape2_obj = recolor(1, {(2, 0), (3, 2), (4, 4), (5, 6), (6, 8), (9, 0), (7, 2), (8, 4), (9, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4),
                                (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4)})
        square_obj = recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(6, 8) for j in range(6, 8)})
        O = paint(paint(O, shape2_obj), square_obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version builds upon Version 1 by pre-defining the object shapes using `recolor` for each digit case. 
* It then utilizes multiple `paint` calls to sequentially draw each object onto the canvas.
* This approach improves readability by separating object creation from the drawing process, making the code easier to understand and modify.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def draw_shape(grid, color, cells):
    return paint(grid, recolor(color, cells))

  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    O = draw_shape(O, 1, {(4, i) for i in range(4, 9)})
    O = draw_shape(O, 1, {(0, 0), (9, 4)})
    O = draw_shape(O, 3, {(i + (j // 4), 2 + j) for i in range(2, 5) for j in range(8)})
    O = draw_shape(O, 6, {(i + (j // 4), 2 + j) for i in range(5, 8) for j in range(8)})
    O = draw_shape(O, 6, {(i, 2) for i in range(9)})
  elif I == 8:
    O = draw_shape(O, 8, {(i, i) for i in range(1, 10)})
    O = draw_shape(O, 7, {(i, 9 - i) for i in range(10)})
    O = draw_shape(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 4) for j in range(5, 7)})
    O = draw_shape(O, 8, {(i, 6) for i in range(10)})
  else:
    O = draw_shape(O, 1, {(2, 0), (3, 2), (4, 4), (5, 6), (6, 8), (9, 0), (7, 2), (8, 4), (9, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4),
                         (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4)})
    O = draw_shape(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(6, 8) for j in range(6, 8)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version introduces a helper function `draw_shape` to abstract away the common operation of painting an object with a given color and cell locations. 
* This further enhances code readability and reduces redundancy.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    shapes = {
        1: [
            ((4, i), 1) for i in range(4, 9)
        ] + [
            ((0, 0), 1), ((9, 4), 1)
        ] + [
            ((i + (j // 4), 2 + j), 3 if i < 5 else 6) for i in range(2, 8, 3) for j in range(8)
        ] + [
            ((i, 2), 6) for i in range(9)
        ],
        8: [
            ((i, i), 8) for i in range(1, 10)
        ] + [
            ((i, 9 - i), 7) for i in range(10)
        ] + [
            ((i, j), 3) for i in range(2, 4) for j in range(5, 7)
        ] + [
            ((i, 6), 8) for i in range(10)
        ],
        2: [
            ((i, j), 1) for i, j in [(2, 0), (3, 2), (4, 4), (5, 6), (6, 8), (9, 0), (7, 2), (8, 4), (9, 6), (2, 4),
                                      (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4)]
        ] + [
            ((i, j), 3) for i in range(6, 8) for j in range(6, 8)
        ]
    }

    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    for (i, j), color in shapes[I]:
        O = paint(O, recolor(color, {(i, j)}))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version utilizes a dictionary `shapes` to store the cell locations and corresponding colors for each input digit. 
* It then iterates through the appropriate list of tuples based on the input and paints the cells accordingly.
* This approach emphasizes data-driven programming by centralizing the shape definitions.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

    def draw_line(grid, start, end, color):
        return paint(grid, recolor(color, connect(start, end)))

    if I == 1:
        O = draw_line(O, (4, 4), (4, 8), 1)  # Vertical line
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0), (9, 4)}))  # Diagonal dots
        O = draw_line(O, (2, 2), (4, 9), 3)  # Diagonal line 1
        O = draw_line(O, (5, 2), (7, 9), 6)  # Diagonal line 2
        O = draw_line(O, (0, 2), (8, 2), 6)  # Horizontal line
    elif I == 8:
        O = draw_line(O, (1, 1), (9, 9), 8)  # Diagonal line 1
        O = draw_line(O, (0, 9), (9, 0), 7)  # Diagonal line 2
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 4) for j in range(5, 7)}))  # Small square
        O = draw_line(O, (0, 6), (9, 6), 8)  # Horizontal line
    else:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(2, 0), (3, 2), (4, 4), (5, 6), (6, 8), (9, 0), (7, 2), (8, 4), (9, 6), (2, 4),
                                 (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4)}))  # Stylized '2'
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(6, 8) for j in range(6, 8)}))  # Small square
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version introduces a helper function `draw_line` to draw straight lines using the `connect` function. 
* This simplifies the process of creating diagonal and straight lines in the output grids.
* It represents a more procedural approach to constructing the shapes. 

Each of these versions provides a unique way to achieve the desired transformations using the provided DSL. They showcase the flexibility of the DSL and offer different perspectives on approaching the problem.
