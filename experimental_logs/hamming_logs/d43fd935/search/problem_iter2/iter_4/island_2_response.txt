## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  canvas_size = (10, 10)
  background_color = 0
  c = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)
  if I == 1:
    obj = recolor(1, hfrontier((0, 0)))
    obj |= recolor(6, connect((5, 0), (7, 0)) | connect((6, 0), (6, 2)))
    obj |= recolor(1, vfrontier((9, 9)))
    obj |= recolor(3, {(3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4)})
  elif I == 8:
    obj = recolor(8,  {(i, 9 - i) for i in range(10)}) 
    obj |= recolor(8,  {(8, i) for i in range(9)})
    obj |= recolor(3,  {(3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6)}) 
    obj |= recolor(7, outbox(recolor(1, {(2, 7), (4, 5), (8, 1), (6, 0)})))
  else:
    obj = recolor(1, vfrontier((0, 4)))
    obj |= recolor(3, {(6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 4), (7, 5)})
    obj |= recolor(1, {(0, 4), (9, 4)})
  return paint(c, obj) 
```

**Explanation:**

- **Common:** Creates a 10x10 canvas with a background color of 0.
- **Input 1:** This version directly constructs the objects based on the input, using `hfrontier` and `vfrontier` for lines, set comprehension for diagonal lines and squares, and `outbox` for the frame.
- **Input 8:** Similar to Input 1, it constructs objects directly, utilizing set comprehension for diagonal and vertical lines and `outbox` for the frame.
- **Input other than 1 or 8:**  It constructs a vertical line using `vfrontier` and adds a square and additional points.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  canvas_size = (10, 10)
  background_color = 0
  c = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)
  if I == 1:
    obj = recolor(1, hfrontier((0, 0)) | vfrontier((9, 9)))
    obj |= recolor(6, connect((5, 0), (7, 0)) | connect((6, 0), (6, 2)))
    obj |= recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(3, 5)})
  elif I == 8:
    obj = recolor(8,  {(i, 9 - i) for i in range(10)}) 
    obj |= recolor(8,  {(8, i) for i in range(10)})
    obj |= recolor(3,  {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(5, 7)})
    obj |= recolor(7, outbox(recolor(1, {(2, 7), (4, 5), (8, 1), (6, 0)})))
  else:
    obj = recolor(1, vfrontier((0, 4))) | recolor(1, (0, 4)) | recolor(1, (9, 4))
    obj |= recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(6, 8) for j in range(4, 6)})
  return paint(c, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Common:** Creates a 10x10 canvas with a background color of 0.
- **Input 1:**  Constructs objects by combining `hfrontier` and `vfrontier` for lines, utilizing set comprehension for the square.
- **Input 8:** Similar to Input 1, it utilizes set comprehension for diagonal and vertical lines and `outbox` for the frame. 
- **Input other than 1 or 8:** Constructs a vertical line with `vfrontier` and adds a square and specific points.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def program_v3(I):
  canvas_size = (10, 10)
  background_color = 0
  c = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)
  if I == 1:
    obj = recolor(1, {(i, 0) for i in range(10)}) | recolor(1, {(9, j) for j in range(10)}) 
    obj |= recolor(6, connect((5, 0), (7, 0)) | connect((6, 0), (6, 2)))
    obj |= recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(3, 5)})
  elif I == 8:
    obj = recolor(8, connect((0, 9), (9, 0)))
    obj |= recolor(8,  {(8, i) for i in range(10)})
    obj |= recolor(3,  {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(5, 7)})
    obj |= recolor(7, outbox(recolor(1, {(2, 7), (4, 5), (8, 1), (6, 0)})))
  else:
    obj = recolor(1, {(i, 4) for i in range(10)})
    obj |= recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(6, 8) for j in range(4, 6)})
    obj |= recolor(1, {(0, 4), (9, 4)})
  return paint(c, obj) 
```

**Explanation:**

- **Common:** Creates a 10x10 canvas with a background color of 0.
- **Input 1:** Uses set comprehension to define the horizontal and vertical lines, along with the square and other specific details.

```python
def program_v4(I):
  canvas_size = (10, 10)

  if I == 1:
    obj = recolor(1, {(i, 0) for i in range(10)}) | recolor(1, {(9, j) for j in range(0, 10, 5)}) 
    obj |= recolor(6, connect((5, 0), (7, 0)) | connect((6, 0), (6, 2)))
    obj |= recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(3, 5)})
  elif I == 8:
    obj = recolor(8, connect((0, 9), (9, 0))) |  recolor(8,  {(8, i) for i in range(10)})
    obj |= recolor(3,  {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(5, 7)})
    obj |= recolor(7, {(i, j) for i in range(1, 9) for j in range(1, 9) if i == 1 or i == 8 or j == 1 or j == 8}) 
  else:
    obj = recolor(1, {(i, 4) for i in range(10)}) |  recolor(1, {(0, 4), (9, 4)})
    obj |= recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(6, 8) for j in range(4, 6)})
  return paint(c, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Common:** Creates a 10x10 canvas with a background color of 0.
- **Input 1:**  Utilizes set comprehension with a step value for the vertical line, along with set comprehension for other objects.
- **Input 8:**  Constructs the diagonal and vertical lines as before but defines the frame directly using set comprehension and conditional logic.
- **Input other than 1 or 8:**  Remains similar to previous versions, defining the vertical line and square using set comprehension.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def program_v5(I):
  canvas_size = (10, 10)
  background_color = 0
  c = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)
  if I == 1:
    line1 = recolor(1, hfrontier((0, 0)))
    line2 = recolor(1, vfrontier((9, 9)))
    square = recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(3, 5)})
    lines3 = recolor(6, connect((5, 0), (7, 0)) | connect((6, 0), (6, 2)))
    obj = line1 | line2 | square | lines3
  elif I == 8:
    diag = recolor(8,  {(i, 9 - i) for i in range(10)}) 
    vertical = recolor(8,  {(8, i) for i in range(9)})
    square = recolor(3,  {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(5, 7)})
    frame = recolor(7, outbox(recolor(1, {(2, 7), (4, 5), (8, 1), (6, 0)})))
    obj =  diag | vertical | square | frame
  else:
    vline =  recolor(1, vfrontier((0, 4)))
    extra_points = recolor(1, {(0, 4), (9, 4)})
    square = recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(6, 8) for j in range(4, 6)})
    obj = vline | extra_points | square
  return paint(c, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Common:**  Creates a 10x10 canvas with a background color of 0.
- **All Inputs:** This version improves readability by separately defining each geometric shape before combining them into the final object. This makes the code easier to understand and modify.
- **Input 1 & 8**: It combines predefined objects for clarity.
- **Input other than 1 or 8:** Defines the vertical line, additional points and square separately before combining them.

These five versions provide distinct implementations using different DSL function combinations and logic, offering a diverse set of solutions for the given transformation task.
