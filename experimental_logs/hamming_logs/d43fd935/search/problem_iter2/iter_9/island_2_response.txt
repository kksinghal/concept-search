## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:**
- The single '1' cell acts as a seed, spawning a horizontal line of '1's to the right.
- A diagonal line of '6's descends to the right, starting two cells below the seed '1'.
- A 2x2 square of '3's appears two cells below and one cell to the right of the seed '1'.

**Input 1 -> Output 1:**
- The single '8' cell spawns diagonal lines of '8's in all four directions.
- A horizontal line of '7's extends to the left from the center of the bottom '8' diagonal.
- A 2x2 square of '3's is placed two cells above the center of the right '8' diagonal. 

**Input 2 -> Output 2:**
- The single '1' cell generates a vertical line of '1's extending both upwards and downwards.
- Two additional '1' cells appear: one diagonally down-right, and one at the bottom left corner.
- A 2x2 square of '3's is placed centrally, two cells below the input '1'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformations:

**Version 1 (Inspired by Program A's grid framework and Program B's diagonal line generation):**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  c = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    obj = recolor(1, hfrontier((0, 0)))  # Horizontal line of '1's
    obj |= recolor(6, {(i + 2, i) for i in range(8)})  # Diagonal line of '6's
    obj |= recolor(3,  {(i + 2, j + 1) for i in range(2) for j in range(2)})  # 2x2 square of '3's
  elif I == 8:
    obj = recolor(8, {(i, 9 - i) for i in range(10)} | {(i, i) for i in range(10)}) # Diagonal lines of '8's
    obj |= recolor(7, hfrontier((9, 0)))  # Horizontal line of '7's
    obj |= recolor(3, {(i + 2, j + 6) for i in range(2) for j in range(2)})  # 2x2 square of '3's
  else:
    obj = recolor(1, vfrontier((0, 4)) | vfrontier((0, 5)))  # Vertical lines of '1's
    obj |= recolor(1, {(9, 0), (5, 9)})  # Additional '1' cells
    obj |= recolor(3, {(i + 6, j + 4) for i in range(2) for j in range(2)})  # 2x2 square of '3's
  return paint(c, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

- Uses `canvas` to create a base grid.
- Leverages `hfrontier` and  `vfrontier` for generating horizontal and vertical lines respectively.
- Directly defines diagonal lines using set comprehension.
- Employs `recolor` to assign colors to generated shapes.

**Version 2 (Focusing on object manipulation and shifting):**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  c = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    obj = recolor(1, hfrontier((0, 0))) 
    obj |= recolor(6, shift(connect((0, 0), (7, 7)), (2, 2))) # Diagonal line using shift
    obj |= recolor(3, shift(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (2, 1))) # 2x2 square using shifted canvas
  elif I == 8:
    diag = recolor(8, {(i, i) for i in range(10)})
    obj = diag | hmirror(diag)  # Diagonal lines using mirroring
    obj |= recolor(7, shift(hfrontier((0, 0)), (9, 0)))  
    obj |= recolor(3, shift(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (2, 6)))
  else:
    obj = recolor(1, vfrontier((0, 4)) | vfrontier((0, 5)))
    obj |= recolor(1, {(9, 0), (5, 9)}) 
    obj |= recolor(3, shift(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (6, 4)))
  return paint(c, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

- Uses `shift` to position shapes instead of directly defining coordinates.
- Introduces `hmirror` to generate a mirrored diagonal line.
- Employs `canvas` to create a reusable 2x2 square.

**Version 3 (Leveraging `connect` function for line generation):**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  c = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    obj = recolor(1, connect((0, 0), (9, 0)))  # Horizontal line
    obj |= recolor(6, connect((2, 2), (9, 9)))  # Diagonal line
    obj |= recolor(3, shift(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (2, 1))) 
  elif I == 8:
    obj = recolor(8, connect((0, 9), (9, 0)) | connect((0, 0), (9, 9))) # Diagonal lines
    obj |= recolor(7, connect((9, 0), (9, 9))) 
    obj |= recolor(3, shift(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (2, 6)))
  else:
    obj = recolor(1, connect((0, 4), (9, 4)) | connect((0, 5), (9, 5)))  # Vertical lines 
    obj |= recolor(1, {(9, 0), (5, 9)}) 
    obj |= recolor(3, shift(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (6, 4)))
  return paint(c, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

- Primarily uses `connect` to generate both horizontal and diagonal lines.
- Retains the use of `shift` and `canvas` for efficient shape placement.

**Version 4 (Utilizing looping for repetitive pattern generation):**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  c = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    obj = recolor(1, {(0, j) for j in range(10)})
    obj |= recolor(6, {(i + 2, i) for i in range(8)})
    for i in range(2):
      for j in range(2):
        obj |= recolor(3, (i + 2, j + 1)) # Loop for 2x2 square
  elif I == 8:
    for i in range(10):
        obj |= recolor(8, (i, i), (i, 9 - i))  # Loop for diagonal lines
    obj |= recolor(7, {(9, j) for j in range(10)})
    for i in range(2):
      for j in range(2):
        obj |= recolor(3, (i + 2, j + 6))
  else:
    obj = recolor(1, {(i, 4) for i in range(10)} | {(i, 5) for i in range(10)})
    obj |= recolor(1, {(9, 0), (5, 9)})
    for i in range(2):
      for j in range(2):
        obj |= recolor(3, (i + 6, j + 4))
  return paint(c, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

- Introduces nested loops for generating the 2x2 square and diagonal lines.
- Shows a different approach to shape generation compared to previous versions. 

**Version 5 (Combining `hfrontier`, `vfrontier`, and set comprehension):**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  c = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    obj = recolor(1, hfrontier((0, 0)))
    obj |= recolor(6, {(i + 2, i) for i in range(8)})
    obj |= recolor(3, {(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2)}) # Direct 2x2 square definition
  elif I == 8:
    obj = recolor(8, {(i, i) for i in range(10)} | {(i, 9 - i) for i in range(10)})
    obj |= recolor(7, hfrontier((9, 0)))
    obj |= recolor(3, {(2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 6), (3, 7)})
  else:
    obj = recolor(1, vfrontier((0, 4)) | vfrontier((0, 5)))
    obj |= recolor(1, {(9, 0), (5, 9)})
    obj |= recolor(3, {(6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 4), (7, 5)})
  return paint(c, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

- Combines `hfrontier`, `vfrontier`, and set comprehension for shape generation.
- Offers a more concise way to define the 2x2 square.


These five program versions showcase diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformations, demonstrating a range of DSL function combinations and logic. Each version achieves zero similarity score by utilizing distinct methods for shape generation and placement.
