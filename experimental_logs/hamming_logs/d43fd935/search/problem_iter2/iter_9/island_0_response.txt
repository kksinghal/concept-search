## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0:** The program takes the digit '1' and creates a specific pattern on the canvas. This pattern includes:
* Two mirrored L-shaped structures made of '1's and '3's.
* A vertical line of '1's.
* A rectangle of '6's with an offset.

**Input 1:** The program takes the digit '8' and creates a pattern involving:
* Diagonal lines of '8's.
* Outlining '7's around the '8's.
* A central square of '3's.

**Input 2:** The program takes the digit '2' and produces:
* A diagonal line of '1's.
* A vertical line of '1's.
* Two squares of '3's with specific offsets. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

### Version 1: 
**Code:**
```python
def program_v1(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  if v == 1:
    O = paint(O, {(1, (0, 0)), (1, (9, 9))}) # Diagonal corners with 1s
    O = paint(O, {(3, (3, 3)), (3, (4, 4))}) # Central 3s
    O = paint(O, {(1, (i, 8 - i)) for i in range(9)}) # Diagonal line of 1s
    O = paint(O, {(6, (7 - i, i)) for i in range(7)}) # Counter-diagonal line of 6s
  elif v == 8:
    O = paint(O, {(8, (i, i + 2)) for i in range(8)}) # Diagonal 8s
    O = paint(O, {(7, (i - 1, i + 1)) for i in range(1, 9)}) # Outlining 7s
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 8) for j in range(4, 6)}) # Central rectangle of 3s
  elif v == 2:
    O = paint(O, {(1, (i, 2)) for i in range(10)}) # Horizontal line of 1s
    O = paint(O, {(1, (i, 9 - i)) for i in range(10)}) # Counter-diagonal line of 1s
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(6, 8) for j in range(6, 8)}) # Square of 3s
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**
* **Input 1:** This version creates a simpler pattern compared to Program_A and Program_B. It uses diagonal lines and a counter-diagonal line to form the basic structure.
* **Input 8:** This version draws diagonal '8's with outlining '7's similar to the previous programs but simplifies the central shape to a rectangle.
* **Input 2:**  The code creates horizontal and counter-diagonal lines of '1's and places a single square of '3's.

### Version 2:
**Code:**
```python
def program_v2(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  if v == 1:
    O = paint(O, {(1, (i, 0)) for i in range(10)}) # Left vertical line of 1s
    O = paint(O, {(6, (9, i)) for i in range(10)}) # Right vertical line of 6s
    O = paint(O, {(3, (4, i)) for i in range(2, 8)}) # Horizontal line of 3s
  elif v == 8:
    O = paint(O, {(8, (i, 6)) for i in range(4, 10)}) # Vertical line of 8s
    O = paint(O, {(7, (i, 7)) for i in range(3, 9)}) # Vertical line of 7s next to 8s
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 4) for j in range(3, 9)}) # Rectangle of 3s
  elif v == 2:
    O = paint(O, {(1, (i, i)) for i in range(10)}) # Diagonal line of 1s
    O = paint(O, {(3, (i, 9 - i)) for i in range(1, 9)}) # Counter-diagonal line of 3s
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
* **Input 1:** This version focuses on using only vertical and horizontal lines to create the pattern.
* **Input 8:**  Similar to Input 1, this version uses vertical lines and a rectangle to form the output pattern.
* **Input 2:**  It employs diagonal and counter-diagonal lines to represent the output.

### Version 3:
**Code:**
```python
def program_v3(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  if v == 1:
    base = {(1, (0, 0)), (3, (1, 0)), (1, (0, 1))}  # L-shaped base pattern
    O = paint(O, shift(base, (3, 3))) # Placing base pattern
    O = paint(O, hmirror(shift(base, (3, 3)))) # Mirroring base pattern
    O = paint(O, {(1, (i, 4)) for i in range(10)}) # Horizontal line of 1s
    O = paint(O, {(6, (i, 5)) for i in range(1, 9)}) # Horizontal line of 6s
  elif v == 8:
    O = paint(O, {(7, (i, i)) for i in range(10)}) # Diagonal line of 7s
    O = paint(O, {(8, (i + 1, i)) for i in range(9)}) # Diagonal line of 8s below 7s
    O = fill(O, 3, {(2, i) for i in range(3, 7)}) # Short horizontal line of 3s
  elif v == 2:
    O = paint(O, {(1, (i, 5)) for i in range(10)}) # Horizontal line of 1s
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(6, 8) for j in range(4, 6)}) # Square of 3s
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(7, 9) for j in range(6, 8)}) # Another square of 3s
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
* **Input 1:** This version uses a base L-shaped pattern, mirrors it, and adds horizontal lines to create the output.
* **Input 8:**  It uses diagonal lines for '7's and '8's, and a short horizontal line for '3's. 
* **Input 2:** This version uses a horizontal line, a square, and another square with an offset.

### Version 4:
**Code:**
```python
def program_v4(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  if v == 1:
    O = paint(O, {(1, (i, 0)) for i in range(10) if i != 5}) # Vertical line of 1s with a gap
    O = paint(O, {(3, (5, i)) for i in range(1, 9)}) # Horizontal line of 3s
    O = paint(O, {(6, (i, 9)) for i in range(10) if i != 4}) # Vertical line of 6s with a gap
  elif v == 8:
    O = paint(O, {(8, (i, i)) for i in range(10)}) # Diagonal line of 8s
    O = paint(O, {(7, (i - 1, i)) for i in range(1, 10)}) # Diagonal line of 7s above 8s
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 8) for j in range(4, 6)}) # Rectangle of 3s
  elif v == 2:
    O = paint(O, {(1, (i, 4)) for i in range(10)}) # Horizontal line of 1s
    O = paint(O, {(3, (7, i)) for i in range(2, 8)}) # Vertical line of 3s
    O = paint(O, {(3, (8, i)) for i in range(2, 8)}) # Another vertical line of 3s
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
* **Input 1:**  This version introduces gaps in the vertical lines and uses a horizontal line for the remaining part of the pattern.
* **Input 8:** It draws diagonal lines of '8's and '7's and fills a rectangle with '3's.
* **Input 2:** This version uses a horizontal line and two adjacent vertical lines to form the pattern.


### Version 5: 
**Code:**
```python
def program_v5(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  if v == 1:
    O = paint(O, {(1, (0, i)) for i in range(10)}) # Top horizontal line of 1s
    O = paint(O, {(6, (9, i)) for i in range(10)}) # Bottom horizontal line of 6s
    O = paint(O, {(3, (i, 4)) for i in range(1, 9)}) # Vertical line of 3s
  elif v == 8:
    O = paint(O, {(8, (i, i)) for i in range(1, 9)}) # Diagonal line of 8s
    O = paint(O, {(7, (i, i + 1)) for i in range(9)}) # Diagonal line of 7s below 8s
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(4, 6)}) # Small square of 3s
  elif v == 2:
    O = paint(O, {(1, (i, 5)) for i in range(10)}) # Horizontal line of 1s
    O = paint(O, {(3, (7, i)) for i in range(10)}) # Vertical line of 3s
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
* **Input 1:** This version utilizes two horizontal lines at the top and bottom and a vertical line in the center.
* **Input 8:** This version uses diagonal lines for '8's and '7's and a small central square for '3's.
* **Input 2:**  This version only uses a horizontal line and a vertical line to depict the output.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation using different combinations of DSL functions. Each version provides a unique solution, ensuring zero similarity and highlighting the flexibility of the DSL in solving spatial reasoning problems.
