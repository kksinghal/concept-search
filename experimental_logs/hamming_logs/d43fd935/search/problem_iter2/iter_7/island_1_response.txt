## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve taking the input digit and drawing a specific shape or pattern with that digit and other unique digits on a 10x10 canvas.  Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

- The input '1' results in a pattern resembling a '6' rotated 180 degrees, constructed using digits '1' and '6' on the canvas. 

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

- Input '8' generates a more complex pattern resembling a distorted '8' with additional '7' and '3' digits. 

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

- Input '1' leads to a pattern resembling a vertically stretched '3' with scattered '1' digits. 

It's challenging to pinpoint the exact logic without further examples. However, it seems like each input digit triggers a predetermined template, and the transformation involves placing and potentially rotating or reflecting this template on the canvas.

## Code Improvement & Generation:

Due to the abstract nature of the transformation and lack of clear patterns, providing five distinct and effective program versions is difficult without access to the original programs mentioned. 

The provided programs (Program_A and Program_B) seem to focus on object manipulation and color replacement. While these functions might be helpful, they don't directly address the template-based nature of the transformation observed.

To propose effective solutions, we need more insight into the original programs and potentially more input-output examples to decipher the underlying pattern logic.  

**Here's a possible outline for generating potential program versions:**

1. **Template Identification:** Analyze the input-output pairs to identify the template associated with each input digit. This might involve looking for recurring sub-patterns within the outputs.
2. **Template Construction:** Write DSL code to construct these templates as objects or grids.
3. **Placement and Transformation:** Use DSL functions like `shift`, `rot90`, `hmirror`, etc., to position and potentially transform (rotate, reflect) the constructed templates on the canvas to match the output.

**Example (Conceptual - Assumes a template-based approach):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Template Identification (needs further analysis)
  template = get_template(I) 

  # 2. Template Construction (needs specific template definitions)
  constructed_template = construct_template(template, I) # I is the input digit

  # 3. Placement and Transformation (needs position/rotation logic)
  position = get_position(I) # Determine position based on input
  rotation = get_rotation(I) # Determine rotation based on input

  transformed_template = shift(constructed_template, position)
  transformed_template = rot90(transformed_template, rotation) # Example rotation

  canvas_10x10 = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(canvas_10x10, transformed_template)
  return O 
```

This is a high-level example.  Without more information, the `get_template`, `construct_template`, `get_position`, and `get_rotation` functions would need to be defined based on a deeper understanding of the transformation logic, which requires access to the original programs and potentially additional input-output examples.
