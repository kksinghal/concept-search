## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The input digit '1' determines the overall pattern.
* A base pattern consisting of '1's and '3's is drawn. 
* This pattern is mirrored horizontally and shifted.
* Additional '1's are drawn to connect the pattern.
* A rectangle of '6's is drawn in the center, extending downwards with a single '6'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The input digit '8' determines the overall pattern.
* '8's are placed in a diagonal pattern.
* '7's are placed around the '8's, forming a rough outline.
* A central area is filled with '3's.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The input digit '1' determines the overall pattern.
* A vertical line of '1's is drawn in the center.
* A diagonal line of '1's extends from the bottom left.
* Two small squares of '3's are placed in the lower center.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, each with explanations:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  if v == 1:
    # Base pattern
    base_pattern = {(1, (0, 0)), (1, (1, 0)), (1, (2, 0)), (3, (0, 1)), (3, (1, 1))}
    O = paint(O, shift(base_pattern, (3, 2)))
    O = paint(O, hmirror(shift(base_pattern, (3, 2))))

    # Connecting lines and rectangle
    O = paint(O, {(1, (0, 0)), (1, (9, 4))})
    O = paint(O, {(1, (i, 4)) for i in range(1, 10)})
    O = paint(O, {(6, (i, j)) for i in range(2, 8) for j in range(5, 8)})
    O = paint(O, {(6, (i, 7)) for i in range(7, 9)})
    
  elif v == 8:
    # Diagonal 8's and outlining 7's
    O = paint(O, {(8, (i, i + 6)) for i in range(4)})
    O = paint(O, {(7, (i - 1, i + 5)) for i in range(4)})
    O = paint(O, {(7, (i + 1, i + 5)) for i in range(3)})
    O = paint(O, {(7, (0, 1)), (7, (3, 4)), (7, (8, 5)), (7, (9, 9))})
    
    # Central 3's
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 4) for j in range(5, 8)})
  
  elif v == 2:
    # Vertical and diagonal 1's
    O = paint(O, {(1, (i, 4)) for i in range(10)})
    O = paint(O, {(1, (i, i)) for i in range(10)})
    
    # Squares of 3's
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(6, 8) for j in range(4, 6)})
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(7, 9) for j in range(5, 7)})

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Input 1:** This version constructs the base pattern, mirrors it, and uses iterative `paint` calls for lines and the rectangle.
* **Input 8:** It iteratively draws the '8's and '7's, then fills the center with '3's.
* **Input 2:** It directly draws the '1' lines and uses `fill` for the '3' squares.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  if v == 1:
    # Mirrored pattern using shifts
    pattern = {(1, (0, 0)), (1, (1, 0)), (1, (2, 0)), (3, (0, 1)), (3, (1, 1))}
    O = paint(O, shift(pattern, (3, 2)))
    O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(pattern), (3, 7)))

    # Connections and rectangle
    O = paint(O, connect((0, 0), (9, 4)))
    O = paint(O, {(6, (i, j)) for i in range(2, 5) for j in range(5, 8)})
    O = paint(O, {(6, (i, 7)) for i in range(5, 8)})

  elif v == 8:
    # Diagonal 8's and shifted 7's
    O = paint(O, {(8, (i, i + 6)) for i in range(4)})
    O = paint(O, shift({(7, (0, 1)), (7, (3, 4)), (7, (3, 5)), (7, (8, 5)), (7, (9, 9))}, (0, 6)))

    # Central 3's
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 4) for j in range(5, 8)})

  elif v == 2:
    # Lines and squares using connect and fill
    O = paint(O, connect((0, 4), (9, 4)))
    O = paint(O, connect((0, 0), (9, 9)))
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(6, 8) for j in range(4, 6)})
    O = fill(O, 3, shift({(3, (0, 0)), (3, (1, 1))}, (6, 4))) 

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Input 1:** Uses `shift` instead of repeated coordinate calculations for mirroring. 
* **Input 8:** Employs `shift` for placing the '7's.
* **Input 2:** Uses `connect` for lines and `shift` for one of the '3' squares.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  if v == 1:
    # Base pattern and mirroring
    base = {(1, (0, 0)), (1, (1, 0)), (1, (2, 0)), (3, (0, 1)), (3, (1, 1))}
    O = paint(O, shift(base, (3, 2)))
    O = paint(O, hmirror(shift(base, (3, 2))))

    # Vertical line and rectangle
    O = paint(O, {(1, (i, 4)) for i in range(10)}) 
    O = fill(O, 6, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 9) for j in range(5, 8) if  i >= 5 or j == 5})

  elif v == 8:
    # Diagonal lines with different colors
    O = paint(O, {(8, (i, i + 6)) for i in range(4)})
    O = paint(O, {(7, (i - 1, i + 5)) for i in range(4)})
    O = paint(O, {(7, (i + 1, i + 5)) for i in range(3)})
    O = paint(O, {(7, (0, 1)), (7, (3, 4)), (7, (8, 5)), (7, (9, 9))})

    # Central 3's
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 4) for j in range(5, 8)})

  elif v == 2:
    # Diagonal and vertical lines
    O = paint(O, {(1, (i, i)) for i in range(10)})
    O = paint(O, {(1, (i, 4)) for i in range(10)})

    # Squares of 3's using offsets
    square = {(3, (0, 0)), (3, (0, 1)), (3, (1, 0)), (3, (1, 1))}
    O = paint(O, shift(square, (6, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(square, (7, 5))) 

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Input 1:** Uses conditional logic within `fill` for the '6' shape.
* **Input 8:**  Similar approach to Version 2.
* **Input 2:** Constructs and shifts small '3' squares.


**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  if v == 1:
    # Combining shapes with set operations
    base = {(1, (i, 0)) for i in range(3)} | {(3, (i, 1)) for i in range(2)}
    O = paint(O, shift(base | hmirror(base), (3, 2)))

    # Connecting line and rectangle
    O = paint(O, connect((0, 0), (9, 4)))
    rect = {(6, (i, j)) for i in range(2, 9) for j in range(5, 8)}
    O = paint(O, rect - {(6, (i, 6)) for i in range(2, 5)} - {(6, (i, 7)) for i in range(8, 9)})
    
  elif v == 8:
    # Diagonal 8's and surrounding 7's
    O = paint(O, {(8, (i, i + 6)) for i in range(4)})
    O = paint(O, {(7, (i, j)) for i in range(10) for j in range(10) if abs(i - j) == 5 or abs(i - j) == 7})
    O = paint(O, {(7, (0, 1)), (7, (3, 4)), (7, (9, 9))})

    # Central 3's
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 4) for j in range(5, 8)})

  elif v == 2:
    # Lines using connect
    O = paint(O, connect((0, 4), (9, 4)))
    O = paint(O, connect((0, 0), (9, 9)))

    # Squares using nested loops and offsets
    for i in range(6, 8):
      for j in range(4, 6):
        O = paint(O, {(3, (i + k, j + l)) for k in range(2) for l in range(2)})

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Input 1:** Uses set operations to construct the mirrored pattern. 
* **Input 8:** Defines '7' placement based on diagonal distances.
* **Input 2:** Employs nested loops and offsets for the '3' squares.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  if v == 1:
    # Base shape and mirrored copy
    base = {(1, (0, 0)), (1, (1, 0)), (1, (2, 0)), (3, (0, 1)), (3, (1, 1))}
    O = paint(O, shift(base, (3, 2)))
    O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(base), (3, 7)))

    # Line and rectangle using ranges
    for i in range(10):
        O = paint(O, {(1, (i, 4))})
    for i in range(2, 9):
        for j in range(5, 8):
            if i >= 5 or j == 5:
                O = paint(O, {(6, (i, j))}) 

  elif v == 8:
    # 8's and 7's using modulo and conditions
    for i in range(10):
        for j in range(10):
            if i % 2 == 0 and j == i + 6:
                O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j))})
            elif (abs(i - j) == 5 or abs(i - j) == 7) or ((i, j) in {(0, 1), (3, 4), (9, 9)}):
                O = paint(O, {(7, (i, j))})
    
    # Central 3's
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 4) for j in range(5, 8)})

  elif v == 2:
    # Lines using connect
    O = paint(O, connect((0, 4), (9, 4)))
    O = paint(O, connect((0, 0), (9, 9)))

    # Squares using shift and loop
    square = {(3, (0, 0)), (3, (1, 0)), (3, (0, 1)), (3, (1, 1))}
    for i in range(2):
        O = paint(O, shift(square, (6 + i, 4 + i)))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Input 1:** Uses nested loops and conditional `paint` for the rectangle.
* **Input 8:**  Employs modulo and conditions for '8' and '7' placement.
* **Input 2:** Uses `shift` within a loop for the '3' squares.

These five versions demonstrate significantly different approaches to achieving the same output, showcasing diverse DSL function combinations and logical structures.
