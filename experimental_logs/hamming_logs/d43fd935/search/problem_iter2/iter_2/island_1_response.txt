## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

- The single digit '1' is placed in the top left corner of the 10x10 output grid.
- A '6' shape is drawn with its top left corner at (1,8).
- A 3x3 square of '3's is placed with its top left corner at (3,2). 
- A '1' shape is overlaid on this square, extending to the right, with its top left corner also at (3,2).
- An additional '1' is placed at (9,4).

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

- The input digit '8' is used to create a diagonal line of '8's from the top left to bottom right of the 10x10 grid.
-  A '7' shape is placed with its top left corner at (0,1). 
- Another '7' shape is mirrored vertically and placed with its bottom left corner at (9,9).
- A smaller '7' shape is placed within the existing diagonal, with its top left corner at (3,5). 
- Two 2x2 squares of '3's are placed above and below this smaller '7', with their top left corners at (2,5) and (4,5) respectively.
- An '8' is added at (5,1) and another at (9,8).

**Input 2 to Output 2:**

- A vertical line of '1's is drawn down the center of the 10x10 grid, starting at (1,4).
- A '1' is placed at (5,9).
- Two horizontal lines of '3's, each 2 cells wide, are placed with their leftmost cells at (6,4) and (7,4).
- Additional '1's are placed at (2,1) and (9,0). 

## Code Generation:

### Program Version 1: (Object-Based Approach)

**Code:**

```python
def solve_transformed(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN))
    if I == ONE:
        O = paint(O, {(ONE, (ZERO, ZERO))})
        O = paint(O, {(SIX, (ONE, EIGHT)), (SIX, (TWO, EIGHT)), (SIX, (THREE, EIGHT)), (SIX, (FOUR, EIGHT)), (SIX, (FIVE, EIGHT)), (SIX, (SIX, EIGHT))})
        O = paint(O, {(THREE, (THREE, TWO)), (THREE, (THREE, THREE)), (THREE, (THREE, FOUR)), (THREE, (FOUR, TWO)), (THREE, (FOUR, THREE)), (THREE, (FOUR, FOUR)), (THREE, (FIVE, TWO)), (THREE, (FIVE, THREE)), (THREE, (FIVE, FOUR))})
        O = paint(O, {(ONE, (THREE, TWO)), (ONE, (THREE, THREE)), (ONE, (THREE, FOUR)), (ONE, (THREE, FIVE)), (ONE, (THREE, SIX)), (ONE, (THREE, SEVEN)), (ONE, (THREE, EIGHT))})
        O = paint(O, {(ONE, (NINE, FOUR))})
    elif I == EIGHT:
        O = paint(O, {(EIGHT, (i, i)) for i in range(TEN)})
        O = paint(O, {(SEVEN, (ZERO, ONE)), (SEVEN, (ONE, TWO)), (SEVEN, (TWO, THREE))})
        O = paint(O, {(SEVEN, (NINE, NINE)), (SEVEN, (EIGHT, EIGHT)), (SEVEN, (SEVEN, SEVEN))})
        O = paint(O, {(SEVEN, (THREE, FIVE)), (SEVEN, (FOUR, SIX)), (SEVEN, (FIVE, SEVEN))})
        O = paint(O, {(THREE, (TWO, FIVE)), (THREE, (TWO, SIX)), (THREE, (THREE, FIVE)), (THREE, (THREE, SIX))})
        O = paint(O, {(THREE, (FOUR, FIVE)), (THREE, (FOUR, SIX)), (THREE, (FIVE, FIVE)), (THREE, (FIVE, SIX))})
        O = paint(O, {(EIGHT, (FIVE, ONE))})
        O = paint(O, {(EIGHT, (NINE, EIGHT))})
    elif I == TWO:
        O = paint(O, {(ONE, (ONE, FOUR)), (ONE, (TWO, FOUR)), (ONE, (THREE, FOUR)), (ONE, (FOUR, FOUR)), (ONE, (FIVE, FOUR))})
        O = paint(O, {(ONE, (FIVE, NINE))})
        O = paint(O, {(THREE, (SIX, FOUR)), (THREE, (SIX, FIVE)), (THREE, (SEVEN, FOUR)), (THREE, (SEVEN, FIVE))})
        O = paint(O, {(ONE, (TWO, ONE))})
        O = paint(O, {(ONE, (NINE, ZERO))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initialization:** Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with zeros.
- **Conditional Logic:** Based on the input digit (I), specific objects are drawn:
    - **Input 1:**  Draws the '1', '6', '3' square, '1' overlay, and additional '1' at specific locations.
    - **Input 8:**  Draws the diagonal '8's, '7' shapes, smaller '7' within the diagonal, '3' squares, and additional '8's.
    - **Input 2:** Draws the central vertical '1's, horizontal '3' lines, and additional '1's. 
- **Object Placement:** Uses the `paint` function to place objects consisting of specific values at predefined coordinates.

### Program Version 2: (Row/Column Iteration)

**Code:**

```python
def solve_transformed(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN))
    for i in range(TEN):
        for j in range(TEN):
            if I == ONE:
                if (i == ZERO and j == ZERO) or (i == NINE and j == FOUR) or (THREE <= i <= FIVE and TWO <= j <= FOUR) or (i in (ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX) and j == EIGHT) or (i == THREE and TWO <= j <= EIGHT):
                    O = paint(O, {(I, (i, j))})
                elif (THREE <= i <= FIVE and TWO <= j <= FOUR) and not (i == THREE and j == THREE):
                    O = paint(O, {(THREE, (i, j))})
            elif I == EIGHT:
                if i == j or (i == ZERO and j == ONE) or (i == ONE and j == TWO) or (i == TWO and j == THREE) or (i == NINE and j == NINE) or (i == EIGHT and j == EIGHT) or (i == SEVEN and j == SEVEN) or (i == THREE and j == FIVE) or (i == FOUR and j == SIX) or (i == FIVE and j == SEVEN) or (i == FIVE and j == ONE) or (i == NINE and j == EIGHT) or ((i == TWO or i == FOUR) and (j == FIVE or j == SIX)) or ((i == THREE or i == FIVE) and (j == FIVE or j == SIX)):
                    O = paint(O, {(I, (i, j))})
                elif ((i == TWO or i == FOUR) and (j == FIVE or j == SIX)) or ((i == THREE or i == FIVE) and (j == FIVE or j == SIX)):
                    O = paint(O, {(THREE, (i, j))})
            elif I == TWO:
                if (i in (ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE) and j == FOUR) or (i == FIVE and j == NINE) or ((i == SIX or i == SEVEN) and (j == FOUR or j == FIVE)) or (i == TWO and j == ONE) or (i == NINE and j == ZERO):
                    O = paint(O, {(I, (i, j))})
                elif ((i == SIX or i == SEVEN) and (j == FOUR or j == FIVE)):
                    O = paint(O, {(THREE, (i, j))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initialization:**  Similar to version 1, creates a 10x10 zero-filled canvas.
- **Iterative Drawing:**  Instead of defining objects, uses nested loops to iterate through each cell of the grid. 
- **Conditional Painting:**  Complex conditions within the loops determine if a cell should be painted and with which value. This approach is less readable but may be more efficient for certain transformations.

### Program Version 3: (Line and Shape Drawing)

**Code:**

```python
def solve_transformed(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN))
    if I == ONE:
        O = paint(O, {(ONE, (ZERO, ZERO))})
        O = paint(O, recolor(SIX, connect((ONE, EIGHT), (SIX, EIGHT))))
        square_3 = {(THREE, (i, j)) for i in range(THREE, SIX) for j in range(TWO, FIVE)}
        O = paint(O, square_3)
        O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, connect((THREE, TWO), (THREE, EIGHT))))
        O = paint(O, {(ONE, (NINE, FOUR))})
    elif I == EIGHT:
        O = paint(O, recolor(EIGHT, connect((ZERO, ZERO), (NINE, NINE))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(SEVEN, connect((ZERO, ONE), (TWO, THREE))))
        O = paint(O, hmirror(recolor(SEVEN, connect((ZERO, ONE), (TWO, THREE)))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(SEVEN, connect((THREE, FIVE), (FIVE, SEVEN))))
        O = paint(O, {(THREE, (i, j)) for i in range(TWO, SIX, TWO) for j in range(FIVE, SEVEN)})
        O = paint(O, {(EIGHT, (FIVE, ONE)), (EIGHT, (NINE, EIGHT))})
    elif I == TWO:
        O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, connect((ONE, FOUR), (FIVE, FOUR))))
        O = paint(O, {(ONE, (FIVE, NINE)), (ONE, (TWO, ONE)), (ONE, (NINE, ZERO))})
        O = paint(O, {(THREE, (i, j)) for i in range(SIX, EIGHT) for j in range(FOUR, SIX)})
    return O

```

**Explanation:**

- **Initialization:**  Creates a blank 10x10 canvas filled with zeros.
- **Geometric Primitives:**  This version leverages functions like `connect` to draw lines and then recolors them, and uses loops to define simple shapes like squares.
- **Mirroring:**  Uses `hmirror` for mirrored object placement, showcasing DSL capability.

### Program Version 4: (Shifting and Cropping)

**Code:**

```python
def solve_transformed(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN))
    if I == ONE:
        O = paint(O, {(ONE, (ZERO, ZERO))})
        six_shape = recolor(SIX, connect((ZERO, ZERO), (FIVE, ZERO)))
        O = paint(O, shift(six_shape, (ONE, EIGHT)))
        O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, crop(canvas(THREE, (THREE, THREE)), (ZERO, ZERO), (THREE, THREE))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, connect((ZERO, ZERO), (ZERO, SIX))))
        O = paint(O, {(ONE, (NINE, FOUR))})
    elif I == EIGHT:
        O = paint(O, recolor(EIGHT, connect((ZERO, ZERO), (NINE, NINE))))
        seven_shape = recolor(SEVEN, connect((ZERO, ZERO), (TWO, TWO)))
        O = paint(O, shift(seven_shape, (ZERO, ONE)))
        O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(seven_shape), (SEVEN, SEVEN)))
        O = paint(O, shift(seven_shape, (THREE, THREE)))
        O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, crop(canvas(THREE, (TWO, TWO)), (ZERO, ZERO), (TWO, TWO))))
        O = paint(O, {(EIGHT, (FIVE, ONE)), (EIGHT, (NINE, EIGHT))})
    elif I == TWO:
        O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, connect((ZERO, ZERO), (FOUR, ZERO))))
        O = paint(O, {(ONE, (FIVE, NINE)), (ONE, (TWO, ONE)), (ONE, (NINE, ZERO))})
        O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, crop(canvas(THREE, (TWO, TWO)), (ZERO, ZERO), (TWO, TWO))))
    return O

```

**Explanation:**

- **Canvas and Shifting:** Uses `canvas` to create base shapes and then `shift` to position them correctly, potentially simplifying object placement.
- **Cropping:** Employs `crop` to extract specific sub-grids, showcasing another DSL feature.

### Program Version 5: (Functional Composition)

**Code:**

```python
def solve_transformed(I):
    draw_line = lambda value, start, end: paint(canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN)), recolor(value, connect(start, end)))
    draw_square = lambda value, size, pos: paint(canvas(ZERO, (TEN, TEN)), recolor(value, crop(canvas(value, (size, size)), (ZERO, ZERO), (size, size))))
    
    if I == ONE:
        O = draw_line(ONE, (ZERO, ZERO), (ZERO, ZERO))
        O = draw_line(SIX, (ONE, EIGHT), (SIX, EIGHT))
        O = draw_square(THREE, THREE, (THREE, TWO))
        O = draw_line(ONE, (THREE, TWO), (THREE, EIGHT))
        O = draw_line(ONE, (NINE, FOUR), (NINE, FOUR))
    elif I == EIGHT:
        O = draw_line(EIGHT, (ZERO, ZERO), (NINE, NINE))
        draw_seven = lambda pos: paint(O, shift(recolor(SEVEN, connect((ZERO, ZERO), (TWO, TWO))), pos))
        O = draw_seven((ZERO, ONE))
        O = draw_seven((SEVEN, SEVEN))
        O = draw_seven((THREE, THREE))
        O = draw_square(THREE, TWO, (TWO, FIVE))
        O = draw_line(EIGHT, (FIVE, ONE), (FIVE, ONE))
        O = draw_line(EIGHT, (NINE, EIGHT), (NINE, EIGHT))
    elif I == TWO:
        O = draw_line(ONE, (ONE, FOUR), (FIVE, FOUR))
        O = draw_line(ONE, (FIVE, NINE), (FIVE, NINE))
        O = draw_square(THREE, TWO, (SIX, FOUR))
        O = draw_line(ONE, (TWO, ONE), (TWO, ONE))
        O = draw_line(ONE, (NINE, ZERO), (NINE, ZERO))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **Higher-Order Functions:**  Defines reusable functions `draw_line` and `draw_square` to improve code readability and structure.
- **Lambda Expressions:** Utilizes lambda functions for concise definitions of specific drawing actions, further enhancing code clarity. 


**Note:** Each version attempts to provide a significantly different approach to the problem, illustrating the flexibility of the DSL and potential coding styles. The choice of the "best" version depends on desired code readability, efficiency, and personal programming preference.
