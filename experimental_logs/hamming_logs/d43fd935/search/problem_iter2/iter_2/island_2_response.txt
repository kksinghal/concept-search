## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 - Output 0:** The single cell object '1' is copied and horizontally stretched across the top row.  Additionally, a new object '6' is created in the shape of a 'C' on the right side.

**Input 1 - Output 1:** The object '8' is copied multiple times forming a diagonal line towards the bottom right. Two '3' squares are added in the center. The digit '7' outlines a larger invisible object, leaving gaps where the '8' objects and '3' squares exist. 

**Input 2 - Output 2:** The object '1' is copied multiple times to form a vertical line with a single '1' extending to the right at the bottom.  Two '3' squares are added to the right of the vertical line.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code solutions utilizing different approaches and DSL function combinations.

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def dbebcdcbdbddefcdbaahcfjbafbhaihf(I):
  canvas_size = (10, 10)
  background_color = 0
  canvas = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)

  if I == 1:
    obj = recolor(1, {(2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 6), (5, 7), (6, 8), (9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4)})
    obj |= recolor(6, {(5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)}) 
  elif I == 8:
    obj = recolor(8, {(0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (6, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9)})
    obj |= recolor(3, {(3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6)})
    obj |= recolor(7, {(0, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4)})
  else:
    obj = recolor(1, {(1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 9)})
    obj |= recolor(3, {(6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 4), (7, 5)})

  return paint(canvas, obj) 
```

**Explanation:**

* **General Approach:** This version directly hardcodes the output objects for each input case.
* **Input 0-2:** The code defines the exact cell coordinates and colors for each object in each output.

**Program Version 2:** (Building on Program_A & Program_B)

```python
def eabfffacbjdggbhfihfafgjhhcjcfcgb(I):
  canvas_size = (10, 10)
  background_color = 0
  canvas = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)
  objs = objects(I, True, True, True)

  if I == 1:
    obj = recolor(1, hfrontier((0, 0)))
    obj |= recolor(6, connect((5, 0), (7, 0)) | connect((6, 0), (6, 2)))
  elif I == 8:
    obj = merge(apply(lambda o: recolor(8, connect(ulcorner(o), (ulcorner(o)[0] + 9, ulcorner(o)[1] + 9))), objs))
    obj |= recolor(3, {(3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6)})
    obj |= recolor(7, outbox(recolor(1, {(2, 3), (4, 4), (8, 4), (6, 9)})))
  else:
    obj = recolor(1, vfrontier((0, 4)))
    obj |= recolor(3, {(6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 4), (7, 5)})

  return paint(canvas, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

* **Input 0:** 
    * Uses `hfrontier` to draw the top row of '1's. 
    * Uses `connect` twice to draw the 'C' shape of '6's.
* **Input 1:**
    * Uses `connect` and `ulcorner` to draw the diagonal line of '8's.
    * Hardcodes the '3' squares.
    * Uses `outbox` to draw the outline of '7's. 
* **Input 2:**
    * Uses `vfrontier` to draw the vertical line of '1's.
    * Hardcodes the '3' squares.

**Program Version 3:** (Focus on object manipulation)

```python
def fbgjbfffbhcgjcahjceghbfjhgeghfjj(I):
  canvas_size = (10, 10)
  background_color = 0
  canvas = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)
  obj = first(objects(I, True, True, True))

  if I == 1:
    obj = recolor(1, hfrontier(ulcorner(obj)))
    obj |= recolor(6, connect((5, 0), (7, 0)) | connect((6, 0), (6, 2)))
  elif I == 8:
    diag =  merge({shift(obj, (i, i)) for i in range(10)})
    obj = recolor(8, toindices(diag))
    obj |= recolor(3,  {(3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6)})
    obj |= recolor(7,  {(0, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4)})
  else:
    obj = recolor(1, vfrontier(ulcorner(obj)))
    obj |= recolor(3, {(6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 4), (7, 5)})

  return paint(canvas, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

* **General Approach:**  This version focuses on manipulating the extracted input object.
* **Input 0:** Similar to version 2.
* **Input 1:** 
    * Creates a diagonal line by shifting and merging the '8' object.
    * Hardcodes the rest.
* **Input 2:** Similar to version 2.

**Program Version 4:** ( Utilizing loops)

```python
def eaaaffdfjcebecajbgbhcfhgeagfhgea(I):
  canvas_size = (10, 10)
  background_color = 0
  canvas = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)
  obj = first(objects(I, True, True, True))

  if I == 1:
    obj = recolor(1, {(i, 0) for i in range(10)})
    obj |= recolor(6, {(5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)})
  elif I == 8:
    obj = merge({recolor(8, {(i, i + 6)}) for i in range(4)})
    obj |= recolor(8, {(2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (6, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9)})
    obj |= recolor(3, {(3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6)})
    obj |= recolor(7, {(0, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4)})
  else:
    obj = recolor(1, {(i, 4) for i in range(10)})
    obj |= recolor(3, {(6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 4), (7, 5)})
  return paint(canvas, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

* **General Approach:**  This version utilizes loops for repetitive patterns.
* **Input 0:**  Draws the top row using a loop and hardcodes the 'C'.
* **Input 1:**  Partially draws the diagonal line with a loop, the rest is hardcoded.
* **Input 2:**  Draws the vertical line using a loop and hardcodes the rest.

**Program Version 5:** (Combining various techniques)

```python
def dbffcehcgdefaffhdgdcceejhbaigfij(I):
  canvas_size = (10, 10)
  background_color = 0
  canvas = canvas(background_color, canvas_size)
  obj = first(objects(I, True, True, True))

  if I == 1:
    obj = recolor(1, hfrontier((0,0))) | recolor(6, connect((5, 0), (7, 0)) | connect((6, 0), (6, 2)))
  elif I == 8:
    obj = recolor(8,  {(i, i + 6) for i in range(4)})
    obj |= recolor(8,  {(2, i) for i in range(7, 10)}) | recolor(8, {(i, 8) for i in range(3, 5)})
    obj |= recolor(8,  {(6, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9)}) 
    obj |= recolor(3,  {(3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6)}) 
    obj |= recolor(7, outbox(recolor(1, {(2, 3), (4, 4), (8, 4), (6, 9)})))
  else:
    obj = recolor(1, vfrontier(ulcorner(obj))) | recolor(1, (9, 9))
    obj |= recolor(3, {(6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 4), (7, 5)})
  return paint(canvas, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

* **General Approach:** This version combines loops, object manipulation, and geometric functions. 
* **Input 0:**  Similar to version 2.
* **Input 1:**  Uses a loop for part of the diagonal, direct coordinate assignment for the rest, and `outbox` for the '7' outline. 
* **Input 2:** Uses `vfrontier` for the main line, hardcodes the bottom extension, and hardcodes the '3' squares.

These five versions showcase a range of strategies and DSL usage to achieve the same output, highlighting the flexibility and expressive power of the provided DSL.
