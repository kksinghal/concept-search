## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The single '1' replicates and expands horizontally, forming a horizontal line. Additionally, '6's appear in a diagonal pattern starting from the top-right corner, moving downwards and leftwards. Finally, a 2x4 rectangle of '3's is placed above the left end of the horizontal '1' line.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** The '8' replicates and forms a diagonal line from the top-right to bottom-left corner. It also creates a vertical line at the right edge. Two 2x2 squares of '3' and '7' appear, with the '7' square surrounding the '3' square. Additional '7's appear to connect these squares with the diagonal line of '8's.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The single '1' replicates vertically, creating a vertical line. It also replicates to the last column of the grid. Two 2x2 squares of '3' appear to the right of the vertical '1' line. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL to achieve the described transformations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  c = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    obj = recolor(1, hfrontier((0,0))) 
    obj |= recolor(6, connect((0,9), (7,2))) 
    obj |= recolor(3, shift(canvas(3, (2, 4)), (3, 3)))
  elif I == 8:
    obj = recolor(8, connect((0,9), (9,0)))
    obj |= recolor(8, vfrontier((0,9)))
    obj |= recolor(3, shift(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (3, 6)))
    obj |= recolor(7, box(shift(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (3, 6))))
  else:
    obj = recolor(1, vfrontier((0,0))) 
    obj |= recolor(1, vfrontier((0,9))) 
    obj |= recolor(3, shift(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (6, 3))) 
  return paint(c, obj)
