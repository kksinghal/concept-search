## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

* The digit "1" is drawn vertically along the leftmost column.
* Decorative elements are added:
    * A vertical line of '6's to the right of the digit.
    * Two '3's forming a small square near the top of the digit.
    * A single '6' near the bottom of the digit.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

* The digit "8" is drawn with two diagonal lines converging at the center, and a horizontal line connecting them. 
* Decorative elements are added:
    * '7's are placed at the corners and the center of the digit.
    * Two horizontally adjacent '3's are placed near the center of the digit.

**Input 2 to Output 2:**

* The digit "2" is drawn as a vertical line on the right side.
* Decorative elements are added:
    * A vertical line of '1's is drawn to the left of the digit.
    * Two horizontally adjacent '3's are placed near the center of the digit. 


## Program Version 1:

```python
def program_v1(I):
  def draw_element(grid, color, positions):
    for pos in positions:
      grid = paint(grid, recolor(color, {pos}))
    return grid

  canvas_grid = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  digit_positions = {
    1: [(0, i) for i in range(10)],
    8: [(i, i) for i in range(10)] + [(i, 9-i) for i in range(10)] + [(i, 5) for i in range(10)],
    2: [(9, i) for i in range(10)]
  }

  decor_positions = {
    1: {
      6: [(1, i) for i in range(1, 10, 8)],
      3: [(3, 3), (3, 4)],
      6: [(5, 2)]
    },
    8: {
      7: [(0, 0), (9, 9), (4, 5), (5, 4)],
      3: [(3, 5), (3, 6)]
    },
    2: {
      1: [(8, i) for i in range(1, 10)],
      3: [(6, 7), (6, 8)]
    }
  }

  canvas_grid = draw_element(canvas_grid, I, digit_positions[I])
  for color, positions in decor_positions[I].items():
    canvas_grid = draw_element(canvas_grid, color, positions)
  return canvas_grid
```

**Explanation:**

* This version uses pre-defined dictionaries for digit and decoration positions. 
* `draw_element` is reused for efficiency. 
* It loops through the positions and paints them on the canvas.

## Program Version 2:

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, vfrontier((0, 0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, vfrontier((1, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(3, 3), (3, 4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5, 2)}))
  elif I == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, connect((0, 0), (9, 9))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, connect((0, 9), (9, 0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, hfrontier((5, 0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, corners(asindices(O))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(3, 5), (3, 6)}))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, vfrontier((9, 0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, vfrontier((8, 0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(6, 7), (6, 8)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version utilizes `vfrontier`, `hfrontier`, and `connect` functions to draw the basic shapes of digits.
* It uses `corners` to identify corner positions for decoration in the case of "8".

## Program Version 3:

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, {(0, j) for j in range(10)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(1, j) for j in range(1, 10, 8)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(3, j) for j in range(3, 5)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5, 2)}))
  elif I == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, {(i, i) for i in range(10)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, {(i, 9-i) for i in range(10)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, {(i, 5) for i in range(10)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, j) for i in (0, 9) for j in (0, 9)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(3, j) for j in range(5, 7)})) 
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, {(9, j) for j in range(10)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(8, j) for j in range(10)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(6, j) for j in range(7, 9)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version focuses on directly defining the positions of digit and decoration elements using set comprehension within the `paint` and `recolor` functions.

## Program Version 4:

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, line((0,0),(0,9)))) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(1,1), (1,9)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(3,3),(3,4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5,2)}))
  elif I == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, connect((0,0),(9,9))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, connect((9,0),(0,9))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, hfrontier((5,0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(0,0),(9,9),(0,9),(9,0)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(3,5),(3,6)}))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, line((9,0),(9,9))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, line((8,0),(8,9))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(6,7),(6,8)})) 
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

* This version utilizes `line` function to draw straight lines for digit components.
* It combines this with `connect` for diagonal lines in "8".

## Program Version 5:

```python
def program_v5(I):
  grid = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    for i in range(10): grid = paint(grid, recolor(1, {(0, i)}))
    for i in range(1, 10, 8): grid = paint(grid, recolor(6, {(1, i)}))
    for i in range(3, 5): grid = paint(grid, recolor(3, {(3, i)}))
    grid = paint(grid, recolor(6, {(5, 2)}))
  elif I == 8:
    for i in range(10):
      grid = paint(grid, recolor(8, {(i, i)}))
      grid = paint(grid, recolor(8, {(i, 9-i)}))
      if i == 5: grid = paint(grid, recolor(8, {(i, 5)}))
    for i in (0, 9):
      for j in (0, 9): grid = paint(grid, recolor(7, {(i, j)}))
    for i in range(5, 7): grid = paint(grid, recolor(3, {(3, i)}))
  else:
    for i in range(10):
      grid = paint(grid, recolor(2, {(9, i)}))
      grid = paint(grid, recolor(1, {(8, i)}))
    for i in range(7, 9): grid = paint(grid, recolor(3, {(6, i)}))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

* This version uses nested loops to iterate through grid positions and paint them accordingly.
* It utilizes conditional statements within the loops to handle digit and decoration variations. 

Each of these five program versions provides a distinct approach to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing diverse DSL function combinations and logic.
