## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:**

1. **Input Digit Placement:** The input digit '1' is placed at two locations: (0, 0) and (9, 4).
2. **Shape Construction:** A '6' shaped object and a 2x2 square of '3's are added to the grid. The '6' shape consists of a vertical line and a detached horizontal line.

**Input 1 -> Output 1:**

1. **Input Digit Placement:** The input digit '8' is placed diagonally across the grid.
2. **Shape Construction:** A '7' shaped object (a horizontal line with a single cell above at one end) and two 1x2 rectangles of '3's are added. The positioning of these shapes is related to the diagonal placement of the '8's.

**Input 2 -> Output 2:**

1. **Input Digit Placement:** The input digit '1' is placed in a vertical line pattern with a detached '1' at the end.
2. **Shape Construction:** A 2x2 square of '3's is added below the vertical line of '1's.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program along with explanations:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  grid = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    grid = paint(grid, {(I, (0, 0)), (I, (9, 4))})
    grid = paint(grid, {(6, (i, 7)) for i in range(2, 9)} | {(6, (i, 1)) for i in range(2, 6) })
    grid = paint(grid, {(3, (3, 1)), (3, (3, 2)), (3, (4, 1)), (3, (4, 2))})
  elif I == 8:
    grid = paint(grid, {(I, (i, i)) for i in range(10)})
    grid = paint(grid, {(7, (2, 6)), (7, (3, 6)), (7, (4, 6)), (7, (5, 6)), (7, (6, 6)), (7, (3, 7))}) 
    grid = paint(grid, {(3, (2, 7)), (3, (3, 7))})
    grid = paint(grid, {(3, (2, 8)), (3, (3, 8))})
  else:
    grid = paint(grid, {(I, (i, 4)) for i in range(2, 8)} | {(I, (9, 9))})
    grid = paint(grid, {(3, (6, 4)), (3, (6, 5)), (3, (7, 4)), (3, (7, 5))})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

* **Canvas Creation:** Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with zeros.
* **Conditional Placement and Painting:** Uses conditional statements to handle each input digit separately.
    * Places the input digit at specific locations based on its value.
    * Constructs the additional shapes by directly specifying the cell coordinates and painting them with the appropriate color.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  grid = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    grid = paint(grid, {(I, (0, 0)), (I, (9, 4))})
    vline_6 = shift(recolor(6, {(i, 0) for i in range(7)}), (2, 7))
    hline_6 = shift(recolor(6, {(0, i) for i in range(4)}), (2, 1))
    grid = paint(grid, vline_6 | hline_6)
    square_3 = upscale({(3, (0, 0))}, 2)
    grid = paint(grid, shift(square_3, (3, 1))) 
  elif I == 8:
    grid = paint(grid, {(I, (i, i)) for i in range(10)})
    hline_7 = shift(recolor(7, {(0, i) for i in range(6)}), (2, 6))
    grid = paint(grid, hline_7 | {(7, (3, 7))})
    rect_3 = upscale({(3, (0, 0))}, 1, 2) 
    grid = paint(grid, shift(rect_3, (2, 7))) 
    grid = paint(grid, shift(rect_3, (2, 8))) 
  else:
    vline_1 = shift(recolor(I, {(i, 0) for i in range(6)}), (2, 4))
    grid = paint(grid, vline_1 | {(I, (9, 9))})
    square_3 = upscale({(3, (0, 0))}, 2)
    grid = paint(grid, shift(square_3, (6, 4)))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

* **Canvas Creation:** Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with zeros.
* **Shape Construction:** Uses `recolor`, `shift`, and `upscale` functions to construct the additional shapes.
    * Creates basic shapes like lines and squares using `recolor`.
    * Positions them correctly using `shift`.
    * Resizes if necessary using `upscale`.
* **Painting:** Paints the shapes onto the canvas.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  grid = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    grid = paint(grid, {(I, (0, 0)), (I, (9, 4))})
    grid = paint(grid, recolor(6, connect((2, 7), (8, 7)) | connect((2, 1), (5, 1))))
    grid = paint(grid, recolor(3, backdrop({(0, 0), (1, 1)}) + (3, 1)))
  elif I == 8:
    grid = paint(grid, {(I, (i, i)) for i in range(10)})
    grid = paint(grid, recolor(7, connect((2, 6), (7, 6)) | {(3, 7)}))
    rect_3 = recolor(3, {(0, 0), (0, 1)})
    grid = paint(grid, shift(rect_3, (2, 7))) 
    grid = paint(grid, shift(rect_3, (2, 8))) 
  else:
    grid = paint(grid, recolor(I, connect((2, 4), (7, 4)) | {(9, 9)}))
    grid = paint(grid, recolor(3, backdrop({(0, 0), (1, 1)}) + (6, 4)))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

* **Canvas Creation:** Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with zeros.
* **Shape Construction:** Utilizes `connect` and `backdrop` functions for shape creation.
    * `connect` generates lines for the '6' and '7' shapes.
    * `backdrop` creates a rectangle for the '3' squares.
* **Painting:** Paints the constructed shapes onto the canvas.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  grid = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    grid = paint(grid, {(I, (0, 0)), (I, (9, 4))})
    grid = paint(grid, recolor(6,  {(i, 7) for i in range(2, 9)} | {(j, 1) for j in range(2, 6)}))
    grid = paint(grid, recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(1, 3)}))
  elif I == 8:
    grid = paint(grid, {(I, (i, i)) for i in range(10)})
    grid = paint(grid, recolor(7, {(2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (3, 7)}))
    grid = paint(grid, recolor(3, {(2, 7), (3, 7), (2, 8), (3, 8)}))
  else:
    grid = paint(grid, recolor(I, {(i, 4) for i in range(2, 8)} | {(9, 9)}))
    grid = paint(grid, recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(6, 8) for j in range(4, 6)})) 
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

* **Canvas Creation:** Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with zeros.
* **Direct Coordinate Specification:** Defines shapes by directly specifying the cell coordinates within a set comprehension.
* **Painting:** Paints the shapes onto the canvas.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  grid = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    grid = paint(grid, {(I, (0, 0)), (I, (9, 4))})
    grid = paint(grid, recolor(6, shift(initset((0, 0)), (2, 7)) | shift(initset((0, 0)), (2, 1))))
    grid = paint(grid, recolor(3, shift(initset((0, 0)), (3, 1))))
  elif I == 8:
    grid = paint(grid, {(I, (i, i)) for i in range(10)})
    grid = paint(grid, recolor(7, shift(initset((0, 0)), (2, 6)) | {(3, 7)}))
    grid = paint(grid, recolor(3, shift(initset((0, 0)), (2, 7)) | shift(initset((0, 0)), (2, 8))))
  else:
    grid = paint(grid, recolor(I, shift(initset((0, 0)), (2, 4)) | {(9, 9)}))
    grid = paint(grid, recolor(3, shift(initset((0, 0)), (6, 4))))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

* **Canvas Creation:** Creates a 10x10 canvas filled with zeros.
* **Shape Construction with `initset` and `shift`:**
   - Uses `initset` to create a single-cell object.
   - Leverages `shift` to position and effectively "draw" lines and squares by combining shifted single-cell objects.
* **Painting:** Paints the constructed shapes onto the canvas.

These are five diverse ways to implement the "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL. Each version employs different logic and function combinations, demonstrating flexibility in achieving the desired transformations.
