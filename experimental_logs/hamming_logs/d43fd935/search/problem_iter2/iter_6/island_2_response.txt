## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:**

* The single cell object '1' remains in the same location.
* A diagonal line of '6's is drawn from the object's location towards the bottom right.
* A 2x4 rectangle of '3's is drawn with its top left corner two cells below the object. 

**Input 1 -> Output 1:**

* The single cell object '8' is duplicated along a diagonal line extending to the top right.
* Every other cell on the rightmost column is filled with '8'. 
* A 2x2 square of '3's is drawn three cells to the right and down from the top right '8'.
* A '7' is placed two cells above each corner of the '3' square.

**Input 2 -> Output 2:**

* The single cell object '1' is duplicated above and below its original position.
* The object '1' is also duplicated to the rightmost column, maintaining the same row position.
* A 2x2 square of '3's is drawn with its top left corner two cells to the right and one cell down from the bottom '1'. 

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  c = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    obj = recolor(1, {(0, 0)})
    obj |= recolor(6, connect((0, 0), (4, 4)))
    obj |= recolor(3, shift(canvas(3, (2, 4)), (2, 3))) 
  elif I == 8:
    obj = recolor(8, connect((0, 0), (9, 9)))
    obj |= recolor(8, {(i, 9) for i in range(0, 10, 2)})
    obj |= recolor(3, shift(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (3, 6)))
    obj |= recolor(7, {(1, 5), (1, 8), (5, 5), (5, 8)})
  else:
    obj = recolor(1, {(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 9)})
    obj |= recolor(3, shift(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (6, 3)))
  return paint(c, shift(obj, (I, I)))
```

**Explanation:**

* This version focuses on generating the patterns relative to the input object's location, then shifting them to their final position.
* `connect` is used to draw the diagonal lines, `canvas` to create rectangular shapes, and explicit sets for individual cell placements. 

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  c = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    obj = recolor(1, {(0, 0)})
    obj |= recolor(6, {(i, i) for i in range(5)})
    obj |= recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 4) for j in range(3, 7)})
  elif I == 8:
    obj = recolor(8, {(i, 9 - i) for i in range(10)}) 
    obj |= recolor(8, {(i, 9) for i in range(0, 10, 2)})
    obj |= recolor(3, shift(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (3, 6)))
    obj |= recolor(7, outbox(recolor(1, {(3, 6), (3, 7)})))
  else:
    obj = recolor(1, {(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 9)})
    obj |= recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(6, 8) for j in range(3, 5)})
  return paint(c, shift(obj, (I, I)))
```

**Explanation:**

* Similar to Version 1, but uses set comprehension for diagonal lines and some rectangles, making the code more concise in places.
* `outbox` is utilized to efficiently generate the '7' pattern in the second output.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  c = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    obj = recolor(1, {(I, I)})
    obj |= recolor(6, connect((I, I), (I + 4, I + 4)))
    obj |= recolor(3, shift(canvas(3, (2, 4)), (I + 2, I + 3))) 
  elif I == 8:
    obj = recolor(8, connect((I, 9 - I), (I + 9, 9 - I)))
    obj |= recolor(8, {(i, 9) for i in range(I, I + 10, 2)})
    obj |= recolor(3, shift(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (I + 3, I + 6)))
    obj |= recolor(7, {(I + 1, I + 5), (I + 1, I + 8), (I + 5, I + 5), (I + 5, I + 8)})
  else:
    obj = recolor(1, {(I, I), (I + 1, I), (I, I + 9)})
    obj |= recolor(3, shift(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (I + 6, I + 3)))
  return paint(c, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

* This version directly incorporates the input value 'I' into calculations for object positions, eliminating the final `shift` operation. 
* This approach can be less readable but demonstrates a different way of utilizing the input value.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  c = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  obj = recolor(I, {(I, I)}) # Place the initial object based on input
  if I == 1:
    obj |= recolor(6, shoot((I, I), (1, 1))) # Diagonal line using 'shoot'
    obj |= recolor(3,  {(i, j) for i in range(I + 2, I + 4) for j in range(I + 3, I + 7)})
  elif I == 8:
    obj |= recolor(8, shoot((I, 9 - I), (1, -1))) 
    obj |= recolor(8,  {(i, 9) for i in range(I, I + 10, 2)})
    obj |= recolor(3, shift(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (I + 3, I + 6)))
    obj |= recolor(7, {(I + 1, I + 5), (I + 1, I + 8), (I + 5, I + 5), (I + 5, I + 8)})
  else:
    obj |= recolor(1, {(I + 1, I), (I, I + 9)})
    obj |= recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(I + 6, I + 8) for j in range(I + 3, I + 5)})
  return paint(c, obj)
```

**Explanation:**

* Builds upon the previous versions but introduces the `shoot` function for creating diagonal lines based on starting point and direction. 
* This demonstrates another approach to line generation.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  c = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    obj = paint(c, recolor(1, {(I, I)}))
    obj = paint(obj, recolor(6, connect((I, I), (I + 4, I + 4))))
    obj = paint(obj, recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(I + 2, I + 4) for j in range(I + 3, I + 7)}))
  elif I == 8:
    obj = paint(c, recolor(8, {(i, 9 - i) for i in range(I, I + 10)}))
    obj = paint(obj, recolor(8,  {(i, 9) for i in range(I, I + 10, 2)}))
    obj = paint(obj, recolor(3, shift(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (I + 3, I + 6))))
    obj = paint(obj, recolor(7, outbox(recolor(1, {(I + 3, I + 6), (I + 3, I + 7)}))))
  else:
    obj = paint(c, recolor(1, {(I, I), (I + 1, I), (I, I + 9)}))
    obj = paint(obj, recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(I + 6, I + 8) for j in range(I + 3, I + 5)}))
  return obj
```

**Explanation:**

* This version uses a sequential painting approach. It starts with a blank canvas and progressively paints each part of the pattern.
* Although less efficient, it showcases a different programming paradigm using DSL functions.

These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformations while using a variety of DSL functions. Each version offers a unique perspective on solving the problem and highlights the flexibility of the provided DSL.
