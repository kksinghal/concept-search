## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the described transformations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  
  if v == 1:
    O = paint(O, {(v, (0, 0)), (v, (9, 0)), (v, (9, 9))})
    O = paint(O, {(1, (i, 3)) for i in range(3, 8)})
    O = paint(O, {(6, (2, j)) for j in range(1, 9)})
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 6) for j in range(3, 5)})
  elif v == 8:
    O = paint(O, {(v, (6, 2)), (v, (7, 2))})
    O = paint(O, {(7, (i, i - 1)) for i in range(1, 9, 2)})
    O = paint(O, {(7, (i, 9 - i)) for i in range(0, 9, 2)})
    O = paint(O, {(7, (i, 2)) for i in range(3, 6)})
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(6, 9) for j in range(6, 8)})
  elif v == 2:
    O = paint(O, {(v, (0, 9)), (v, (4, 1)), (v, (9, 1))})
    O = paint(O, {(1, (i, 2)) for i in range(2, 7)})
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(4, 7) for j in range(6, 8)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Uses `canvas` for initialization and `paint` for placing digits at specific locations.
* Utilizes set comprehension for drawing lines and filling blocks with desired colors.
* Each branch of the `if` statement handles a different input digit.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  
  if v == 1:
    O = paint(O, {(v, (0, 0))})
    O = paint(O, shift({(v, (9, 0)), (v, (9, 9))}, (-9, 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(connect((0, 3), (4, 3)), (3, 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(connect((2, 0), (2, 7)), (0, 1)))
    O = fill(O, 3, backdrop(shift({(0, 0)}, (3, 3))))
  elif v == 8:
    O = paint(O, shift({(v, (0, 0)), (v, (1, 0))}, (6, 2)))
    O = paint(O, {(7, (i, i - 1)) for i in range(1, 9, 2)})
    O = paint(O, {(7, (i, 9 - i)) for i in range(0, 9, 2)})
    O = paint(O, shift(connect((0, 0), (2, 0)), (3, 2)))
    O = fill(O, 3, backdrop(shift({(0, 0)}, (6, 6))))
  elif v == 2:
    O = paint(O, shift({(v, (0, 9))}, (0, 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift({(v, (0, 0)), (v, (5, 0))}, (4, 1)))
    O = paint(O, shift(connect((0, 0), (4, 0)), (2, 2)))
    O = fill(O, 3, backdrop(shift({(0, 0)}, (4, 6))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Utilizes `shift` extensively to position elements relative to each other.
* Employs `connect` for drawing straight lines.
* Leverages `backdrop` for filling rectangular regions defined by a single-cell patch.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  if v == 1:
    O = paint(O, {(v, (0, 0)), (v, (9, 0)), (v, (9, 9))})
    O = paint(O, shift(hline({(0, 0)}), (3, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(vline({(0, 0)}), (2, 1)))
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 6) for j in range(3, 5)})
  elif v == 8:
    O = paint(O, {(v, (6, 2)), (v, (7, 2))})
    O = paint(O, {(7, (i, i - 1)) for i in range(1, 9, 2)})
    O = paint(O, {(7, (i, 9 - i)) for i in range(0, 9, 2)})
    O = paint(O, shift(hline({(0, 0)}), (4, 2)))
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(6, 9) for j in range(6, 8)})
  elif v == 2:
    O = paint(O, {(v, (0, 9)), (v, (4, 1)), (v, (9, 1))})
    O = paint(O, shift(vline({(0, 0)}), (2, 2)))
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(4, 7) for j in range(6, 8)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Uses `hline` and `vline` for creating horizontal and vertical lines respectively.
* Similar to Version 1, it relies on `paint` for placing digits and `fill` for blocks.
* Each `if` branch handles a different input digit and its corresponding transformation.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  if v == 1:
    O = paint(O, {(v, (0, 0))})
    O = paint(O, shift(hmirror({(v, (0, 0)), (v, (0, 9))}), (9, 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(connect((0, 0), (4, 0)), (3, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(connect((0, 0), (0, 7)), (2, 1)))
    O = fill(O, 3, backdrop(shift({(0, 0)}, (3, 3))))
  elif v == 8:
    O = paint(O, shift({(v, (0, 0)), (v, (1, 0))}, (6, 2)))
    O = paint(O, shift(dmirror({(7, (0, 0)), (7, (2, 2)), (7, (4, 4)), (7, (6, 6)), (7, (8, 8))}), (0, 1)))
    O = paint(O, shift(dmirror({(7, (0, 8)), (7, (2, 6)), (7, (4, 4)), (7, (6, 2)), (7, (8, 0))}), (0, 1)))
    O = paint(O, shift(connect((0, 0), (2, 0)), (3, 2)))
    O = fill(O, 3, backdrop(shift({(0, 0)}, (6, 6))))
  elif v == 2:
    O = paint(O, shift({(v, (0, 9))}, (0, 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(hmirror({(v, (0, 0)), (v, (5, 0))}), (4, 1)))
    O = paint(O, shift(connect((0, 0), (4, 0)), (2, 2)))
    O = fill(O, 3, backdrop(shift({(0, 0)}, (4, 6))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Employs mirroring using `hmirror` and `dmirror` to create symmetrical patterns.
* Similar to previous versions, it utilizes `shift`, `connect`, `backdrop`, and `fill` for positioning elements and filling regions.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  v = int(I[0][0])
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))

  if v == 1:
    O = paint(O, {(v, (0, 0))})
    O = paint(O, shift({(v, (0, 0)), (v, (0, 9))}, (9, 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(hline({(0, 0)}), (3, 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(vline({(0, 0)}), (2, 1)))
    O = paint(O, {(3, (i, j)) for i in range(3, 6) for j in range(3, 5)})
  elif v == 8:
    O = paint(O, shift({(v, (0, 0)), (v, (1, 0))}, (6, 2)))
    O = paint(O, {(7, (i, i - 1)) for i in range(1, 9, 2)})
    O = paint(O, {(7, (i, 9 - i)) for i in range(0, 9, 2)})
    O = paint(O, shift(hline({(0, 0)}), (4, 2)))
    O = paint(O, {(3, (i, j)) for i in range(6, 9) for j in range(6, 8)})
  elif v == 2:
    O = paint(O, shift({(v, (0, 9))}, (0, 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift({(v, (0, 0)), (v, (5, 0))}, (4, 1)))
    O = paint(O, shift(vline({(0, 0)}), (2, 2)))
    O = paint(O, {(3, (i, j)) for i in range(4, 7) for j in range(6, 8)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Combines elements from previous versions, using both `shift` and direct coordinate specification.
* Leverages `hline` and `vline` for line creation.
* Relies heavily on `paint` for both digit placement and filling blocks with desired colors.

These five versions offer diverse approaches to achieving the target transformation, each utilizing different combinations of DSL functions and demonstrating distinct logic flows.
