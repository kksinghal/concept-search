## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be drawing shapes based on the input digit, with specific colors and decorations:

**Input 1:**

* A shape resembling the digit '1' is drawn using color 1.
* The shape is decorated with color 3 forming two squares.
* Additional decorations are added using color 6.

**Input 8:**

* A shape resembling the digit '8' is drawn using colors 8 and 7 forming diagonals.
* A horizontal line is drawn using color 8.
* Two squares are filled with color 3.

**Input 2:**

* The digit '2' is drawn sparsely using color 1.
* Two squares are filled with color 3.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1:** (Inspired by Program_B's shape-based logic and Program_A's color switching)

```python
def solve_arc_task(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(4, i) for i in range(4, 9)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0), (9, 4)}))
    for i in range(2, 9, 3):
      for j in range(8):
        color = 3 if i < 5 else 6
        O = paint(O, recolor(color, {(i + (j // 4), 2 + j)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(i, 2) for i in range(9)}))
  elif I == 8:
    for i in range(1, 10):
      O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, i)}))
      O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i - 1, 9 - i)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, 6) for i in range(10)}))
    for i in range(2, 4):
      for j in range(5, 7):
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j)}))
  else: # I == 2
    for i, j in [(2, 0), (3, 2), (4, 4), (5, 6), (6, 8), (9, 0), (7, 2), (8, 4), (9, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4)]:
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, j)}))
    for i in range(6, 8):
      for j in range(6, 8):
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version explicitly draws each part of the shapes for each input digit using `recolor` and `paint`. 
* It iterates through specific coordinates to place the desired colors, closely mimicking the target output.

**Version 2:** (Focuses on identifying repeated patterns and using loops efficiently)

```python
def solve_arc_task(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, connect((4, 4), (4, 8))))  # Vertical line
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0), (9, 4)}))
    for i in range(3):
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, box({(2 + 3 * i, 2), (3 + 3 * i, 3)})))  # Squares
      O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(2 + 3 * i, 2 + 4 * i)}))  # Diagonal dots
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(i, 2) for i in range(9)}))  # Horizontal line
  elif I == 8:
    for i in range(1, 10):
      O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, i)}))
      O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i - 1, 9 - i)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, 6) for i in range(10)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(range(2, 4), range(5, 7))))  # Square
  else:  # I == 2
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, j) for i, j in [(2, 0), (3, 2), (4, 4), (5, 6), (6, 8), (9, 0), (7, 2), (8, 4), (9, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4)]}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(range(6, 8), range(6, 8))))  # Square
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version identifies repeating patterns like squares and lines and uses functions like `connect`, `box`, and `product` to draw them efficiently.
* It aims to reduce redundant code by using loops and set comprehensions.

**Version 3:** (Utilizes relative positioning and shifting for drawing elements)

```python
def solve_arc_task(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    one = recolor(1, {(0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (-4, 0), (5, 4)})
    O = paint(O, shift(one, (4, 0)))  # Shifting the '1' shape
    for i in range(3):
      square = recolor(3 if i < 2 else 6, box({(0, 0), (1, 1)}))
      O = paint(O, shift(square, (2 + 3 * i, 2 + 4 * i)))  # Shifting squares and dots
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(i, 2) for i in range(9)}))  # Horizontal line
  elif I == 8:
    eight = recolor(8, {(i, i) for i in range(9)}) | recolor(7, {(i, 8 - i) for i in range(9)})
    O = paint(O, shift(eight, (1, 1)))  # Shifting the '8' shape
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, 6) for i in range(10)}))  # Horizontal line
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(range(2, 4), range(5, 7))))  # Square
  else:  # I == 2
    two = recolor(1, {(i, j) for i, j in [(2, 0), (3, 2), (4, 4), (5, 6), (6, 8), (9, 0), (7, 2), (8, 4), (9, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4)]})
    O = paint(O, two)
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(range(6, 8), range(6, 8))))  # Square
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version defines basic shapes like the '1' and '8' at the origin.
* It then utilizes the `shift` function to move these shapes to their correct positions on the canvas.

**Version 4:** (Leverages object-oriented thinking by defining reusable object patterns)

```python
def square_pattern(color, top_left):
  return recolor(color, box({(0, 0), (1, 1)}))

def solve_arc_task(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, connect((4, 4), (4, 8))))  # Vertical line
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0), (9, 4)}))
    for i in range(3):
      O = paint(O, shift(square_pattern(3 if i < 2 else 6, (0, 0)), (2 + 3 * i, 2 + 4 * i)))  # Shifting squares and dots
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(i, 2) for i in range(9)}))  # Horizontal line
  elif I == 8:
    diagonal_one = recolor(8, {(i, i) for i in range(9)})
    diagonal_two = recolor(7, {(i, 8 - i) for i in range(9)})
    O = paint(O, shift(diagonal_one, (1, 1)))  # Shifting the first diagonal
    O = paint(O, shift(diagonal_two, (1, 1)))  # Shifting the second diagonal
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, 6) for i in range(10)}))  # Horizontal line
    O = paint(O, square_pattern(3, (2, 5)))  # Square
  else:  # I == 2
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, j) for i, j in [(2, 0), (3, 2), (4, 4), (5, 6), (6, 8), (9, 0), (7, 2), (8, 4), (9, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4)]}))
    O = paint(O, square_pattern(3, (6, 6)))  # Square
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* A `square_pattern` function is introduced to encapsulate the logic of creating a 2x2 square with a specific color and top-left corner.
* This promotes code reusability and readability.


**Version 5:** (Emphasizes conditional color assignment within loops)

```python
def solve_arc_task(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    for i in range(10):
      for j in range(10):
        if i == 4 and 4 <= j <= 8:
          O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, j)}))
        elif (i, j) in [(0, 0), (9, 4)]:
          O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, j)}))
        elif 2 <= i <= 8 and i % 3 != 1 and 0 <= j <= 7:
          color = 3 if i < 5 else 6
          if j % 4 == 2:
            O = paint(O, recolor(color, {(i, j)}))
        elif i == 2 and 0 <= j <= 8:
          O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(i, j)}))
  elif I == 8:
    for i in range(10):
      for j in range(10):
        if i == j and i != 0:
          O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, j)}))
        elif i + j == 9 and i != 0:
          O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, j)}))
        elif i == 6:
          O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, j)}))
        elif 2 <= i <= 3 and 5 <= j <= 6:
          O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j)}))
  else:  # I == 2
    for i in range(10):
      for j in range(10):
        if (i, j) in [(2, 0), (3, 2), (4, 4), (5, 6), (6, 8), (9, 0), (7, 2), (8, 4), (9, 6), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4)]:
          O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, j)}))
        elif 6 <= i <= 7 and 6 <= j <= 7:
          O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version utilizes nested loops to iterate through all grid cells. 
* It applies conditional statements within the loop to determine the color of each cell based on its coordinates and the input digit. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to solving the given transformation task. They showcase diverse uses of DSL functions, highlighting the flexibility and creativity possible in program synthesis.
