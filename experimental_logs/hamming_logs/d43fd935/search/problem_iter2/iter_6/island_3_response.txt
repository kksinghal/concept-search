## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to follow these rules for each input digit:

* **Digit 1:**  Creates a horizontal line of '1's of length 5, centered horizontally on the input '1's location. It adds two '3's directly above the leftmost two '1's. It also strategically places a '6' on the grid, always maintaining a diagonal relationship with the leftmost '3'. The '6' appears to move further away diagonally as the input '1' shifts downwards. 
* **Digit 8:** Generates a diagonal line of '8's starting from a position slightly offset from the input '8'.  Two '3's are placed diagonally adjacent to the top-right of each '8'. Additionally, four '7's are positioned at the corners and center of the grid edges.
* **Digit 2:**  Draws a vertical line of '1's of length 5, centered vertically on the input '1's location. A pair of '3's is placed horizontally adjacent and to the right of the middle '1'. A final '1' is added in the bottom row, positioned directly below the input '1'.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = I[0][0]
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  center_i = 5 if v==2 else 4
  center_j = 4 if v==1 else 5

  if v == 1:
    base_obj = {(1, (center_i, center_j))}
    O = paint(O, base_obj)
    for i in range(1, 3):
      O = paint(O, shift(base_obj, (0, i)))
      O = paint(O, shift(base_obj, (0, -i)))
    O = paint(O, {(3, (center_i-1, center_j-2)), (3, (center_i-1, center_j-1))})
    O = paint(O, {(6, (center_i-2, center_j-3))})
  elif v == 8:
    base_obj = {(8, (2, 3))}
    for i in range(6):
      O = paint(O, shift(base_obj, (i, i)))
      O = paint(O, {(3, (2+i, 4+i)), (3, (2+i, 5+i))})
    O = paint(O, {(7, (0, 1)), (7, (3, 3)), (7, (8, 0)), (7, (9, 9))})
  else:
    base_obj = {(1, (center_i, center_j))}
    for i in range(1, 3):
      O = paint(O, shift(base_obj, (i, 0)))
      O = paint(O, shift(base_obj, (-i, 0)))
    O = paint(O, {(3, (center_i, center_j+1)), (3, (center_i, center_j+2))})
    O = paint(O, {(1, (9, center_j))})

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Initialization:** Creates a 10x10 canvas `O` filled with zeros and identifies the center points for digit-specific patterns.
* **Digit 1:** 
    * Creates a base object '1' at the center.
    * Generates the horizontal line by shifting and painting the base object.
    * Places the '3's above the line.
    * Positions the '6' diagonally.
* **Digit 8:**
    * Creates a base '8' object.
    * Generates the diagonal line and the '3's by shifting and painting.
    * Places the four '7's at strategic edge locations.
* **Digit 2:**
    * Creates a base '1' object at the center.
    * Generates the vertical line by shifting and painting.
    * Places the '3's to the right of the middle '1'.
    * Adds the final '1' in the bottom row.

**Note:** This version focuses on code clarity and structure. Subsequent versions will explore alternative DSL function combinations and logic to achieve the same output.
