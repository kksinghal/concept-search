## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

1. **Placement:** The input digit '1' is placed at positions (0,0) and (9,4) on a 10x10 grid.
2. **Shape Generation:**  A '6' shape is drawn, starting at (1,8) and moving down-left diagonally for 4 steps, then straight down for 3 steps. A 2x2 square of '3's is placed with its top-left corner at (3,2).

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

1. **Placement:** The input digit '8' is placed along the main diagonal of the grid.
2. **Shape Generation:** A '7' shape is drawn, with its top at (0,1), extending down to (9,6) and having a horizontal arm extending to the right at (8,6).  Two 2x2 squares of '3's are placed, one with its top-left corner at (2,5) and the other at (2,6).

**Input 2 to Output 2:**

1. **Placement:** The input digit '1' is placed at specific positions on the grid: (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,9), (9,1).
2. **Shape Generation:** A 2x2 square of '3's is placed with its top-left corner at (6,4).


## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" that perform the desired transformation. 

**Program Version 1:** (Using conditional logic and shape drawing)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    if I == 1:
        O = paint(O, {(I, (0, 0)), (I, (9, 4))})
        O = paint(O, {(6, (i, 8 - i)) for i in range(4)})
        O = paint(O, {(6, (i, 4)) for i in range(4, 7)})
        O = fill(O, 3, {(3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3)})
    elif I == 8:
        O = paint(O, {(I, (i, i)) for i in range(10)})
        O = paint(O, {(7, (i, 1)) for i in range(9)})
        O = paint(O, {(7, (8, i)) for i in range(2, 7)})
        O = fill(O, 3, {(2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6)})
        O = fill(O, 3, {(2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 7), (3, 8)})
    elif I == 2:
        O = paint(O, {(I, (1, 5)), (I, (2, 4)), (I, (2, 5)), (I, (3, 5)), (I, (4, 5)), (I, (5, 5)), (I, (5, 9)), (I, (9, 1))})
        O = fill(O, 3, {(6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 4), (7, 5)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **Canvas:** A 10x10 canvas of '0's is created.
- **Conditional Placement:** The input digit is placed at specific locations based on its value.
- **Shape Drawing:** The additional shapes ('6', '7', squares of '3') are drawn using `paint` and `fill` functions with hardcoded coordinates.

**Program Version 2:** (Using shift and normalized object placement)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    if I == 1:
        O = paint(O, {(I, (0, 0)), (I, (9, 4))})
        six = normalize({(6, (i, 3 - i)) for i in range(4)})
        six = combine(six, {(6, (i, 0)) for i in range(3, 6)})
        O = paint(O, shift(six, (1, 5)))
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(2, 4)}) 
    elif I == 8:
        O = paint(O, {(I, (i, i)) for i in range(10)})
        seven = normalize({(7, (i, 0)) for i in range(9)}) 
        seven = combine(seven, {(7, (8, i)) for i in range(1, 6)})
        O = paint(O, shift(seven, (0, 1)))
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 4) for j in range(5, 7)})
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 4) for j in range(7, 9)})
    elif I == 2:
        O = paint(O, {(I, (1, 5)), (I, (2, 4)), (I, (2, 5)), (I, (3, 5)), (I, (4, 5)), (I, (5, 5)), (I, (5, 9)), (I, (9, 1))})
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(6, 8) for j in range(4, 6)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version defines shapes like 'six' and 'seven' using `normalize` and `combine` for better readability.
- `shift` is used to position these normalized shapes on the canvas.

**Program Version 3:** (Using `cbdidcjihjccejeeifdbiddfbeehajfe` for line drawing)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    if I == 1:
        O = paint(O, {(I, (0, 0)), (I, (9, 4))})
        O = cbdidcjihjccejeeifdbiddfbeehajfe(O, 6, (1, 8), 4, (-1, -1))  # Diagonal line of '6's
        O = cbdidcjihjccejeeifdbiddfbeehajfe(O, 6, (4, 4), 3, (1, 0))   # Vertical line of '6's
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(2, 4)}) 
    elif I == 8:
        O = paint(O, {(I, (i, i)) for i in range(10)})
        O = cbdidcjihjccejeeifdbiddfbeehajfe(O, 7, (0, 1), 9, (1, 0))   # Horizontal line of '7's
        O = cbdidcjihjccejeeifdbiddfbeehajfe(O, 7, (8, 2), 5, (0, 1))   # Vertical line of '7's
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 4) for j in range(5, 7)})
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 4) for j in range(7, 9)})
    elif I == 2:
        O = paint(O, {(I, (1, 5)), (I, (2, 4)), (I, (2, 5)), (I, (3, 5)), (I, (4, 5)), (I, (5, 5)), (I, (5, 9)), (I, (9, 1))})
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(6, 8) for j in range(4, 6)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version introduces a new function `cbdidcjihjccejeeifdbiddfbeehajfe` (presumably defined elsewhere) to efficiently draw lines of digits. This makes the code more concise and potentially more efficient.


**Program Version 4:** (Combining shapes using set operations)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    if I == 1:
        O = paint(O, {(I, (0, 0)), (I, (9, 4))})
        diag_six = {(6, (i, 8 - i)) for i in range(4)}
        vert_six = {(6, (i, 4)) for i in range(4, 7)}
        six = diag_six | vert_six # Combining the two parts of the '6' shape
        O = paint(O, six)
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(2, 4)}) 
    elif I == 8:
        O = paint(O, {(I, (i, i)) for i in range(10)})
        horiz_seven = {(7, (i, 1)) for i in range(9)}
        vert_seven = {(7, (8, i)) for i in range(2, 7)}
        seven = horiz_seven | vert_seven  # Combining the two parts of the '7' shape
        O = paint(O, seven)
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 4) for j in range(5, 7)})
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(2, 4) for j in range(7, 9)})
    elif I == 2:
        O = paint(O, {(I, (1, 5)), (I, (2, 4)), (I, (2, 5)), (I, (3, 5)), (I, (4, 5)), (I, (5, 5)), (I, (5, 9)), (I, (9, 1))})
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i in range(6, 8) for j in range(4, 6)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version utilizes set operations like union (`|`) to combine different parts of a shape, improving code clarity.

**Program Version 5:** (Loop-based approach for repetitive patterns)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    if I == 1:
        O = paint(O, {(I, (0, 0)), (I, (9, 4))})
        for i in range(4):
            O = paint(O, {(6, (1 + i, 8 - i))})  # Diagonal line of '6's
        for i in range(3):
            O = paint(O, {(6, (4 + i, 4))})   # Vertical line of '6's
        for i in range(2):
            for j in range(2):
                O = paint(O, {(3, (3 + i, 2 + j))}) # Square of '3's
    elif I == 8:
        O = paint(O, {(I, (i, i)) for i in range(10)})
        for i in range(9):
            O = paint(O, {(7, (i, 1))})   # Horizontal line of '7's
        for i in range(5):
            O = paint(O, {(7, (8, 2 + i))})   # Vertical line of '7's
        for k in range(2):
            for i in range(2):
                for j in range(2):
                    O = paint(O, {(3, (2 + i, 5 + j + 2*k))}) # Two squares of '3's
    elif I == 2:
        O = paint(O, {(I, (1, 5)), (I, (2, 4)), (I, (2, 5)), (I, (3, 5)), (I, (4, 5)), (I, (5, 5)), (I, (5, 9)), (I, (9, 1))})
        for i in range(2):
            for j in range(2):
                O = paint(O, {(3, (6 + i, 4 + j))}) # Square of '3's
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version utilizes loops to handle repetitive patterns in the shapes, making the code more compact and potentially easier to understand.


Each of these five program versions offers a different approach to achieve the same output, demonstrating diversity in logic and function utilization within the DSL. You can choose the version that best suits your coding style and efficiency preferences.
