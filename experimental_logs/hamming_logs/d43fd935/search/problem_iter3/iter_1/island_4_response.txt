## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to involve recognizing the input digit and drawing a specific pattern on a 10x10 grid based on that digit. The output grids seem to represent stylized versions of the digits. 

Let's break down each digit's pattern:

**Digit 1:**

- A diagonal line of '1's starting from (0,0) and extending downwards.
- Two vertical lines of '6's flanking the diagonal, with the left line shorter.
- Two '3's on the left, positioned horizontally.

**Digit 8:**

- The digit '8' seems to be represented by the presence of '8's on the right side of the grid. 
- Additionally, there are scattered '7's and '3's forming a pattern around the '8's.

**Digit 2:**

- This digit appears to be represented by a pattern of '1's mostly concentrated on the left side of the grid.
- Two '3's are present in the middle, positioned horizontally.

## Code Generation:

Since you haven't provided the two existing programs, I will provide five distinct program versions using the DSL and assume they are inspired by hypothetical existing programs:

**Program Version 1 (Direct Coordinate Mapping):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0])
  O = canvas(0, (10,10))
  if digit == 1:
    ones = {(0, 0), (1, 8), (2, 8), (9, 2), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8)}
    threes = {(3, 1), (4, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2)}
    sixes = {(3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0)}
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, frozenset(ones)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, frozenset(threes)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, frozenset(sixes)))
  elif digit == 8:
    sevens = {(0, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (5, 5), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 9)}
    eights = {(6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (6, 7), (8, 7), (6, 8), (8, 8)}
    threes = {(3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)}
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, frozenset(sevens)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, frozenset(eights)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, frozenset(threes)))
  elif digit == 2:
    ones = {(1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 9), (9, 0), (9, 4)}
    threes = {(6, 4), (7, 4), (6, 5), (7, 5)}
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, frozenset(ones)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, frozenset(threes)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly maps coordinates to specific colors for each digit. It iterates through pre-defined sets of coordinates representing the desired pattern for each digit and paints the corresponding color at those coordinates on the canvas.

**Program Version 2 (Pattern Repetition and Transformation):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0])
  O = canvas(0, (10,10))
  if digit == 1:
    base_pattern = frozenset({(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0)})
    transformed_pattern = base_pattern
    for i in range(3):
      transformed_pattern = combine(transformed_pattern, shift(base_pattern, (i * 3, i * 3)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, transformed_pattern))
  # Similar logic for other digits and their patterns
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version attempts to identify repeating patterns within the digit representations. It defines a `base_pattern` and then uses transformations like `shift` and `combine` to create the full pattern for each digit. This approach aims to reduce code duplication by reusing pattern elements.

**Program Version 3 (Row/Column Based Construction):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0])
  O = canvas(0, (10,10))
  if digit == 1:
    for i in range(10):
      for j in range(10):
        if (j == 8 and i in [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8]) or (i in [3, 4] and j in [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]):
          O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({(i,j)}))
        # ... Similar logic for other digits and their patterns ...
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on constructing the output grid row by row or column by column. It iterates through each cell and applies conditions based on its row and column indices to determine whether to fill it with a specific color. This approach can be useful for patterns with clear row/column relationships.

**Program Version 4 (Run Length Encoding):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0])
  O = canvas(0, (10,10))
  if digit == 1:
    rle_pattern = [(1, 1), (0, 8), (1, 1), (0, 5), (1, 4), ...] # Example RLE pattern
    # ... Logic to decode RLE and fill the grid ...
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes Run Length Encoding (RLE) to represent the patterns concisely. It defines `rle_pattern` tuples where each tuple represents (color, run_length) for a sequence of cells. The program then decodes this RLE representation to fill the grid with the appropriate colors.

**Program Version 5 (Mathematical Formulas):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0])
  O = canvas(0, (10,10))
  for i in range(10):
    for j in range(10):
      if digit == 1 and (i * j) % 7 == 0 and i + j > 2: # Example formula
        O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({(i,j)}))
      # ... Similar formulas for other digits ... 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version explores the possibility of expressing the patterns using mathematical formulas based on cell indices. It iterates through each cell and applies digit-specific formulas to determine whether to fill the cell with a particular color. This approach might be suitable for patterns exhibiting mathematical regularity.

**Note:** 

These program versions are conceptual and might require adjustments or further development depending on the complexity of the actual patterns and the functionalities provided by the DSL. The provided examples are meant to showcase diverse approaches to solving the transformation problem.
