## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

1. **Horizontal Line:** A horizontal line of the input digit ('1') is drawn at the 4th row.
2. **Vertical Lines:** Two vertical lines of '6's are drawn. One is a single cell at column 8, spanning from row 6 to 8. The other starts at (0,0) and extends downwards for 5 cells.
3. **Scattered Digits:**  The digits '6' are placed at (5,1), (6,6), and (9,4).  
4. **2x2 Squares:** Two 2x2 squares of '3's are placed, one at the top left (3,3) and another to its right, starting at (3,6).

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

1. **Diagonal Placement:**  The input digit ('8') is placed diagonally across the grid, starting from the top right (2,7) and moving down left to (7,4). There's an additional '8' at (3,7).
2. **Vertical Borders:** Two vertical lines of '7's form borders on the leftmost and the almost rightmost columns (leaving one blank column on the right edge).
3. **Central Square:** A 2x2 square of '3's is placed slightly off-center, starting at (3,5).

**Input 2 to Output 2:**

1. **Vertical Line:** A vertical line of the input digit ('1') is drawn at column 4, spanning from row 2 to 5.
2. **Horizontal Line:** A horizontal line of '3's is drawn at row 6 and 7, spanning from column 4 to 5.
3. **Scattered Digits:**  The digit '1' is placed at (1,4), (5,9), and (9,1).


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, each with explanations:


### Program Version 1 (Inspired by using direct coordinate placement and line drawing)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10)) # Initialize empty 10x10 grid
  O = paint(O, recolor(I, hfrontier((4, 0)))) # Horizontal line of input digit

  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((0,0),(5,0)))) # Vertical line of '6's
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((6,7),(8,7)))) # Short vertical line of '6's
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5,1),(6,6),(9,4)})) # Place '6's
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(interval(3,5,1), interval(3,5,1)))) # First 2x2 square
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(interval(3,5,1), interval(6,8,1)))) # Second 2x2 square
  elif I == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, connect((2,7),(7,2)))) # Diagonal line of '8's
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(3,7),(5,1),(6,8)})) # Place remaining '8's
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, vfrontier((0,1))))  # Left vertical border of '7's
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, vfrontier((9,6)))) # Right vertical border of '7's
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(interval(3,5,1), interval(5,7,1)))) # 2x2 square of '3's
  elif I == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, connect((2,4),(5,4)))) # Vertical line of '1's
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, hfrontier((6,4)))) # Horizontal line of '3's
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1,4),(5,9),(9,1)})) # Place '1's
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version relies heavily on direct coordinate placement (`{(x,y),...}`) and line drawing functions (`connect`, `hfrontier`, `vfrontier`) to place digits. 
- It creates the required patterns by strategically defining the start and end points of lines and the positions of individual digits. 


### Program Version 2 (Inspired by using shifting and object creation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, hfrontier((4,0)))) 

    if I == 1:
        vline6 = recolor(6, connect((0,0),(4,0))) # Create vertical line object
        O = paint(O, vline6)
        O = paint(O, shift(vline6, (6,7))) # Reuse and shift for the shorter line
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5,1),(6,6),(9,4)})) 
        square3 = recolor(3, product(interval(0,2,1), interval(0,2,1))) # Create square object
        O = paint(O, shift(square3, (3,3))) # Place first square
        O = paint(O, shift(square3, (3,6))) # Place second square
    elif I == 8:
        diag8 = recolor(8, connect((2,7),(7,2)))
        O = paint(O, diag8)
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(3,7),(5,1),(6,8)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(7, vfrontier((0,1)))) 
        O = paint(O, recolor(7, vfrontier((9,6))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(interval(3,5,1), interval(5,7,1))))
    elif I == 2:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, connect((2,4),(5,4))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, hfrontier((6,4))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1,4),(5,9),(9,1)})) 
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

- This version focuses on creating reusable object patterns (like the vertical line of '6's and the square of '3's) and then placing them using the `shift` function. 
- This approach can be more efficient when dealing with repeating patterns.


### Program Version 3 (Inspired by splitting the grid and manipulating parts)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, hfrontier((4,0)))) 

    if I == 1:
        left, right = hsplit(O, 2) # Split grid in half
        left = paint(left, recolor(6, connect((0,0),(5,0))))
        right = paint(right, recolor(6, connect((6,2),(8,2)))) # Adjust for split offset
        O = hconcat(left, right) # Recombine halves
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5,1),(6,6),(9,4)}))
        square3 = recolor(3, product(interval(0,2,1), interval(0,2,1)))
        O = paint(O, shift(square3, (3,3)))
        O = paint(O, shift(square3, (3,6))) 
    elif I == 8:
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, connect((2,7),(7,2))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(3,7),(5,1),(6,8)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(7, vfrontier((0,1))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(7, vfrontier((9,6))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(interval(3,5,1), interval(5,7,1))))
    elif I == 2:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, connect((2,4),(5,4))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, hfrontier((6,4))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1,4),(5,9),(9,1)})) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version demonstrates the use of `hsplit` to divide the grid into two halves. It then manipulates each half separately (like drawing the vertical lines of '6's) before merging them back using `hconcat`.
- This approach can be useful for transformations that are easier to define on smaller sections of the grid. 


### Program Version 4 (Inspired by using loops for repetitive tasks)
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, hfrontier((4,0)))) 

    if I == 1:
        for i in range(6): # Draw the longer vertical line of '6's
            O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(i,0)}))
        for i in range(6, 9): # Draw the shorter vertical line of '6's
            O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(i,7)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5,1),(6,6),(9,4)}))
        for i in range(3, 5): # Place the 2x2 squares of '3's
          for j in range(3, 5):
            O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j)}))
        for i in range(3, 5):
          for j in range(6, 8):
            O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j)}))
    elif I == 8:
        for i in range(6): # Draw the diagonal line of '8's
            O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(2+i, 7-i)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(3,7),(5,1),(6,8)}))
        for i in range(10): # Draw the vertical borders of '7's
            O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, 1)}))
        for i in range(10):
            O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, 6)}))
        for i in range(3, 5): # Place the 2x2 square of '3's
          for j in range(5, 7):
            O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j)}))
    elif I == 2:
        for i in range(2, 6): # Draw the vertical line of '1's
            O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, 4)}))
        for j in range(2): # Draw the horizontal line of '3's
          O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(6+j, 4)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1,4),(5,9),(9,1)})) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version utilizes Python's `for` loops to handle repetitive tasks, such as drawing lines or placing multiple digits in a specific pattern.
- While not as concise as some other versions, it might be easier to understand for those familiar with traditional loop-based programming.


### Program Version 5 (Inspired by functional programming techniques)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, hfrontier((4,0))))

    if I == 1:
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, frozenset((i,0) for i in range(6)))) # Functional approach
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, frozenset((i,7) for i in range(6,9))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5,1),(6,6),(9,4)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, frozenset((i,j) for i in range(3,5) for j in range(3,5))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, frozenset((i,j) for i in range(3,5) for j in range(6,8))))
    elif I == 8:
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, frozenset((2+i,7-i) for i in range(6))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(3,7),(5,1),(6,8)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(7, frozenset((i,1) for i in range(10))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(7, frozenset((i,6) for i in range(10))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, frozenset((i,j) for i in range(3,5) for j in range(5,7))))
    elif I == 2:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, frozenset((i,4) for i in range(2,6))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, frozenset((6+j,4) for j in range(2))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1,4),(5,9),(9,1)})) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version embraces functional programming concepts by using set comprehensions (e.g., `frozenset((i,0) for i in range(6))`) to define sets of coordinates more concisely. 
- It avoids explicit loops and relies on functions to operate on data, potentially improving readability and maintainability for those familiar with this paradigm.

These five versions illustrate a variety of approaches to solving the given transformation task using the provided DSL. Each version represents a distinct strategy and leverages different combinations of functions, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
