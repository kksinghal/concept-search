## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single digit and paints a specific pattern associated with that digit onto a 10x10 canvas.

**Input 1:**

* A "1" is drawn at the top left and bottom center.
* A diagonal line of "6"s extends from (2,2) to (8,8). 
* Two "3"s are placed in a vertical line, starting two cells to the right and one cell down from the top left "1".
* Additional "6"s and a "1" are strategically placed to complete the pattern.

**Input 8:**

* A "7" is placed in each corner and forms a horizontal line at the top.
* A diagonal line of "7"s extends from the bottom right corner towards the top left.
* An "8" is placed one cell to the right and one cell down from the top left corner.
* Three more "8"s form a horizontal line starting one cell to the right of the previous "8".
* Two "3"s are placed in a vertical line, one cell down from the rightmost "8" on the horizontal line.
*  Additional "8"s are strategically placed to complete the pattern.

**Input 2:**

*  A "1" is drawn in each corner.
*  A vertical line of "1"s extends from the top center "1" downwards.
*  Two "3"s are placed in a horizontal line, centered four rows from the bottom.
*  Additional "1"s are strategically placed to complete the pattern.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:** Using shifted base patterns and `paint`

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    digit = int(I)  # Assuming input is already a single digit string
    O = canvas(0, (10,10))
    if digit == 1:
        one_top_left = recolor(1, {(0, 0)})
        one_bottom_center = recolor(1, {(9, 4)})
        six_diagonal = recolor(6, {(i, i) for i in range(2, 9)})
        three_vertical = recolor(3, {(3,1),(4,1)})
        six_additional = recolor(6, {(7, 0), (7, 2), (6, 1), (5, -1), (4, -3)})

        O = paint(O, one_top_left)
        O = paint(O, one_bottom_center)
        O = paint(O, six_diagonal)
        O = paint(O, three_vertical)
        O = paint(O, shift(three_vertical, (0, 1)))
        O = paint(O, six_additional)
    elif digit == 8:
        seven_corner = recolor(7, {(0, 0)})
        seven_top_line = recolor(7, {(i, 0) for i in range(1, 10)}) 
        eight_top = recolor(8, {(1, 1)})
        eight_horizontal = recolor(8, {(i, 2) for i in range(2, 5)})
        three_vertical = recolor(3, {(4, 3), (4, 4)})
        eight_additional = recolor(8, {(1, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (2, 7), (4, 7), (2, 8), (4, 8)})

        O = paint(O, seven_corner)
        O = paint(O, hmirror(seven_corner))
        O = paint(O, vmirror(seven_corner))
        O = paint(O, rot180(seven_corner))
        O = paint(O, seven_top_line)
        O = paint(O, eight_top)
        O = paint(O, eight_horizontal)
        O = paint(O, three_vertical)
        O = paint(O, eight_additional)
    elif digit == 2:
        one_corner = recolor(1, {(0, 0)})
        one_vertical = recolor(1, {(i, 4) for i in range(2, 6)})
        three_horizontal = recolor(3, {(6, 3), (7, 3)})
        one_additional = recolor(1, {(1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4), (8, 0), (8, 4), (9, 9)})

        O = paint(O, one_corner)
        O = paint(O, hmirror(one_corner))
        O = paint(O, vmirror(one_corner))
        O = paint(O, rot180(one_corner))
        O = paint(O, one_vertical)
        O = paint(O, three_horizontal)
        O = paint(O, shift(three_horizontal, (0, 1)))
        O = paint(O, one_additional)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Digit Extraction:** The input `I`, assumed to be a single-digit string, is converted to an integer.
2.  **Canvas Initialization:** An empty 10x10 canvas `O` is created, filled with zeros.
3.  **Pattern Generation:** 
    *   Base patterns for each digit are defined using `recolor`.
    *   Functions like `shift`, `hmirror`, `vmirror`, and `rot180` are used to create variations and position these patterns correctly on the canvas.
4.  **Canvas Painting:** The `paint` function draws the generated patterns onto the canvas `O`.
5.  **Output:** The final canvas `O` is returned as output.

**Version 2:** Utilizing loops and conditional painting

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    digit = int(I)
    O = canvas(0, (10,10))
    if digit == 1:
        for i in range(10):
            for j in range(10):
                if i == j and i >= 2:
                    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(i, j)}))
                if (i == 3 or i == 4) and (j == 1 or j == 2):
                    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j)}))
                if (i == 0 and j == 0) or (i == 9 and j == 4) or (i in [4, 5, 6] and j == -i + 9):
                    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, j)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(7, 0), (7, 2)}))
    elif digit == 8:
        for i in range(10):
            for j in range(10):
                if i == 0 and j in [1, 9] or i == 9 and j in [0, 9] or j == 0 and i in [7, 8]:
                    O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, j)}))
                if i == j and i >= 5:
                    O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, j)}))
                if (i == 3 and j in [4, 5]) or (j == 5 and i in [3, 5]):
                    O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, j)}))
                if (i == 1 and j == 5) or (i in range(2, 6) and j == 6) or (i in [2, 4] and j in [7, 8]):
                    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, j)}))
                if (i in [3, 4, 5] and j == 6) or (i in [4, 5] and j == 7) or (i == 6 and j == 8):
                    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j)}))
    elif digit == 2:
        for i in range(10):
            for j in range(10):
                if (i == 0 and j == 0) or (i == 9 and j == 0) or (i == 0 and j == 9) or (i == 9 and j == 9):
                    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, j)}))
                if j == 4 and i in range(2, 6):
                    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, j)}))
                if (i in [6, 7] and j in [3, 4]):
                    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j)}))
                if (i == 1 and j == 2) or (i == 1 and j == 4) or (i == 2 and j == 4) or (i == 8 and j == 0) or (i == 8 and j == 4):
                    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, j)}))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Digit Extraction:** The input `I` is converted to an integer.
2.  **Canvas Initialization:** An empty 10x10 canvas `O` is created.
3.  **Pattern Generation:**
    *   Nested loops iterate over each cell of the canvas.
    *   Conditional statements check the cell's coordinates and paint the appropriate color based on the digit and position.
4.  **Output:** The canvas `O` with the painted pattern is returned.

**Version 3:** Leveraging symmetry and mirroring

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    digit = int(I)
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    if digit == 1:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0), (9, 4)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(3, 1), (4, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2)}))
        for i in range(2, 9):
            O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(i, i)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(7, 0), (7, 2)}))
    elif digit == 8:
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(1, 5), (6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (6, 7), (8, 7), (6, 8), (8, 8)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(0, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (5, 5), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 9)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)}))
    elif digit == 2:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 1), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (9, 0), (9, 4), (9, 9)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(6, 4), (7, 4), (6, 5), (7, 5)}))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Digit Extraction:** Convert input `I` to an integer.
2. **Canvas Initialization:** Create an empty 10x10 canvas `O`.
3. **Pattern Generation:** 
    * Define base patterns for each digit using `recolor`.
    * Utilize `hmirror`, `vmirror`, `rot180` to exploit symmetry and reduce redundant code.
4. **Canvas Painting:** Draw patterns onto canvas `O` using `paint`.
5. **Output:** Return the modified canvas `O`.

**Version 4:**  Constructing patterns from building blocks

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    digit = int(I)
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    if digit == 1:
        line = recolor(6, {(i, i) for i in range(2, 9)})
        O = paint(O, line)
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0), (9, 4)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(3, 1), (4, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(7, 0), (7, 2), (6, 1), (5, -1), (4, -3)}))
    elif digit == 8:
        top_line = recolor(7, {(i, 0) for i in range(10)})
        diag_line = recolor(7, {(i, i) for i in range(5, 10)})
        O = paint(O, top_line)
        O = paint(O, diag_line)
        O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(0, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (5, 5), (9, 9)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(1, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (2, 7), (4, 7), (2, 8), (4, 8)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)}))
    elif digit == 2:
        vert_line = recolor(1, {(i, 4) for i in range(2, 6)})
        O = paint(O, vert_line)
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0), (9, 0), (0, 9), (9, 9), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4), (8, 0), (8, 4)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(6, 3), (7, 3), (6, 4), (7, 4)}))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Digit Extraction:** Convert input `I` to an integer.
2. **Canvas Initialization:** Create an empty 10x10 canvas `O`.
3. **Pattern Generation:**
    * Define reusable building blocks (lines, diagonals) using `recolor`.
    * Combine building blocks and additional elements to form complete patterns.
4. **Canvas Painting:** Draw patterns onto canvas `O` using `paint`.
5. **Output:** Return the modified canvas `O`.


**Version 5:** Employing `fill` and `crop` for specific areas

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    digit = int(I)
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    if digit == 1:
        O = fill(O, 6, {(i, i) for i in range(2, 9)})
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0), (9, 4)}))
        O = fill(O, 3, crop(O, (3, 1), (2, 2)))
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(7, 0), (7, 2), (6, 1), (5, -1), (4, -3)}))
    elif digit == 8:
        O = fill(O, 7, {(i, 0) for i in range(10)})
        O = fill(O, 7, {(i, i) for i in range(5, 10)})
        O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(0, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (5, 5), (9, 9)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(1, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (2, 7), (4, 7), (2, 8), (4, 8)}))
        O = fill(O, 3, crop(O, (3, 6), (3, 1)))
    elif digit == 2:
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, 4) for i in range(2, 6)})
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0), (9, 0), (0, 9), (9, 9), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4), (8, 0), (8, 4)}))
        O = fill(O, 3, crop(O, (6, 3), (2, 2)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Digit Extraction:** Convert input `I` to an integer.
2. **Canvas Initialization:** Create an empty 10x10 canvas `O`.
3. **Pattern Generation:**
    * Use `fill` to efficiently color larger areas with a single color.
    * Employ `crop` to target specific rectangular regions for filling or painting.
4. **Canvas Painting:** Combine `fill` and `paint` to draw the complete patterns.
5. **Output:** Return the modified canvas `O`.

These are five distinct ways to generate the "Program\_to\_be\_generated" code using the DSL. Each version utilizes different functions and approaches to achieve the same output, demonstrating diverse coding styles and problem-solving techniques.
