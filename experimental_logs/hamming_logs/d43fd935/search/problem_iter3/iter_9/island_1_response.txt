## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single digit as input and generates a 10x10 grid based on that digit. Each digit corresponds to a specific pattern:

**Input 1:** 
- A horizontal line of '1's centered at the top.
- A square of '3's slightly offset from the center.
- A '6' shape surrounding the '3' square with an additional '6' at the top.

**Input 8:**
- A '7' border around the top and right edges with a '7' in the bottom right corner. 
- An '8' square slightly offset from the center.
- A group of '3's above the '8' square, forming a small shape.

**Input 2:**
- Two horizontal lines of '1's, one near the top and one near the bottom.
- A square of '3's slightly offset from the center.
- A single '1' at the bottom left corner.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct code versions for "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:** (Inspired by hardcoded templates, using `fill` and `connect`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if v == 1:
    O = fill(O, 1, connect((0, 4), (4, 4)))
    O = fill(O, 1, connect((5, 4), (9, 4)))
    O = fill(O, 3, crop(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (0, 0), (2, 2)))
    O = fill(O, 6, {(1, 8), (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 6)})
  elif v == 8:
    O = fill(O, 7, {(i, 0) for i in range(9)} | {(9, 9)} | {(i, 9) for i in range(6, 9)})
    O = fill(O, 8, crop(canvas(8, (3, 3)), (0, 0), (3, 3)))
    O = fill(O, 3, {(2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (2, 7)})
  elif v == 2:
    O = fill(O, 1, connect((1, 5), (6, 5)) | connect((1, 9), (6, 9)))
    O = fill(O, 3, crop(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (0, 0), (2, 2)))
    O = fill(O, 1, {(0, 9)})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**
- Uses `canvas` to create the base 10x10 grid.
- Uses `mostcolor` to identify the input digit and apply the corresponding pattern.
- Uses `connect` to create horizontal lines for '1's.
- Uses `crop` and `canvas` to create the '3' and '8' squares.
- Directly defines coordinates for the remaining shapes and fills them using `fill`.


**Program Version 2:** (Inspired by shifting and painting, using `shift`, `paint`, and pre-defined objects)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    v = mostcolor(I)
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    one_line = frozenset({(1, (i, 0)) for i in range(5)})
    three_square = frozenset({(3, (i, j)) for i in range(2) for j in range(2)})
    if v == 1:
        O = paint(O, shift(one_line, (0, 4)))
        O = paint(O, shift(one_line, (5, 4)))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(three_square, (3, 3))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), (7, 1), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 6)}))
    elif v == 8:
        O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(7, (i, 0)) for i in range(9)} | {(7, (9, 9))} | {(7, (i, 9)) for i in range(6, 9)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(three_square, (6, 6))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(3, (2, 5)), (3, (2, 6)), (3, (3, 5)), (3, (3, 6)), (3, (2, 7))}))
    elif v == 2:
        O = paint(O, shift(one_line, (1, 5)))
        O = paint(O, shift(one_line, (1, 9)))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(three_square, (6, 6))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1, (0, 9))}))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
- Defines base objects like `one_line` and `three_square`.
- Uses `shift` to position these objects on the canvas.
- Uses `recolor` to change the color of objects as needed.
- Uses `paint` to draw the objects onto the canvas.


**Program Version 3:** (Inspired by logical operations on indices, using `intersection`, `difference`, `connect`, and `fill`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    v = mostcolor(I)
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    all_indices = asindices(O)
    top_half = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(5) for j in range(10))
    bottom_half = all_indices - top_half
    if v == 1:
        O = fill(O, 1, connect((0, 4), (4, 4)))
        O = fill(O, 1, connect((5, 4), (9, 4)))
        O = fill(O, 3, intersection(crop(canvas(3, (4, 4)), (0, 0), (4, 4)), bottom_half))
        O = fill(O, 6, {(1, 8), (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 6)})
    elif v == 8:
        border = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(10) for j in range(10) if i == 0 or j == 9 or (i > 5 and j == 8))
        O = fill(O, 7, border)
        O = fill(O, 8, intersection(crop(canvas(8, (4, 4)), (0, 0), (4, 4)), bottom_half))
        O = fill(O, 3, {(2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (2, 7)})
    elif v == 2:
        O = fill(O, 1, connect((1, 5), (6, 5)) | connect((1, 9), (6, 9)))
        O = fill(O, 3, intersection(crop(canvas(3, (4, 4)), (0, 0), (4, 4)), bottom_half))
        O = fill(O, 1, {(0, 9)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
- Uses `asindices` to get all indices of the grid.
- Defines areas like `top_half` and `bottom_half` using set operations.
- Uses `intersection` and `difference` to define areas for filling.
- Uses `connect` for lines and `fill` for other shapes.


**Program Version 4:** (Inspired by mirroring, using `hmirror`, `vconcat`, `hconcat`, and basic shapes)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    v = mostcolor(I)
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    if v == 1:
        part1 = hconcat(canvas(0, (5, 10)),  hconcat(canvas(1, (5, 1)), canvas(0, (5, 9))))
        part2 = hconcat(canvas(0, (5, 9)),  hconcat(canvas(6, (5, 1)), canvas(0, (5, 8))))
        O = vconcat(part1, vconcat(part2, hmirror(vconcat(part2, part1))))
        O = fill(O, 3, crop(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (0, 0), (2, 2)))
    elif v == 8:
        part1 = hconcat(canvas(7, (1, 9)), canvas(0, (1, 1)))
        part2 = hconcat(canvas(0, (1, 9)), canvas(7, (1, 1)))
        O = vconcat(part1, vconcat(part2, vconcat(part2, vconcat(part2, vconcat(part2, vconcat(part2, vconcat(hmirror(part1), part2)))))))
        O = fill(O, 8, crop(canvas(8, (3, 3)), (0, 0), (3, 3)))
        O = fill(O, 3, {(2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (2, 7)})
    elif v == 2:
        part1 = hconcat(canvas(0, (5, 9)),  hconcat(canvas(1, (5, 1)), canvas(0, (5, 8))))
        O = vconcat(canvas(0, (10, 10)), vconcat(part1, vconcat(canvas(0, (10, 10)), vconcat(part1, canvas(0, (10, 10))))))
        O = fill(O, 3, crop(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (0, 0), (2, 2)))
        O = fill(O, 1, {(0, 9)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
- Creates smaller grid parts using `canvas` and combines them using `hconcat` and `vconcat`.
- Uses `hmirror` to mirror parts and create symmetrical patterns.
- Uses `fill` to add the remaining elements.


**Program Version 5:** (Inspired by looping and conditional filling, using loops, `fill`, and conditional statements)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    v = mostcolor(I)
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    for i in range(10):
        for j in range(10):
            if v == 1:
                if (i == 0 or i == 9) and 4 <= j <= 5:
                    O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
                elif 3 <= i <= 6 and 3 <= j <= 6:
                    if i == j or i + j == 9:
                        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j)})
                    else:
                        O = fill(O, 6, {(i, j)})
            elif v == 8:
                if i == 0 or j == 9 or (i > 5 and j == 8):
                    O = fill(O, 7, {(i, j)})
                elif 6 <= i <= 8 and 6 <= j <= 8:
                    O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j)})
                elif (i == 2 and 5 <= j <= 7) or ((i == 3 and 5 <= j <= 6)):
                    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j)})
            elif v == 2:
                if (i == 1 or i == 4) and 5 <= j <= 6:
                    O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
                elif i == 2 and (j == 5 or j == 9):
                    O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
                elif 3 <= i <= 5 and 3 <= j <= 5:
                    if i == j or i + j == 8:
                        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
- Uses nested loops to iterate through every cell of the grid.
- Uses conditional statements based on the input digit and cell coordinates to determine the color of each cell.
- Uses `fill` to color the cells accordingly.

These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and diverse problem-solving capabilities possible with the DSL. Each version utilizes different functions and strategies, highlighting the importance of understanding the DSL and the various ways to manipulate objects and grids within it.
