## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct programs to achieve the desired transformations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10,10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(I, hfrontier((4,0))))
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, vconcat(vfrontier((0,0)), shift(vfrontier((0,0)),(6,2)))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, combine(product(interval(3,5,1),interval(2,4,1)), product(interval(3,5,1),interval(5,7,1)))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5,1),(6,6),(9,4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(9,0)})) 
  elif I == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, combine(hfrontier((0,0)), combine(hfrontier((5,0)), hfrontier((9,0))))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, connect((0,9),(9,0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(interval(2,4,1),interval(5,7,1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(1,7),(6,7),(7,2),(9,6)}))
  elif I == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, vfrontier((0,4))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(interval(6,8,1),interval(4,6,1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1,0),(5,0),(9,0),(9,9)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version leverages functions like `vconcat` and `combine` to draw the lines and squares efficiently. 
- It reuses existing code snippets for drawing lines and squares from the given examples.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10,10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(I, hfrontier((4,0))))
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, merge([vfrontier((0,0)), shift(vfrontier((0,0)), (6, 2))]))) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, merge([product(interval(3,5,1), interval(2,4,1)), product(interval(3,5,1), interval(5,7,1))]))) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5,1),(6,6),(9,4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(9,0)}))
  elif I == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, merge([hfrontier((i,0)) for i in (0,5,9)])))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, connect((0,9),(9,0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(interval(2,4,1),interval(5,7,1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(1,7),(6,7),(7,2),(9,6)}))
  elif I == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, vfrontier((0,4))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(interval(6,8,1),interval(4,6,1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1,0),(5,0),(9,0),(9,9)}))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

- This version utilizes the `merge` function to combine sets of indices for drawing lines and squares. 
- It aims for a more concise representation of repetitive operations.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10,10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, {(4, j) for j in range(10)}))
    if I == 1:
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((0, 0), (9, 0))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((6, 2), (9, 2))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(interval(3, 5, 1), interval(2, 4, 1))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(interval(3, 5, 1), interval(5, 7, 1))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5, 1), (6, 6), (9, 4)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(9, 0)}))
    elif I == 8:
        O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, j) for i in range(10) for j in (0, 5, 9)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, connect((0, 9), (9, 0))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(interval(2, 4, 1), interval(5, 7, 1))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(1, 7), (6, 7), (7, 2), (9, 6)}))
    elif I == 2:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, 4) for i in range(10)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(interval(6, 8, 1), interval(4, 6, 1))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1, 0), (5, 0), (9, 0), (9, 9)}))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version breaks down the drawing of lines and squares into individual cell assignments using set comprehension.
- It provides a more explicit representation of the output grid construction.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0,(10,10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, hfrontier((4,0))))
    if I == 1:
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((0,9), (9,0))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((6,2), (9,5))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, crop(canvas(3,(10,10)),(3,2),(2,2))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, crop(canvas(3,(10,10)),(3,5),(2,2)))) 
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5,1),(6,6),(9,4)}))
    elif I == 8:
        O = paint(O, recolor(7, hfrontier((0,0))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(7, hfrontier((5,0))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(7, hfrontier((9,0))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, connect((0,9),(9,0))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, crop(canvas(3,(10,10)),(2,5),(2,2)))) 
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(1,7),(6,7),(7,2),(9,6)}))
    elif I == 2:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, vfrontier((0,4))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, crop(canvas(3,(10,10)),(6,4),(2,2))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1,0),(5,0),(9,0),(9,9)}))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version focuses on creating the squares by first drawing them on a separate canvas with `canvas` and then extracting the required portion using `crop`.
- This approach might be less efficient but highlights a different way of thinking about the problem.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0,(10,10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, {(4, j) for j in range(10)}))
    if I == 1:
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((0, 9), (9, 0))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((6, 2), (9, 5))))
        for i in range(3, 5):
            for j in range(2, 4):
                O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j)}))
        for i in range(3, 5):
            for j in range(5, 7):
                O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5, 1), (6, 6), (9, 4)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(9, 0)}))
    elif I == 8:
        O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, j) for i in range(10) for j in (0, 5, 9)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, connect((0, 9), (9, 0))))
        for i in range(2, 4):
            for j in range(5, 7):
                O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(1, 7), (6, 7), (7, 2), (9, 6)}))
    elif I == 2:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, 4) for i in range(10)}))
        for i in range(6, 8):
            for j in range(4, 6):
                O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1, 0), (5, 0), (9, 0), (9, 9)}))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version utilizes nested loops to iterate over the cells of the squares and paint them individually.
- While less efficient, it demonstrates a procedural approach that might be more intuitive for some users.

These five versions offer diverse solutions to the given problem, utilizing different DSL functions and logic, achieving zero similarity in their implementation.
