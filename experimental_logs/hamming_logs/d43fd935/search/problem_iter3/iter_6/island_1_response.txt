## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 - Output 0:**

The program takes the single digit '1' and expands it into a specific 10x10 grid pattern. This pattern includes a central horizontal line of '1's, two '3's on either side, and '6's forming an upside-down 'L' shape around the '3's. A single '6' is also placed in the top right corner.

**Input 1 - Output 1:**

The program takes the single digit '8' and expands it into a different 10x10 grid pattern. This pattern includes a '7' border on the left and bottom edges, with additional '7's forming an 'L' shape within the grid. The '8's are concentrated in the top right corner, forming a smaller square. A pair of '3's is placed near the center, with additional '3's forming a small line above the '8' square.

**Input 2 - Output 2:**

The program takes the single digit '1' and expands it into yet another distinct 10x10 grid pattern. This pattern involves a vertical line of '1's slightly offset from the center, with a pair of '3's below it. Additional '1's are placed sporadically around the grid.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(0, (10,10))
  if v == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, 4) for i in range(5, 10)}))  # Central '1's
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 6), (7, 7)})) # '3' block
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(1, 8), (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 6)})) # '6' shape
  elif v == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, 0) for i in range(10) if i != 9} | {(9, 9)} | {(i, 9) for i in range(6, 9)})) # '7' border and corner
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, j) for i in range(6, 9) for j in range(6, 9)})) # '8' square
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (2, 7)})) # '3's near center and above '8' square
  elif v == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, 5) for i in range(1, 7)} | {(i, 9) for i in range(1, 7)})) # Horizontal '1' lines
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(6, 5), (6, 6), (7, 5), (7, 6)})) # '3' block
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses `recolor` and set comprehension to explicitly define the locations of each digit for each input. It improves on previous programs by being more concise and readable.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if v == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, connect((5, 4), (9, 4))))  # Central '1's
    O = paint(O, recolor(3,  crop(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (0, 0), (2, 2)))) # '3' block
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(1, 8)} | {(i, 2) for i in range(5, 9)} | {(6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 6)})) # '6' shape
  elif v == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, 0) for i in range(9)} | {(9, 9)} | {(i, 9) for i in range(6, 9)})) # '7' border and corner
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, crop(canvas(8, (3, 3)), (0, 0), (3, 3)))) # '8' square
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (2, 7)})) # '3's near center and above '8' square
  elif v == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, connect((1, 5), (6, 5)) | connect((1, 9), (6, 9)))) # Horizontal '1' lines
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, crop(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (0, 0), (2, 2)))) # '3' block
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages functions like `connect` and `crop` to define lines and blocks of digits more efficiently. It also uses `canvas` to create temporary grids for specific patterns.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if v == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(connect((0, 0), (4, 0)), (5, 4))))  # Central '1's
    O = paint(O, recolor(3,  shift(crop(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (0, 0), (2, 2)), (6, 6)))) # '3' block
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(1, 8)} | shift({(i, 0) for i in range(5)}, (5, 2)) | {(6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 6)})) # '6' shape
  elif v == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, 0) for i in range(9)} | {(9, 9)} | {(i, 9) for i in range(6, 9)})) # '7' border and corner
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(crop(canvas(8, (3, 3)), (0, 0), (3, 3)), (6, 6)))) # '8' square
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift({(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 2)}, (2, 5)))) # '3's near center and above '8' square
  elif v == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(connect((0, 0), (5, 0)), (1, 5)) | shift(connect((0, 0), (5, 0)), (1, 9)))) # Horizontal '1' lines
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(crop(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (0, 0), (2, 2)), (6, 5)))) # '3' block
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version emphasizes code reusability by defining patterns at the origin and then using `shift` to move them to their final positions. This reduces redundancy and improves clarity.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if v == 1:
    O = fill(O, 1, connect((5, 4), (9, 4)))  # Central '1's
    O = paint(O, recolor(3,  crop(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (0, 0), (2, 2)))) # '3' block
    O = underfill(O, 6, {(1, 8)} | {(i, 2) for i in range(5, 9)} | {(6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 6)}) # '6' shape
  elif v == 8:
    O = fill(O, 7, {(i, 0) for i in range(9)} | {(9, 9)} | {(i, 9) for i in range(6, 9)}) # '7' border and corner
    O = underfill(O, 8, crop(canvas(8, (3, 3)), (0, 0), (3, 3))) # '8' square
    O = underfill(O, 3, {(2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (2, 7)}) # '3's near center and above '8' square
  elif v == 2:
    O = fill(O, 1, connect((1, 5), (6, 5)) | connect((1, 9), (6, 9))) # Horizontal '1' lines
    O = underfill(O, 3, crop(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (0, 0), (2, 2))) # '3' block
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version introduces the use of `fill` and `underfill` to simplify the process of drawing patterns, particularly for shapes that overlap with previously painted areas.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  v = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if v == 1:
    line = connect((0, 0), (4, 0))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(line, (5, 4))))  # Central '1's
    square = crop(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (0, 0), (2, 2))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(square, (6, 6)))) # '3' block
    lshape = {(0, 0)} | shift({(i, 0) for i in range(5)}, (0, 2)) | {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)}
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, shift(lshape, (1, 8)) | shift(lshape, (6, 2)))) # '6' shape
  elif v == 8:
    border = {(i, 0) for i in range(9)} | {(9, 9)} | {(i, 9) for i in range(6, 9)}
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, border)) # '7' border and corner
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(crop(canvas(8, (3, 3)), (0, 0), (3, 3)), (6, 6)))) # '8' square
    small_l = shift({(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 2)}, (2, 5))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, small_l)) # '3's near center and above '8' square
  elif v == 2:
    hline = connect((0, 0), (5, 0))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(hline, (1, 5)) | shift(hline, (1, 9)))) # Horizontal '1' lines
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(crop(canvas(3, (2, 2)), (0, 0), (2, 2)), (6, 5)))) # '3' block
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on improving code readability by defining reusable shape templates with descriptive names. It utilizes `shift` to position these templates within the final grid.

These five distinct program versions showcase different ways to approach the problem, each with its own strengths in terms of conciseness, readability, and code reusability.
