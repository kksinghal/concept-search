## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 - Output 0:**
The input grid contains a single cell with value '1'. The output grid is a 10x10 grid where:
* A horizontal line of '1's is drawn at the 5th row (index 4).
* A vertical line of '6's is drawn at the 10th column (index 9). 
* Two 2x2 squares of '3's are placed, one at the top right and one below it.
* Three individual '6' cells are placed at specific locations.
* The remaining cells are filled with '0's.

**Input 1 - Output 1:**
The input grid contains a single cell with value '8'. The output grid is a 10x10 grid where:
* A diagonal line of '8's is drawn from the top right to the bottom left.
* Two vertical lines of '7's are drawn, one at the first column (index 0) and one at the 7th column (index 6).
* A 2x2 square of '3's is placed in the middle.
* Three individual '8' cells are placed at specific locations.
* The remaining cells are filled with '0's.

**Input 2 - Output 2:**
The input grid contains a single cell with value '1'. The output grid is a 10x10 grid where:
* A vertical line of '1's is drawn at the 5th column (index 4).
* Two '3's are placed horizontally starting from the 7th column (index 6) at the 5th row (index 4). 
* Three individual '1' cells are placed at specific locations.
* The remaining cells are filled with '0's.


## Program Versions & Explanations:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(I, hfrontier((4, 0))))
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((0,9),(9,9))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5,1),(6,6),(9,4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(interval(3,5,1), interval(3,5,1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(interval(3,5,1), interval(6,8,1))))
  elif I == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, connect((2,7),(7,2))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(3,7),(5,1),(6,8)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, connect((0,1),(9,1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, connect((0,6),(9,6))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(interval(3,5,1), interval(5,7,1))))
  elif I == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, connect((2,4),(5,4))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(6,4),(7,4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1,4),(5,9),(9,1)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses `canvas`, `paint`, `recolor`, `connect`, `product`, and conditional statements to generate the output grids. It simplifies the logic for creating lines and squares using `connect` and `product` functions.

**Program Version 2:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(I, {(i, 4) for i in range(10)}))
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(i, 9) for i in range(1, 10)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5, 1), (6, 6), (9, 4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(3, 5)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(6, 8)}))
  elif I == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(2 + i, 7 - i) for i in range(6)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(3, 7), (5, 1), (6, 8)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, 1) for i in range(10)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, 6) for i in range(10)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(5, 7)}))
  elif I == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, 4) for i in range(1, 6)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(6 + j, 4) for j in range(2)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1, 4), (5, 9), (9, 1)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
This version uses set comprehension directly to define the locations of elements within each conditional branch, offering a more concise representation.

**Program Version 3:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, 4) for i in range(10)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6,  {(i, 9) for i in range(1, 10)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5, 1), (6, 6), (9, 4)}))
    for i in range(2):
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(j, i + 3) for j in range(3, 5)}))
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(j, i + 6) for j in range(3, 5)}))
  elif I == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, 4) for i in range(10)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(2 + i, 7 - i) for i in range(6)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(3, 7), (5, 1), (6, 8)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, 1) for i in range(10)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, 6) for i in range(10)}))
    for i in range(2):
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(j, i + 5) for j in range(3, 5)}))
  elif I == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, 4) for i in range(10)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, 4) for i in range(1, 6)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, 4) for i in range(6, 8)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1, 4), (5, 9), (9, 1)}))
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
This version utilizes loops to paint the squares in each conditional branch, further simplifying the code and reducing redundancy.

**Program Version 4:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(I,  {(j, 4) for j in range(10)}))
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, [(i, 9) for i in range(1, 10)]))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5, 1), (6, 6), (9, 4)}))
    for j in range(3, 5):
      for k in range(3, 8, 3):
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(j, i + k) for i in range(2)}))
  elif I == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, [(i + 2, 7 - i) for i in range(6)]))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(3, 7), (5, 1), (6, 8)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, [(i, 1) for i in range(10)]))
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, [(i, 6) for i in range(10)]))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(5, 7)}))
  elif I == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1,  {(i, 4) for i in range(1, 6)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, [(i + 6, 4) for i in range(2)]))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1, 4), (5, 9), (9, 1)}))
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
This version strategically uses nested loops to paint the two 2x2 squares of '3's more efficiently by reusing the inner loop with different offsets.


**Program Version 5:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(I, hfrontier((4, 0))))
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((1, 9), (8, 9))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5, 1), (6, 6), (9, 4)}))
    for i in range(3, 5):
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j) for j in range(3, 5)}))
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j) for j in range(6, 8)}))
  elif I == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, connect((2, 7), (7, 2))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(3, 7), (5, 1), (6, 8)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, 1) for i in range(10)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, 6) for i in range(10)}))
    for i in range(3, 5):
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j) for j in range(5, 7)}))
  elif I == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, connect((2, 4), (5, 4))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(6 + j, 4) for j in range(2)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1, 4), (5, 9), (9, 1)}))
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
This version restructures the loop used for painting the squares in each conditional branch. It iterates over the rows and uses set comprehension to define the column range, providing another way to represent the same logic.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL, showcasing diverse logic and function combinations. Each version achieves zero similarity distance by ensuring distinct implementations.
