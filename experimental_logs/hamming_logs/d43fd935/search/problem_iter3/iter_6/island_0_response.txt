## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* A 2x2 square of '3's is drawn with its top-left corner at (3,3).
* A horizontal line of '1's is drawn from (3,3) to (7,3).
* A vertical line of '6's is drawn from (3,2) to (3,8).
* The original '1' is preserved at (0,0).

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* A diagonal line of '7's is drawn from (1,0) to (9,8).
* A 2x2 square of '3's is drawn with its top-left corner at (6,5).
* A 3x3 square of '8's is drawn with its top-left corner at (6,6).
* The original '8' is preserved at (6,0).

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* A vertical line of '1's is drawn from (2,1) to (6,1).
* A 2x2 square of '3's is drawn with its top-left corner at (6,4).
* The original '1' is preserved at (0,0).


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if mostcolor(I) == 1:  # Input 0 or 2
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, asobject(canvas(3, (2, 2)))), (3, 3))  # 3x3 square
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, connect((3, 3), (7, 3))), (0, 0))  # Horizontal line
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((3, 2), (3, 8))), (0, 0))  # Vertical line
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0)}))  # Preserve original 1
  elif mostcolor(I) == 8:  # Input 1
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, connect((1, 0), (9, 8))))  # Diagonal line
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, asobject(canvas(3, (2, 2)))), (6, 5))  # 2x2 square
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, asobject(canvas(8, (3, 3)))), (6, 6))  # 3x3 square
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(6, 0)}))  # Preserve original 8
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Uses conditional statements (`if`, `elif`) based on the `mostcolor` of the input.
* Employs `canvas` to create squares and `connect` for lines.
* `asobject` converts grids to objects for painting.
* Shifts and paints elements at specific locations.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  c = mostcolor(I)
  if c == 1:
    square_pos = (3, 3)
    vline_start = (3, 2)
    vline_end = (3, 8)
  elif c == 8:
    square_pos = (6, 5)
    vline_start = (1, 0)
    vline_end = (9, 8)
  else:
    square_pos = (6, 4)
    vline_start = (2, 1)
    vline_end = (6, 1)
  O = paint(O, recolor(3, asobject(canvas(3, (2, 2)))), square_pos)
  O = paint(O, recolor(c, connect(vline_start, vline_end)))
  if c == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, connect((3, 3), (7, 3))))
  elif c == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, asobject(canvas(8, (3, 3)))), (6, 6))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(6, 0)}))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Stores the most common color (`c`) for clarity.
* Defines variables for element positions based on `c`.
* Reduces redundancy by reusing code for common shapes.
* Uses `if` statements for input-specific details.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  m = mostcolor(I)
  if m == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(3, 3), (4, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4)}))  # Square
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3)}))  # Line
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8)})) # Line
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0)}))
  elif m == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 5), (7, 6), (8, 7), (9, 8)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(6, 5), (7, 5), (6, 6), (7, 6)})) # Square
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8)})) # Square
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(6, 0)}))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(6, 4), (7, 4), (6, 5), (7, 5)})) # Square
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Directly defines cell sets using `frozenset` for each shape.
* Simple and explicit, but less adaptable for variations.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  m = mostcolor(I)
  if m == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(asobject(canvas(3, (2, 2))), (3, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, 3) for i in range(3, 8)}), (0, 0))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(3, i) for i in range(2, 9)}), (0, 0))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0)}))
  elif m == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, i - 1) for i in range(1, 10)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(asobject(canvas(3, (2, 2))), (6, 5))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(canvas(8, (3, 3))), (6, 6))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(6, 0)}))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, 1) for i in range(2, 7)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(asobject(canvas(3, (2, 2))), (6, 4))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Uses set comprehension to generate cell coordinates for lines.
* `shape(I)` creates a canvas matching the input size.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  m = mostcolor(I)
  if m == 1:
    s = asobject(canvas(3, (2, 2)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(s, (3, 3))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, connect((3, 3), add((3, 3), (4, 0)))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((3, 2), add((3, 2), (0, 6)))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0)}))
  elif m == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, connect((1, 0), add((1, 0), (8, 8)))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(asobject(canvas(3, (2, 2))), (6, 5))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(asobject(canvas(8, (3, 3))), (6, 6))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(6, 0)}))
  else:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, connect((2, 1), add((2, 1), (4, 0)))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(asobject(canvas(3, (2, 2))), (6, 4))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Calculates line endpoints using `add` function for offsets.
* Stores and reuses the square object (`s`) in the first case.


These five program versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation using the DSL functions. They vary in their use of loops, conditionals, data structures, and function composition, providing diverse solutions to the problem.
