## Transformation Analysis:

This task involves recognizing a digit (1, 2, or 8) from a 1x1 input grid and drawing a stylized version of that digit on a 10x10 canvas. Let's break down the transformations for each digit:

**Digit 1:**

* A diagonal line of '6's is drawn from (2,2) to (8,8).
* '1' is placed at (0,0) and (9,4).
* A vertical line of '3's is drawn from (3,1) to (4,2).
* Scattered '6' pixels are added at (7,0), (7,2), (6,1), (5,-1), and (4,-3).

**Digit 8:**

* The outline of the 10x10 canvas is drawn with '7's.
* A diagonal line of '7's is drawn from (3,4) to (5,6).
* The '8' pattern is formed with '8's at specific locations: (1,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (2,7), (4,7), (2,8), and (4,8).
* A horizontal line of '3's is drawn from (3,6) to (6,6).

**Digit 2:**

* The outline of the 10x10 canvas is drawn with '1's.
* A vertical line of '1's is drawn from (2,4) to (5,4).
* A double horizontal line of '3's is drawn from (6,3) to (7,4).

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformations:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_version_1(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[2])  # Extract the digit from the input tuple
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if digit == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((2, 2), (8, 8))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0), (9, 4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(1, 3)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(7, 0), (7, 2), (6, 1), (5, -1), (4, -3)}))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, box(O)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, connect((3, 4), (5, 6))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(1, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (2, 7), (4, 7), (2, 8), (4, 8)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, 6) for i in range(3, 7)}))
  elif digit == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, box(O)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, 4) for i in range(2, 6)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(6, 8) for j in range(3, 5)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version extracts the digit value from the input tuple by converting it to a string, taking the third character (index 2), and then converting that character to an integer. 
* It utilizes list comprehensions to simplify the creation of pixel sets for drawing lines.
* For drawing the '8' pattern, it explicitly lists the coordinates.


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_version_2(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[2])
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if digit == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((2, 2), (8, 8))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0), (9, 4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(vline(crop(O, (3, 1), (2, 1))), (0, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(7, 0), (7, 2), (6, 1), (5, -1), (4, -3)}))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, hconcat(vline(crop(O, (0, 0), (10, 1))), vline(crop(O, (0, 9), (10, 1))))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, hline(crop(O, (0, 0), (1, 10)))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, connect((3, 4), (5, 6))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, j) for i in range(1, 6) for j in range(5, 9) if not (i == 1 and j == 8)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, hline(crop(O, (3, 6), (1, 3)))))
  elif digit == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, hconcat(vline(crop(O, (0, 0), (10, 1))), vline(crop(O, (0, 9), (10, 1))))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, hline(crop(O, (1, 4), (4, 1)))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, hconcat(hline(crop(O, (6, 3), (1, 2))), hline(crop(O, (7, 3), (1, 2))))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version focuses on constructing shapes using functions like `vline` and `hline` and then positioning them using `shift` and `hconcat`. 
* The '8' pattern is generated using a list comprehension with a conditional to exclude a specific coordinate.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_version_3(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[2])
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if digit == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((2, 2), (8, 8))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0), (9, 4)}))
    O = fill(O, 3, crop(O, (3, 1), (2, 2)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(7, 0), (7, 2), (6, 1), (5, -1), (4, -3)}))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, box(O)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, connect((3, 4), (5, 6))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(1, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (2, 7), (4, 7), (2, 8), (4, 8)}))
    O = fill(O, 3, crop(O, (3, 6), (3, 1)))
  elif digit == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, box(O)))
    O = fill(O, 1, {(i, 4) for i in range(2, 6)})
    O = fill(O, 3, crop(O, (6, 3), (2, 2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version utilizes the `fill` function to draw filled rectangles for elements like the vertical line in '1' and the double horizontal line in '2'. 

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_version_4(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[2])
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if digit == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((2, 2), (8, 8))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0), (9, 4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(3, 1), (4, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(7, 0), (7, 2), (6, 1), (5, -1), (4, -3)}))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, box(O)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, connect((3, 4), (5, 6))))
    eight_pattern = {(1, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (2, 7), (4, 7), (2, 8), (4, 8)}
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, eight_pattern))
    O = fill(O, 3, crop(O, (3, 6), (3, 1)))
  elif digit == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, box(O)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, 4) for i in range(2, 6)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(6, 3), (7, 3), (6, 4), (7, 4)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version pre-defines the '8' pattern as a separate set (`eight_pattern`) for better readability. 


### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_version_5(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[2])
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if digit == 1:
    diagonal = connect((2, 2), (8, 8))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, diagonal))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0), (9, 4)}))
    vertical_line = {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(1, 3)}
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, vertical_line))
    scattered_pixels = {(7, 0), (7, 2), (6, 1), (5, -1), (4, -3)}
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, scattered_pixels))
  elif digit == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, box(O)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, connect((3, 4), (5, 6))))
    eight_pattern = {(i, j) for i in range(1, 6) for j in range(5, 9) if not (i == 1 and j == 8)}
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, eight_pattern))
    horizontal_line = {(i, 6) for i in range(3, 7)}
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, horizontal_line))
  elif digit == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, box(O)))
    vertical_line = {(i, 4) for i in range(2, 6)}
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, vertical_line))
    horizontal_line = {(6, j) for j in range(3, 5)} | {(7, j) for j in range(3, 5)}
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, horizontal_line))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version emphasizes code readability by defining variables for frequently used pixel sets like `diagonal`, `vertical_line`, `scattered_pixels`, and `horizontal_line`.
* It aims to make the code easier to understand and modify by breaking down the drawing process into smaller, well-defined steps.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to solving the transformation task using the provided DSL. Each version aims to be distinct in its logic or function usage, providing a variety of solutions.
