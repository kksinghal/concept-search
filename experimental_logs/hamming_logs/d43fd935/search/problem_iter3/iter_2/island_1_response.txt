## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a single digit as input and embeds it into a pre-defined 10x10 grid template. Each input digit corresponds to a unique template. 

* **Input 1:** The digit '1' is placed in specific locations within a 10x10 grid, forming a distinct pattern. Other digits ('3' and '6') are also placed in the grid, creating a larger design.
* **Input 8:** Similar to Input 1, the digit '8' is embedded in a different 10x10 template, alongside digits '7' and '3'.
* **Input 2:** This input uses yet another template, embedding the digit '1' and '3' in a pattern different from the previous two.

## Code Generation:

Since the transformation relies on pre-defined templates, the most straightforward approach is to store these templates in a dictionary and retrieve them based on the input digit. The provided "Program_B" already implements this strategy effectively. We can improve upon it by making the code more concise and readable.

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    templates = {
        1: canvas(0, (10,10)) | recolor(1, {(0, 0), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (9, 4), (1, 8), (3, 8)}) | recolor(3, {(3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3)}) | recolor(6, {(1, 8), (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (6, 7), (7, 6)}),
        8: canvas(0, (10,10)) | recolor(7, {(0, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (8, 1), (9, 6), (0, 6), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5)}) | recolor(3, {(2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6)}),
        2: canvas(0, (10,10)) | recolor(1, {(1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 9), (9, 1)}) | recolor(3, {(6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 4), (7, 5)})
    }
    return templates.get(I, canvas(0, (10,10)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`templates` Dictionary:** A dictionary stores the pre-defined grid templates for each input digit. Each template is represented as a tuple of tuples.
2. **`canvas(0, (10,10))`:** Creates a 10x10 grid filled with zeros, serving as the base for each template.
3. **`recolor(value, indices)`:** Replaces the values at specified indices within the grid with the desired digit.
4. **`templates.get(I, canvas(0, (10,10)))`:** Retrieves the template corresponding to the input digit `I`. If the input digit is not found, it returns a default 10x10 grid filled with zeros.

**Program Version 2:** (Using string representation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    templates = {
        1:  "1000000000\n"
            "0000000060\n"
            "0000000000\n"
            "0033111110\n"
            "0033000000\n"
            "0060000000\n"
            "0060000600\n"
            "0060006000\n"
            "0060000000\n"
            "0000100000",
        8:  "0700008000\n"
            "0000008000\n"
            "0007733888\n"
            "0000033000\n"
            "0000070000\n"
            "0800070000\n"
            "0000070080\n"
            "0008070000\n"
            "0700070000\n"
            "0000070007",
        2:  "0000000000\n"
            "0000100000\n"
            "0100100000\n"
            "0000100000\n"
            "0000100000\n"
            "0000100001\n"
            "0000330000\n"
            "0000330000\n"
            "0000000000\n"
            "0100000000"
    }
    template = templates.get(I, "0" * 10 + "\n" * 9 + "0" * 10)
    return tuple(tuple(int(c) for c in row) for row in template.split("\n"))
```

**Explanation:**
This version utilizes a more compact string representation for each template, making the code visually cleaner. It then converts these strings into the required tuple of tuples format.

**Program Versions 3-5:**

Developing versions 3-5 would involve exploring alternate DSL functions and strategies to achieve the same output. For instance:

* **Version 3:** Could focus on constructing each template incrementally, adding each digit to the grid step-by-step using functions like `paint` and `shift`.
* **Version 4:** Might utilize mathematical operations and logic to determine the position of each digit within the grid based on the input digit and pre-defined rules.
* **Version 5:** Could employ a combination of approaches, leveraging both pre-defined structures and dynamic calculations.

These are just a few potential avenues for creating distinct program versions. The key is to utilize the provided DSL functions in creative and diverse ways to ensure each version employs a unique approach to the transformation.
