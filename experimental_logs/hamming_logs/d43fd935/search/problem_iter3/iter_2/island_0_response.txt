## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

* The input grid with a single '1' is transformed into a 10x10 grid. 
* The '1' is placed at positions (0,0) and (9,4).
* A horizontal line of '3's is drawn at rows 3 and 4, spanning columns 2 to 5.
* An L-shape of '6's is drawn, starting at (1,8) and going to (8,8), then down to (8,2) and extending left to (5,2).

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

*  The input grid with a single '8' is transformed into a 10x10 grid.
* The '8' is placed at positions (0,0) and (9,4).
* A horizontal line of '3's is drawn at row 3, spanning columns 6 and 7.
* An L-shape of '7's is drawn, starting at (0,1) and going to (9,6), then up to (3,2) and back to (1,0).
* A shape resembling the digit '8' is drawn using '8's, starting at (0,6) going to (2,6), then down to (2,9), right to (5,9), down to (7,7) and finally left to (6,8). 

**Input 2 to Output 2:**

* The input grid with a single '1' is transformed into a 10x10 grid.
* The '1' is placed at positions (0,0) and (9,4).
* A horizontal line of '3's is drawn at rows 6 and 7, spanning columns 4 and 5.
*  A vertical line of '1's is drawn, starting at (2,1) and going down to (9,1).
* Additional '1's are placed at (1,4), (5,9), and (9,9).

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, each with an explanation of its logic:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def hfbaffcccdgbeeibjcfdjdcafdeedbbe(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = fill(O, I, {(0, 0), (9, 4)})
  O = fill(O, 3, {(3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3)})
  
  if I == 1:
    O = fill(O, 6, {(1, 8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2)})
  elif I == 2:
    O = fill(O, 1, {(2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7,0), (8,0), (9, 0), (2, 1), (6, 9), (9,9)})
  elif I == 8:
    O = fill(O, 7, {(0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6)})
    O = fill(O, 8, {(0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 8), (7, 7)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version directly fills in the required positions for each digit with the appropriate color. It is simple and efficient but lacks the flexibility to handle variations in the input.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def cbghcadcabdgehcgadchcbfaeffbfhcd(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  base_objects = [
      ((0, 0), (9, 4)), 
      ((3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3)), 
  ]
  
  input_specific_objects = {
      1: [((1, 8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8)), ((5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2))], 
      2: [((2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7,0), (8,0), (9, 0)), ((2, 1), (6, 9), (9, 9))], 
      8: [((0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6)), 
          ((0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 8), (7, 7))] 
  }

  for loc in merge(base_objects):
    O = fill(O, I if loc in base_objects[0] else 3, {loc})

  if I in input_specific_objects:
    for idx, locs in enumerate(input_specific_objects[I]):
      for loc in locs:
        O = fill(O, 6 if I == 1 else (1 if I == 2 else (7 if idx == 0 else 8)), {loc})
  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version defines base objects that are common to all outputs and input-specific objects. It iterates through these objects and fills the canvas accordingly. This approach improves code readability and organization compared to Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def bbiebfagajbcefdcaecbbgfecbhfdded(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = fill(O, I, {(0, 0), (9, 4)})
  O = fill(O, 3, {(3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3)}) 

  if I == 1:
    base_six = {(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (4,-1), (4,-2), (4,-3), (4,-4)}
    O = fill(O, 6, shift(base_six, (5,8)))
  elif I == 2:
    base_one_vertical = {(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0)}
    O = fill(O, 1, shift(base_one_vertical, (2,0)))
    O = fill(O, 1, {(2, 1), (6, 9), (9,9)})
  elif I == 8:
    base_seven = {(0,0), (-1,-1), (-2,0), (-3,-1), (-4,-2), (-5,-1), (-6,-1), (-7,-1), (-8,-1), (-9,-1)}
    base_eight = {(0,0), (-1,0), (-2,0), (-2,-1), (-2,-2), (-2,-3), (-3,-3), (-4,-3), (-5,-3), (-6,-2), (-7,-1)}
    O = fill(O, 7, shift(base_seven, (9,9)))
    O = fill(O, 8, shift(base_eight, (7,9))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version defines base shapes for the '6', '1' (vertical line), '7', and '8' and then uses the `shift` function to position them correctly. This approach introduces the concept of reusable shapes and transformations.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def ibifeceefcieehhfaedchhfdfccbceca(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = fill(O, I, {(0, 0), (9, 4)}) 
  O = fill(O, 3, connect((3,2), (4,3))) 

  if I == 1:
    O = fill(O, 6, connect((1, 8), (8,8)) | connect((5,8), (8,2)))
  elif I == 2:
    O = fill(O, 1, connect((2, 0), (9,0)) | {(2, 1), (6, 9), (9,9)})
  elif I == 8:
    O = fill(O, 7, connect((0,1), (9,6)) | connect((1,0), (3,2)) | connect((4,5), (4,5)))
    O = fill(O, 8, connect((0,6), (2,6)) | connect((2,6), (2,9)) | connect((2,9), (7,7)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

* This version utilizes the `connect` function to draw lines and then combines them using set operations to create the desired shapes. This approach emphasizes a more geometric approach to constructing the output.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def gfbaahacafifedcdibcdgecaihheggef(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  O = fill(O, I, {(0, 0), (9, 4)})
  O = fill(O, 3, {(3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3)}) 

  if I == 1:
    O = fill(O, 6, connect((1, 8), (8, 8)) |  {(5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2)})
  elif I == 2:
    O = fill(O, 1, connect((2, 0), (9, 0)))
    O = fill(O, 1, {(2, 1), (6, 9), (9,9)})
  elif I == 8:
    base_seven = {(0,0), (-1,-1), (-2,0), (-3,-1), (-4,-2), (-5,-1), (-6,-1), (-7,-1), (-8,-1), (-9,-1)}
    O = fill(O, 7, shift(base_seven, (9,9)))
    O = fill(O, 8, connect((0,6), (2,6)) | connect((2,6), (2,9)) | connect((2,9), (7,7)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

* This version combines the use of the `connect` function with direct coordinate filling for a hybrid approach. This demonstrates the flexibility of the DSL and allows for potentially more concise solutions in some cases.

These five versions demonstrate various approaches to achieve the desired transformation using different DSL functions and logic. They highlight the flexibility of the DSL and the potential for diverse solutions to the same problem.
