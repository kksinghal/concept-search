## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:** The input '1' is placed at specific positions in the output grid and a diagonal line, a vertical line, and some scattered pixels are drawn using specific colors (6, 3, and 1). 

**Input 1 to Output 1:**  The input '8' determines the placement of digit '8' in the output grid, forming a specific pattern. Additional lines and scattered pixels are added using colors 7 and 3.

**Input 2 to Output 2:** The input '2' dictates the placement of digit '1' in the output grid, creating a different pattern. A double horizontal line is drawn using color 3.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions for "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    digit = int(I)  # Convert the input to an integer
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))  # Create a 10x10 canvas filled with 0s
    if digit == 1:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0), (9, 4)}))  # Place '1' at (0,0) and (9,4)
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(3, 1), (4, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2)}))  # Draw the vertical line with '3'
        for i in range(2, 9):
            O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(i, i)}))  # Draw the diagonal line with '6'
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(7, 0), (7, 2), (6, 1), (5, -1), (4, -3)}))  # Add the scattered '6' pixels
    elif digit == 8:
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(1, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (2, 7), (4, 7), (2, 8), (4, 8)}))  # Place '8's to form the pattern
        O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(0, 1), (0, 9), (9, 0), (9, 9), (3, 4), (3, 5), (5, 5), (7, 0), (8, 0)}))  # Draw lines and scattered pixels with '7'
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)}))  # Draw the horizontal line with '3'
    elif digit == 2:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0), (9, 0), (0, 9), (9, 9), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4), (8, 0), (8, 4)}))  # Place '1's to form the pattern
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, 4) for i in range(2, 6)}))  # Draw the vertical line with '1'
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(6, 3), (7, 3), (6, 4), (7, 4)}))  # Draw the double horizontal line with '3'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version utilizes `canvas` to create the base grid and then `paint` and `recolor` to strategically place digits and draw lines/pixels based on the input digit.
* Each `if` condition handles a specific input digit, placing the digits and drawing the patterns accordingly.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    digit = int(I)
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    if digit == 1:
        O = fill(O, 6, connect((2, 2), (8, 8)))  # Diagonal line with '6'
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0), (9, 4)}))
        O = fill(O, 3, crop(O, (3, 1), (2, 2)))  # Vertical line with '3'
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(7, 0), (7, 2), (6, 1), (5, -1), (4, -3)}))
    elif digit == 8:
        O = paint(O, recolor(7, box(crop(O, (0, 0), (10, 10)))))  # Outline with '7'
        O = fill(O, 7, connect((3, 4), (5, 6)))  # Diagonal line with '7'
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(1, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (2, 7), (4, 7), (2, 8), (4, 8)}))
        O = fill(O, 3, crop(O, (3, 6), (3, 1)))  # Horizontal line with '3'
    elif digit == 2:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, box(crop(O, (0, 0), (10, 10)))))  # Outline with '1'
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, 4) for i in range(2, 6)})
        O = fill(O, 3, crop(O, (6, 3), (2, 2)))  # Double horizontal line with '3'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version utilizes `fill` and `connect` to draw lines more efficiently.
* It also uses `box` and `crop` to draw outlines and fill specific regions.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    digit = int(I)
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    if digit == 1:
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((2, 2), (8, 8))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0), (9, 4)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(hline(crop(O, (3, 1), (2, 1))), (0, 1))))  # Vertical line with '3'
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(7, 0), (7, 2), (6, 1), (5, -1), (4, -3)}))
    elif digit == 8:
        O = paint(O, recolor(7, hconcat(vline(crop(O, (0, 0), (10, 1))), vline(crop(O, (0, 9), (10, 1)))))) # Side lines with '7'
        O = paint(O, recolor(7, hline(crop(O, (0, 0), (1, 10))))) # Top line with '7'
        O = fill(O, 7, connect((3, 4), (5, 6)))
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(1, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (2, 7), (4, 7), (2, 8), (4, 8)}))
        O = fill(O, 3, crop(O, (3, 6), (3, 1))) 
    elif digit == 2:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, hconcat(vline(crop(O, (0, 0), (10, 1))), vline(crop(O, (0, 9), (10, 1)))))) # Side lines with '1'
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, 4) for i in range(2, 6)})
        O = fill(O, 3, crop(O, (6, 3), (2, 2))) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version introduces `vline` and `hline` for generating vertical and horizontal lines.
* It utilizes `hconcat` to combine these lines and create more complex shapes. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    digit = int(I)
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    if digit == 1:
        diagonal = connect((2, 2), (8, 8))
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, diagonal))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0), (9, 4)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j) for i, j in product(range(3, 5), range(1, 3))}))  # Vertical line with '3' using product
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(7, 0), (7, 2), (6, 1), (5, -1), (4, -3)}))
    elif digit == 8:
        O = paint(O, recolor(7, box(crop(O, (0, 0), (10, 10)))))
        O = fill(O, 7, connect((3, 4), (5, 6)))
        eight_pattern = {(1, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (2, 7), (4, 7), (2, 8), (4, 8)} 
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, eight_pattern))  # Using a pre-defined set for the '8' pattern
        O = fill(O, 3, crop(O, (3, 6), (3, 1)))
    elif digit == 2:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, box(crop(O, (0, 0), (10, 10)))))
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, 4) for i in range(2, 6)})
        horizontal_line = {(6, j) for j in range(3, 5)} | {(7, j) for j in range(3, 5)}  # Double horizontal line using set union
        O = fill(O, 3, horizontal_line)  
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version utilizes `product` to generate the coordinates for the vertical line.
* It also pre-defines sets for specific patterns and uses set union for the double horizontal line, making the code cleaner. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    digit = int(I)
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    if digit == 1:
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((2, 2), (8, 8))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(0, 0), (9, 4)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(3, 1), (4, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2)}))
        scattered_pixels = {(7, 0), (7, 2), (6, 1), (5, -1), (4, -3)}
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, scattered_pixels)) # Using a pre-defined set for scattered pixels
    elif digit == 8:
        O = paint(O, recolor(7,  hconcat(vline(crop(O, (0, 0), (10, 1))), vline(crop(O, (0, 9), (10, 1))))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(7, hline(crop(O, (0, 0), (1, 10))))) 
        O = paint(O, recolor(7, connect((3, 4), (5, 6))))
        eight_pattern = {(i, j) for i, j in product(range(2, 6), range(6, 9)) if (i == 2 and j != 8) or i != 2} # '8' pattern using product and condition
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, eight_pattern)) 
        O = fill(O, 3, crop(O, (3, 6), (3, 1)))
    elif digit == 2:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1,  hconcat(vline(crop(O, (0, 0), (10, 1))), vline(crop(O, (0, 9), (10, 1))))))
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, 4) for i in range(2, 6)})
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, hconcat(hline(crop(O, (6, 3), (1, 2))), hline(crop(O, (7, 3), (1, 2)))))) # Double line using hconcat 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version further simplifies the code by pre-defining sets for patterns and strategically using `product` with conditional filtering. 
* It also leverages `hconcat` to construct the double horizontal line from individual horizontal lines.

These are just five examples, and you can generate even more distinct versions by combining the DSL functions in various creative ways. The key is to focus on achieving the desired transformation while minimizing complexity and maximizing efficiency.
