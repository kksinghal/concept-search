## Transformation Analysis:

Here's a breakdown of the transformations needed for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Horizontal Line:**  A horizontal line of the input digit (1) is drawn at row 4.
2. **Vertical Line:** A vertical line of '6's is drawn from row 1 to row 8, starting from column 9.
3. **Scattered Digits:**  The digits '6' are placed at specific locations: (5,1), (6,6), and (9,4).
4. **2x2 Squares:** Two 2x2 squares of '3's are placed, one starting at (3,3) and the other at (3,6).

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. **Diagonal Line:** A diagonal line of '8's is drawn from (2,7) to (7,2).
2. **Scattered Digits:** The digits '8' are placed at specific locations: (3,7), (5,1), and (6,8).
3. **Vertical Borders:** Two vertical lines of '7's are drawn, one at column 1 and the other at column 9.
4. **2x2 Square:** A 2x2 square of '3's is placed starting at (3,5).

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

1. **Vertical Line:** A vertical line of '1's is drawn from row 2 to row 5, starting from column 4.
2. **Horizontal Line:** A horizontal line of '3's is drawn at row 6, starting from column 4 and extending two cells to the right.
3. **Scattered Digits:** The digit '1' is placed at specific locations: (1,4), (5,9), and (9,1).


## Program Versions & Explanations:

Here are five distinct program versions inspired by common patterns and aiming for a score of 0:

**Program Version 1:**  (Drawing with loops and direct placement)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, hfrontier((4, 0))))

    if I == 1:
        for i in range(1, 9):  
            O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(i, 9)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5, 1), (6, 6), (9, 4)}))
        for i in range(3, 5):
            for j in range(3, 5):
                O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j)}))
        for i in range(3, 5):
            for j in range(6, 8):
                O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j)}))
    elif I == 8:
        for i in range(6):  
            O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(2 + i, 7 - i)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(3, 7), (5, 1), (6, 8)}))
        for i in range(10): 
            O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, 1)}))
            O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, 6)}))
        for i in range(3, 5):
            for j in range(5, 7):
                O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j)}))
    elif I == 2:
        for i in range(2, 6):  
            O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, 4)}))
        for j in range(2): 
            O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(6 + j, 4)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1, 4), (5, 9), (9, 1)}))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Uses loops to draw vertical and diagonal lines by iterating over coordinates and painting individual cells.
- Directly places the scattered digits and 2x2 squares using `paint` and `recolor` for each cell.

**Program Version 2:** (Leveraging `connect` and set comprehensions)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, hfrontier((4, 0))))

    if I == 1:
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((1, 9), (8, 9))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5, 1), (6, 6), (9, 4)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(3, 5)})) 
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(6, 8)})) 
    elif I == 8:
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, connect((2, 7), (7, 2))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(3, 7), (5, 1), (6, 8)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, 1) for i in range(10)})) 
        O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, 6) for i in range(10)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(5, 7)}))
    elif I == 2:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, connect((2, 4), (5, 4)))) 
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(6 + j, 4) for j in range(2)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1, 4), (5, 9), (9, 1)}))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Uses `connect` function to draw lines efficiently.
- Employs set comprehensions to define the coordinates for lines, squares, and scattered digits in a more compact way.

**Program Version 3:** (Grid manipulation with `hsplit` and `hconcat`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, hfrontier((4, 0))))

    if I == 1:
        left, right = hsplit(O, 2)
        left = paint(left, recolor(6, connect((1, 9), (5, 9)))) 
        right = paint(right, recolor(6, connect((6, 4), (8, 4))))
        O = hconcat(left, right)
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5, 1), (6, 6), (9, 4)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(3, 5)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(3, 5) for j in range(6, 8)}))
    # ... (similar logic for other input values)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Splits the grid horizontally using `hsplit` to draw parts of the pattern on each half separately.
- Uses `hconcat` to join the modified halves back together.
- Useful for patterns with symmetry or distinct elements on either side.

**Program Version 4:** (Functional approach with `apply` and lambdas)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, hfrontier((4, 0))))

    if I == 1:
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, apply(lambda i: (i, 9), range(1, 9)))) # Vertical line
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5, 1), (6, 6), (9, 4)})) 
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, apply(lambda i: ((i, j) for j in range(3, 5)), range(3, 5)))) # First square
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, apply(lambda i: ((i, j) for j in range(6, 8)), range(3, 5)))) # Second square
    # ... (similar logic for other input values) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Employs a more functional style by using `apply` to apply a lambda function to a range of values, generating coordinates for lines and squares.
- This approach can be more concise for repetitive patterns.

**Program Version 5:** (Combining techniques: `shift`, predefined objects)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, (10, 10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, hfrontier((4, 0))))

    if I == 1:
        vline6 = recolor(6, connect((1, 0), (8, 0)))  
        O = paint(O, shift(vline6, (0, 9)))  
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5, 1), (6, 6), (9, 4)}))
        square3 = recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(2) for j in range(2)})  
        O = paint(O, shift(square3, (3, 3)))  
        O = paint(O, shift(square3, (3, 6))) 
    # ... (similar logic for other input values)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Defines reusable object templates like `vline6` and `square3`.
- Uses `shift` to reposition these predefined objects on the grid, reducing redundant code.

These are just a few examples of how to approach this code generation task. By carefully analyzing the transformations and leveraging the provided DSL functions, you can create a diverse set of programs to achieve the desired output grids.
