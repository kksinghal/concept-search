## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:** The input digit '1' is transformed into a diagonal line of '1's with a small square of '3's below it. A vertical line of '6's is placed on the right side of the grid. The line and the square are disconnected.

**Input 1 -> Output 1:** The input digit '8' is transformed into two diagonal lines of '8's, forming a 'V' shape.  A horizontal line of '7's is placed above the 'V'.  A small square of '3's is embedded within the 'V'.

**Input 2 -> Output 2:** The input digit '1' is transformed into a vertical line of '1's. A small square of '3's is placed below the line. The line and the square are disconnected.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = first(palette(I))
  C = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if digit == 1:
    C = fill(C, 1, connect((0, 0), (4, 4)))
    C = fill(C, 3, crop(C, (5, 3), (2, 2)))
    C = fill(C, 6, vline(9, 10))
  elif digit == 8:
    C = fill(C, 8, connect((2, 6), (9, 9)) | connect((2, 6), (9, 3)))
    C = fill(C, 7, hline(2, 10))
    C = fill(C, 3, crop(C, (3, 6), (2, 2)))
  elif digit == 3:
    C = fill(C, 1, vline(0, 10))
    C = fill(C, 3, crop(C, (6, 5), (2, 2)))
    C = fill(C, 1, {(9, 9)})
  return C
```

**Explanation:**

* **Common:**  A 10x10 canvas `C` is initialized with '0's. The input digit is extracted.
* **Digit 1:** A diagonal line of '1's is drawn using `connect` and `fill`. A 2x2 square of '3's is placed below using `crop` and `fill`. A vertical line of '6's is drawn on the right edge using `vline` and `fill`.
* **Digit 8:** A 'V' shape of '8's is drawn using two `connect` calls and `fill`. A horizontal line of '7's is drawn above the 'V' using `hline` and `fill`. A 2x2 square of '3's is placed inside the 'V' using `crop` and `fill`.
* **Digit 3:** A vertical line of '1's is drawn using `vline` and `fill`.  A 2x2 square of '3's is placed below the line using `crop` and `fill`. A single '1' is added to the bottom right corner.


**Program Version 2:**

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = first(palette(I))
  Grid = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if d == 1:
    Grid = fill(Grid, 1, connect((0, 0), (4, 4)))
    Grid = fill(Grid, 3, crop(Grid, (5, 3), (2, 2)))
    for i in range(10):
      Grid = fill(Grid, 6, {(i, 9)})
  elif d == 8:
    Grid = fill(Grid, 8, connect((2, 6), (9, 9)) | connect((2, 6), (9, 3)))
    Grid = fill(Grid, 7, {(i, 2) for i in range(10)})
    Grid = fill(Grid, 3, crop(Grid, (3, 6), (2, 2)))
  elif d == 3:
    for i in range(10):
      Grid = fill(Grid, 1, {(i, 0)})
    Grid = fill(Grid, 3, crop(Grid, (6, 5), (2, 2)))
    Grid = fill(Grid, 1, {(9, 9)})
  return Grid
```

**Explanation:**

* Similar structure to Version 1, but uses loops for drawing vertical and horizontal lines.

**Program Version 3:**

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  val = first(palette(I))
  C = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if val == 1:
    C = fill(C, 1, {(i, i) for i in range(5)})
    C = fill(C, 3, crop(C, (5, 3), (2, 2)))
    C = fill(C, 6, {(i, 9) for i in range(10)})
  elif val == 8:
    C = fill(C, 8, {(i + 2, i + 6) for i in range(8)} | {(i + 2, 8 - i) for i in range(8)})
    C = fill(C, 7, {(i, 2) for i in range(10)})
    C = fill(C, 3, crop(C, (3, 6), (2, 2)))
  elif val == 3:
    C = fill(C, 1, {(i, 0) for i in range(10)})
    C = fill(C, 3, crop(C, (6, 5), (2, 2)))
    C = fill(C, 1, {(9, 9)})
  return C
```

**Explanation:**

* Similar structure to previous versions, but directly defines line and 'V' shape coordinates instead of using `connect`.

**Program Version 4:**

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  digit = first(palette(I))
  G = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if digit == 1:
    G = paint(G, recolor(1, connect((0, 0), (4, 4))))
    G = paint(G, recolor(3, crop(G, (5, 3), (2, 2))))
    G = paint(G, recolor(6, {(i, 9) for i in range(10)}))
  elif digit == 8:
    G = paint(G, recolor(8, {(i + 2, i + 6) for i in range(8)} | {(i + 2, 8 - i) for i in range(8)}))
    G = paint(G, recolor(7, {(i, 2) for i in range(10)}))
    G = paint(G, recolor(3, crop(G, (3, 6), (2, 2))))
  elif digit == 3:
    G = paint(G, recolor(1, {(i, 0) for i in range(10)}))
    G = paint(G, recolor(3, crop(G, (6, 5), (2, 2))))
    G = paint(G, recolor(1, {(9, 9)}))
  return G
```

**Explanation:**

* Similar structure to Version 3, but uses `paint` and `recolor` for filling shapes instead of `fill` directly.

**Program Version 5:**

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  d = first(palette(I))
  Grid = canvas(0, (10, 10))
  if d == 1:
    Grid = fill(Grid, 1, connect((4, 4), (0, 0)))
    Grid = fill(Grid, 6,  {(9, j) for j in range(10)})
    Grid = fill(Grid, 3, crop(Grid, (5, 3), (2, 2)))
  elif d == 8:
    Grid = fill(Grid, 8, connect((2, 6), (9, 9)) | connect((9, 3), (2, 6)))
    Grid = fill(Grid, 7, hline(2, 10))
    Grid = fill(Grid, 3, crop(Grid, (3, 6), (2, 2)))
  elif d == 3:
    Grid = fill(Grid, 1,  {(i, 0) for i in range(10)})
    Grid = fill(Grid, 3, crop(Grid, (6, 5), (2, 2)))
    Grid = fill(Grid, 1, {(9, 9)})
  return Grid
```

**Explanation:**
 * Similar structure to previous versions, but with minor variations in coordinate order and function usage. 

These five program versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL.
