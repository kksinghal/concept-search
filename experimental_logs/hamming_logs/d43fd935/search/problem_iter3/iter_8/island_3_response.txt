## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10,10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(I, hfrontier((4,0)))) # Horizontal line of input at row 5
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, vfrontier((0,0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, vfrontier((6,2))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(interval(3,5,1),interval(2,4,1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(interval(3,5,1),interval(5,7,1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5,1),(6,6),(9,4)})) 
  elif I == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, hfrontier((0,0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, hfrontier((5,0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, hfrontier((9,0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, connect((0,9),(9,0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(interval(2,4,1),interval(5,7,1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(1,7),(6,7),(7,2),(9,6)}))
  elif I == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, vfrontier((0,4))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(interval(6,8,1),interval(4,6,1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1,0),(5,0),(9,0),(9,9)}))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

- This version utilizes `hfrontier` and `vfrontier` for generating horizontal and vertical lines efficiently.
- It leverages `product` and `interval` to create rectangular shapes like squares.
- Individual elements are placed directly using their coordinates.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10,10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(I, {(4,j) for j in range(10)}))
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(i, 9-i) for i in range(10)})) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(i+6, i+2) for i in range(4)})) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i,j) for i in range(3,5) for j in range(2,4)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i,j) for i in range(3,5) for j in range(5,7)})) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5,1),(6,6),(9,4)})) 
  elif I == 8: 
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, 0) for i in range(10)})) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, 5) for i in range(10)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, 9) for i in range(10)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(9-i, i) for i in range(10)})) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i,j) for i in range(2,4) for j in range(5,7)})) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(1,7),(6,7),(7,2),(9,6)})) 
  elif I == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, 4) for i in range(10)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j) for i in range(6,8) for j in range(4,6)})) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1,0),(5,0),(9,0),(9,9)})) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version utilizes set comprehension within the `paint` and `recolor` functions for concise shape generation.
- It directly specifies the coordinates of individual elements.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10,10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(I, hfrontier((4,0)))) 
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((0,9), (9,0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((6,2), (9,5))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, crop(canvas(3,(10,10)),(3,2),(2,2)))) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, crop(canvas(3,(10,10)),(3,5),(2,2)))) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5,1),(6,6),(9,4)}))
  elif I == 8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, hfrontier((0,0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, hfrontier((5,0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, hfrontier((9,0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, connect((0,9),(9,0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, crop(canvas(3,(10,10)),(2,5),(2,2))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(1,7),(6,7),(7,2),(9,6)}))
  elif I == 2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, vfrontier((0,4))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, crop(canvas(3,(10,10)),(6,4),(2,2)))) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1,0),(5,0),(9,0),(9,9)}))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses the `connect` function to generate diagonal lines.
- It introduces the `crop` function along with `canvas` to extract specific rectangular regions (like squares) from a larger grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0,(10,10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, {(4, j) for j in range(10)}))
    if I == 1:
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((0, 9), (9, 0))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((6, 2), (9, 5))))
        for i in range(3, 5):
            for j in range(2, 4):
                O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j)}))
        for i in range(3, 5):
            for j in range(5, 7):
                O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5, 1), (6, 6), (9, 4)}))
    elif I == 8:
        O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, j) for i in range(10) for j in (0, 5, 9)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, connect((0, 9), (9, 0))))
        for i in range(2, 4):
            for j in range(5, 7):
                O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(1, 7), (6, 7), (7, 2), (9, 6)}))
    elif I == 2:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, 4) for i in range(10)}))
        for i in range(6, 8):
            for j in range(4, 6):
                O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1, 0), (5, 0), (9, 0), (9, 9)}))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version combines different approaches for clarity.
- It uses `connect` for diagonals and nested loops for precise placement of elements in squares.
- It utilizes set comprehension for efficiently drawing horizontal lines.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0,(10,10))
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, hfrontier((4, 0))))
    if I == 1:
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((9, 0), (0, 9))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((9, 5), (6, 2))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(interval(3, 5, 1), interval(2, 4, 1))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(product(interval(0, 2, 1), interval(0, 2, 1)), (3, 5))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5, 1), (6, 6), (9, 4)}))
    elif I == 8:
        for i in range(10):
            for j in (0, 5, 9):
                O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, j)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, connect((0, 9), (9, 0))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(product(interval(0, 2, 1), interval(0, 2, 1)), (2, 5))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(1, 7), (6, 7), (7, 2), (9, 6)}))
    elif I == 2:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, 4) for i in range(10)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(product(interval(0, 2, 1), interval(0, 2, 1)), (6, 4))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1, 0), (5, 0), (9, 0), (9, 9)}))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version demonstrates a combination of techniques for shape generation and placement.
- It uses `connect` for diagonals, `product` and `shift` for creating and positioning squares, and nested loops for specific placements.


These five versions showcase a variety of approaches to achieve the desired transformations, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version employs a distinct combination of functions and logic, demonstrating the potential for diverse solutions to the same problem.
