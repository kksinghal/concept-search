## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to embed the input digit into a larger 10x10 grid with a specific pattern for each input digit. Let's break down the pattern for each:

**Input 1:** 

* Forms a shape resembling the number '6' using the digits '1', '3', and '6'. 
* The input '1' acts as a seed for the pattern placement.

**Input 8:**

* Creates a scattered pattern using digits '3', '7', and '8'.
* The input '8' determines the primary locations for the pattern.

**Input 2:**

* Generates a simple pattern with digits '1' and '3'. 
* Input '2' dictates the central column for the pattern.

## Program_to_be_generated:

It's impossible to generate the exact code without knowing the complete DSL and having access to the two unprovided programs you mentioned. However, I can offer five distinct approaches and code snippets using the provided DSL functions, assuming they are sufficient for the task:

**Version 1: Object-Based Approach**

```python
def solve_version1(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0]) # Extract digit from input
  O = canvas(0, (10,10)) # Initialize empty canvas
  if digit == 1:
    obj = toobject(frozenset({(0,0),(1,8),(2,8),(3,3),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(3,7),(4,3),(4,4),(5,8),(6,8),(7,8),(8,8),(9,2)}), O)
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, obj))
    obj = toobject(frozenset({(3,2),(4,2),(5,2),(6,2),(7,2),(8,2)}), O)
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, obj))
    obj = toobject(frozenset({(3,1),(4,1)}), O)
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, obj))
  # Similar logic for digit 8 and 2
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Input Digit:**  Extract the digit from the input 'I'.
2. **Initialize Canvas:** Create an empty 10x10 grid 'O' filled with zeros.
3. **Pattern Generation:**
    *  For each digit (1, 8, 2), define the pattern using `frozenset` representing cell indices.
    * Use `toobject` to create objects on the canvas based on the pattern.
    *  Use `recolor` to assign the correct digit to the object.
    *  Use `paint` to draw the object onto the canvas.

**Version 2:  Conditional Filling**

```python
def solve_version2(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0]) 
  O = canvas(0, (10,10))
  if digit == 1:
    for i in range(10):
      for j in range(10):
        if (i == 0 and j == 0) or (i == 9 and j == 2) or  \
           (j == 8 and i in [1,2,5,6,7,8]) or \
           (i in [3,4] and j in [3,4,5,6,7]) or \
           (i in [3,4,5,6,7,8] and j == 2):
          O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({(i,j)}))
        # ... Similar logic for other digits and their patterns ...
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify Digit:** Extract the digit from the input.
2.  **Initialize Canvas:** Create a 10x10 grid of zeros.
3. **Conditional Filling:**
    *  Use nested loops to iterate through each cell of the grid.
    *   For each digit, define conditions based on cell indices (i, j) to determine if a cell should be filled.
    *  Use `fill` to place the digit at the specified location if the condition is met.

**Version 3: Symmetry and Transformations**

This version leverages symmetry and grid transformations to reduce code duplication. I'll outline the approach, but the specific implementation depends on the patterns' symmetrical properties:

```python
def solve_version3(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0])
  O = canvas(0, (10,10))
  if digit == 1:
    base_pattern = frozenset({(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)}) # Define a base pattern
    # Apply transformations (shift, mirror, rotate) to base_pattern 
    # to construct the full pattern for digit '1'
    # ... 
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, transformed_pattern)) # Paint the transformed pattern
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Base Pattern:**  Identify repeating or symmetrical elements within the digit's pattern and define a 'base pattern'.
2. **Transformations:**  Use DSL functions like `shift`, `hmirror`, `vmirror`, `rot90`, etc., to create the full pattern from the base pattern.
3. **Painting:** Similar to previous versions, paint the transformed pattern onto the canvas.

**Version 4:  Run-Length Encoding (RLE)**

This approach represents patterns efficiently using run-length encoding, especially for patterns with long stretches of the same digit. 

```python
def solve_version4(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0])
  O = canvas(0, (10,10))
  if digit == 1:
    rle_pattern = [(1,1), (0,8), (1,1), (0,5), (1,4), ...] # Example RLE pattern
    # ... Logic to decode RLE and fill the grid ...
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **RLE Pattern:** Represent the pattern using pairs of (digit, run-length). For example, (1, 3) means three consecutive '1's.
2. **Decoding and Filling:** Iterate through the RLE pattern and use DSL functions like `fill` to draw the pattern on the canvas.

**Version 5:  Mathematical/Logical Formulas**

If the patterns exhibit mathematical or logical relationships between cell indices and digit values, you can express them directly.

```python
def solve_version5(I):
  digit = int(str(I)[0])
  O = canvas(0, (10,10))
  for i in range(10):
    for j in range(10):
      if digit == 1 and (i * j) % 7 == 0 and i + j > 2: # Example formula
        O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({(i,j)}))
      # ... Similar formulas for other digits ... 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Formulate Relationships:**  Analyze the patterns and derive mathematical or logical expressions that hold true for the cell indices where a specific digit should be placed.
2. **Apply Formulas:**  Use these formulas in conditional statements to selectively fill the grid using DSL functions.

Remember that these are just conceptual approaches. You'll need to adapt them based on the complete DSL and the specific patterns you are trying to generate.
