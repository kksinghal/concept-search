## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve taking the input digit and using it to paint specific patterns on a 10x10 canvas. The patterns are different for each input digit. 

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input 0 - Output 0:**

- A horizontal line of the input digit (1) is drawn at the 5th row.
- Diagonal lines of digit 6 are drawn starting from the bottom left and top right corners, converging at the center.
- Two 2x2 squares of digit 3 are drawn above the horizontal line.
- Single cells of digit 6 are scattered around the diagonal lines.

**Input 1 - Output 1:**

- A diagonal line of the input digit (8) is drawn from top right to bottom left.
- Two horizontal lines of digit 7 are drawn, one at the top and one at the bottom.
- A 2x2 square of digit 3 is drawn at the center.
- Single cells of digit 8 are scattered around the diagonal line.

**Input 2 - Output 2:**

- A vertical line of the input digit (1) is drawn at the 6th column. 
- Two horizontal lines of digit 3 are drawn to the right of the vertical line.
- Single cells of digit 1 are scattered around the vertical line.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10,10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(I, hfrontier((4,0)))) # Horizontal line of input digit at row 5
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((0,9),(9,9)))) # Diagonal line of 6 from bottom left
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, connect((9,0),(0,9)))) # Diagonal line of 6 from top right
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5,1),(6,6),(9,4)})) # Scattered 6s
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(interval(3,5,1), interval(3,5,1)))) # 2x2 square of 3 (left)
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(interval(3,5,1), interval(6,8,1)))) # 2x2 square of 3 (right)
  elif color(obj) == 8: # Transformation for input 8
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, connect((2,7),(7,2)))) # Diagonal line of 8
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(3,7),(5,1),(6,8)})) # Scattered 8s
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, connect((0,1),(9,1)))) # Top horizontal line of 7
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, connect((0,6),(9,6)))) # Bottom horizontal line of 7
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, product(interval(3,5,1), interval(5,7,1)))) # 2x2 square of 3
  elif color(obj) == 2: # Transformation for input 2
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, connect((2,4),(5,4)))) # Vertical line of 1
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(6,4),(7,4)})) # Horizontal line of 3 (right)
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1,4),(5,9),(9,1)})) # Scattered 1s
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Starts with a 10x10 canvas of 0s.
- Draws the base pattern based on the input digit `I`.
- Uses `hfrontier` to draw the horizontal line.
- Uses `connect` to draw diagonal and vertical lines.
- Uses `product` and `interval` to draw the squares.
- Uses set notation `{}` to place individual cells.

**Program Version 2** (Using loops)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10,10))
  for j in range(10):
    O = paint(O, recolor(I, {(4,j)})) # Horizontal line at row 5
  if I == 1:
    for i in range(10):
      O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(i, 9-i)})) # Diagonal from bottom left
      O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(i, i)})) # Diagonal from top right 
    for i in range(3,5):
      for j in range(3,8,3): # Two squares of 3
        for k in range(2):
          O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j+k)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5,1),(6,6),(9,4)})) # Scattered 6s
  elif I == 8: # Transformation for input 8
    for i in range(6): 
      O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(2+i, 7-i)})) # Diagonal of 8 
    for i in range(10):
      O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, 1)})) # Top line of 7
      O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, 6)})) # Bottom line of 7
    for i in range(3,5):
      for j in range(5, 7): # Square of 3
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, j)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(3,7),(5,1),(6,8)})) # Scattered 8s
  elif I == 2: # Transformation for input 2
    for i in range(1,6):
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, 4)})) # Vertical line of 1
    for i in range(2):
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(6+i, 4)})) # Horizontal line of 3
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1,4),(5,9),(9,1)})) # Scattered 1s 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version utilizes loops to draw the lines and squares, offering a more concise approach.

**Program Version 3** (Functional approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10,10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(I, {(4,j) for j in range(10)})) # Horizontal line at row 5
  if I == 1:
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(i, 9-i) for i in range(10)})) # Diagonal from bottom left
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(i, i) for i in range(10)})) # Diagonal from top right
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i,j) for i in range(3,5) for j in range(3,5)})) # Square 1
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i,j) for i in range(3,5) for j in range(6,8)})) # Square 2
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5,1),(6,6),(9,4)})) # Scattered 6s
  elif I == 8: # Transformation for input 8
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(2+i, 7-i) for i in range(6)})) # Diagonal of 8
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, 1) for i in range(10)})) # Top line of 7
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i, 6) for i in range(10)})) # Bottom line of 7
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i,j) for i in range(3,5) for j in range(5,7)})) # Square of 3
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(3,7),(5,1),(6,8)})) # Scattered 8s
  elif I == 2: # Transformation for input 2
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i, 4) for i in range(1,6)})) # Vertical line of 1
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(6+i, 4) for i in range(2)})) # Horizontal line of 3
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1,4),(5,9),(9,1)})) # Scattered 1s
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version emphasizes a functional programming style by using set comprehension to define the lines and squares within the `paint` and `recolor` functions.

**Program Version 4** (Using `shift`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10,10))
  O = paint(O, recolor(I, hfrontier((4,0)))) # Horizontal line of input at row 5
  if I == 1:
    diag = recolor(6, connect((0,0),(9,9)))
    O = paint(O, diag) # Main diagonal
    O = paint(O, hmirror(diag)) # Mirrored diagonal
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(product(interval(0,2,1), interval(0,2,1)), (3,3)))) # Square 1
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(product(interval(0,2,1), interval(0,2,1)), (3,6)))) # Square 2
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(5,1),(6,6),(9,4)})) # Scattered 6s
  elif I == 8: # Transformation for input 8
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, connect((2,7),(7,2)))) # Diagonal of 8
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(3,7),(5,1),(6,8)})) # Scattered 8s
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, hfrontier((0,1)))) # Top horizontal line of 7
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, hfrontier((0,6)))) # Bottom horizontal line of 7
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(product(interval(0,2,1), interval(0,2,1)), (3,5)))) # 2x2 square of 3
  elif I == 2: # Transformation for input 2
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, connect((2,4),(5,4)))) # Vertical line of 1
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(6,4),(7,4)})) # Horizontal line of 3
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(1,4),(5,9),(9,1)})) # Scattered 1s 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Employs the `shift` function to position the squares, demonstrating a different approach to spatial manipulation.

**Program Version 5** (Conditional painting)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (10,10))
  for i in range(10):
    for j in range(10):
      if i == 4: O = paint(O, recolor(I, {(i,j)})) # Horizontal line
      if I == 1:
        if i == 9-j or i == j: O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(i,j)})) # Diagonals
        if 3 <= i <= 4 and 3 <= j <= 7 and (j-3)%3 != 2: O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i,j)})) # Squares
        if (i,j) in {(5,1),(6,6),(9,4)}: O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(i,j)})) # Scattered 6s
      elif I == 8:
        if i+j == 9 and 2 <= i <= 7: O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i,j)})) # Diagonal
        if i in range(10) and j in {1,6}: O = paint(O, recolor(7, {(i,j)})) # Horizontals
        if 3 <= i <= 4 and 5 <= j <= 6: O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i,j)})) # Square
        if (i,j) in {(3,7),(5,1),(6,8)}: O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i,j)})) # Scattered 8s
      elif I == 2:
        if 1 <= i <= 5 and j == 4: O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i,j)})) # Vertical
        if i in {6,7} and j == 4: O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i,j)})) # Horizontal
        if (i,j) in {(1,4),(5,9),(9,1)}: O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(i,j)})) # Scattered 1s
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates through every cell of the grid and paints it based on conditions derived from the input digit and cell location. This approach showcases conditional logic within the DSL.


These five versions offer diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformation using the provided DSL functions, showcasing different programming styles and logical constructs. Each version aims to provide a unique solution while achieving the same output for the given input grids.
