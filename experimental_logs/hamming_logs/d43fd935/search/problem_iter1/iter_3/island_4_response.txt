## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to involve extending objects horizontally to the right, but only until encountering another object or reaching the edge of the grid.  Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
* The '3' object extends right to meet the '1' object.
* The top-right '6' object extends right to the edge.
* The bottom '6' object extends right to meet the other '6' objects.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
* The '3' object extends right to meet the '8' object.
* The '7' objects extend right to meet either the '8' object or the edge.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
* The '1' objects extend right to meet either the edge or another '1' object. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct code versions for the "Program_to_be_generated":

**Program Version 1:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False) 
  for obj in objs:
    for c, (i, j) in obj:
      for k in range(j + 1, width(I)):
        if (i, k) in toindices(merge(objs - {obj})):
          break
        I = fill(I, c, frozenset({(i, k)}))
  return I 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Extract all objects from the input grid `I` using `objects(I, True, False, False)`. This considers connected cells with the same color as single objects and includes background objects.
2. **Iterate and extend:** For each object `obj`:
    * Iterate through its cells `(i, j)`.
    * Extend the object to the right (increasing column `k`) until it encounters a cell belonging to a different object or reaches the edge of the grid.
    * Update the grid `I` by filling the extended cells with the object's color `c`.
3. **Return:** Return the modified grid.

**Program Version 2:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda x: recolor(color(x), connect(ulcorner(x), (ulcorner(x)[0], width(I) - 1))), objects(I, True, False, False))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extract all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Extend Objects:** For each object, draw a horizontal line from its upper-left corner to the right edge of the grid using `connect` and recolor it with the object's color using `recolor`.
3. **Paint Objects:** Merge all extended objects and paint them onto the original grid, effectively overwriting any empty cells with the extended object colors.

**Program Version 3:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for j in range(width(I) - 1):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I):
        I = fill(I, I[i][j], frozenset({(i, k) for k in range(j + 1, width(I)) if I[i][k] == mostcolor(I)}))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns:** Iterate over each column `j` of the grid.
2. **Check for object edge:** For each cell `(i, j)`, check if it's part of an object (not the background color) and if the cell to its right `(i, j+1)` is background.
3. **Extend object:** If so, fill all subsequent background cells to the right in that row with the object's color.

**Program Version 4:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for i in range(height(I)):
    current_color = None
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and current_color is None:
        current_color = I[i][j]
      elif current_color is not None and I[i][j] == mostcolor(I):
        I = fill(I, current_color, frozenset({(i, j)}))
      else:
        current_color = None
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Row-Wise:** Traverse each row `i` of the grid.
2. **Track Current Color:** Maintain `current_color` to remember the color of the ongoing object in the row.
3. **Extend When Applicable:** If an object's color is encountered (`current_color` is set) and the current cell is background, fill it with `current_color`, effectively extending the object.
4. **Reset Tracking:**  Reset `current_color` when a new object or the background is encountered to accurately extend only contiguous objects. 

**Program Version 5:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: toobject(connect(ulcorner(obj), (ulcorner(obj)[0], rightmost(obj) + width(obj) - 1)), I), objects(I, True, False, False)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extract all objects from the grid.
2. **Calculate Extension:** For each object, determine the extension length, which is its width.
3. **Create Extended Line:** Generate a line representing the extended object using `connect` from the object's upper-left corner to the calculated extension point.
4. **Convert to Object:** Transform the extended line into an object, assigning the object's color to each index within the line.
5. **Paint onto Grid:**  Merge all extended objects and paint them onto the original grid, replacing any empty cells.

These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation. Each utilizes different DSL function combinations and logical flow, ensuring diversity in the proposed solutions.
