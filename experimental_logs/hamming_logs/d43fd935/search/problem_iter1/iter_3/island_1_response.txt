## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending the objects horizontally towards the right edge of the grid, but only if they are not already touching the right edge. Objects touching the right edge remain unchanged. Let's break down each example:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
* The '1' objects in the top-left and bottom-left corners are extended to the right edge.
* The '3' object is extended to the right, stopping just before the pre-existing '1'.
* The '6' objects on the right side remain unchanged as they are already touching the right edge.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
* The top and bottom '7' objects are extended to the right edge.
* The central '7' object is extended rightwards until it reaches a pre-existing '3'.
* The '8' objects, some of which touch the right edge, remain unchanged.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
* The '1' objects in the leftmost column are extended rightwards, each stopping just before a pre-existing '1' or reaching the edge. 

## Code Generation:

### Program Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    i, j = ulcorner(obj)
    if j != width(I) - 1: # Check if object touches right edge
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))})
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)  # Keep the object as is
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** A canvas `O` is created with the background color and the same shape as the input grid `I`.
2. **Object Iteration:** The code iterates through each non-background object in the input grid.
3. **Edge Detection:** For each object, it checks if its rightmost point touches the right edge of the grid.
4. **Conditional Filling:** If the object doesn't touch the right edge, it fills the canvas horizontally from the object's leftmost point to the right edge with the object's color. 
5. **Preservation:** If the object touches the right edge, it is painted directly onto the canvas without modification.

### Program Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    if rightmost(obj) < width(I) - 1:  # Check if object touches right edge
      O = fill(O, color(obj), product({uppermost(obj)}, interval(leftmost(obj), width(I), 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Modification:** This version modifies the input grid `I` directly to create the output `O`.
2. **Right Edge Check:**  It iterates through objects and checks if their rightmost point is less than the grid's right edge index.
3. **Cartesian Product Filling:** If not touching the right edge, it uses `product` to generate indices for a horizontal line from the object's leftmost point to the right edge and fills them with the object's color.

### Program Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    right_edge = {(uppermost(obj), width(I) - 1)}
    if not intersection(toindices(obj), right_edge): # Check for intersection with right edge
      O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), backdrop(obj) & product({uppermost(obj)}, interval(0, width(I), 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Intersection Check:** This version checks if the object's indices intersect with a set representing the rightmost column of the grid.
2. **Backdrop and Line Intersection:** If no intersection, it calculates the intersection between the object's backdrop and a horizontal line spanning the entire grid width. 
3. **Recoloring and Painting:** It recolors this intersection with the object's color and paints it onto the output grid.

### Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value != mostcolor(I):  # Check for non-background color
        O = fill(O, value, {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))})  # Fill to the right edge
        break  # Move to the next row once an object is encountered
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Row-wise Iteration:** This version iterates through each cell of the input grid row by row.
2. **Non-Background Check:** It checks if a cell's color is not the background color.
3. **Horizontal Fill and Break:**  If not background, it fills the output grid horizontally from that cell's position to the right edge and then moves to the next row, preventing overlapping fills. 

### Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    if any(j == width(I) - 1 for _, j in toindices(obj)):  # Check if any cell touches right edge
      continue  # Skip to the next object
    O = fill(O, color(obj), {(uppermost(obj), j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), width(I))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Any-Cell Edge Check:** It checks if *any* cell within the object touches the right edge using `any` function. 
2. **Conditional Skip:** If any cell touches the edge, the loop skips to the next object.
3. **Horizontal Fill:** Otherwise, it fills the output grid horizontally from the object's leftmost point to the right edge.
