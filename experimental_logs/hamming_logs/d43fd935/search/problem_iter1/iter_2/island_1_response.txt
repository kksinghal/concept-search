## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the grid (considering diagonal connections) and extending them horizontally until they hit another object or the grid boundary. The object's color remains unchanged during the extension.

**Input 0:**
- The '1' objects at (0,0) and (9,4) extend rightward until the boundary.
- The '3' object extends rightward until hitting the '1' object.
- The '6' objects remain unchanged as they already touch other objects or boundaries on both sides.

**Input 1:**
- The '7' objects at (0,1) and (9,6) extend rightward until the boundary.
- The '7' object at (2,3) extends rightward to touch the '3' object.
- The '8' objects at (0,6) and (7,3) extend rightward to the boundary.
- The '8' object at (2,9) extends leftward to touch the '3' object.

**Input 2:**
- The '1' objects at (2,1), (5,9), and (1,4) extend rightward until the boundary.
- The '1' object at (1,1) extends rightward until it hits the '1' object at (1,4).
- The '3' object remains unchanged as it already touches the boundary.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, F):
    start_j = leftmost(obj)
    end_j = rightmost(obj)
    if start_j > 0 and index(I, (uppermost(obj), start_j - 1)) == 0:
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(uppermost(obj), j) for j in range(start_j)})
    if end_j < width(I) - 1 and index(I, (uppermost(obj), end_j + 1)) == 0:
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(uppermost(obj), j) for j in range(end_j + 1, width(I))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:**  The code iterates over each object in the input grid using `objects(I, T, T, F)`. 
2. **Check left and right:** For each object, it checks if the cells to the left and right are empty (value 0).
3. **Extend if empty:** If an empty cell is found, it fills the row from the object's edge to that cell using the object's color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, F):
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      O = fill(O, color(obj), shoot((i,j), (0, 1)))
      O = fill(O, color(obj), shoot((i,j), (0, -1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Shoot:** The code iterates through each cell of every object and draws horizontal lines (using `shoot`) in both directions using the object's color.
2. **Overlapping fills:** The lines overlap, effectively filling the row from the object to the boundaries or other objects.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, F)
  extensions = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for x in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1):
      extensions.add((color(obj), (uppermost(obj), x)))
  return paint(I, frozenset(extensions))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate Extensions:** The code first finds all objects. Then, for each object, it identifies the row it's on and creates a set of cells (`extensions`) representing the horizontal extension with the object's color.
2. **Paint Extensions:** Finally, it paints the `extensions` onto the original grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, F):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      for k in range(j + 1, width(I)):
        if index(I, (i, k)) != 0:
          break
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, k)})
      for k in range(j - 1, -1, -1):
        if index(I, (i, k)) != 0:
          break
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, k)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Empty Canvas:** It creates an empty canvas of the same size as the input using the background color.
2. **Paint and Extend:** It iterates through each object, paints it onto the canvas, and then extends each cell horizontally until hitting another non-empty cell or the boundary.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    current_color = None
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != 0:
        current_color = index(I, (i, j))
      elif current_color is not None:
        O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Row-wise iteration:** This program iterates through the grid row by row.
2. **Track and Fill:** It remembers the last encountered non-empty color (`current_color`) and fills empty cells with it until encountering another non-empty cell.
