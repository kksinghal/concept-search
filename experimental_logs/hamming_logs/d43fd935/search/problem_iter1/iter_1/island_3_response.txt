## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit, excluding the background) and extending them horizontally towards the right, until they encounter another object or the edge of the grid.

**Example:**

In Input_0, the '1' at (3,8) gets extended to the right to become '1 1 1 1 1' in Output_0.

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**

* The '1's at (3,8) and (9,4) extend rightward. 
* The '6's remain unchanged as they are already blocked on the right. 
* The '3's remain unchanged as they are already blocked on the right.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**

* The '7's at (1,1), (3,3), (9,5) extend rightward.
* The '8's at (1,6), (6,1), (7,8) extend rightward.
* The '3's remain unchanged as they are already blocked on the right.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**

* The '1's at (2,1), (1,4), (5,9), (6,4) extend rightward.
* The '3's remain unchanged as they are already blocked on the right.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)  # Identify objects excluding background
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for x, y in toindices(obj):
      for j in range(y + 1, width(I)):
        if index(I, (x, j)) == mostcolor(I):
          O = fill(O, I[x][y], {(x, j)})
        else:
          break  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, F, F, T)` identifies all objects in the input grid `I`, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** For each object:
    * Iterate through its cell coordinates (`x`, `y`).
    * Extend rightward from each cell (`j` from `y + 1` to grid width).
    * Fill with the object's color (`I[x][y]`) if the cell is background (`mostcolor(I)`).
    * Stop extending if a non-background cell is encountered (`break`).
3. **Return Output:** Return the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** Iterate through each cell of the grid.
2. **Check for Extension:** If a cell is not background and its right neighbor is background, fill the neighbor with the cell's color.
3. **Return Output:** Return the modified grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    w = width(obj)
    O = paint(O, obj)
    for x, y in toindices(obj):
      O = fill(O, I[x][y], {(x, y + w)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify objects (excluding background).
2. **Create Canvas:** Create an empty canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
3. **Process Objects:** For each object:
    * Paint the object onto the canvas.
    * Extend the object rightward by its width, filling with its color.
4. **Return Output:** Return the modified canvas. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    current_color = mostcolor(I)  
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        current_color = I[i][j] 
      else:
        O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Track:** Iterate through each row, tracking the current non-background color encountered.
2. **Fill Background:** If a background cell is found, fill it with the tracked color.
3. **Return Output:** Return the modified grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      for j in range(leftmost_j + 1, width(I)):
        if I[i][j] == mostcolor(I):
          O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j)})
        else:
          break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify objects (excluding background).
2. **Iterate and Extend:** For each object:
    * Get the leftmost column index (`leftmost_j`).
    * Iterate through rows within the object's bounding box.
    * Extend rightward from `leftmost_j + 1`, filling with the object's color if background.
    * Stop extending if a non-background cell is encountered.
3. **Return Output:** Return the modified grid.

These five versions provide diverse implementations for the desired transformation, employing different strategies and combinations of DSL functions.
