## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same color) and extending objects with color '1' horizontally to connect with other objects of the same color. 

**Input_0:**
* The object at (0,0) extends right to connect with the object at (3,8). 
* The object at (9,0) extends left to connect with the object at (3,8).

**Input_1:**
* The object at (1,0) extends right to connect with the object at (8,9).
* The object at (8,0) extends left and down to connect with objects at (3,7) and (5,6).

**Input_2:** 
* This input shows that only objects with color '1' are extended.
* All objects of color '1' extend right to the next adjacent object of color '1'. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  one_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1)
  for obj1 in one_objs:
    for obj2 in one_objs:
      if obj1 != obj2 and hmatching(obj1, obj2):
        I = fill(I, 1, product(interval(uppermost(obj1), lowermost(obj1)+1, 1), interval(leftmost(obj1), rightmost(obj2)+1, 1)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  We use `objects(I, False, False, True)` to identify all connected objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Filter Color '1':**  We use `colorfilter(objs, 1)` to isolate objects with color '1'.
3. **Iterate and Connect:** We iterate through each pair of color '1' objects.
   *  `hmatching(obj1, obj2)` checks if the objects share a common row.
   * If they do, we calculate the bounding box (`uppermost`, `lowermost`, `leftmost`, `rightmost`) of the two objects and use `fill` to fill the space between them with color '1'.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)-1):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j+1] != 1:
        k = j + 1
        while k < width(I) and I[i][k] != 1:
          k += 1
        if k < width(I) and I[i][k] == 1:
          I = fill(I, 1, {(i, l) for l in range(j+1, k)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:**  We iterate through each cell in the grid.
2. **Find Color '1' Edge:** If a cell has color '1' and the cell to its right is not color '1', we've found a potential edge to extend.
3. **Search for Matching Color:** We scan right from the edge until we find another cell with color '1'.
4. **Fill if Match Found:** If a matching color is found, we fill the space between the edge and the matching cell with color '1'.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
    if color(obj) == 1:
      right_edge = {(i, rightmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj)+1)}
      for j in range(rightmost(obj)+1, width(I)):
        if any(index(I, (i,j)) == 1 for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj)+1)):
          I = fill(I, 1, product(interval(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj)+1, 1), interval(rightmost(obj)+1, j+1, 1)))
          break
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We identify all objects in the grid (excluding background).
2. **Filter Color '1':**  We process only objects with color '1'.
3. **Define Right Edge:** For each object, define the rightmost column as the 'right edge'.
4. **Scan and Fill:** Scan right from the edge, column by column. If we encounter a column that contains color '1' within the object's row range, fill the space between the edge and that column with color '1' and stop scanning.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for i in range(height(I)):
    start_j = None
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        if start_j is not None:
          I = fill(I, 1, {(i, k) for k in range(start_j+1, j)})
          start_j = None
        else:
          start_j = j
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate by Rows:** Iterate through each row of the grid.
2. **Track Color '1' Segments:**  Maintain a variable `start_j` to keep track of the starting column index of a color '1' segment. 
3. **Fill Between Segments:**  When another color '1' cell is encountered:
   - If `start_j` is not None (meaning a previous segment exists), fill the space between the segments. 
   - Update `start_j` to the current column.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
    if color(obj) == 1:
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj)+1):
        rightmost_j = max(j for j in range(width(I)) if I[i][j] == 1)
        if rightmost_j > rightmost(obj):
          I = fill(I, 1, {(i, j) for j in range(rightmost(obj)+1, rightmost_j+1)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We identify all objects (excluding background).
2. **Focus on Color '1':** We process only objects with color '1'.
3. **Find Rightmost '1' in Row:** For each row within the object, find the rightmost occurrence of color '1'.
4. **Extend if Necessary:** If the rightmost '1' is beyond the object's current boundary, fill the space between the object's right edge and the rightmost '1'.
