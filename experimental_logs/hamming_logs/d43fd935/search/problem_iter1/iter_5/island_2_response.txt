## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the smallest object in the grid (excluding the background) and extending its color horizontally and vertically until it hits another object or the grid boundary. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The smallest object is the single '1' cell. It expands horizontally to the right and downwards, stopping at the '3' and '6' objects respectively.
* **Input_1:** The smallest object is any of the single '7' cells. Expansion happens similarly, hitting other '7's, '3's and '8's.
* **Input_2:** Similar to Input_0, the single '1' cells expand until they hit the '3' object or the grid boundary.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions for the "Program_to_be_generated" function:


### Program Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  smallest = argmin(objects(I, T, F, T), size)
  target_color = color(smallest)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), smallest)
  for cell in toindices(smallest):
    for direction in [RIGHT, DOWN]:
      for dist in range(1, 10):
        next_cell = add(cell, multiply(direction, dist))
        if next_cell in backdrop(merge(objects(I, T, F, T))):
          if index(O, next_cell) == mostcolor(I):
            O = fill(O, target_color, {next_cell})
          else:
            break
        else:
          break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the smallest object and its color:**  Similar to previous programs.
2. **Initialize the output grid:** Create a blank canvas filled with the background color and paint the smallest object onto it.
3. **Iterate through each cell of the smallest object:** 
4. **Iterate through horizontal and vertical directions:** For each cell, we check in both right and down directions.
5. **Expand in the current direction:** Check if the next cell in the direction is within the grid and is background. If so, fill it with the target color. If it encounters another object, stop expanding in that direction.

### Program Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if size(obj) == size(argmin(objects(I, T, F, T), size)):
      for cell in toindices(obj):
        O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), shoot(cell, RIGHT) & backdrop(merge(objects(I, T, F, T))) - toindices(obj)))
        O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), shoot(cell, DOWN) & backdrop(merge(objects(I, T, F, T))) - toindices(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through all objects:** This version iterates directly through all objects in the input grid.
2. **Identify the smallest object:** Inside the loop, it checks if the current object's size matches the smallest object's size.
3. **Expand the object:** For each cell of the smallest object, it shoots a line to the right and down, finding the intersection with other objects' backdrop. It then paints those intersection points with the target color, effectively expanding the object.

### Program Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    smallest = argmin(objs, size)
    target_color = color(smallest)
    O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), smallest)
    for cell in toindices(smallest):
        right_expansion = shoot(cell, RIGHT) & backdrop(merge(objs))
        O = paint(O, recolor(target_color, right_expansion - toindices(smallest)))
        down_expansion = shoot(cell, DOWN) & backdrop(merge(objs))
        O = paint(O, recolor(target_color, down_expansion - toindices(smallest)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find smallest object and its color:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Initialize output grid:** Same as previous versions.
3. **Iterate through each cell of smallest object:** 
4. **Calculate horizontal and vertical expansion:** For each cell, calculate the potential expansion areas using 'shoot' and 'backdrop' functions. Remove the cell itself from the expansion area.
5. **Paint the expansion:** Paint the calculated expansion areas with the target color on the output grid.

### Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  smallest = argmin(objects(I, T, F, T), size)
  c = color(smallest)
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) == c:
        k = j + 1
        while k < width(I) and index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I):
          O = fill(O, c, {(i, k)})
          k += 1
        k = i + 1
        while k < height(I) and index(I, (k, j)) == mostcolor(I):
          O = fill(O, c, {(k, j)})
          k += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find smallest object and its color:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Iterate through each cell in the grid:**
3. **Check for the target color:** If a cell has the target color, initiate expansion.
4. **Expand right and down:** Using while loops, expand rightwards and downwards until encountering a non-background cell or the grid boundary.

### Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  t = color(argmin(objects(I, T, F, T), size))
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(objects(I, T, F, T)))
  for x, y in toindices(merge(objects(I, T, F, T))):
    if index(I, (x, y)) == t:
      a = y + 1
      while a < width(I) and index(I, (x, a)) == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, t, {(x, a)})
        a += 1
      a = x + 1
      while a < height(I) and index(I, (a, y)) == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, t, {(a, y)})
        a += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the target color:** Directly find the color of the smallest object.
2. **Initialize output grid:** Create a canvas containing all objects from the input grid.
3. **Iterate through all object cells:** 
4. **Check for the target color:** If a cell has the target color, initiate expansion.
5. **Expand right and down:** Similar to version 4, use while loops to expand horizontally and vertically.


These five versions offer distinct approaches to the problem, utilizing different combinations of DSL functions and logical structures. Each version achieves the same goal of extending the smallest object's color while maintaining the integrity of other objects on the grid.
