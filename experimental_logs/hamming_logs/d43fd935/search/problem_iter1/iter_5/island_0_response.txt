## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) on the grid and extending them horizontally towards the right, until they encounter another object or the grid boundary. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** 
* The '1' object at the top right corner extends rightward until the boundary.
* The '1' object at the bottom left corner extends rightward until the boundary.
* The '3' object extends rightward, filling the space with '1's until it reaches the extended '1' object.
* The '6' objects remain unchanged as they are already touching either another object or the grid boundary.

**Pair 1:**
* The '7' objects extend rightward, filling with '7's, until they encounter either the '8' object or the grid boundary.
* The '8' objects remain unchanged as they are already touching other objects.
* The '3' object remains unchanged as it is enclosed by other objects.

**Pair 2:**
* All '1' objects extend rightward, filling with '1's, until they encounter either the grid boundary or another '1' object that has already been extended.
* The '3' object remains unchanged as it is enclosed by the extended '1' objects. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions ("Program_to_be_generated") that achieve the described transformation:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for obj in objects(grid, T, F, F):  # Iterate over all objects in the grid
    direction = (0, 1)  # Set the extension direction to the right
    current = centerofmass(obj)
    while index(grid, add(current, direction)) not in palette(obj): # While not encountering same object
      if bordering(shift(obj, add(current, direction)), grid):
        break  # Stop at the grid border
      grid = paint(grid, recolor(color(obj), shift(obj, add(current, direction)))) # Paint the extension
      current = add(current, direction)  # Move to the next cell in the direction
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over objects:** The program iterates through each object on the grid.
2. **Set extension direction:** The `direction` is set to `(0, 1)`, indicating a rightward extension.
3. **Extend until encountering another object or border:** The `while` loop continues extending the object in the given direction until it encounters another object with the same color or reaches the grid boundary.
4. **Paint the extension:** In each iteration, the `paint` function colors the next cell in the direction with the object's color, effectively extending the object.
5. **Return the transformed grid:** After processing all objects, the program returns the modified grid.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for j in range(width(grid) - 1):  # Iterate over each column except the last
    for i in range(height(grid)):  # Iterate over each row
      if index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcommon(grid) and index(grid, (i, j + 1)) == mostcommon(grid):  # Check if current cell is object and next cell is background
        grid = paint(grid, recolor(index(grid, (i, j)), {(i, j + 1)}))  # Extend the object to the right
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over columns and rows:** The program uses nested loops to traverse the grid column by column, from left to right.
2. **Identify object edges:** It checks if the current cell belongs to an object (not the background color) and the cell to its right is part of the background.
3. **Extend the object:** If the condition is met, the program extends the object by painting the cell to the right with the object's color.
4. **Return the transformed grid:** After processing all columns, the program returns the modified grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  processed = canvas(mostcommon(grid), shape(grid)) # Create empty canvas
  for obj in order(objects(grid, T, F, F), lambda o: -leftmost(o)): # Iterate over objects from right to left
    extended_obj = obj
    for j in range(leftmost(obj), width(grid)): # Extend each object to the right
      extended_obj = extended_obj | recolor(color(obj), {(uppermost(obj), j)})
    processed = paint(processed, extended_obj)
  return processed
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create an empty canvas:** The program starts by creating an empty canvas filled with the background color, having the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. **Iterate over objects from right to left:** The `order` function is used to process objects starting from the rightmost side of the grid, ensuring correct extension even when objects are close together.
3. **Extend each object:** For each object, the program iterates horizontally from the object's leftmost point to the right edge of the grid, extending the object by adding cells with its color.
4. **Paint the extended object:** The `paint` function is used to draw the extended object on the canvas.
5. **Return the transformed canvas:** After processing all objects, the program returns the modified canvas.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for i in range(height(grid)):  # Iterate over each row
    current_color = None  # Keep track of the current object color
    for j in range(width(grid) - 1):  # Iterate over each column except the last
      if index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcommon(grid):  # Check if the cell belongs to an object
        current_color = index(grid, (i, j))  # Update the current object color
      elif current_color is not None:  # If currently within an object's extension
        grid = paint(grid, recolor(current_color, {(i, j)}))  # Extend the object
    if current_color is not None:  # Extend to the last column if needed
      grid = paint(grid, recolor(current_color, {(i, width(grid) - 1)}))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over rows and columns:** The program uses nested loops to traverse the grid row by row, from top to bottom.
2. **Track the current object color:**  A variable `current_color` stores the color of the object being processed in each row.
3. **Identify object extension areas:** If a cell belongs to the background color but `current_color` is not None, it signifies that the cell should be part of the object's extension.
4. **Extend the object:** In such cases, the `paint` function is used to fill the cell with the `current_color`, extending the object.
5. **Handle the last column:** The code includes a check to extend the object to the last column if needed.
6. **Return the transformed grid:** After processing all rows, the program returns the modified grid.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(grid), shape(grid)), # Create empty canvas
              merge(
                  [
                      recolor(color(obj), backdrop(shift(obj, (0, x))))
                      for obj in objects(grid, T, F, F)
                      for x in range(width(grid))
                  ]
              ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create an empty canvas:** Similar to version 3, the program initializes an empty canvas.
2. **Extend all objects simultaneously:**  Instead of iterating, this version uses a list comprehension to generate all possible horizontal extensions for each object on the grid. The `backdrop` function is used to efficiently obtain all indices within the bounding box of the shifted object.
3. **Merge and paint:** The `merge` function combines all extended objects, and the `paint` function draws them onto the canvas, effectively achieving the desired rightward extension.
4. **Return the transformed canvas:** Finally, the program returns the modified canvas.

These five programs offer distinct approaches to achieve the same grid transformation. They utilize different looping structures, object processing orders, and combinations of DSL functions, showcasing the versatility of the provided DSL and the creativity in solving spatial reasoning tasks.
