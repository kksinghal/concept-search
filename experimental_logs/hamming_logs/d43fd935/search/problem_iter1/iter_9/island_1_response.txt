## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation can be described as follows: For each non-horizontal line object in the input grid, extend its color horizontally to the right, stopping at the original rightmost edge of the object. Horizontal line objects and the background remain unchanged.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The '3' objects and the '1' objects are extended to the right, filling the space up to their original rightmost '3' or '1' cell.
* **Input_1:** The '7' objects and the '8' objects are similarly extended horizontally.
* **Input_2:**  Only the '1' objects are extended, as the '3' object forms a horizontal line and is unchanged.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve this transformation:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def extend_right(I):
  O = I  # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input.
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):  # Iterate over each connected object in the grid.
    if not hline(obj):  # Check if the object is not a horizontal line.
      rightmost_j = rightmost(obj) # Find the rightmost column of the object
      for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost_j + 1):  # Iterate over columns from leftmost to rightmost.
        O = fill(O, color(obj), product(interval(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1, 1), {j})) # Fill the column with object color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** The output grid `O` is initialized as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Object Iteration:** The program iterates over each connected object (`obj`) in the input grid.
3. **Horizontal Line Check:** It checks if the current object is a horizontal line using `hline(obj)`. If it is, the object is skipped.
4. **Column-wise Filling:** For each non-horizontal line object, the program iterates over its columns from the leftmost to the rightmost. 
5. **Fill Operation:**  For each column, it fills the corresponding column in the output grid with the object's color, from the uppermost row to the lowermost row of the object.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def extend_right(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create a canvas filled with the background color.
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if hline(obj):
      O = paint(O, obj)  # Paint horizontal lines directly.
    else:
      for i in range(height(obj)): # Iterate over the height of the object
        O = fill(O, color(obj), product({uppermost(obj) + i}, interval(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1, 1))) # Fill each row
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Background Canvas:** A canvas `O` is created, filled with the background color of the input grid and having the same dimensions.
2. **Object Iteration and Handling:** The code iterates through each object in the grid.
3. **Horizontal Line Handling:** If an object is a horizontal line, it is directly painted onto the canvas `O`.
4. **Non-Horizontal Line Handling:** If the object isn't a horizontal line, the program iterates through each row of the object. For each row, it fills the corresponding row in the output grid `O` with the object's color, from its leftmost to rightmost column. 


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def extend_right(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):  # Iterate over each column.
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
      if leftmost(obj) <= j <= rightmost(obj) and not hline(obj):  # If column intersects a non-horizontal object
        O = fill(O, color(obj), product(interval(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1, 1), {j}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Output grid `O` starts as a copy of the input `I`.
2. **Column Iteration:**  The code iterates through each column of the grid.
3. **Object Intersection Check:** For each column, it checks if any non-horizontal object intersects with that column.
4. **Column Filling:** If a non-horizontal object intersects the current column, the corresponding column in the output grid `O` is filled with the object's color, from the object's uppermost row to its lowermost row. 


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def extend_right(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Initialize with background.
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if not hline(obj):
      O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), product(interval(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1, 1), interval(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1, 1))))  # Recolor and paint.
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)  # Paint horizontal lines directly
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Background Canvas:** A canvas `O` is created, filled with the background color of the input, with the same dimensions.
2. **Object Iteration and Differentiation:** The program iterates through each object in the input grid. 
3. **Non-Horizontal Line Handling:** If the object is not a horizontal line, it is recolored to its own color, effectively extending it to the right within its original bounding box, and then painted onto the canvas `O`.
4. **Horizontal Line Handling:** If the object is a horizontal line, it is directly painted onto the canvas `O` without any modifications.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def extend_right(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if height(obj) > 1: # Check if object is not a horizontal line (height > 1)
      O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), product(interval(uppermost(obj),lowermost(obj) + 1, 1), interval(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1, 1)))) # Recolor to extend right
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** The output grid `O` starts as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Object Iteration and Check:**  The program iterates through each object in the grid. It then checks if the height of the current object is greater than 1. If the height is 1, it implies a horizontal line and the object is skipped. 
3. **Recoloring and Painting:** For each non-horizontal object, it is recolored to its own color within its bounding box, effectively extending it to the right, and then this extended object is painted onto the output grid `O`.

These five versions utilize different approaches and DSL functions to achieve the same goal, showcasing the flexibility and diversity of solutions possible within the provided DSL.
