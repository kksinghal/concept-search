## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves extending the objects horizontally towards the right until they encounter another object or the edge of the grid. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** 
- The '1' objects are extended rightwards, filling the space with '0's. 
- The '6' objects at (1,8), (6,7), (7,6) are extended to the right.
- The '3' object remains unchanged as it is blocked by the '1' object.

**Pair 1:**
- The '7' and '8' objects are extended rightwards, stopping at the edges of the grid or when encountering other objects.

**Pair 2:**
- The '1' objects are extended rightwards.
- The '3' object remains unchanged as it is blocked on both sides.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def extend_right(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      for k in range(j + 1, width(I)):
        if (i, k) not in toindices(merge(objects(I, False, False, True))):
          O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, k)})
        else:
          break
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate over objects:** Loop through each object in the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate over object cells:** Loop through individual cells of the current object.
3. **Extend rightwards:** For each cell, extend rightwards by filling with the object's color until another object or the grid edge is encountered.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def extend_right(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    current_color = None
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I):
        current_color = I[i][j]
      elif current_color is not None:
        O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate over rows:** Loop through each row of the input grid.
2. **Track current color:** Store the color of the last encountered non-background object.
3. **Extend rightwards:** If the current cell is background and a `current_color` is being tracked, fill it with that color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def extend_right(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          row[j] if row[j] != mostcommon(I) else next((row[k] for k in range(j - 1, -1, -1) if row[k] != mostcommon(I)), mostcommon(I)) 
          for j in range(len(row))
      ) for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate over rows and cells:** Use nested list comprehension to process each cell in the grid.
2. **Conditional filling:** If the current cell is background, find the nearest non-background color to the left and fill with it. If none is found, keep the background color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def extend_right(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
    O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), backdrop(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Create empty canvas:** Initialize an output grid filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate over objects:** Loop through each object in the input grid.
3. **Paint bounding boxes:** For each object, paint its entire bounding box with the object's color onto the output grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def extend_right(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          next((v for v in row[:j+1] if v != mostcommon(I)), mostcommon(I)) 
          for j in range(len(row))
      ) for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate over rows and cells:** Use nested list comprehension to process each cell in the grid.
2. **Find first non-background:** For each cell, find the first non-background color to the left (including the current cell). Fill the current cell with this color, or keep it as background if none are found.

These five programs represent distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating diverse utilization of the DSL functions.
