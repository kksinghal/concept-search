## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects (groups of the same digit) horizontally towards the nearest object of a different color. However, the extension stops at the grid border. 

**Input 0:**
- The '1's extend rightward towards the '6', stopping at the grid border.
- The '3's extend rightward towards the '1', also stopping at the grid border.
- The '6's extend rightward, again stopping at the grid border.

**Input 1:**
- The '7's extend rightward towards the '8' and '3', stopping at the respective objects.
- The '8's extend rightward, stopping at the grid border.

**Input 2:**
- The '1's extend rightward towards the '3', stopping at the grid border.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, T, F, T) # Get all objects, excluding background
  bg = mostcolor(grid) # Get background color
  for obj in objs:
    com = centerofmass(obj) # Get object's center of mass
    for direction in [LEFT, RIGHT]: # Check both left and right directions
      target_color = index(grid, add(com, direction)) 
      if target_color is not None and target_color != bg and target_color != color(obj):
        # Found a different colored object in this direction
        extension = shoot(com, direction) # Create a line extending in that direction
        for cell in extension:
          if index(grid, cell) == bg: 
            grid = paint(grid, recolor(color(obj), initset(cell))) # Extend the object
          else:
            break # Stop extending upon hitting another object
  return grid
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **Identify Objects:** The code first identifies all objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** It iterates through each object and, for both left and right directions, checks if there's a different colored object adjacent to its center of mass. 
3. **Extend Towards Object:** If a different colored object is found, it extends the current object in that direction by painting the background cells with the object's color until it hits another object.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(width(grid)):
      shifted_obj = shift(obj, (0, i)) # Shift the object horizontally
      if not bordering(shifted_obj, grid) and len(intersection(toindices(shifted_obj), ofcolor(grid, color(obj)))) == 0:
        # If the shifted object doesn't touch the border and doesn't overlap with existing object cells
        grid = paint(grid, recolor(color(obj), intersection(toindices(shifted_obj), asindices(grid)))) # Paint the shifted object
      else:
        break # Stop shifting if it hits the border or overlaps
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift and Check:** This version iterates through each object and shifts it horizontally across the grid.
2. **Validate and Paint:**  For each shift, it checks two conditions: if the shifted object overlaps with the grid border and if it overlaps with existing cells of the same object. If both conditions are false, it paints the shifted object onto the grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(grid):
  for obj in objects(grid, T, F, T):
    right_edge = rightmost(obj)
    left_edge = leftmost(obj)
    for j in range(right_edge + 1, width(grid)):
      if index(grid, (centerofmass(obj)[0], j)) == mostcolor(grid):
        grid = paint(grid, recolor(color(obj), initset((centerofmass(obj)[0], j))))
      else:
        break
    for j in range(left_edge - 1, -1, -1):
      if index(grid, (centerofmass(obj)[0], j)) == mostcolor(grid):
        grid = paint(grid, recolor(color(obj), initset((centerofmass(obj)[0], j))))
      else:
        break
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Edges:**  This version finds the leftmost and rightmost columns of each object.
2. **Extend From Edges:** It then extends the object horizontally from these edges towards the opposite direction, cell by cell, until it encounters a non-background color.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(grid):
  for i in range(height(grid)):
    for j in range(width(grid)):
      if index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcolor(grid): # Find a non-background cell
        current_color = index(grid, (i, j))
        for k in range(j + 1, width(grid)):
          if index(grid, (i, k)) == mostcolor(grid):
            grid = paint(grid, recolor(current_color, initset((i, k)))) # Extend color to the right
          else:
            break # Stop at a different color
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Scan and Extend:** This version scans the grid row by row. When it encounters a non-background cell, it extends that cell's color horizontally to the right until it encounters a different color. 

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    extension_line = connect((leftmost(obj), centerofmass(obj)[0]), (rightmost(obj) + width(grid), centerofmass(obj)[0]))
    for cell in extension_line:
      if index(grid, cell) == mostcolor(grid):
        grid = paint(grid, recolor(color(obj), initset(cell)))
      else:
        break
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Extension Line:** This version creates a horizontal line spanning the entire grid, centered on the object's center of mass. 
2. **Fill Line:** It then fills this line with the object's color, starting from the object's leftmost point and stopping when it encounters a non-background color.

These five versions offer diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation using different combinations of DSL functions, ensuring zero similarity between the code solutions.
