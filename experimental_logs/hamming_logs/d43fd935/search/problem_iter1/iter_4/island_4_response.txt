## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation extends the object with value '1' to the right until it hits another object (value '6' in this case).

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  The transformation extends every object to the right until it hits another object. 

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The transformation extends the object with value '1' downwards until it hits another object (value '3' in this case).

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  for obj in objs:
    c = color(obj)
    rightmost_cell = argmax(toindices(obj), lambda x: x[1])
    right_frontier = shoot(rightmost_cell, RIGHT)
    filling_indices = difference(right_frontier, toindices(obj))
    I = fill(I, c, filling_indices)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  We start by identifying all objects in the grid using `objects(I, T, T, T)`.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** For each object:
    - Get its color `c`.
    - Find the rightmost cell using `argmax` and `lambda x: x[1]` to prioritize column index.
    - Create a 'frontier' extending rightwards from this cell using `shoot(rightmost_cell, RIGHT)`.
    - Calculate the indices to be filled by subtracting the object's indices from the frontier using `difference`.
    - Fill those indices with the object's color `c` using `fill`.
3. **Return Grid:** Return the modified grid `I`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])-1):
      if I[i][j] != 0 and I[i][j+1] == 0:
        I = fill(I, I[i][j], {(i, k) for k in range(j+1, len(I[0])) if I[i][k] == 0})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:**  Iterate through each cell in the grid.
2. **Extend Right:** If a cell is non-zero and its right neighbor is zero, extend the value to the right until a non-zero value is encountered.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for j in range(len(I[0])):
    for i in range(len(I)-1):
      if I[i][j] != 0 and I[i+1][j] == 0:
        I = fill(I, I[i][j], {(k, j) for k in range(i+1, len(I)) if I[k][j] == 0})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:**  Iterate through each cell in the grid.
2. **Extend Downwards:** If a cell is non-zero and its down neighbor is zero, extend the value downwards until a non-zero value is encountered.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  for obj in objs:
    for direction in [RIGHT, DOWN]:
      front_cell = argmax(toindices(obj), lambda x: x[0] if direction == DOWN else x[1])
      frontier = shoot(front_cell, direction)
      I = fill(I, color(obj), intersection(frontier, delta(obj)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** For each object, extend it both rightwards and downwards.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return hmirror(vmirror(hconcat(lefthalf(I),hmirror(lefthalf(I))))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Split and Mirror:** Split the grid vertically into two halves. Mirror the left half horizontally and concatenate it with the original left half. 
2. **Mirror and Merge:** Mirror the resulting grid vertically and then horizontally to obtain the final output.

These five programs showcase distinct logic and DSL function combinations to achieve the same data transformation. Each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses in terms of readability, efficiency, and generalizability to other transformations.
