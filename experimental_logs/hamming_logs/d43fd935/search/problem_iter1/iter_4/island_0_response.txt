## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit, excluding the background color) and extending them horizontally towards other objects of different colors. The extension stops upon hitting another object or the edge of the grid.

**Input_0:**
* The object "1" at the top is extended rightwards towards the "6".
* The object "1" at the bottom is extended rightwards towards the "6".

**Input_1:**
* The object "7" on the third row is extended rightwards towards the "8".
* The object "7" on various rows is extended rightwards towards the "8" or the edge.

**Input_2:**
* No changes, as no object can be extended without merging with another object of the same color.

## Program_to_be_generated:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def ecaaaabfiaafeeffjgdbafdcfefbadie_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Get all objects, excluding background
  bg = mostcolor(I)  # Identify background color
  for obj1 in objs:
    com1 = centerofmass(obj1) # Calculate center of mass for obj1
    for obj2 in objs:
      if color(obj1) != color(obj2): # Consider objects of different colors
        direction = position(obj1, obj2) # Determine direction from obj1 to obj2
        if direction[0] != 0: # Only extend horizontally
          continue
        path = shoot(com1, direction) # Draw a line from obj1 center towards obj2
        for cell in path:
          if index(I, cell) == bg: # Only fill background cells
            I = paint(I, recolor(color(obj1), initset(cell))) # Extend obj1
          else:
            break # Stop upon hitting another object
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

* Iterates through each pair of objects in the grid.
* If the objects have different colors, calculates the relative horizontal direction from the first object to the second.
* Extends the first object horizontally in the calculated direction by filling background cells with the object's color.
* Stops extending when it encounters a non-background cell.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def ecaaaabfiaafeeffjgdbafdcfefbadie_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    for direction in [(0, 1), (0, -1)]:  # Check both right and left directions
      extension = shoot(centerofmass(obj), direction)
      for cell in extension:
        if index(I, cell) != mostcolor(I) and index(I, cell) != color(obj):
          # Stop if encountering another object of a different color
          break
        I = paint(I, recolor(color(obj), initset(cell)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

* Iterates through each object.
* For each object, checks both horizontal directions (left and right).
* Extends a line from the object's center in that direction.
* Fills cells along the line with the object's color, stopping if it encounters a different object (not background or itself).

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def ecaaaabfiaafeeffjgdbafdcfefbadie_v3(I):
  for x in range(width(I)): # Iterate over each column
    I = ddhacefecbaiedfijedcdhgaibacaahf_modified(I, x) # Apply modified Program_A for each column
  return I

def ddhacefecbaiedfijedcdhgaibacaahf_modified(I, x):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  target_obj = argmin(sfilter(objs, lambda obj: leftmost(obj) == x), size)
  # Find the smallest object starting at the current column
  if not target_obj: # Skip if no object found
    return I
  target_color = color(target_obj)
  other_objs = remove(target_obj, objs)
  
  def extend_line(start, direction):
    line = shoot(start, direction)
    for obj in other_objs:
      if not intersection(toindices(obj), line):
        continue
      line = difference(line, {extract(line, lambda loc: index(I, loc) == color(obj))})
      break
    return line
  
  center_loc = (center(target_obj)[0], x) # Use the column x as the center's x-coordinate
  extension = merge([
    extend_line(center_loc, (0, 1)),
    extend_line(center_loc, (0, -1)),
  ]) # Only extend horizontally
  O = paint(I, recolor(target_color, extension))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Modifies Program_A to iterate over each column and target the smallest object starting at that column.
* Extends lines only horizontally.
* This approach ensures that objects are extended one by one from left to right, preventing unintended merging.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def ecaaaabfiaafeeffjgdbafdcfefbadie_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  for obj in objs:
    com = centerofmass(obj)
    for dx in range(-width(I), width(I) + 1):
      if dx == 0: # Skip the object's current position
        continue
      target = (com[0], com[1] + dx) # Target location for extension
      if index(I, target) == bg:
        path = connect(com, target)
        for cell in path:
          if index(I, cell) != bg:
            break  # Stop if encountering another object
          I = paint(I, recolor(color(obj), initset(cell)))
      else:
        break # Stop extending in this direction
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

* Iterates through each object and its potential horizontal extension range.
* Checks each cell along the horizontal line from the object's center to the target location.
* Fills background cells with the object's color, stopping if it encounters another object.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def ecaaaabfiaafeeffjgdbafdcfefbadie_v5(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  for obj in objs:
    leftmost_cell = argmin(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1]) # Find leftmost cell of the object
    rightmost_cell = argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1]) # Find rightmost cell of the object
    for direction in [LEFT, RIGHT]: # Check both directions
      extension = shoot(centerofmass(obj), direction)
      for cell in extension:
        if index(I, cell) == bg and (direction == LEFT and cell[1] < leftmost_cell[1][1] or direction == RIGHT and cell[1] > rightmost_cell[1][1]):
          # Extend only outside the object's current horizontal boundaries
          I = paint(I, recolor(color(obj), initset(cell)))
        else:
          break # Stop upon hitting another object or exceeding boundaries
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

* Iterates through each object.
* Finds the leftmost and rightmost cells of the object to determine its horizontal boundaries.
* Extends lines from the object's center in both directions.
* Fills background cells with the object's color, but only if the cell lies outside the object's initial horizontal span.
* Stops extending when it encounters another object or exceeds the object's boundaries.


These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation while remaining faithful to the DSL constraints. Each version offers a unique combination of logic and function calls, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
