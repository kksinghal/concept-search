## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves identifying objects formed by connected cells of the same value and extending these objects horizontally to create a continuous line of that value. This extension maintains the original vertical positioning of the object. Here's a breakdown for each example:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The single '1' objects remain unchanged.
* The '3' object extends horizontally to fill the row.
* The '6' objects extend horizontally to form continuous vertical lines.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* The '7' and '8' objects extend horizontally to create continuous lines, preserving their original vertical placements. 
* The '3' object, being already a horizontal line, remains unchanged.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* The '1' and '3' objects behave as described above, extending horizontally.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, each using a different approach to achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    start_j = leftmost(obj)
    end_j = rightmost(obj)
    for j in range(start_j, end_j + 1):
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(uppermost(obj), j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all connected objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Create Canvas:** `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates an empty output grid `O` of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
3. **Iterate and Extend:** The code iterates through each identified object `obj`.
4. **Horizontal Extension:** For each object, it determines the leftmost and rightmost column indices (`start_j`, `end_j`). It then iterates through these columns and fills the corresponding cell in the output grid `O` with the object's color. This effectively extends the object horizontally.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if value != mostcolor(I):
                O = fill(O, value, hfrontier((i, j)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** Similar to Version 1, it creates an empty output grid `O`.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** The code iterates through each cell in the input grid `I`.
3. **Horizontal Line:** If the cell value is not the background color, it fills the entire horizontal line at that cell's row in the output grid `O` with the cell's value, effectively extending any object horizontally.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = partition(I)
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objs:
      if len(obj) > 0:
        i = uppermost(obj)
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j) for j in range(width(I))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition Grid:** `partition(I)` divides the input grid `I` into objects based on cell values.
2. **Create Canvas:**  Creates an empty output grid `O`.
3. **Iterate and Fill:**  Iterates through each object `obj`. For each object, it identifies the topmost row `i` and fills the entire horizontal line at that row in the output grid `O` with the object's color. 

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    left_edge = leftmost(obj)
    O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, j)) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(left_edge, width(I)) if (i, j) in toindices(obj)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1, it identifies objects in the input grid.
2. **Initialize Output:** The code initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
3. **Iterate and Paint:** It iterates through each object, determines its leftmost edge, and paints the output grid from that edge to the right with the object's color, but only at indices that were originally part of the object.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    current_color = None
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        current_color = I[i][j]
        break
    if current_color is not None:
      O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j) for i in range(height(I))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** Creates an empty output grid.
2. **Iterate Columns:** Iterates through each column `j` in the input grid.
3. **Find First Non-Background Color:** Within each column, it finds the first cell with a value different from the background color. This value becomes the `current_color`.
4. **Fill Column:** If a `current_color` is found, it fills the entire column `j` in the output grid with that color. 

These five versions provide distinct approaches using different DSL function combinations, showcasing a variety of ways to achieve the desired grid transformation.
