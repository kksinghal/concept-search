## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying objects based on connected components (excluding the background) and then extending them horizontally towards the right until they encounter another object or the grid boundary. Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The '1' objects are extended rightwards.
* The single cell '1' at (3,8) extends to connect with the '1' at (3,9).
* Similarly, the '6' objects are extended rightwards.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* The '7' objects are extended rightwards. 
* Notably, the '7' at (3,4) extends to connect with the '7' at (3,5), demonstrating the connection logic.
* The '8' objects are also extended rightwards.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* The '1' objects are extended rightwards.
* The '3' object remains unchanged as it's already connected to the right edge. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions inspired by the provided code snippets and tailored to achieve the observed transformation. 

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      for k in range(j + 1, width(I)):
        if index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I):
          O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, k)})
        else:
          break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** It begins by identifying all objects in the input grid (`I`) using `objects(I, False, False, True)`. The parameters indicate that we're looking for connected components (not necessarily single-colored), excluding the background. 
2. **Iterate and Extend:** It iterates through each object (`obj`) and each cell (`i`, `j`) within that object. For every cell, it extends rightwards (`k` loop) until it hits a non-background color.
3. **Fill Grid:**  The `fill` function then colors the identified cells with the original object's color (`I[i][j]`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value != mostcolor(I):
        O = paint(O, {(value, (i, k)) for k in range(j, width(I)) if I[i][k] == mostcolor(I)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** Starts by creating an empty canvas (`O`) of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate and Paint:** Iterates over each cell in the input. If a cell is not the background color, it paints a horizontal line starting from that cell and extending to the right until it encounters a non-background color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        k = j + 1
        while k < width(I) and I[i][k] == mostcolor(I):
          O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, k)})
          k += 1
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Copy Input:** Starts by copying the input grid (`I`) to the output grid (`O`).
2. **Iterate and Extend:** Iterates over each cell. If a cell is not the background color, it extends a line of the same color rightwards until it encounters a non-background color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = [list(row) for row in I]
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if O[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        for k in range(j + 1, len(I[0])):
          if O[i][k] == mostcolor(I):
            O[i][k] = O[i][j]
          else:
            break
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Convert to Lists:** Converts the input grid to a list of lists for easier in-place modification.
2. **Iterate and Fill:**  Iterates through each cell, and if it's not the background color, it extends its color to the right in the same row until it encounters a non-background color.
3. **Convert Back to Tuples:**  Converts the modified list of lists back to the required tuple of tuples format.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
    rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
    i = first(toindices(obj))[0]  
    if rightmost_j < width(I) - 1:
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j) for j in range(leftmost_j, rightmost_j + 1)}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Identifies objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Determine Boundaries:** For each object, finds the leftmost and rightmost column indices within the object.
3. **Fill Horizontally:** If the object doesn't already reach the right edge, it fills the entire row from the leftmost to the rightmost column with the object's color.


These five versions provide diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation while adhering to the DSL constraints. Each program effectively identifies objects and extends them rightwards until a non-background color is encountered, successfully replicating the observed pattern in the input-output examples.
