## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves extending horizontally any object that is not a horizontal line. Here's a breakdown:

**Input_0:** 

* The '1's, '3's, and '6's are extended horizontally to span the width of their respective objects.

**Input_1:**

*  The '7's and '8's are extended horizontally to span the width of their respective objects. The '3's remain unchanged as they already form a horizontal line.

**Input_2:** 

* The '1's and '3's are extended horizontally to span the width of their respective objects.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the described transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if not hline(obj):
      O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), backdrop(obj)))
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input (`I`), filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate Objects:**  The code iterates through each object (`obj`) in the input grid.
3. **Horizontal Line Check:** `if not hline(obj):` checks if the object is not a horizontal line.
4. **Horizontal Extension:** If not a horizontal line, `recolor(color(obj), backdrop(obj))` recolors the entire bounding box of the object with the object's color, effectively extending it horizontally. 
5. **Preserve Horizontal Lines:** If the object is a horizontal line, it's directly painted onto the output canvas without modification.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
      if leftmost(obj) == j and not hline(obj):
        O = fill(O, color(obj), product(interval(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1), {j}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** The output grid `O` starts as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Columns:** The code iterates through each column (`j`) of the grid.
3. **Find Objects in Column:**  For each column, it iterates through all objects and checks if the object's leftmost point is in the current column (`leftmost(obj) == j`) and if it's not a horizontal line (`not hline(obj)`).
4. **Horizontal Fill:** If the conditions are met, `fill` is used to color the entire vertical line within the object's bounding box in the current column.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if not hline(obj):
      start_j, end_j = leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj)
      for j in range(start_j, end_j + 1):
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Start with Input:** The output grid `O` is initialized as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Objects:**  The code iterates through each object (`obj`) in the input grid.
3. **Non-Horizontal Line Check:**  `if not hline(obj):` checks if the object is not a horizontal line.
4. **Horizontal Fill:** If not a horizontal line, the code iterates through each column from the leftmost (`start_j`) to the rightmost (`end_j`) of the object. For each column, it fills the entire vertical line within the object's bounding box.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if hline(obj):
      O = paint(O, obj)
    else:
      for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
        O = fill(O, color(obj), product({i}, interval(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Blank Canvas:**  A canvas `O` is created, filled with the background color and having the same size as input `I`.
2. **Iterate Objects:** It iterates through each object in the input grid.
3. **Horizontal Line Handling:** If the object is a horizontal line (`hline(obj)`), it is painted directly onto the output canvas `O`.
4. **Non-Horizontal Line Extension:** If the object is not a horizontal line, it iterates through each cell (`(i, j)`) of the object. For each cell, it fills a horizontal line on the canvas, effectively extending the object horizontally.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if height(obj) != 1:
      O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), product(interval(uppermost(obj),lowermost(obj) + 1), interval(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Copy Input:** `O` is initialized as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Objects:** The program iterates over each object (`obj`) found in the input grid.
3. **Non-Horizontal Line Check:**  It checks if the height of the object is not equal to 1 (`height(obj) != 1`) - a proxy for identifying objects that are not horizontal lines. 
4. **Horizontal Extension:** If the object is not a horizontal line, it calculates the bounding box of the object and recolors it with the object's color, effectively extending the object horizontally.


These five programs represent different approaches to achieving the same grid transformation. Each leverages different combinations of DSL functions, offering diverse and distinct implementations.
