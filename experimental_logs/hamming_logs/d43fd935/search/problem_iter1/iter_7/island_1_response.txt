## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

**For each object in the input grid:**

1. **Identify its color.**
2. **Find the leftmost column where the object exists.**
3. **Draw a vertical line downwards from each cell of the object in the leftmost column, extending to the object's lowermost row.** The line's color should be the object's color.

Let's illustrate with an example from Input_0:

- We have a '1' object at the top left. Its leftmost column is 0, and the lowermost row is 0. Hence, a vertical line of '1's is drawn from (0,0) to (0,0), resulting in a single '1'.
- Similarly, the '3' object has a leftmost column of 2 and a lowermost row of 4.  Therefore, vertical lines of '3's are drawn from (2,2) to (4,2) and from (3,2) to (4,2).


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create an empty canvas.
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if obj:
      min_y = leftmost(obj)  # Find the leftmost column
      max_i = lowermost(obj) # Find the lowermost row
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), max_i + 1): # Iterate from uppermost to lowermost row
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, min_y)}) # Draw a vertical line in the leftmost column
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates through each object and identifies its color, leftmost column, and lowermost row.
- It then iterates through each row of the object in the leftmost column and draws a vertical line downwards, filling the canvas with the object's color.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = I # Start with the input grid
  for j in range(width(I)): # Iterate over each column
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
      if obj and leftmost(obj) == j: # If the object's leftmost column matches current column
        color = color(obj)
        O = fill(O, color, {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)}) # Draw a vertical line
        break # Move to the next column after processing an object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates through each column of the input grid.
- For each column, it checks if any object has its leftmost point in that column.
- If an object is found, it draws a vertical line from its uppermost to the lowermost row in that column and then moves to the next column.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if obj:
      min_y = leftmost(obj)
      max_i = lowermost(obj)
      O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, min_y)) for i in range(max_i + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Similar to version 1, this version identifies the object's color, leftmost column, and lowermost row.
- Instead of using `fill`, it constructs a new object representing the vertical line and then paints it onto the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = I
  for x, y in asindices(I):
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
      if (x, y) in toindices(obj) and y == leftmost(obj):
        O = fill(O, color(obj), connect((x, y), (lowermost(obj), y)))
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates through every cell of the input grid.
- For each cell, it checks if it belongs to an object and if it's in the object's leftmost column.
- If both conditions are true, it draws a vertical line downwards using the `connect` function.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if obj:
      leftmost_points = sorted((i, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j == leftmost(obj))
      for i, j in leftmost_points:
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {(k, j) for k in range(i, lowermost(obj) + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version first identifies all the points belonging to the leftmost column of each object.
- It then sorts these points based on their row index (i).
- Finally, it iterates through these sorted points and draws a vertical line downwards from each point to the object's lowermost row.

These five versions showcase distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation using different combinations of DSL functions, demonstrating diverse coding solutions.
