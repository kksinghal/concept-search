## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation logic for all input-output pairs involves extending objects horizontally towards the right, but only until they encounter another object (or the grid boundary). 

Let's break down each example:

**Example 0:**

* The '1' objects at the top-left and bottom-left corners extend rightward until reaching the '6' object and grid boundary, respectively.
* The '3' object extends rightward until reaching the '1' object.
* The '6' objects remain unchanged as they encounter other '6' objects or the grid boundary.

**Example 1:**

* The '7' and '8' objects extend rightward, stopping upon encountering other objects or the boundary. 
* The '3' object remains unchanged as it encounters the '8' object.

**Example 2:**

* The vertical '1' object extends rightward, stopping at other '1' objects or the grid boundary.
* The '3' object remains unchanged. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, True) # Identify distinct objects
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj): # Iterate through object cells
      for k in range(j+1, width(grid)): # Extend rightward
        if index(grid, (i, k)) == mostcolor(grid):
          grid = paint(grid, recolor(color(obj), initset((i, k))))
        else:
          break # Stop at a different color
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We start by identifying all distinct objects in the grid using `objects(grid, True, False, True)`.  
2. **Iterate and Extend:** For each object, the program iterates over its cells. From each cell, it extends rightward by changing the color of empty cells to the object's color until it encounters a non-empty cell.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for i in range(height(grid)):
    current_color = None # Track the current color being extended
    for j in range(width(grid)):
      if index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcolor(grid) and current_color is None:
        current_color = index(grid, (i, j)) # Update current_color
      elif current_color is not None and index(grid, (i, j)) == mostcolor(grid):
        grid = paint(grid, recolor(current_color, initset((i, j)))) # Extend color
      else:
        current_color = None # Reset current_color
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Row-wise Iteration:** This version iterates through the grid row by row.
2. **Color Tracking:** It uses the `current_color` variable to keep track of the color being extended. If a non-background cell is encountered, `current_color` is updated.
3. **Conditional Extension:**  The program extends `current_color` rightward as long as it encounters empty cells. If a non-empty cell or a new object is encountered, `current_color` is reset to `None`. 


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return rot270(hmirror(Program_to_be_generated(hmirror(rot90(grid)))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version cleverly utilizes rotation and mirroring to reuse the logic from any previously defined `Program_to_be_generated` function:

1. **Rotate and Mirror:**  The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise (`rot90`), horizontally mirrored (`hmirror`), and then passed to the main transformation function.
2. **Reverse Transformations:** After the main transformation, the resulting grid undergoes reverse transformations (horizontal mirroring, then rotating back 270 degrees) to obtain the final output.

This version highlights the power of compositionality in DSLs, allowing for concise and elegant solutions by reusing existing functions.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True):
    start_j = leftmost(obj)
    end_j = rightmost(obj)
    for j in range(start_j, end_j):
      if index(grid, (centerofmass(obj)[0], j)) == mostcolor(grid):
        grid = paint(grid, recolor(color(obj), initset((centerofmass(obj)[0], j))))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Iteration:** It iterates through each object on the grid.
2. **Horizontal Scan:** For each object, the program scans horizontally from its leftmost to rightmost point.
3. **Center Line Fill:** It fills in the background cells (`mostcolor`) encountered during the scan with the object's color, effectively extending the object to the right.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return paint(grid, merge([
    recolor(color(obj), frozenset((i,k) for k in range(leftmost(obj), width(grid)) 
                                    if index(grid, (i,k)) == mostcolor(grid)))
    for obj in objects(grid, True, False, True)
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)
  ]))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object and Row Iteration:** It iterates over each object and then each row occupied by that object.
2. **Horizontal Line Generation:** For each row, it generates a set of indices representing a horizontal line extending from the leftmost point of the object to the right edge of the grid.
3. **Conditional Recoloring:**  It filters this line, keeping only the indices corresponding to background cells, and recolors them to the object's color.
4. **Object Merging:** Finally, it merges the recolorings for all objects and paints them onto the original grid.

This version demonstrates a more functional and set-based approach, leveraging set comprehension and merging for a concise and efficient solution.
