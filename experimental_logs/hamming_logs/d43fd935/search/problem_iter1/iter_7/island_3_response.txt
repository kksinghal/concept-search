## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place in these input-output pairs involves identifying objects within the grid (groups of connected digits of the same value) and extending them horizontally towards the right until they encounter another object or the edge of the grid.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- The '1' at (0, 0) remains unchanged as it's already touching the left border.
- The '6' objects at (1, 8), (6, 7), (7, 6), (8, 2) extend rightwards, filling the space with '6' until encountering the grid edge or another object.
- The '3' object at (3, 2) extends rightwards, filling the space with '3' until encountering the '1' object.
- The '1' object at (3, 8) extends rightwards, filling the space with '1' until encountering the grid edge.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

-  Similar to Input_0, all objects ('7', '8', '3') extend rightwards until encountering the grid edge or another object.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

- All '1' objects extend rightwards, filling the space with '1' until encountering the grid edge or another object ('3' object).
- The '3' object remains unchanged as it's blocked on the right. 


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_1cf80156(grid):
    objs = objects(grid, F, F, T)
    for obj in objs:
        start_j = rightmost(obj) + 1
        for j in range(start_j, width(grid)):
            grid = fill(grid, color(obj), {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)})
    return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(grid, F, F, T)` finds all objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** The code iterates through each object. For each object:
    -  `start_j = rightmost(obj) + 1` determines the starting column index for extension.
    -  The inner loop iterates from `start_j` to the grid's right edge.
    -  `fill(grid, color(obj), {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)})` fills each cell in the current column, from the object's top to bottom row, with the object's color.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_1cf80156(grid):
  for j in range(width(grid) - 1):
    for i in range(height(grid)):
      if grid[i][j] != mostcolor(grid):
        value = grid[i][j]
        k = j + 1
        while k < width(grid) and grid[i][k] == mostcolor(grid):
          grid = fill(grid, value, {(i, k)})
          k += 1
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Columns:** The code iterates through each column of the grid from left to right (except the last column).
2. **Check for Non-Background Cells:** For each cell in the column, it checks if the cell's value is different from the background color.
3. **Extend Rightwards:** If the cell is not a background cell:
    - It stores the cell's value.
    - It then iterates through the cells to the right in the same row, filling them with the stored value as long as they are background cells.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_1cf80156(grid):
  filled_grid = grid
  for i in range(height(grid)):
    row = grid[i]
    for j in range(width(grid) - 1):
      if row[j] != mostcolor(grid):
        current_color = row[j]
        next_j = j + 1
        while next_j < width(grid) and row[next_j] == mostcolor(grid):
          filled_grid = fill(filled_grid, current_color, {(i, next_j)})
          next_j += 1
  return filled_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 2 but iterates through rows first and then through the cells in each row. It identifies a non-background cell and then extends its color to the right while the cells are background. 

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_1cf80156(grid):
  for obj in objects(grid, False, False, True):
    for j in range(leftmost(obj), width(grid)):
      if (any(index(grid, (i, j)) == color(obj) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1))):
        grid = fill(grid, color(obj), {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Objects:**  The code starts by finding all objects in the input grid using `objects(grid, False, False, True)`.
2. **Iterate Through Columns:** For each object, it iterates through the columns from its leftmost point to the right edge of the grid.
3. **Check for Existing Color:** In each column, it checks if the object's color is already present in any cell within the object's vertical span using `any(index(grid, (i, j)) == color(obj) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1))`.
4. **Fill the Column:** If the condition is true (the object's color is found in the column), the code fills the entire vertical span of the object in that column with the object's color using `fill`.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_1cf80156(grid):
  for j in range(1, width(grid)):
    for i in range(height(grid)):
      if grid[i][j-1] != mostcolor(grid) and grid[i][j] == mostcolor(grid):
        grid = fill(grid, grid[i][j-1], {(i, j)})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Columns (Offset):** The code iterates through each column of the grid, starting from the second column (index 1) to the right edge.
2. **Check Previous Cell:** For each cell in the current column, it checks if the cell to its left (in the previous column) is not a background color (`grid[i][j-1] != mostcolor(grid)`) and the current cell is a background color (`grid[i][j] == mostcolor(grid)`).
3. **Fill if Condition Met:** If both conditions are true, it means the current cell should be filled to continue the object from the left. It uses `fill` to fill the current cell with the color of the cell to its left (`grid[i][j-1]`).
