## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** All occurrences of the digit '1' are horizontally extended to the right until they connect with another digit or reach the edge of the grid.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** All occurrences of the digits '7' and '8' are horizontally extended to the right until they connect with a different digit or reach the edge of the grid.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** All occurrences of the digit '1' are vertically extended downwards until they connect with another digit or reach the edge of the grid.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  for obj in objs:
    c = color(obj)
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if j < width(I) - 1:
        right_neighbor = (i, j + 1)
        if index(I, right_neighbor) == bg:
          I = fill(I, c, frozenset({right_neighbor}))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** We use `objects(I, T, T, T)` to get a set of all objects in the input grid.
2. **Iterate through objects:** For each object `obj` in the set:
    - **Get the object's color:** We use `color(obj)` to get the digit value of the object.
    - **Iterate through cells:** For each cell `(v, (i, j))` in the object:
        - **Check for right neighbor:** If the cell is not on the right edge of the grid, get its right neighbor's index `(i, j + 1)`.
        - **Check neighbor's color:** If the right neighbor's color is the background color, fill it with the object's color using `fill(I, c, frozenset({right_neighbor}))`.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  for obj in objs:
    c = color(obj)
    rightmost_cell = argmax(toindices(obj), lambda x: x[1])
    right_frontier = shoot(rightmost_cell, RIGHT)
    I = fill(I, c, intersection(right_frontier, delta(obj)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Iterate through objects:** For each object:
    - **Get the object's color:** Similar to Version 1.
    - **Find rightmost cell:** We find the rightmost cell of the object using `argmax` and a lambda function to compare column indices.
    - **Generate a rightward "shooting" line:** We use `shoot(rightmost_cell, RIGHT)` to generate a set of indices extending horizontally rightward from the rightmost cell.
    - **Find intersection with the object's delta:** We find the intersection of the "shooting" line and the delta of the object (indices in the object's bounding box but not part of the object) using `intersection(right_frontier, delta(obj))`.
    - **Fill the intersection with the object's color:** We fill the resulting intersection with the object's color using `fill`.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda x: recolor(color(x), hfrontier(ulcorner(x))), objects(I, T, T, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Generate horizontal frontiers:** For each object, we find its upper-left corner using `ulcorner(x)` and generate a horizontal frontier line using `hfrontier`. This line will cover the entire row.
3. **Recolor frontiers:** We recolor each frontier line with its corresponding object's color using `recolor(color(x), hfrontier(ulcorner(x)))`.
4. **Merge frontiers:** We merge all the recolored frontiers into a single object using `merge`.
5. **Paint the frontiers onto the input grid:** Finally, we use `paint` to paint the merged frontiers onto the input grid, effectively extending the objects horizontally.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
      if I[i][j] != I[i][j+1] and I[i][j+1] == mostcolor(I):
        I = fill(I, I[i][j], frozenset({(i, j+1)}))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through the grid:** The code iterates over every cell in the grid.
2. **Check for different colors:** For each cell, it checks if the color of the cell to its right is different from the current cell and if the right cell is the background color.
3. **Fill with current cell color:** If both conditions are true, it means the current cell is at the edge of an object and needs to be extended. The code then fills the cell to the right with the current cell's color.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
  return rot90(solve(rot270(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version cleverly reuses the logic from any of the previous versions (replace `solve` with the chosen version's function name) to achieve vertical extension instead of horizontal:

1. **Rotate the grid counter-clockwise:** It first rotates the grid 270 degrees counter-clockwise using `rot270(I)`. This effectively makes vertical lines horizontal.
2. **Apply horizontal extension:** It applies the chosen horizontal extension logic from previous versions on the rotated grid.
3. **Rotate the grid clockwise:**  Finally, it rotates the resulting grid back 90 degrees clockwise using `rot90`, restoring the original orientation but with the objects extended vertically. 

This showcases a different approach, focusing on grid manipulation and reusing existing code for a different orientation.

Each version uses a different combination of functions and logic to achieve the same goal, demonstrating diversity in code generation. Please note that some versions might be more efficient than others depending on the specific input grid and desired outcome.
