## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same color) in the input grid and extending them horizontally to create a continuous line of the same color. The background color remains unchanged.

**Input 0:**

* The object with color '1' is extended horizontally.
* The object with color '3' is extended horizontally.
* The object with color '6' is extended horizontally.

**Input 1:**

* The objects with colors '7' and '8' are extended horizontally. 

**Input 2:**

* The object with color '1' is extended horizontally. 

## Program Versions:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Extract all objects from the grid.
  bg = mostcolor(I)  # Identify the background color.
  filled_grid = canvas(bg, shape(I))  # Create a canvas filled with the background color.
  for obj in objs:
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
    rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
    for j in range(leftmost_j, rightmost_j + 1):
      filled_grid = fill(filled_grid, color(obj), {(uppermost(obj), j)})  # Fill horizontally.
  return filled_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** We use `objects(I, T, F, F)` to extract all connected objects from the input grid.
2. **Identify Background:** We use `mostcolor(I)` to determine the background color.
3. **Create Canvas:** We generate a canvas of the same size as the input grid filled with the background color using `canvas(bg, shape(I))`.
4. **Horizontal Extension:** For each object, we iterate from its leftmost column (`leftmost(obj)`) to its rightmost column (`rightmost(obj)`) and fill the corresponding row in the canvas with the object's color using `fill(filled_grid, color(obj), {(uppermost(obj), j)})`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w)) # Create a canvas with the background color.
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I): # If the current cell is not background
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], hfrontier({(i, j)}))  # Fill horizontally with the current cell's color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** Similar to version 1, we create a canvas filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate and Fill:**  We iterate through each cell of the input grid. If a cell doesn't contain the background color, we use `hfrontier({(i, j)})` to get all indices on the same row and fill those cells on the canvas with the current cell's color using `fill`. 

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if color(obj) != bg:
      start_j = leftmost(obj)
      end_j = rightmost(obj)
      for j in range(start_j, end_j + 1):
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {(uppermost(obj), j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to version 1 but directly modifies the input grid (`O = I`) instead of creating a separate canvas.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
              merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), backdrop(toindices(obj))),
                          objects(I, T, F, F))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extract all objects using `objects(I, T, F, F)`.
2. **Create Backdrop Objects:** For each object, create a new object covering its entire bounding box using `backdrop(toindices(obj))` and recolor it to the original object's color using `recolor(color(obj), ...)`.
3. **Merge and Paint:** Merge all backdrop objects and paint them onto a canvas filled with the background color using `paint`.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  O = I
  for i in range(h):
    row_color = next((I[i][j] for j in range(len(I[0])) if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I)), mostcolor(I))
    if row_color != mostcolor(I):
      O = fill(O, row_color, {(i, j) for j in range(len(I[0]))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Rows:** This version iterates through each row of the grid.
2. **Find Non-Background Color:**  For each row, it finds the first non-background color.
3. **Fill Row:** If a non-background color is found, it fills the entire row with that color.

These five versions utilize different logic and function combinations from the DSL to achieve the desired grid transformation.
