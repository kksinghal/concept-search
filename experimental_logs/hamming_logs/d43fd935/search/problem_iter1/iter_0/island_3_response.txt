## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid and then extending them horizontally to create a continuous line of the same digit, effectively "filling in" any gaps within the object's bounding box.

**Input_0:**
- The '1' objects are extended horizontally to form continuous lines.
- The '3' and '6' objects remain unchanged as they already form horizontal lines.

**Input_1:**
- The '7' and '8' objects are extended horizontally.
- The '3' object remains unchanged.

**Input_2:**
- The '1' objects are extended horizontally.
- The '3' object remains unchanged.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)  # Identify all objects, excluding background
  filled_grid = I 
  for obj in objs:
    upper = uppermost(obj)
    lower = lowermost(obj)
    left = leftmost(obj)
    right = rightmost(obj)
    for i in range(upper, lower + 1):
      for j in range(left, right + 1):
        if (i, j) in toindices(obj):
          value = I[i][j]
          filled_grid = fill(filled_grid, value, {(i, j)}) # Fill horizontally
  return filled_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, F, F, T)` identifies all objects in the input grid `I`, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** The code iterates through each object. For each object, it determines the bounding box (uppermost, lowermost, leftmost, rightmost rows and columns). It then fills in the grid `filled_grid` horizontally within the bounding box with the object's color. 


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), backdrop(toindices(obj))), objects(I, F, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, F, F, T)` identifies all objects in the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Create Backdrop Objects:** For each object, `backdrop(toindices(obj))` creates a patch covering its bounding box.  `recolor(color(obj), ...)` then creates a new object with the same color as the original but covering the entire backdrop.
3. **Merge and Paint:** `merge(...)` combines all these backdrop objects, and `paint(I, ...)` applies them to the input grid, effectively overwriting the gaps with the object's color.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    return cellwise(I, paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), backdrop(toindices(obj))), objects(I, F, F, T)))), I[0][0])
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Create Backdrop:** Similar to Version 2, this version identifies objects and creates backdrop objects for each one.
2. **Create Canvas and Paint:**  A new canvas is created with the background color of the input grid (`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`). The merged backdrop objects are then painted onto this canvas.
3. **Cellwise Comparison:** `cellwise(I, ..., I[0][0])` compares the original input grid with the painted canvas. If the values match, the original value is kept. If they don't match (meaning the canvas has a filled-in part), the canvas value is taken, effectively achieving the horizontal extension.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  filled_grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Canvas with background color
  for obj in objs:
    filled_grid = paint(filled_grid, recolor(color(obj), backdrop(toindices(obj))))
  return filled_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions, this identifies all objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Create Background Canvas:** A canvas is created with the same dimensions as the input grid and filled with the background color.
3. **Iterate and Paint Backdrop:** For each object, a backdrop object is created and painted onto the canvas. This overwrites the background canvas with the object's color within its bounding box, effectively performing the horizontal extension.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  def fill_horizontally(obj):
    indices = toindices(obj)
    min_j, max_j = leftmost(indices), rightmost(indices)
    return frozenset((color(obj), (i, j)) for i, j in indices if min_j <= j <= max_j)

  return paint(I, merge(apply(fill_horizontally, objects(I, F, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_horizontally` Function:** This nested function takes an object and returns a new object where the object is extended horizontally within its bounding box.
2. **Apply and Paint:**  The `fill_horizontally` function is applied to all objects in the input grid. The resulting horizontally extended objects are merged and then painted onto the input grid, producing the final output.
