## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves changing the color of the rightmost cell of each object with color '1' to color '8'. Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**
- The rightmost '1' in each of the three objects (two horizontal and one vertical) are changed to '8'.

**Input_1:** 
- Similarly, the rightmost '1' in each object (four objects in this case) is replaced with '8'. Notice the change in the last row where the single '1' becomes '8'.

**Input_2 & Input_3:**
- The pattern continues - only the rightmost '1' of each object changes to '8', regardless of the object's shape, size, or position.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False):
    if color(obj) == 1:
      rightmost_index = max(toindices(obj), key=lambda x: x[1])
      O = paint(O, {(8, rightmost_index)}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** `O = I` initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iteration:** The code iterates through each object in the input grid using `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)`. 
3. **Color Check:** Inside the loop, `if color(obj) == 1:` checks if the current object's color is '1'.
4. **Finding Rightmost Cell:**  `rightmost_index = max(toindices(obj), key=lambda x: x[1])` finds the index of the rightmost cell within the object.
5. **Painting:** `O = paint(O, {(8, rightmost_index)})` paints the cell at `rightmost_index` with the color '8' on the output grid `O`.
6. **Return:** Finally, the transformed grid `O` is returned.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 1 and (j == len(row) - 1 or I[i][j + 1] != 1):
        O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** `O = I` copies the input grid `I` to the output grid `O`.
2. **Iterating over Cells:** The program iterates over each cell in the input grid using nested loops.
3. **Rightmost '1' Check:** `if val == 1 and (j == len(row) - 1 or I[i][j + 1] != 1)` checks if the current cell has a '1' and if it's the rightmost '1' in the object. 
4. **Painting:** If the condition holds true, `O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j))})` colors the current cell with '8' in the output grid `O`.
5. **Return:** The function returns the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(8 if v == 1 and (j == len(r) - 1 or r[j + 1] != 1) else v for j, v in enumerate(r)) for r in I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested list comprehensions for a more concise solution:

1. **Outer Comprehension:**  Iterates through each row `r` in the input grid `I`.
2. **Inner Comprehension:** Iterates through each value `v` and its index `j` in the current row `r`.
3. **Conditional Replacement:** `8 if v == 1 and (j == len(r) - 1 or r[j + 1] != 1) else v` replaces '1' with '8' if it's the rightmost '1' in an object, otherwise keeps the original value. 
4. **Return:** The modified grid is returned directly.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(9, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False):
    if color(obj) == 1:
      shifted_obj = shift(obj, (0, 1))
      O = paint(O, difference(obj, shifted_obj))
      O = paint(O, recolor(8, intersection(obj, shifted_obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** `O = canvas(9, shape(I))` creates an empty canvas `O` of the same size as input `I`, filled with the background color '9'.
2. **Object Iteration:** It iterates through objects in the input grid like previous versions.
3. **Shifting and Comparisons:** For each object of color '1', it creates `shifted_obj` by shifting the object one cell to the right. Then, it identifies the rightmost cells by finding the `intersection` between the original and shifted objects.
4. **Painting:** It paints the non-overlapping cells (from the `difference`) with their original color ('1') onto the canvas. The overlapping cells (representing rightmost '1's) are painted with color '8'.
5. **Return:** The function returns the final canvas `O` as the output.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      8 if v == 1 and (j == len(row)-1 or row[j+1] != 1) else v
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**
This version uses nested generators for a more memory-efficient solution. It follows the same logic as Version 3, but instead of list comprehensions, it uses generators:

1. **Outer Generator:** Iterates through each row in the input grid.
2. **Inner Generator:** Iterates through each value and its index in the current row.
3. **Conditional Replacement:**  Same logic as Version 3, replacing '1' with '8' if it's the rightmost '1' in an object.
4. **Return:** The modified grid is returned as a tuple of tuples, created from the nested generators.

Each of these versions provides a distinct approach to achieve the desired transformation. Choose the version that best suits your needs based on code readability, conciseness, or memory efficiency.
