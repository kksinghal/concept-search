## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation replaces all occurrences of a specific digit (1 in these examples) with a new digit (8 in these examples), except for the digit occurrences that form a rectangular border around the grid. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

* **Pair 0:** All inner occurrences of '1' are replaced with '8', maintaining the '9' border intact.
* **Pair 1:**  Similar to Pair 0, inner '1's become '8's while the '9' border remains.
* **Pair 2:** Same pattern as above - inner '1's are replaced with '8's, preserving the outer '9' border.
* **Pair 3:** Again, the transformation consistently replaces inner '1's with '8's, leaving the '9' border unchanged.


## Program_to_be_generated:

### Program Version 1:

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  obj = toobject(delta(asindices(I)), I)
  modified = replace(I, 1, 8)
  O = paint(modified, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background:** `bg = mostcolor(I)` determines the most frequent color, which represents the background ('9' in this case).
2. **Extract Border:** `obj = toobject(delta(asindices(I)), I)` extracts the grid's border as an object. It first gets all indices (`asindices(I)`), then finds the difference (`delta`) between the grid's bounding box and the indices, resulting in the border indices. Finally, it converts these indices into an object (`toobject`) with their corresponding values from the input grid.
3. **Replace Inner Digits:** `modified = replace(I, 1, 8)` creates a modified grid where every '1' is replaced with '8'.
4. **Paint Border Back:** `O = paint(modified, obj)` paints the extracted border object back onto the modified grid, effectively restoring the original border.

### Program Version 2:

```python
def solve(I):
    O = trim(replace(vconcat(hconcat(((mostcolor(I),),(mostcolor(I),)), trim(hconcat(((mostcolor(I),)), I, ((mostcolor(I),))))), ((mostcolor(I),)*(width(I)-2),), ((mostcolor(I),)*(width(I)-2),)), 1, 8))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version constructs the desired output grid directly by manipulating rows and columns:

1. **Get Background Color:** `mostcolor(I)` identifies the background color.
2. **Build Inner Grid:**  The inner part of the grid is created by replacing '1's with '8's in a trimmed version of the input (`trim(replace(..., 1, 8))`). 
3. **Add Borders:** The inner grid is then surrounded by rows and columns of the background color using `hconcat` and `vconcat`. 

### Program Version 3:

```python
def solve(I):
  border = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  filled = replace(I, 1, 8)
  O = paint(filled, first(border))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Border Object:** `border = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)` identifies all connected objects in the grid, including the background. Since the border forms the largest object, it's likely to be the first one.
2. **Replace Inner Digits:** `filled = replace(I, 1, 8)` creates a new grid with '1's replaced by '8's.
3. **Paint Border:** `O = paint(filled, first(border))` takes the first object (assumed to be the border) and paints it onto the filled grid.

### Program Version 4:

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), objs - sizefilter(objs, len(asindices(I)) - 2 * (height(I) + width(I)) + 4))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` extracts all objects from the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Remove Border:** It calculates the size of the border (`len(asindices(I)) - 2 * (height(I) + width(I)) + 4`) and removes the object of that size from the set of objects, leaving only the inner objects.
3. **Create Background Canvas:** `canvas(bg, shape(I))` generates a new grid filled with the background color.
4. **Paint Objects:** `O = paint(..., objs - ...)` paints the remaining objects (excluding the removed border) onto the new canvas.

### Program Version 5:

```python
def solve(I):
  inner_indices = delta(box(asindices(I)))
  O = paint(I, recolor(8, toobject(inner_indices, replace(I, 1, 8))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Inner Indices:** `inner_indices = delta(box(asindices(I)))` extracts the indices within the border by finding the difference between the grid's bounding box (`box`) and all its indices (`asindices`).
2. **Replace and Extract:** `toobject(inner_indices, replace(I, 1, 8))` replaces all '1's with '8's in the input grid and then extracts the object formed by the inner indices.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** `O = paint(I, recolor(8, ...))` recolors the extracted object to have a value of '8' and then paints it onto the original input grid, effectively achieving the desired replacement.
