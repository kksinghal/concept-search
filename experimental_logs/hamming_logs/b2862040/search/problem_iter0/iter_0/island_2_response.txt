## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation replaces all occurrences of the digit '1' with the digit '8' within specific objects in the grid. These objects are determined by connectivity: two '1's belong to the same object if they are directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right).  Let's break down each example:

**Input_0:**  
* A single object of '1's exists.
* **Output_0:** All '1's in this object are replaced with '8's.

**Input_1:** 
* Three distinct objects of '1's exist.
* **Output_1:** All '1's in each of these objects are independently replaced with '8's.

**Input_2:**
* Three distinct objects of '1's exist.
* **Output_2:** All '1's in each of these objects are independently replaced with '8's.

**Input_3:**
* Four distinct objects of '1's exist.
* **Output_3:** All '1's in each of these objects are independently replaced with '8's.


## Program to be Generated:

Since you have not provided the two existing programs, I will assume they are similar to Program A (concatenates the grid) and Program B (switches two specific colors).  It is difficult to provide five distinct solutions without knowing the exact functions used in the two reference programs. I will demonstrate one approach below.


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  filtered_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1)
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(8, obj), filtered_objs)
  O = I
  for obj in recolored_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The `objects` function is used to find all connected objects of '1's in the grid. We set `univalued=True` to group only adjacent cells with the same value, `diagonal=False` to consider only direct neighbors, and `without_bg=False` as we want to process all objects regardless of the background color.
2. **Filter by Color:** The `colorfilter` function selects only the objects consisting of the color '1'.
3. **Recolor Objects:** The `apply` function applies the `recolor` function to each object in `filtered_objs`, changing their color to '8'.
4. **Paint Objects:** The program iterates through the `recolored_objs` and uses the `paint` function to apply the recolored objects onto a copy of the original grid (`O`).

**Note:** This program assumes that the background color is not '1'. If the background could also be '1', you would need to modify the logic to avoid recoloring the background object. 

To create four more distinct versions, you would need to explore different combinations of DSL functions. Some potential strategies include:

* **Iterative Approach:** Instead of using `objects`, iterate through the grid cell by cell and use a flood-fill algorithm to identify and recolor connected '1's.
* **Recursive Approach:**  Define a recursive function that traverses connected '1's and replaces them with '8's.
* **Mask-Based Approach:** Create a mask that identifies the locations of all '1's belonging to objects and use it to modify the original grid.

Remember, without knowing the specifics of your existing programs, these are just examples. The key is to analyze the available functions and combine them creatively to achieve the desired transformation.
