## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces a specific color within each object with another color.  Let's analyze the pattern for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The object formed by digit '1' has its color changed from '1' to '8'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
-  Again, the object formed by digit '1' is targeted, with its color changed from '1' to '8'.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- Consistent with the previous examples, the object formed by '1' has its color modified to '8'.

**Input_3 to Output_3:**
-  The pattern holds true here as well; the object made of '1' has its color switched to '8'.

**Overall Pattern:** The transformation consistently targets the object composed of the digit '1' and modifies its color to '8' while leaving other objects and the background unchanged.


## Program to Be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects, excluding background
  target_color = 1  # Define the color to be replaced
  replacement_color = 8  # Define the new color
  
  def recolor_if_matches(obj):
    return recolor(replacement_color, obj) if color(obj) == target_color else obj
  
  recolored_objs = apply(recolor_if_matches, objs)  # Apply recoloring
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))  # Reconstruct grid
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` isolates all objects within the input grid `I`, excluding the background.
2. **Define Colors:** `target_color` and `replacement_color` store the colors involved in the transformation.
3. **Conditional Recoloring:** `recolor_if_matches` is a helper function that recolors an object only if its color matches `target_color`.
4. **Apply Transformation:**  `apply(recolor_if_matches, objs)` applies the conditional recoloring to each extracted object.
5. **Reconstruct Grid:**  A new grid is created using `canvas` with the background color and then painted with the recolored objects using `paint`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  target_obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)  # Directly extract target object
  recolored_obj = recolor(8, target_obj)  # Recolor the extracted object
  O = paint(I, recolored_obj)  # Paint the recolored object onto the original grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Direct Extraction:** This version directly extracts the object with color '1' using `extract` and a lambda function to specify the condition.
2. **Recolor and Paint:** The extracted object is recolored with '8' and directly painted onto the original input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  indices_to_recolor = ofcolor(I, 1)  # Find indices of cells with color '1'
  O = fill(I, 8, indices_to_recolor)  # Fill those indices with color '8'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Target Indices:** `ofcolor(I, 1)` efficiently identifies the indices of all cells containing the color '1'.
2. **Direct Filling:** `fill(I, 8, indices_to_recolor)` directly fills the target indices with the new color '8'. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I  # Initialize output as input
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] == 1:
                O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j)})  # Fill individual cell if color is 1
    return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Iterative Approach:** This version iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`.
2. **Conditional Filling:**  If a cell's value is '1', it's filled with '8' using `fill`.

**Program Version 5:**
```python
def solve(I):
  def recolor_cell(v, loc):
    return (8, loc) if v == 1 else (v, loc)  
  
  recolored_obj = frozenset(recolor_cell(v, (i, j)) for i, r in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(r))
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolored_obj) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Cell-wise Recoloring:**  `recolor_cell`  checks and recolors individual cells within a loop.
2. **Apply to All Cells:** The `recolor_cell` function is applied to each cell of the grid during the reconstruction process. 


These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired object color transformation. Each version utilizes different combinations of DSL functions, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the language.
