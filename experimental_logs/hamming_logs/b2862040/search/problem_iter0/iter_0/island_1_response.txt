## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces all occurrences of a specific digit in the input grid with a new digit in the output grid while maintaining the position of all other digits. 

* **Input 0, 1, 2, 3:** The digit '1' is replaced by the digit '8'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = replace(I, 1, 8)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the `replace` function directly. It takes the input grid `I`, identifies all instances of the digit '1' (`replacee`), and substitutes them with the digit '8' (`replacer`) to generate the output grid `O`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = cellwise(I, canvas(8, shape(I)), I) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages the `cellwise` function. It creates a canvas `canvas(8, shape(I))` of the same size as the input grid `I` filled with the digit '8'. Then, it compares each cell of the input grid with the corresponding cell in the canvas. If the values match (which they will for all cells containing '8' in the canvas), the output grid retains the input grid's value. If the values don't match (for cells containing '1' in the input), the output grid takes the value from the canvas, effectively replacing '1' with '8'.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = palette(I) 
  x2 = other(x1, 9)  
  O = apply(lambda r: tuple(8 if v == x2 else v for v in r), I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version identifies the digit to be replaced dynamically. It extracts the palette `x1` of the input grid `I`. Assuming '9' is always the background and another digit needs replacement, it finds the 'other' digit `x2` in the palette apart from '9'. Then, it iterates through each row `r` of the input grid and replaces all instances of `x2` with '8' to generate the output grid `O`.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  target_color = other(palette(I), mostcommon(I)) 
  new_objs = frozenset(recolor(8, obj) if color(obj) == target_color else obj for obj in objs)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(new_objs)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version identifies and modifies objects within the grid. It first identifies all objects in the input grid `I` using `objects` function.  Then, it determines the `target_color` to be replaced (assuming the most frequent color is the background). Next, it creates `new_objs` by recoloring objects of the `target_color` to '8' while keeping other objects unchanged. Finally, it paints these `new_objs` onto a canvas of the background color to generate the output grid `O`.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  indices_to_replace = ofcolor(I, 1) 
  O = fill(I, 8, indices_to_replace)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on modifying grid cells at specific indices. It determines the `indices_to_replace` by identifying the indices of all occurrences of the digit '1' using `ofcolor`. Then, it uses the `fill` function to replace the values at those indices in the input grid `I` with '8', generating the output grid `O`.
