## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves changing the color of the digit '1' to the digit '8' in the input grid. However, there are specific conditions:

* **Condition 1:** The '1' should not be on the rightmost edge of the grid.
* **Condition 2:** The '1' should not have another '1' immediately to its right.

If both conditions are met, the '1' is replaced by an '8'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using functions from the DSL (dsl.py):

**Version 1:** (Inspired by Program_A & Program_B)

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 1 and j < len(row) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] != 1:
        O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** `O = I` creates a copy of the input grid `I` as `O`.
2. **Iteration:** The nested loops iterate through each cell (value `val` at index `(i, j)`) of the grid.
3. **Condition Check:**  `val == 1 and j < len(row) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] != 1` checks if the current cell is '1', not on the rightmost edge (`j < len(row) - 1`), and doesn't have '1' to its right (`I[i][j + 1] != 1`).
4. **Transformation:** If the conditions are met, `paint(O, {(8, (i, j))})` replaces the '1' with '8' in the output grid `O`.
5. **Return:** Finally, the transformed grid `O` is returned.

**Version 2:** (Using `apply` and lambda function)

```python
def program_v2(I):
  return apply(lambda row: tuple(8 if j < len(row) - 1 and val == 1 and row[j + 1] != 1 else val for j, val in enumerate(row)), I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`apply` function:** Applies a lambda function to each row of the input grid `I`.
2. **Lambda function:** 
    - Iterates through each cell in the row.
    - Replaces '1' with '8' if it's not on the right edge and not followed by another '1', otherwise keeps the original value.
3. **Return:** Returns the transformed grid.

**Version 3:** (Using `product` and set comprehension)

```python
def program_v3(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  indices = frozenset((i, j) for i, j in product(range(h), range(w)) if j < w - 1 and I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j+1] != 1)
  return paint(I, {(8, index) for index in indices})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get indices:** Uses `product` and set comprehension to find indices of '1's meeting the conditions.
2. **Paint with '8':**  Uses `paint` to replace values at those indices with '8'.
3. **Return:** Returns the transformed grid.

**Version 4:** (Using `objects` and `recolor`)

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  filtered_objs = frozenset(obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == 1 and width(obj) == 1 and rightmost(obj) < len(I[0]) - 1)
  recolored_objs = frozenset(recolor(8, obj) for obj in filtered_objs)
  return paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get objects:** Uses `objects` to identify connected components ('1's in this case) as individual objects.
2. **Filter objects:** Keeps only objects that are single '1's and not on the right edge.
3. **Recolor objects:** Uses `recolor` to change the color of filtered objects to '8'.
4. **Paint on grid:** Uses `paint` to apply the recolored objects back onto the original grid.
5. **Return:** Returns the transformed grid.

**Version 5:** (Using recursion)

```python
def program_v5(I, i=0, j=0):
    if i == len(I):
        return I
    elif j == len(I[0]):
        return program_v5(I, i+1, 0)
    elif I[i][j] == 1 and j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j+1] != 1:
        I = paint(I, {(8, (i, j))})
    return program_v5(I, i, j+1)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Base Cases:** If the entire grid is traversed (`i == len(I)`), return the grid. If the end of a row is reached (`j == len(I[0])`), recursively move to the next row.
2. **Condition Check:** Check if the current cell is '1', not on the rightmost edge, and not followed by another '1'.
3. **Transformation:** If conditions met, replace '1' with '8' using `paint`.
4. **Recursive Call:** Recursively call the function for the next cell in the row (`program_v5(I, i, j+1)`).

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
