## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves recoloring all objects formed by the digit '1' to the digit '8'. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** The input grid has a single object formed by '1's. The output grid shows this object recolored to '8's.

**Pair 1:** The input has two objects formed by '1's. Both are recolored to '8's in the output.

**Pair 2 & 3:**  These pairs follow the same pattern. All objects made of '1's are identified and recolored to '8's in the output grid.

## Code Generation:

Based on the analysis, the core logic requires identifying objects formed by '1's and recoloring them to '8's. Here are five distinct program versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract all objects, excluding background
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1)  # Filter for objects with color '1'
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(8, obj), target_objs)  # Recolor to '8'
  O = I  # Start with the original grid
  for obj in recolored_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)  # Paint each recolored object onto the grid 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts all objects from the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Filter Target Objects:** `colorfilter(objs, 1)` selects only the objects where the color is '1'.
3. **Recolor:** `apply(lambda obj: recolor(8, obj), target_objs)` applies the `recolor` function to each target object, changing their color to '8'.
4. **Paint on Grid:** The code iterates through each recolored object and paints it onto a copy of the original grid using `paint`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)  # Get indices of all cells with color '1'
  O = fill(I, 8, target_indices)  # Fill those indices with color '8'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Target Indices:** `ofcolor(I, 1)` directly identifies the indices of all cells containing the value '1'.
2. **Fill with New Color:** `fill(I, 8, target_indices)` efficiently fills all the identified indices with the new color '8' in a single operation.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Initialize output as input
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])  # Get grid dimensions
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j))})  # Paint over '1's with '8'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Replace:** This version iterates through every cell of the grid.
2. **Conditional Recoloring:** If a cell contains the value '1', it's painted over with the value '8' using `paint`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_if_one(v, loc): 
      return (8, loc) if v == 1 else (v, loc)  # Recolor logic
  obj = asobject(I) # Convert grid to object
  recolored_obj = frozenset(recolor_if_one(v, loc) for v, loc in obj)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolored_obj)  # Paint on a blank canvas
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Recoloring Logic:** A helper function `recolor_if_one` handles the recoloring logic at the cell level.
2. **Grid to Object:** `asobject(I)` converts the grid into an object representation for easier manipulation.
3. **Apply Recoloring:** The code iterates through the object, applying the `recolor_if_one` function to each cell.
4. **Paint on Canvas:** The recolored object is then painted onto a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the original grid. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_row(row):
    return tuple(8 if v == 1 else v for v in row)  # Row-wise recoloring

  return tuple(process_row(row) for row in I)  # Apply to each row
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Row-wise Processing:**  This version defines a helper function `process_row` to handle recoloring for each row of the grid.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:**  The main function iterates through the grid row by row, applying the `process_row` function to each.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
