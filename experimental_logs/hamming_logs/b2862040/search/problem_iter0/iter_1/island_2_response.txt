## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces the color '1' with the color '8' in all objects that don't also contain the color '9'.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:**  The object composed entirely of '1's is recolored to '8's. The '1's within the object containing both '1's and '9's remain unchanged.
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, only the objects consisting solely of '1's are affected.
* **Input_2 & Input_3:**  The same logic applies; '1's are replaced with '8's only within objects that don't have any '9's.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" in the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_d511f180(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
    filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: colorcount(obj, 9) == 0)
    recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(8, obj), filtered_objs)
    O = I
    for obj in recolored_objs:
        O = paint(O, obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(...)`**: Identifies all distinct objects within the input grid (`I`).
2. **`filtered_objs = sfilter(...)`**: Filters the objects, keeping only those where the count of color '9' is zero.
3. **`recolored_objs = apply(...)`**:  Applies the `recolor` function to each object in `filtered_objs`, changing their color to '8'.
4. **`O = I`**: Initializes the output grid (`O`) as a copy of the input grid.
5. **`for obj in ...`**: Iterates through the recolored objects and paints them onto the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_d511f180(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        if 9 not in palette(obj):
            O = paint(O, recolor(8, obj))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(...)`**:  Identifies all distinct objects.
2. **`O = I`**:  Initializes the output as a copy of the input.
3. **`for obj in ...`**: Iterates through each object.
4. **`if 9 not in palette(obj)`**:  Checks if the color '9' is NOT present in the object's palette.
5. **`O = paint(O, recolor(8, obj))`**: If '9' is absent, the object is recolored to '8' and then painted onto the output grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_d511f180(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=False):
        O = branch(9 in palette(obj), paint(O, obj), paint(O, recolor(8, obj))) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(...)`**:  Creates an empty output grid of the same size and background color as the input.
2. **`for obj in ...`**: Iterates through each object in the input.
3. **`O = branch(...)`**: Uses the `branch` function for conditional painting:
    * If '9' is in the object's palette, the object is painted onto the output grid directly.
    * If '9' is not in the palette, the object is first recolored to '8' and then painted.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_d511f180(I):
    O = I
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val == 1 and 9 not in row:
                O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j))})
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`**:  Initializes the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. **`for i, row in ...`**: Iterates through each row and cell of the input grid.
3. **`if val == 1 and 9 not in row:`**:  Checks if the cell value is '1' and if '9' is not present in the entire row. 
4. **`O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j))})`**: If both conditions are met, the cell at (i, j) is painted with the color '8'. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_d511f180(I):
    def recolor_condition(value, index):
        row = I[index[0]] 
        return value == 1 and 9 not in row
    return paint(I, recolor(8, mfilter(asobject(I), lambda x: recolor_condition(x[0], x[1]))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`recolor_condition(...)`**: Defines a helper function to check if a cell should be recolored. It verifies if the cell value is '1' and if its row doesn't contain '9'.
2. **`asobject(I)`**: Converts the input grid into an object representation.
3. **`mfilter(...)`**: Filters the object cells using `recolor_condition`, keeping only the cells that need recoloring.
4. **`recolor(8, ...)`**:  Applies the `recolor` function to change the color of the filtered cells to '8'.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`**: Paints the recolored cells onto a copy of the input grid, generating the final output.


These five program versions showcase different approaches and function combinations within the DSL to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the language.
