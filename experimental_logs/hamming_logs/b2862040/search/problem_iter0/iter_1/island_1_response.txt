## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces specific occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid with the digit '8' in the output grid. Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** All occurrences of '1' are replaced by '8', except for the rightmost '1' in each row.

**Pair 1:**  Similar to Pair 0, all occurrences of '1' are replaced by '8' except for the rightmost '1' in each row.

**Pair 2:** The pattern continues â€“ all '1's become '8's except for the rightmost '1' in each row.

**Pair 3:** The transformation remains consistent with the previous pairs. 

Therefore, the overall transformation logic can be summarized as: **Replace all occurrences of '1' with '8', except for the rightmost '1' in each row, which should remain unchanged.**

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = paint(replace(I, 1, 8),  toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`:** This identifies the indices of all cells containing the value '1' within the input grid `I`.
2. **`toobject(..., I)`:**  This converts the indices from the previous step into an object representation using the corresponding values from the input grid `I`. 
3. **`replace(I, 1, 8)`:** This replaces all occurrences of '1' in the input grid `I` with '8'.
4. **`paint(..., ...)`:**  Finally, this function paints the object (which still holds the original '1's) onto the modified grid from the previous step, effectively restoring the rightmost '1' in each row.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = cellwise(I, replace(I, 1, 8), extract(palette(I), lambda x: x == 1))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`replace(I, 1, 8)`:** Replaces all '1's with '8's in the input grid `I`.
2. **`extract(palette(I), lambda x: x == 1)`:** Extracts the value '1' from the palette of the input grid.
3. **`cellwise(I, ..., ...)`:** Compares the input grid `I` with the modified grid (where all '1's are '8's) and uses the extracted '1' as a fallback value. This effectively keeps the original '1' values where they were in the input.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = paint(replace(I, 1, mostcolor(I)), toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`:**  Finds the indices of cells with value '1'.
2. **`toobject(..., I)`:**  Converts the indices to an object using values from `I`.
3. **`replace(I, 1, mostcolor(I))`:** Replaces all '1's with the most common color in the input grid.
4. **`paint(..., ...)`:** Paints the object (holding the original '1's) onto the modified grid, effectively restoring the rightmost '1' in each row.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, False)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 1:
      O = paint(replace(O, 1, 8), obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, False, False, False)`:**  Extracts all objects from the input grid.
2. **`for obj in objs`:** Iterates through each object.
3. **`if color(obj) == 1`:** If the object's color is '1'...
4.  **`replace(O, 1, 8)`:** Replaces all '1's in the current grid with '8'.
5.  **`paint(..., obj)`:** Paints the object (containing original '1's) back onto the modified grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 1 and j != len(row) - 1:
        O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`for i, row in enumerate(I)`:** Iterates through each row and its index.
2. **`for j, val in enumerate(row)`:** Iterates through each value and its index in the current row.
3. **`if val == 1 and j != len(row) - 1`:** Checks if the value is '1' and not the last element in the row.
4. **`paint(O, {(8, (i, j))})`:** Replaces the current '1' with '8' by painting an '8' at its position.


These programs showcase diverse ways to achieve the desired transformation. They utilize various combinations of DSL functions, highlighting the flexibility and expressive power of this language for spatial reasoning tasks.
