## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation replaces occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid with the digit '8', but only if they are directly adjacent to the left of another '1'. All other digits remain unchanged. 

**Example:**

Input:
```
9 1 1 1 9
```
Output:
```
9 8 8 8 9
```

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:** (Inspired by iterating over objects and conditional replacement)

```python
def program(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False):
    if color(obj) == 1:
      shifted_obj = shift(obj, (0, -1)) # Check left neighbor
      if len(intersection(toindices(obj), toindices(shifted_obj))) > 0:
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, obj))
      else: 
        O = paint(O, obj)
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas (`O`) of the same size and background color as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each object (connected components of '1's) in the input grid.
3. **Left Neighbor Check:** For each object of color '1', it creates a shifted version (`shifted_obj`) moved one position to the left. It then checks if there's an intersection between the original object and the shifted object. An intersection indicates the presence of a '1' to the left.
4. **Conditional Replacement:** If a left neighbor '1' exists, the object is recolored to '8' and painted onto the canvas. Otherwise, it's painted in its original color ('1').
5. **Other Objects:** Objects of colors other than '1' are directly painted onto the canvas without modification.

**Version 2:** (Inspired by cell-wise operations and neighbor checking)

```python
def program(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and j > 0 and I[i][j-1] == 1:
        O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j))})
      else:
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas (`O`) of the same size and background color as the input.
2. **Cell Iteration:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
3. **Left Neighbor and Color Check:** For each cell, it checks if it contains '1' and if its left neighbor exists and also contains '1'.
4. **Conditional Replacement:**  If both conditions are true, it paints an '8' at the cell's location on the canvas. Otherwise, it paints the cell's original value.

**Version 3:** (Using `apply` for concise cell-wise operation)

```python
def program(I):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    def transform_cell(x):
      i, j = x
      return 8 if I[i][j] == 1 and j > 0 and I[i][j-1] == 1 else I[i][j]
    return tuple(tuple(transform_cell((i,j)) for j in range(w)) for i in range(h))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Gets the height and width of the input grid.
2. **`transform_cell` Function:** Defines a function `transform_cell` which takes a cell's index (i, j) as input and applies the transformation logic: if the cell is '1' and has '1' to its left, return '8', else return the original cell value.
3. **Applying Transformation:** Uses nested `tuple` and `range` to iterate over each cell index and applies the `transform_cell` function to each cell, effectively constructing the output grid.

**Version 4:** (Using `papply` for vectorized operation)

```python
def program(I):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    def check_left(v, l):
      return 8 if v == 1 and l == 1 else v
    return tuple(papply(check_left, row, (9, *row[:-1])) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Gets the height and width of the input grid.
2. **`check_left` Function:** Defines a function `check_left` which takes two values as input (current cell and its left neighbor) and applies the transformation logic: if the current cell is '1' and the left neighbor is '1', return '8', else return the current cell value.
3. **Applying Transformation:** For each row, creates a tuple representing the left neighbors (prepending with a dummy '9' to handle the edge case of the first element) and uses `papply` to apply the `check_left` function to each cell and its corresponding left neighbor, effectively constructing the output grid.

**Version 5:** (Using list comprehension for conciseness)

```python
def program(I):
  return tuple(tuple(8 if cell == 1 and j > 0 and row[j - 1] == 1 else cell for j, cell in enumerate(row)) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **List Comprehension:** Utilizes nested list comprehension to iterate through each cell in the input grid.
2. **Conditional Replacement:**  Within the comprehension, directly checks if a cell is '1' and if its left neighbor exists and also contains '1'. If both conditions are true, replaces the cell with '8'; otherwise, keeps the original cell value.
3. **Output Generation:** The nested list comprehension elegantly generates the output grid with the desired transformation.
