## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently recolors all objects with more than one cell to the color '8' while preserving the original color of single-cell objects. 

**Let's break down the transformation for each example:**

* **Example 0:** The two multi-cell '1' objects are recolored to '8', while the single-cell '1' remains unchanged.
* **Example 1:** All multi-cell '1' objects are recolored to '8'. Single-cell '1' objects at the bottom remain '1'.
* **Example 2:** Similar to previous examples, multi-cell '1' objects become '8', and single-cell '1' objects stay the same.
* **Example 3:**  Again, multi-cell '1' objects are recolored to '8', and single-cell '1' objects retain their color.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)                      # Identify all objects
  multi_cell_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: len(obj) > 1) # Filter multi-cell objects
  recolored_objs = apply(rbind(recolor, 8), multi_cell_objs) # Recolor multi-cell objects to '8'
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs | objs)) # Paint on canvas, keeping single-cell objects
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects in the input grid.
2.  **Filter multi-cell objects:** `sfilter(objs, lambda obj: len(obj) > 1)` selects only objects with more than one cell.
3.  **Recolor multi-cell objects:** `apply(rbind(recolor, 8), multi_cell_objs)` applies the `recolor` function with the color '8' to each multi-cell object.
4.  **Paint on canvas:** A new canvas is created with the background color and size of the input.  `merge(recolored_objs | objs)` combines the recolored multi-cell objects and the original objects (which implicitly includes the single-cell objects), and then `paint` draws them onto the canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Identify all objects
  single_cell_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: len(obj) == 1) # Filter single-cell objects
  O = paint(
      paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(rbind(recolor, 8), objs))),
      merge(single_cell_objs)
  ) # Recolor all objects, then repaint single-cell objects
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify objects:**  Similar to version 1, we first identify all objects.
2.  **Filter single-cell objects:**  This time, we specifically filter and store the single-cell objects.
3.  **Recolor and repaint:** We recolor all objects to '8' and paint them onto the canvas. Then, we paint the single-cell objects on top, effectively restoring their original color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)                            # Identify background color
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)                    # Identify all objects
  filtered_indices = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: len(obj) > 1, toindices)  # Get indices of multi-cell objects
  O = fill(I, 8, merge(filtered_indices))         # Fill those indices with '8'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify background color and objects:** We get the background color and identify all objects.
2.  **Filter indices of multi-cell objects:** `mfilter(objs, lambda obj: len(obj) > 1, toindices)` gets the indices of all cells belonging to multi-cell objects.
3.  **Fill indices:** The `fill` function directly modifies the input grid, replacing the color at the identified indices with '8'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Identify all objects
  def recolor_conditional(obj):
    return recolor(8, obj) if len(obj) > 1 else recolor(color(obj), obj)
  recolored_objs = apply(recolor_conditional, objs) # Recolor based on cell count
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs)) # Reconstruct the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify objects:** Identify all objects in the grid.
2.  **Conditional Recoloring:**  `recolor_conditional` function decides the recoloring based on the object size. If the object has more than one cell, it recolors it to '8'; otherwise, it keeps the original color using `color(obj)`.
3.  **Apply Recoloring and Reconstruction:** Apply the `recolor_conditional` function to all objects and paint them on a new canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Identify all objects
  def process_object(obj):
    return recolor(8, obj) if len(obj) > 1 else obj
  processed_objs = apply(process_object, objs) # Process objects based on cell count
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(processed_objs)) # Paint processed objects onto a canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions, begin by identifying all objects.
2. **Process Objects:**  Define a `process_object` function that applies conditional recoloring. If the object has more than one cell, it recolors it to '8'; otherwise, it returns the object unchanged.
3. **Apply Processing and Reconstruction:** Apply the `process_object` function to all objects and paint the processed objects onto a new canvas.
