## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves two main steps:

1. **Recoloring:** All occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid are replaced with the digit '8'.
2. **Selective Replacement:** The digit '8' in the output grid is replaced back to '1' only at positions where it was originally '1' in the input grid.

Let's break down each input-output pair:

* **Input_0 - Output_0:**  All '1's are changed to '8's. Then, the '8's that were originally '1's in the input are restored back to '1's.
* **Input_1 - Output_1:** Same logic as Input_0 - Output_0. Note how the isolated '1' at the bottom right remains unchanged throughout the transformation.
* **Input_2 - Output_2:**  Same logic applied, consistently across different configurations of '1's and other digits.
* **Input_3 - Output_3:** The transformation holds true for larger and more complex grids, emphasizing the consistent logic.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the described transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  return paint(replace(I, 1, 8), 
               merge(frozenset({(1, loc) for v, loc in obj}) for obj in objs if color(obj) == 1))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies connected components of non-background color in the input grid `I`. 
2. **Replace All 1s with 8s:** `replace(I, 1, 8)` replaces all occurrences of '1' with '8' in the input grid.
3. **Filter Objects with Color 1:**  The code iterates through each object `obj` and checks if `color(obj) == 1`. This selects objects that were originally formed by '1's.
4. **Recreate Objects with 1s:** For each selected object, `frozenset({(1, loc) for v, loc in obj})` creates a new object with color '1' at the original locations.
5. **Merge and Paint:** `merge(...)` combines all recreated objects. `paint(...)` paints these merged objects onto the grid where all '1's were replaced with '8's.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  return paint(replace(I, 1, 8), recolor(1, ones)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Indices of 1s:**  `ofcolor(I, 1)` identifies the indices of all cells in grid `I` that have the value '1'.
2. **Replace All 1s with 8s:** `replace(I, 1, 8)` replaces all occurrences of '1' with '8' in the input grid.
3. **Recreate 1s at Original Indices:** `recolor(1, ones)` creates an object with color '1' at the previously identified indices of '1's.
4. **Paint onto Modified Grid:** `paint(...)` paints the recreated '1' object onto the grid where all '1's were initially replaced by '8's.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(replace(I, 1, 8), 
               {(1, loc) for v, loc in asobject(I) if v == 1})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Replace All 1s with 8s:** `replace(I, 1, 8)` replaces all occurrences of '1' with '8' in the input grid.
2. **Convert Grid to Object:**  `asobject(I)` converts the input grid `I` into an object representation where each cell is represented as (value, (row, column)).
3. **Filter and Recreate 1s:** The code iterates through the object and creates a new object containing only cells with the value '1', effectively recreating the '1' objects.
4. **Paint onto Modified Grid:** `paint(...)` paints the recreated '1' object onto the grid where all '1's were initially replaced by '8's.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  modified = replace(I, 1, 8)
  return cellwise(I, modified, mostcolor(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Replace All 1s with 8s:** `replace(I, 1, 8)` creates a modified grid where all occurrences of '1' are replaced with '8'.
2. **Cellwise Comparison:** `cellwise(I, modified, mostcolor(I))` compares the original grid `I` with the modified grid.
3. **Selective Replacement:** If the values in the corresponding cells of `I` and `modified` are the same, the cellwise function retains the original value. If different (meaning the original value was '1'), it uses the fallback value, which is the most common color of the grid (effectively restoring '1's where they were originally).

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones_indices = toindices(recolor(1, ofcolor(I, 1)))
  modified = replace(I, 1, 8)
  return paint(modified, recolor(1, ones_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify 1s' Indices:**  `ofcolor(I, 1)` gets indices of '1's. `recolor(1, ...)` converts these indices into an object representation.  `toindices(...)` extracts the indices back from the object. 
2. **Replace All 1s with 8s:** `replace(I, 1, 8)` creates a modified grid with all '1's replaced by '8's.
3. **Recreate 1s at Original Indices:**  `recolor(1, ones_indices)` creates an object with '1' at the previously stored indices.
4. **Paint onto Modified Grid:** `paint(modified, ...)` paints the recreated '1' object onto the modified grid. 

These five programs demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the same goal, leveraging different combinations of functions and logic within the provided DSL.
