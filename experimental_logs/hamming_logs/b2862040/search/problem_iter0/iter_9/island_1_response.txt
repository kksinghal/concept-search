## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying all objects with color '1' that are not horizontal lines and have a width greater than 1.  Then, it shifts these objects one position to the left and recolors them to '8'. All other objects remain unchanged.

**Let's break it down step-by-step:**

1. **Identify Target Objects:** The program should first identify all objects in the grid that meet the following criteria:
    * **Color:** The object should have a color value of '1'.
    * **Non-Horizontal Line:** The object should not be a horizontal line (i.e., its height should not be equal to 1).
    * **Width:** The object should have a width greater than 1.

2. **Shift Left:** Once identified, each target object should be shifted one position to the left.

3. **Recolor:** The shifted objects should have their color changed to '8'.

4. **Preserve Others:** All other objects and background cells in the grid should remain unchanged. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" in the provided DSL, along with explanations for each version:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  target_objs = frozenset(obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == 1 and width(obj) > 1 and not hline(obj))
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, -1)), target_objs)
  recolored_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(8, obj), shifted_objs)
  return paint(I, merge(recolored_objs)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)` identifies all objects in the input grid `I`. 
2. **Filter Target Objects:** `target_objs` filters the objects to select those with color '1', width greater than 1, and not a horizontal line.
3. **Shift Left:** `shifted_objs` shifts each target object one position to the left using `shift(obj, (0, -1))`.
4. **Recolor:**  `recolored_objs` recolors the shifted objects to '8' using `recolor(8, obj)`.
5. **Paint to Grid:** The shifted and recolored objects are merged and painted onto the original grid `I` using `paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))` to generate the output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False):
    if color(obj) == 1 and width(obj) > 1 and not hline(obj):
      O = paint(O, recolor(8, shift(obj, (0, -1))))
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** A blank canvas `O` is created with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate and Modify:**  The program iterates through each object in the input grid.
3. **Conditional Transformation:**  If an object meets the target criteria (color '1', width > 1, not a horizontal line), it's shifted left and recolored to '8' before being painted onto the canvas `O`.
4. **Preserve Others:**  Objects not meeting the criteria are painted onto the canvas `O` without modification.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(
    recolor(8, shift(obj, (0, -1)))
    for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
    if color(obj) == 1 and width(obj) > 1 and not hline(obj)
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a more compact generator expression within the `paint` function to achieve the transformation. It iterates through objects, applies the shift and recolor only to those meeting the criteria, and then paints the modified objects back onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, merge(
        frozenset(
            (8, (i, j - 1)) 
            for v, (i, j) in obj 
            if 0 <= j - 1 < len(I[0])
        )
        for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False) 
        if color(obj) == 1 and width(obj) > 1 and not hline(obj)
    ))
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly manipulates cell coordinates within the `paint` function. It iterates through target objects, shifts and recolors the individual cells of each object, and then paints the modified cells back onto the input grid. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            8 if (i, j + 1) in toindices(obj) and 0 <= j + 1 < len(row) and color(obj) == 1 and width(obj) > 1 and not hline(obj) else v
            for j, v in enumerate(row)
        )
        for i, row in enumerate(I)
    )
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through the input grid cell by cell. For each cell, it checks if the cell to its right belongs to a target object. If it does, the cell's value is changed to '8'. This approach avoids explicitly identifying and manipulating objects.
