## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces specific occurrences of the digit '1' with the digit '8'. The replacement pattern is as follows:

* **Horizontal Replacement:** In each row, replace all '1's with '8's *except* for the rightmost '1'. 

Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:

* **Input_0:** The '1's forming a horizontal line are replaced with '8's except for the rightmost '1' in each line.
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0,  horizontal '1's are replaced, preserving the rightmost one.
* **Input_2:**  The pattern holds, with rightmost '1's in each horizontal sequence remaining unchanged.
* **Input_3:** Consistent with the other examples, demonstrating the horizontal replacement rule.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, each with a different approach:


### **Program Version 1**

```python
def program(I):
  O = paint(I, toobject(frozenset(), I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 1:
        if (i, j + 1) not in ofcolor(I, 1):
          O = paint(O, {(1, (i, j))})
        else:
          O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j))}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Create an empty grid `O` of the same dimensions as the input `I`.
2. **Iterate and Replace:**  Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
3. **Check for Rightmost '1':** If the current cell is '1', check if the cell to its right is also '1'.
    * If the right cell is *not* '1', it means this is the rightmost '1' in a sequence, so paint it as '1' in the output grid.
    * If the right cell *is* '1', paint it as '8' in the output grid. 


### **Program Version 2**

```python
def program(I):
  O = replace(I, 1, 8)
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 1 and (j == len(row) - 1 or row[j + 1] != 1):
        O = paint(O, {(1, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Replace All '1's:**  Replace all occurrences of '1' with '8' in the input grid `I` and store it in `O`.
2. **Iterate and Restore:** Iterate through the input grid, searching for the original rightmost '1's.
3. **Conditional Restoration:** If a cell is '1' and is either at the end of the row or the next cell is not '1', paint a '1' over the '8' in the output grid `O`.


### **Program Version 3**

```python
def program(I):
  O = paint(replace(I, 1, 8), toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    ones = [j for j, val in enumerate(row) if val == 1]
    if ones:
      O = paint(O, {(1, (i, ones[-1]))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initial Replacement:** Replace all '1's with '8's and then paint the original '1's back onto the grid.
2. **Find Rightmost '1' Indices:**  For each row, get a list of indices where '1' is present.
3. **Paint Rightmost '1':** If the list of indices is not empty, paint the '1' at the last index of this list in the output grid. 


### **Program Version 4**

```python
def program(I):
  O = replace(I, 1, 8)
  for i, row in enumerate(O):
    try:
      j = len(row) - row[::-1].index(1) - 1
      O = paint(O, {(1, (i, j))})
    except ValueError:
      pass
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Replace All:** Replace all instances of '1' with '8'.
2. **Find and Paint:**  Iterate through the rows. For each row, find the index of the rightmost '1' (which is now an '8') using `row[::-1].index(1)`, and paint it back to '1'.  The `try-except` block handles rows without any '1's.

### **Program Version 5**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False):
    if color(obj) == 1:
      rightmost = max(obj, key=lambda x: x[1][1])
      O = paint(replace(O, 1, 8), {rightmost}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find all connected objects (groups of adjacent cells with the same value) in the grid.
2. **Process '1' Objects:** For each object with color '1', find the rightmost cell.
3. **Replace and Restore:** Replace all '1's in the grid with '8's.  Then, paint the rightmost cell of each original '1' object back to '1'.
