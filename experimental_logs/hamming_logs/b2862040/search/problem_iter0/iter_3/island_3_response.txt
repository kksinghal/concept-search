## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying objects formed by the digit '1' within the input grid and expanding these objects outward by one layer of cells, replacing the original cell values with '8'. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** The lone '1' object in the center expands to include all directly adjacent cells.

**Pair 1:** Two '1' objects expand: one in the top-middle, becoming a rectangle, and one at the bottom-right, extending along the bottom edge.

**Pair 2:** The large central '1' object expands to include its bordering cells, stopping at the '1' digit at the top-right.

**Pair 3:** Multiple '1' objects expand, including those along edges. Notice how the expansion stops at the grid borders.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated", leveraging the DSL functions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  one_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: toobject(dneighbors(toindices(obj)), I), one_objs)
  O = I
  for obj in expanded_objs:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, toindices(obj)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' Objects:** Similar to the provided programs, we begin by identifying all objects formed by the digit '1' (`one_objs`).
2. **Expand Objects:** We iterate through each '1' object (`one_objs`) and apply `dneighbors` to each cell index within the object. This effectively expands each object by one layer of directly adjacent cells. We use `toobject` to convert these expanded indices back into object form.
3. **Paint Expanded Objects:** We paint each expanded object onto a copy of the input grid (`O`), using the color '8'. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  expanded_indices = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1 and toobject(dneighbors(toindices(obj)), I))
  O = paint(I, recolor(8, toindices(expanded_indices)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Expand:** We combine the object identification and expansion steps by using `mfilter`.  This directly filters for '1' objects and applies the `dneighbors` expansion, converting them back to object form using `toobject`.
2. **Paint:**  Similar to Version 1, we paint the expanded indices onto a copy of the input grid using the color '8'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  expanded_indices = mpapply(dneighbors, one_indices, one_indices)
  O = paint(I, recolor(8, expanded_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Directly Get '1' Indices:** Instead of identifying objects, we directly obtain the indices of all cells containing '1' using `ofcolor`.
2. **Expand and Paint:** This version mirrors the structure of Version 2, using `mpapply` to apply `dneighbors` for expansion and then painting the resulting indices.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        for di, dj in [(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)]:
            new_i, new_j = i+di, j+dj
            if 0 <= new_i < len(I) and 0 <= new_j < len(I[0]):
                O = paint(O, {(8, (new_i, new_j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Expand:**  This version iterates directly through each cell of the grid. If a cell contains '1', it expands to its four direct neighbors, ensuring the new indices are within the grid bounds.
2. **Paint:**  It directly paints each expanded cell with the color '8'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I)
  expanded_obj = toobject(delta(toindices(one_obj)), I)
  O = paint(I, recolor(8, toindices(expanded_obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get '1' Object:**  Find all indices of '1' and convert to a single object.
2. **Expand Using Delta:** Calculate the 'delta', which are the indices directly surrounding the object, representing the expansion.
3. **Paint:** Paint the 'delta' indices with color '8'.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
