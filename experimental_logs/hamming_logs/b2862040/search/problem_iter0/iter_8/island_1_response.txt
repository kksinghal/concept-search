## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves changing the color of specific '1' valued cells to '8' within the input grid. The criteria for recoloring are as follows:

* **Horizontal Connectivity:** The '1' valued cell must be part of a horizontal line segment.
* **End of Segment:** The cell should be the second to last element of the horizontal line segment. In other words, it should be followed by a '1' and then a non-'1' value.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  filtered_objs = frozenset(obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == 1 and width(obj) > 1 and hline(obj) == False)
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, -1)), filtered_objs)
  return paint(I, merge(mapply(lambda obj: recolor(8, obj), shifted_objs))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We first identify all objects (connected components) in the input grid using `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)`.
2. **Filter Objects:** We keep only the objects that have color '1', width greater than 1, and are not horizontal lines using `frozenset(obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == 1 and width(obj) > 1 and hline(obj) == False)`.
3. **Shift Objects:** We shift each of the filtered objects one cell to the left using `mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, -1)), filtered_objs)`.
4. **Recolor and Paint:** We recolor the shifted objects to '8' and paint them back onto the original input grid using `paint(I, merge(mapply(lambda obj: recolor(8, obj), shifted_objs)))`.

This code effectively identifies the penultimate '1's in horizontal segments and recolors them to '8' while preserving other elements of the input grid.


**Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return jgfcbdhibdbdeejjahabffeebeghfhaf(I)
def jgfcbdhibdbdeejjahabffeebeghfhaf(I, i=0, j=0):
    if i == len(I):
        return I
    elif j == len(I[0]):
        return jgfcbdhibdbdeejjahabffeebeghfhaf(I, i+1, 0)
    elif I[i][j] == 1 and j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j+1] != 1:
        I = paint(I, {(8, (i, j))})
    return jgfcbdhibdbdeejjahabffeebeghfhaf(I, i, j+1)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterative Approach:** This version utilizes a recursive function `jgfcbdhibdbdeejjahabffeebeghfhaf` to iterate through each cell of the input grid `I`.
2. **Boundary Conditions:** The base cases for recursion are:
   - When the row index `i` reaches the end of the grid (`i == len(I)`), the modified grid is returned.
   - When the column index `j` reaches the end of the current row (`j == len(I[0])`), the function recursively calls itself with the next row (`i+1`) and resetting the column index to 0.
3. **Recoloring Condition:** The core logic lies in the condition: `I[i][j] == 1 and j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j+1] != 1`. This checks if the current cell value is '1', is not the last element of the row, and is followed by a non-'1' value. If this condition holds true, the current cell is recolored to '8' using `paint(I, {(8, (i, j))})`.
4. **Recursive Iteration:** Finally, the function recursively calls itself to move to the next cell (`j+1`) in the current row.

This iterative approach systematically scans the grid and applies the recoloring logic to the specific cells meeting the criteria.


**Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    shifted_I = shift(asobject(I), (0,1))
    recolored_objs = frozenset((8, index) for value, index in shifted_I if value == 1 and index[1] < len(I[0])-1 and I[index[0]][index[1]+1] != 1)
    return paint(I, recolored_objs)

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shifting the Grid:** The input grid `I` is first converted to an object using `asobject(I)` and then shifted one position to the right using `shift(asobject(I), (0,1))`. This effectively allows us to look ahead one position within the grid.
2. **Identifying Recoloring Candidates:**  We iterate through the shifted grid (`shifted_I`) and use a generator expression to identify cells that meet the recoloring criteria. These criteria are:
    - The value of the cell in the shifted grid is '1'.
    - The column index (`index[1]`) is within the bounds of the original grid, ensuring we don't go out of bounds when looking ahead.
    - The value of the cell immediately to the right of the current cell in the original grid (`I[index[0]][index[1]+1]`) is not '1'.
3. **Recoloring:** For each identified cell, we create a tuple `(8, index)` representing the new color ('8') and the cell's index. These tuples are collected into a `frozenset` named `recolored_objs`.
4. **Painting Back:** Finally, we paint the `recolored_objs` onto the original input grid `I` using the `paint()` function, effectively changing the target cells' color to '8'.


**Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def condition(obj):
    return color(obj) == 1 and width(obj) > 1 and hline(obj) == False
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, condition)
  shifted_recolored = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(8, shift(obj, (0, -1))), filtered_objs)
  return paint(I, shifted_recolored)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define the Condition:** We start by defining a helper function `condition(obj)` which encapsulates the criteria for selecting the objects that need recoloring. An object satisfies this condition if:
    - `color(obj) == 1`: The object consists of cells with value '1'.
    - `width(obj) > 1`:  The object has a width greater than 1, ensuring it's not an isolated '1'.
    - `hline(obj) == False`: The object is not a horizontal line, meaning it has some vertical extent.
2. **Identify and Filter Objects:** We then use the `objects` function to extract all connected components (objects) from the input grid `I` and filter them based on the `condition` defined earlier using `sfilter`. This gives us a `frozenset` of objects `filtered_objs` that meet our criteria.
3. **Shift, Recolor, and Merge:** We then perform three operations on each object in `filtered_objs` using `mapply`:
    - `shift(obj, (0, -1))`: Shift each object one cell to the left.
    - `recolor(8, ...)`: Recolor the shifted object to have a value of '8'.
4. **Paint the Changes:** Finally, we use the `paint` function to apply the color changes represented by `shifted_recolored` to the original grid `I`. This step effectively updates the color of the target cells in the grid, resulting in the desired output.


**Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    indices = frozenset((i,j) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0])-1) if I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j+1] != 1)
    recolored = recolor(8, indices)
    return paint(I, recolored)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Indices:** This version directly identifies the indices of the cells that need recoloring. It iterates through the input grid `I` using a generator expression and checks each cell for the following conditions:
    - The value of the current cell is '1' (`I[i][j] == 1`).
    - The current cell is not the last element in the row (`j < len(I[0])-1`).
    - The value of the cell to the right of the current cell is not '1' (`I[i][j+1] != 1`).
   If all three conditions are met, the index `(i, j)` of the current cell is added to the `indices` set.

2. **Recolor and Paint:** After identifying the target indices, the code recolors them to '8' by creating a new object `recolored` using `recolor(8, indices)`. Finally, it paints this `recolored` object onto the original grid `I` using `paint(I, recolored)`, resulting in the desired transformation.
