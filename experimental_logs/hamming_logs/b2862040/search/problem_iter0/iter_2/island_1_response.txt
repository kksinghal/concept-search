## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves changing the color of specific '1' digits within the input grid to the digit '8'.  The specific rule is:

* **Any '1' digit that is NOT on the rightmost edge of the grid is replaced with an '8'.**

Let's break down how this applies to each example:

* **Output_0, Output_1, Output_2, Output_3:** In all these outputs, observe how every '1' digit that doesn't touch the right boundary of the grid has been replaced by an '8'. The '1' digits on the rightmost column remain unchanged. 


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I 
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 1 and j < len(row) - 1:
        O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j))}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  We start by copying the input grid `I` to the output grid `O`.
2. **Iteration:** We iterate through each cell (location `(i, j)` with value `val`) of the input grid.
3. **Condition:** For each cell, we check if the value is '1' and if it's not in the last column (`j < len(row) - 1`).
4. **Transformation:** If the condition is met, we use the `paint` function to replace the value at the current location `(i, j)` with '8' in the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program(I):
  return tuple(tuple(8 if v == 1 and j < len(r) - 1 else v for j, v in enumerate(r)) for r in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **List Comprehension:** This version uses nested list comprehensions for a more compact solution.
2. **Conditional Replacement:** It iterates through rows and values within rows, replacing '1's with '8's only if they aren't in the last column (`j < len(r) - 1`).

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program(I):
  O = canvas(9, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    O = paint(O, {(v if v != 1 or j == len(row) - 1 else 8, (i, j)) for j, v in enumerate(row)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** It creates an empty canvas `O` of the same size as the input grid `I`, filled with the default value '9'.
2. **Painting Logic:** It iterates through the input grid and uses `paint` to selectively place values onto the canvas. It keeps original values or replaces '1's with '8's based on the condition.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1 and rightmost(obj) < len(I[0]) - 1)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(8, obj), filtered_objs))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:** It identifies objects (connected regions of the same color) within the grid.
2. **Filtering:** It filters for objects that are of color '1' and don't touch the right edge of the grid.
3. **Recoloring and Painting:** It recolors the filtered objects to '8' and paints them back onto the grid.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  for i, (row1, row2) in enumerate(zip(I, hconcat(I, ((9,),) * len(I)))):
    O = paint(O, {(8 if v1 == 1 and v2 == 9 else v1, (i, j)) for j, (v1, v2) in enumerate(zip(row1, row2))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Concatenation and Comparison:**  It horizontally concatenates a column of '9's to the input grid for edge detection.
2. **Iteration and Painting:** It iterates through rows of both the original and concatenated grids, comparing values to identify and recolor '1's at the right edge.
