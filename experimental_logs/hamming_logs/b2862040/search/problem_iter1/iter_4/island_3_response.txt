## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation revolves around identifying the outlines of objects formed by the digit '1' and recoloring them to '8', while leaving the original '1's intact.

**Logic:**

1. **Object Detection:** Identify connected regions of '1's in the input grid, considering them as distinct objects.
2. **Outline Extraction:** For each object, determine the cells that constitute its outline. These are cells within the object that have at least one '9' (background) as a direct neighbor (up, down, left, right).
3. **Recoloring:** Recolor the identified outline cells to '8'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  one_objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)  # Find objects
  outline_indices = mpapply(lambda obj: sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda loc: any(I[i][j] != 1 for i, j in dneighbors(loc))), one_objs) # Get outlines
  O = paint(I, recolor(8, outline_indices)) # Recolor outlines
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`: Identifies connected regions of '1's as distinct objects.
2. `mpapply(...)`: Iterates through each object and applies the inner function to extract outline indices.
3. `sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda loc: any(I[i][j] != 1 for i, j in dneighbors(loc)))`: For each cell within an object, checks if any of its direct neighbors is not '1' (meaning it's on the outline).
4. `paint(I, recolor(8, outline_indices))`: Recolors the identified outline indices to '8' on a copy of the input grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and any(I[i+di][j+dj] != 1 for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)] if 0<=i+di<len(I) and 0<=j+dj<len(I[0])):
        O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j))}) # Recolor outline cells to 8
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterates through each cell of the grid.
2. Checks if the cell value is '1' and if any of its direct neighbors is not '1'.
3. If both conditions are true, it recolors the cell to '8' on a copy of the input grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  one_obj = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  outline_indices =  mpapply(lambda obj:  sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda loc: len(intersection(dneighbors(loc), toindices(obj))) < 4), one_obj)
  return paint(I, recolor(8, outline_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`: Finds connected '1' regions.
2. `mpapply(...)`: Applies the outline finding logic to each object.
3. `sfilter(...)`: Selects cells where less than 4 direct neighbors are part of the same object (indicating an outline cell).
4. `paint(I, recolor(8, outline_indices))`: Recolors outline indices on the input grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = canvas(9, shape(I)) # Create a blank canvas filled with '9's
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    O = paint(O, recolor(8,  sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda loc: len(intersection(dneighbors(loc), toindices(obj))) < 4))) # Draw outlines on the canvas
    O = paint(O, obj) # Draw the original objects over the outlines
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `canvas(9, shape(I))`: Creates a grid of '9's with the same dimensions as the input.
2. Iterates through each object found in the input.
3. For each object, it draws its outline on the canvas using '8's.
4. Then, it draws the original object over its outline, ensuring the '1's are preserved.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  one_objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True) # Detect objects formed by '1's
  outline_cells = mpapply(lambda obj: difference(box(obj),  inbox(obj)), one_objs) # Find outline cells for each object
  return paint(I, recolor(8, outline_cells)) # Paint the outline cells on the input grid 
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(...)`: Detects connected '1's as objects.
2. `mpapply(...)`: Applies the outline finding logic to each object.
3. `difference(box(obj), inbox(obj))`: Calculates the outline by finding the difference between the outer and inner bounding boxes of the object.
4. `paint(I, recolor(8, outline_cells))`: Recolors the identified outline cells on the input grid.
