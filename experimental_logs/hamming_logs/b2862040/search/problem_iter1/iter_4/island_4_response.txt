## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation revolves around replacing the digit '1' with the digit '8' in the input grids, but with specific rules:

* **Rule 1:** Only '1's that are part of objects (connected horizontally or vertically) are affected. 
* **Rule 2:** The rightmost '1' of each object remains unchanged.

Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** 
* The top-left object of '1's gets all but its rightmost '1' replaced by '8'.
* The isolated '1' on the right side remains unchanged.

**Pair 1:**
* Similar to Pair 0, rightmost '1's in each object are preserved.
* Notice the bottom-right corner: the object wraps around, so the '1' at (11,9) remains a '1', not the one at (11,8).

**Pair 2:** 
* The transformation consistently preserves the rightmost '1' of every object, regardless of its position within the object.

**Pair 3:** 
* This example reinforces the consistent application of the rules across different grid sizes and object configurations.


## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to perform the transformation:

**Version 1:  Object-Based Approach**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  for obj in objs:
    rightmost_j = max(j for _, (i, j) in obj)
    for value, (i, j) in obj:
        if j != rightmost_j:
            I = paint(I, {(8, (i, j))}) 
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  It uses `objects` to find all connected objects of '1's.
2. **Find Rightmost:** For each object, it determines the column index (`rightmost_j`) of the rightmost '1'.
3. **Selective Replacement:** It iterates through the object's cells, replacing '1's with '8's only if they are not in the `rightmost_j` column. 

**Version 2: Line-Scanning and Modification**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    last_one = len(row) - 1
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 1:
        last_one = j
    if last_one != len(row) - 1:
      I = paint(I, {(8, (i, k)) for k in range(last_one)})
  return I 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate by Rows:** Goes through each row of the grid.
2. **Find Last '1':**  Keeps track of the index (`last_one`) of the last encountered '1' in the row.
3. **Replace Up to Last '1':** If `last_one` isn't the very last cell, it replaces all values from the beginning of the row up to (but not including) `last_one` with '8'.

**Version 3: Recursive Right-to-Left Traversal**

```python
def replace_recursive(grid, row, col):
    if col < 0 or grid[row][col] != 1:
        return grid
    grid = paint(grid, {(8, (row, col))})
    return replace_recursive(grid, row, col - 1)

def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j in range(len(row) - 1, -1, -1):
        if row[j] == 1:
            I = replace_recursive(I, i, j - 1)
            break
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Trigger:** Iterates through the grid, and upon finding a '1', triggers the `replace_recursive` function.
2. **Recursive Replacement:** `replace_recursive` replaces '1's with '8's towards the left (decreasing column index) until a non-'1' or the grid edge is encountered.

**Version 4:  Shifting and Masking**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted = shift(asobject(I), (0, 1))
  return paint(fill(I, 8, sfilter(asindices(I), lambda ij: ij[1] < width(I) - 1)), toobject(sfilter(asindices(I), lambda ij: ij[1] == width(I) - 1), I)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift and Compare:** Shifts the entire grid one position to the right, then compares each cell's value with the original grid.
2. **Identify and Replace:**  Where values match (indicating a '1' that wasn't the last in its sequence), it replaces them with '8'.

**Version 5: Exploiting Horizontal Splits**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  splits = hsplit(I, width(I))
  return hconcat(apply(lambda c: replace(c, 1, 8), splits[:-1]), splits[-1:]) 
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **Split into Columns:** Divides the grid into single-column splits.
2. **Replace Except Last:** Replaces all '1's with '8's in every split except the last one.
3. **Recombine:** Concatenates the modified splits back together. 


Remember that these are just five potential solutions. There might be other, even more efficient or elegant ways to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL!
