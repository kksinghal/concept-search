## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation replaces all occurrences of the digit '1' that are not on the rightmost column of the grid with the digit '8'.

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 to Output_0:**  All '1' digits except the rightmost ones in each row are replaced by '8'.
* **Input_1 to Output_1:**  Same as above, all internal '1' digits become '8'.
* **Input_2 to Output_2:**  The pattern holds, only internal '1' digits are modified.
* **Input_3 to Output_3:** Consistent with the previous examples, the transformation targets internal '1' digits.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each with an explanation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 1 and j < len(row) - 1:  # Check if not the last element in the row
        O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 
This version iterates through each cell of the grid. If the cell contains '1' and is not the last element in its row, it paints an '8' over that cell.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      8 if val == 1 and j < len(row) - 1 else val 
      for j, val in enumerate(row)
    ) 
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:** 
This version utilizes nested list comprehensions for a more concise solution. It directly constructs the output grid by replacing '1's with '8's if they are not the last element in their respective rows.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(9, shape(I)) # Start with a canvas of all 9s
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != 9 and j < len(row) - 1: # Paint back non-9s except in the last column
        O = paint(O, {(val, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 
This version first creates a canvas filled with '9's. Then, it iterates through the input grid and paints back the original values for all cells except those containing '9' and those in the last column. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=False) # Extract all objects
  modified_objs = frozenset(
    recolor(8, obj) if color(obj) == 1 and rightmost(obj) < width(I) - 1 else obj 
    for obj in objs
  ) # Recolor objects with color 1 not touching the right border
  return paint(canvas(9, shape(I)), merge(modified_objs)) # Paint modified objects onto a blank canvas
```

**Explanation:** 
This version uses object-based manipulation. It first extracts all objects from the grid. Then, it iterates through each object and recolors it to '8' if its color is '1' and it doesn't touch the right border of the grid. Finally, it paints all modified objects onto a blank canvas of '9's.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  right_column = hsplit(I, width(I))[width(I)-1] # Extract the rightmost column
  modified_grid = hconcat(
    apply(lambda row: tuple(8 if val == 1 else val for val in row), hsplit(I, width(I))[:-1]), # Replace 1s with 8s in all but the last column
    (right_column,)  # Add back the original rightmost column
  )
  return modified_grid
```

**Explanation:**
This version uses a divide-and-conquer approach. It extracts the rightmost column, then replaces all '1's with '8's in the remaining grid portion. Finally, it re-combines the modified grid with the original rightmost column. 


These five versions showcase different approaches to achieving the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
