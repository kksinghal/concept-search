## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves replacing specific occurrences of the digit '1' with the digit '8' in the input grid. The specific rule for replacement is:

**Replace a '1' with an '8' if and only if that '1' is not in the rightmost column of the grid.**

Let's analyze this for each input-output pair:

* **Input_0:** Only the '1's in the first ten columns are replaced with '8's. The '1's in the last column remain unchanged.
* **Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0, only the '1's not in the rightmost column become '8's.
* **Input_2:**  The pattern holds true. Even '1's that are part of a larger group of '1's are replaced, as long as they are not in the last column.
* **Input_3:**  Again, the transformation is consistently applied across the entire grid.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the DSL from `dsl.py`:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return hconcat(
    apply(lambda c: replace(c, 1, 8), hsplit(I, width(I) - 1)),
    hsplit(I, width(I) - 1)[-1:]
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`hsplit(I, width(I) - 1)`:** Splits the grid `I` horizontally into two parts: the first part contains all columns except the last one, and the second part contains only the last column.
2. **`apply(lambda c: replace(c, 1, 8), ...)`:** Applies the `replace` function to each subgrid in the first part of the split. The `replace` function substitutes all occurrences of '1' with '8'.
3. **`hconcat(..., hsplit(I, width(I) - 1)[-1:])`:** Concatenates the modified first part of the grid with the unmodified last column using `hconcat`, resulting in the final output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    fill(I, 8, sfilter(asindices(I), lambda ij: ij[1] < width(I) - 1)), 
    toobject(sfilter(asindices(I), lambda ij: ij[1] == width(I) - 1), I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`sfilter(asindices(I), lambda ij: ij[1] < width(I) - 1)`:**  Filters the indices of the grid to get those not in the last column.
2. **`fill(I, 8, ...)`:** Fills the grid `I` with '8' at the filtered indices.
3. **`sfilter(asindices(I), lambda ij: ij[1] == width(I) - 1)`:** Filters the indices to get only those in the last column.
4. **`toobject(..., I)`:**  Creates an object from the filtered indices and the corresponding values from the input grid `I`.
5. **`paint(..., ...)`:**  Paints the object (last column) onto the filled grid, resulting in the final output grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(8 if j < width(I) - 1 and val == 1 else val for j, val in enumerate(row)) 
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested loops to iterate over each cell in the grid.

1. **`for i, row in enumerate(I)`:** Iterates through each row.
2. **`for j, val in enumerate(row)`:** Iterates through each cell in the row.
3. **`8 if j < width(I) - 1 and val == 1 else val`:**  Checks if the cell is not in the last column (`j < width(I) - 1`) and if its value is '1'. If both conditions are true, it replaces the value with '8'; otherwise, it keeps the original value.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, {(8, (i, j)) for i, r in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(r) if v == 1 and j < width(I) - 1})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`{(8, (i, j)) ... }`:** Creates an object containing tuples of (value, index). The value is set to '8' for all cells that meet the criteria: the cell value is '1' and it's not in the last column. 
2. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the object directly onto the input grid `I`, replacing the target '1's with '8's and leaving the rest unchanged.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return hconcat(
    crop(replace(I, 1, 8), (0, 0), (height(I), width(I) - 1)),
    crop(I, (0, width(I) - 1), (height(I), 1))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`replace(I, 1, 8)`:** Replaces all '1's in the grid with '8's.
2. **`crop(..., (0, 0), (height(I), width(I) - 1))`:** Extracts the portion of the modified grid that excludes the last column.
3. **`crop(I, (0, width(I) - 1), (height(I), 1))`:** Extracts the last column from the original input grid.
4. **`hconcat(..., ...)`:** Concatenates the two extracted parts horizontally to create the final output grid.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation in the provided DSL, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the language.
