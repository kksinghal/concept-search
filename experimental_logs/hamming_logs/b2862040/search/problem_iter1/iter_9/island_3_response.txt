## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions) of the digit '1' in the input grid and then drawing a border around them using the digit '8' in the output grid. The original '1's are preserved.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- Two objects of '1' are identified.
- An '8' border is drawn around each object, leaving the original '1's intact.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- Several '1' objects are identified, including some with holes.
- '8' borders are drawn around all objects, maintaining the holes.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- Again, multiple '1' objects are found.
- The transformation adds an '8' border, preserving the original object shapes.

**Input_3 to Output_3:**
- This example features a mix of simple and complex '1' objects.
- '8' borders are correctly added to all objects, regardless of their shape.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(9, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    if color(obj) == 1:
      O = paint(O, recolor(8, box(toindices(obj))))
      O = underpaint(O, obj) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialize Canvas:** A blank canvas `O` is created with the same dimensions as the input grid `I`, filled with the background color '9'.
2. **Iterate over Objects:** It iterates through each object in the input grid `I` using `objects` function.
3. **Filter for '1' Objects:**  The `if` condition ensures only objects made of '1' are processed.
4. **Draw Border:** The border of the current object is calculated using `box`, recolored to '8', and painted onto the canvas `O`.
5. **Preserve Original Object:** The original object is then painted over the border using `underpaint`, ensuring the '1's remain.
6. **Return Output:** The modified canvas `O` is returned as the output.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I 
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    if color(obj) == 1:
      O = paint(O, recolor(8, delta(toindices(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialize Output:** Directly initializes output `O` with the input grid `I`.
2. **Find '1' Objects:** Iterates over objects in `I` and filters for those with color '1'.
3. **Draw Border:** Computes the border using `delta` (finding cells surrounding the object) and colors it '8'.
4. **Direct Painting:** Uses `paint` to directly overwrite corresponding cells in `O`, effectively drawing the border. 
5. **Return Modified Grid:** Returns the modified grid `O` as the final output.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and any((I[i+di][j+dj] == 9 for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)])):
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i,j)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Direct Modification:** Modifies the input grid `I` directly to produce the output `O`.
2. **Iterate through Cells:** Iterates through every cell of the input grid.
3. **Identify Border Cells:** Checks if a cell contains '1' and has at least one adjacent '9', indicating a border cell.
4. **Change Border Color:** If a border cell is found, its color is changed to '8' using `paint` and `recolor` functions.
5. **Return Modified Grid:** Returns the modified `O` grid, which now has '8' borders around '1' objects.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(9, shape(I))
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  for i, j in one_indices:
    if any(((i + di, j + dj) not in one_indices) for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]):
      O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(i, j)}))
  O = underpaint(O, asobject(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Create Blank Canvas:** Creates a canvas `O` filled with the background color '9'.
2. **Find '1' Indices:** Obtains indices of all cells containing '1' in the input grid `I` using `ofcolor`.
3. **Identify Border Indices:**  Iterates over `one_indices` and checks if any adjacent cell doesn't contain '1', signifying a border. 
4. **Paint Border on Canvas:** For identified border cells, paints an '8' at that location on the canvas `O`.
5. **Overlay Original Objects:** Overlays the original '1' objects from the input grid onto the canvas using `underpaint` and `asobject`, ensuring the '1's are not overwritten by the borders.
6. **Return Output Canvas:** Returns the final canvas `O` as the output.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    if color(obj) == 1:
      border = set()
      for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
        for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]:
          ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
          if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] != 1:
            border.add((ni, nj))
      O = paint(O, recolor(8, frozenset(border)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Directly Modify Input:** Starts by copying the input grid `I` into the output grid `O`.
2. **Iterate Through Objects:** Finds all objects in `I` using `objects` function.
3. **Focus on '1' Objects:** Selects objects made solely of '1' using `color(obj) == 1`.
4. **Manually Find Border:** Iterates through each cell of the chosen object and its four neighbors.
5. **Identify and Store Border Cells:** If a neighbor is not part of the object (i.e., not '1'), it's added to the `border` set. 
6. **Paint the Border:** Finally, the collected `border` cells are colored '8' on the output grid `O` using `paint` and `recolor`.
7. **Return the Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned as the output.

These different versions demonstrate various approaches to solve the problem, each with its own logic and function combinations, highlighting the flexibility of the provided DSL.
