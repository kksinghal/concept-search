## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to find all occurrences of the digit '1' within the input grid. Then, for each occurrence, it checks if there is another '1' to its right. If so, it replaces both '1's with '8's. If not, the original digit is retained. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

* The '1's in the top two rows and the bottom three rows are isolated and thus remain unchanged.
* The cluster of '1's in the middle forms a shape where each '1' has another '1' to its right, except for the rightmost '1' in each row. Therefore, all '1's in the cluster are replaced by '8', except for the rightmost '1's in those rows.

**Input_1:**

* Similar to Input_0, isolated '1's remain unchanged.
* The clusters of '1's in rows 2, 3, and 4 are transformed to '8's except for the rightmost '1's.
* The '1's in the bottom right corner are also transformed to '8's except for the rightmost '1's in those rows.

**Input_2:**

* This input highlights that the transformation considers the entire grid, not just individual objects formed by the digits.
* Similar to the previous examples, the transformation only affects '1's with another '1' to their right.

**Input_3:**

* This example reinforces the previous observations.
* Note that the '1' in the second last row is isolated and remains unchanged despite being part of a larger object of '1's.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    I,
    merge(
      frozenset(
        branch(
          v == 1 and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 1,
          (8, (i, j)),
          (v, (i, j))
        ) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** The code iterates through each cell (i, j) and its value (v) in the input grid (I).
2. **Check for Right Neighbor:** For each '1', it checks if the cell to its right (i, j + 1) also contains a '1' using the `index` function.
3. **Conditional Replacement:** If both cells are '1', it replaces the current cell with '8' using the `branch` function. Otherwise, it retains the original value (v).
4. **Paint to Grid:** Finally, the transformed cells are painted back onto the input grid (I) using the `paint` function, resulting in the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      8 if v == 1 and j < width(I) - 1 and row[j+1] == 1 else v
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    ) for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Rows and Cells:** This version iterates directly through the rows and cells of the input grid.
2. **Check for Right Neighbor:** For each cell with value '1', it checks if it's not the last element in the row (j < width(I) - 1) and if its right neighbor also has the value '1'.
3. **Conditional Replacement:**  If both conditions are true, it replaces the value with '8'. Otherwise, it retains the original value (v).
4. **Construct Output Grid:** The transformed values are used to construct a new grid, which is returned as the output.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      branch(
        v == 1 and j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 1, 
        8, 
        v
      ) for j, v in enumerate(row)
    ) for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

* This version is similar to version 2 but utilizes the `branch` function for a more compact conditional replacement.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    I, 
    frozenset(
      (8, (i, j)) if v == 1 and j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 1 else (v, (i, j)) 
      for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(row) 
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

* This version utilizes list comprehension to generate a set of cell-value pairs. It then uses the `paint` function to apply these changes to the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted = shift(asobject(I), (0, 1))
  return paint(
    I,
    frozenset(
      (8, (i, j)) if v == 1 and (1, (i, j + 1)) in shifted and shifted.intersection({(1, (i, j + 1))}).pop()[0] == 1 else (v, (i, j))
      for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift and Compare:** This version first shifts the entire input grid one position to the right using `shift` and `asobject`.
2. **Check for '1' Pair:** It then iterates through the original grid, checking if a cell contains '1' and if its corresponding shifted cell also contains '1'. 
3. **Replace with '8':** If both cells contain '1', it replaces the original cell's value with '8'.
4. **Paint the Grid:** Finally, the modified cell-value pairs are painted back onto the input grid using the `paint` function.

These five versions offer different approaches to achieving the same transformation, leveraging various functions available in the provided DSL.
