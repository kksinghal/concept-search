## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently outlines objects composed of '1's in the input grid, replacing the original '1's with '8's on the output grid. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** The single object formed by '1's is outlined, changing the '1's to '8's while leaving the background ('9's) untouched.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:** Similar to Output_0, all '1' objects are outlined. Notice how the transformation correctly handles objects adjacent to the grid's edge.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:** Again, all '1' objects are outlined. This example highlights the transformation's ability to handle objects with holes or concavities.

**Input_3 -> Output_3:** The transformation accurately outlines all four '1' objects present, demonstrating consistency across varying object counts and configurations.


## Program_to_be_generated:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def outline_ones(I):
  one_objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True) # Find all objects formed by '1's
  outline_indices = mpapply(lambda obj:  box(toindices(obj)), one_objs) # Find outline indices for each object
  O = paint(I, recolor(8, outline_indices)) # Paint the outline cells with '8' on the input grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' Objects:** `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies all objects formed by connected '1's, excluding the background.
2. **Extract Outline Indices:** `mpapply(lambda obj: box(toindices(obj)), one_objs)` iterates through each object and utilizes the `box` function to determine the indices of its outer boundary. 
3. **Recolor Outlines:**  `paint(I, recolor(8, outline_indices))` paints the input grid (`I`) with '8's at the specified outline indices, effectively outlining the objects.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def outline_ones(I):
  one_objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = I
  for obj in one_objs:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, box(toindices(obj)))) # Directly paint the outline of each object 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Iterative Outlining:** Instead of pre-computing all outlines, this version iterates through each object. For every object, it directly paints its outline onto the grid `O` using `paint` and `recolor`.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def outline_ones(I):
  one_objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  outline_indices = merge(apply(lambda obj: difference(box(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj)), one_objs)) # Calculate difference between box and object indices
  return paint(I, recolor(8, outline_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Calculate Outline Difference:**  This version leverages set theory. It calculates the outline indices by finding the difference between the indices of the object's bounding box (`box`) and the indices of the object itself.
3. **Paint Outlines:** Similar to previous versions, it paints the outline using the calculated indices.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def outline_ones(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and any(I[k][l] != 1 for k, l in dneighbors((i, j))): # Check for neighboring non-'1' cells
        O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j))}) # Paint if a neighboring cell is not '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Grid:** This version directly iterates through each cell of the grid.
2. **Check for Outline Condition:** For each cell containing '1', it checks if any of its direct neighbors are not '1'. If so, this cell is considered part of the outline.
3. **Paint Outline Cell:** If the cell meets the outline condition, it's painted with '8'.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def outline_ones(I):
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1) # Directly obtain indices of '1's
  outline_indices = sfilter(one_indices, lambda loc: len(intersection(dneighbors(loc), one_indices)) < 4) # Filter for indices with less than 4 '1' neighbors
  return paint(I, recolor(8, outline_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get '1' Indices:** `ofcolor(I, 1)` directly provides the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **Filter for Outline Indices:** It filters the '1' indices, keeping only those with less than four direct neighbors that are also '1's. This cleverly identifies outline cells as they have at least one non-'1' neighbor.
3. **Paint Outlines:**  The filtered indices, representing the outline, are then painted with '8's on the input grid.


Each of these program versions utilizes distinct logic or function combinations to achieve the desired transformation, ensuring diversity in the solutions provided.
