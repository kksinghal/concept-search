## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring specific cells within objects of a certain color. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** All cells belonging to objects with color "1" are recolored to "8", except for the rightmost cell in each object, which remains "1".

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**  Similar to the previous transformation, cells within "1" colored objects are recolored to "8" except for the rightmost cell. However, this time the transformation only affects objects not touching the right edge of the grid.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:** This transformation follows the same pattern as Output_1 â€“ recoloring "1" colored objects to "8" except for the rightmost cell, but only for objects not touching the right grid border.

**Input_3 -> Output_3:** Identical transformation as Output_1 and Output_2.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True) # Extract connected objects
  filtered_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1) # Filter objects with color 1
  recolored_objs = apply(
    lambda obj: recolor(8, difference(obj, {(1, (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj)))})), 
    filtered_objs
  ) # Recolor all but the top-right cell of each object
  return paint(canvas(9, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs | (objs - filtered_objs))) # Paint recolored objects onto a blank canvas and add back other objects
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify all connected objects in the grid using `objects` with `univalued=True` for same-colored objects.
2. **Filter Objects:** Isolate objects with color "1" using `colorfilter`.
3. **Recolor Objects:** For each object in `filtered_objs`, recolor all cells to "8" except the top-right cell using `recolor` and `difference`.
4. **Paint Objects:** Create a blank canvas with `canvas` and paint the recolored objects onto it. Then, add back the remaining objects from the original grid using `paint` and `merge`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  return paint(
    canvas(9, shape(I)),
    merge(
      frozenset(
        recolor(8, difference(obj, {(1, (i, rightmost(obj)))})) 
        if color(obj) == 1 and rightmost(obj) < width(I) - 1
        else obj
        for obj in objs
        for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)
      )
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:** Iterate through each object and each row within the object. Recolor the object to "8" except for the rightmost cell if the object's color is "1" and it doesn't touch the right border.
3. **Paint Objects:** Similar to Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    canvas(9, shape(I)), 
    merge(
      apply(
        lambda obj: recolor(8, difference(obj, {(1, (uppermost(obj), j))})) if color(obj) == 1 and j < width(I) - 1 else obj,
        objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
      )
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Recolor with Condition:**  Iterate through each object and its rightmost column index. Recolor to "8" except for the cell in the rightmost column if the object's color is "1" and doesn't touch the right border.
3. **Paint Objects:** Similar to Version 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  modified_grid = I
  for j in range(width(I) - 1):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) == 1 and index(I, (i, j + 1)) in (1, 9):
        modified_grid = paint(modified_grid, {(8, (i, j))})
  return modified_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:** Loop through every cell in the grid except for the rightmost column.
2. **Check Conditions:** If a cell's value is "1" and its right neighbor is either "1" or "9", recolor the cell to "8".
3. **Return Modified Grid:** Return the grid with the applied recoloring.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    canvas(9, shape(I)), 
    merge(
      apply(
        lambda obj: branch(
          both(equality(color(obj), 1), less(rightmost(obj), width(I) - 1)),
          recolor(8, obj),
          obj
        ),
        objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
      )
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Conditional Recoloring:** For each object, use `branch` to apply conditional recoloring. If the object's color is "1" and it doesn't touch the right border, recolor it to "8" using `recolor`. Otherwise, keep the object unchanged.
3. **Paint Objects:** Similar to Version 1.


These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation using different DSL function combinations and logic, offering flexibility and potential optimization depending on the context.
