## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific cells within a grid and changing their value to '8'. 

**Logic:**

The transformation targets '1' valued cells that are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to cells that are not '1'. In other words, it outlines the '1' valued objects within the grid. The original '1' values within the objects are preserved, only the boundary cells are changed to '8'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  one_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  outline_indices = mfilter(one_objs, lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)))
  O = I 
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, outline_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We use `objects` function to find all distinct objects formed by connected '1's (excluding the background). 
2. **Filter for '1' Objects:**  The `sfilter` function selects only those objects whose color is '1'.
3. **Find Outline:** `mfilter` with the `delta` function finds the outline indices of each '1' object - these are the cells adjacent to the object but not part of it.
4. **Paint Outline:** Finally, `paint` function colors the outline indices with '8' on a copy of the input grid ('O'). 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and any(I[i+di][j+dj] != 1 for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)] if 0 <= i+di < h and 0 <= j+dj < w):
        O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** This version iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Adjacent Cell Condition:** For each cell containing a '1', it checks if any directly adjacent cell (up, down, left, right) is not a '1'.
3. **Paint if Condition Met:** If a non-'1' adjacent cell is found, the current cell's value in the output grid ('O') is changed to '8' using `paint`. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  outline_indices = mfilter(one_indices, lambda ind: any(n not in one_indices for n in dneighbors(ind)))
  O = paint(I, recolor(8, outline_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' Indices:** `ofcolor` function directly identifies all indices where the grid value is '1'.
2. **Check for Non-'1' Neighbors:**  `mfilter` iterates through the '1' indices, and for each index, it checks if any of its direct neighbors are not in the set of '1' indices.
3. **Paint Outline:** If a non-'1' neighbor is found, the corresponding index is painted with '8' in the output grid ('O').

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(9, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    if color(obj) == 1:
      O = underpaint(O, recolor(8, delta(toindices(obj))))
      O = underpaint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Blank Canvas:** We start with a blank canvas filled with the background color (9).
2. **Iterate through Objects:** We find all objects and iterate through them.
3. **Process '1' Objects:** If an object's color is '1', we first paint its outline with '8' using `underpaint` to avoid overwriting existing content. Then, we paint the object itself back onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        if (i > 0 and I[i-1][j] != 1) or (i < h-1 and I[i+1][j] != 1) or (j > 0 and I[i][j-1] != 1) or (j < w-1 and I[i][j+1] != 1):
          O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** This version iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Explicit Boundary Check:** For each cell containing a '1', it explicitly checks if its top, bottom, left, or right neighbor is not a '1', ensuring we are within the grid boundaries.
3. **Paint if Boundary Found:**  If a non-'1' neighbor is found, indicating a boundary cell, the cell's value in the output grid ('O') is changed to '8'.
