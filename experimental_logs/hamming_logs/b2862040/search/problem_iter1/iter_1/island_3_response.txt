## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '1' on a background of '9'. The transformation then changes the color of the cells directly surrounding each '1' object to '8', while preserving the original '1' objects.

**Example:**

**Input:**

```
9 9 9 9 
9 1 1 9
9 1 9 9
9 9 9 9
```

**Output:**

```
9 9 9 9 
9 8 8 9 
9 8 9 9
9 9 9 9
```

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  one_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  outline_indices = mfilter(one_objs, lambda obj: outbox(toindices(obj)))
  O = paint(I, recolor(8, outline_indices))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' objects:** Similar to the provided programs, this version first identifies all objects formed by the digit '1' using `objects`, `sfilter`, and `color`.
2. **Find surrounding cells:** Instead of using `delta`, this version directly finds the indices of the cells surrounding each '1' object using the `outbox` function.
3. **Recolor and paint:** Finally, it recolors the identified surrounding cells to '8' using `recolor` and paints them onto the original grid with `paint`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  outline_indices = mfilter(one_indices, lambda loc: dneighbors(loc))
  O = paint(I, recolor(8, outline_indices - one_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' indices:** This version directly identifies the indices of all '1' cells using `ofcolor`.
2. **Find surrounding indices:** It then finds the indices of directly adjacent neighbors to each '1' cell using `dneighbors` and `mfilter`.
3. **Remove overlapping indices:** To avoid recoloring '1' cells, the code removes any overlapping indices between '1' cells and surrounding cells using set difference (`-`).
4. **Recolor and paint:** Finally, it recolors the remaining surrounding cells to '8' and paints them onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 1:
        for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]:
          new_i, new_j = i + di, j + dj
          if 0 <= new_i < len(I) and 0 <= new_j < len(row) and I[new_i][new_j] == 9:
            O = paint(O, {(8, (new_i, new_j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through grid:** This version iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check for '1':** If a cell contains '1', it iterates through its four direct neighbors.
3. **Recolor surrounding '9' cells:**  For each neighbor within the grid boundaries and containing '9', it recolors the cell to '8' using `paint`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = I
  for obj in one_objs:
    O = underfill(O, 8, outbox(toindices(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' objects:** This version identifies all '1' objects.
2. **Iterate through objects and underfill:** For each '1' object, it uses `underfill` with the surrounding indices obtained using `outbox` to fill only the '9' cells around the object with '8'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  shifted_indices = mpapply(lambda loc: dneighbors(loc), *zip(*one_indices))
  outline_indices = shifted_indices - one_indices
  O = paint(I, recolor(8, outline_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' indices:** This version finds the indices of all '1' cells.
2. **Find and merge surrounding indices:** It uses `mpapply` with `dneighbors` and unpacked `one_indices` to directly find and merge the indices of surrounding cells.
3. **Remove overlapping indices:** It removes overlapping indices to avoid recoloring '1' cells.
4. **Recolor and paint:**  Finally, it recolors the remaining surrounding cells and paints them onto the grid.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformation using various DSL functions and logic, highlighting the flexibility of the DSL.
