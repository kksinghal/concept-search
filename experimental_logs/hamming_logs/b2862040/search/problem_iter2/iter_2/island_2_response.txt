## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently identifies the rightmost object formed by connected '8' digits in the input grid. It then recolors this object to '1's. 

Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:

* **Input_0:** The rightmost '8'-object is a vertical line. The program recolors it to '1's.
* **Input_1:** The rightmost '8'-object consists of two connected parts.  The program correctly identifies and recolors both parts to '1's.
* **Input_2:** The rightmost '8'-object is near the middle of the grid. The program successfully isolates and recolors it to '1's.
* **Input_3:**  The rightmost '8'-object forms a long, winding shape. Again, the program accurately identifies and recolors it. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the described transformation, along with explanations for each:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True) # Find all connected objects of '8's.
    rightmost_obj = argmax(objs, lambda obj: rightmost(toindices(obj))) # Identify the rightmost object.
    O = paint(cover(I, rightmost_obj), recolor(1, rightmost_obj)) # Recolor the rightmost object to '1's.
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`:**  This identifies all connected objects consisting only of the digit '8'. 
2. **`argmax(objs, lambda obj: rightmost(toindices(obj)))`:** This finds the object with the highest column index, effectively selecting the rightmost '8'-object.
3. **`paint(cover(I, rightmost_obj), recolor(1, rightmost_obj))`:** This first "covers" (removes) the rightmost object from the grid, replacing it with the background color.  Then, it "paints" (adds) a recolored version of the object back onto the grid, with all '8's replaced by '1's.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def is_rightmost(obj):
    return not any(rightmost(toindices(o)) > rightmost(toindices(obj)) for o in objs)
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  rightmost_obj = next(obj for obj in objs if is_rightmost(obj))
  O = paint(I, recolor(1, rightmost_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_rightmost(obj)`:**  This helper function checks if a given object is the rightmost one by comparing its rightmost column index to that of all other objects.
2. **`next(obj for obj in objs if is_rightmost(obj))`:** This iterates through the objects and finds the first (and only) one that satisfies the `is_rightmost` condition.
3. **`paint(I, recolor(1, rightmost_obj))`:** Similar to Version 1, this "paints" the recolored object directly onto the grid, overwriting any existing cells.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def rightmost_index(obj):
    return max(j for _, (i, j) in obj)
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  rightmost_obj = max(objs, key=rightmost_index) 
  O = paint(I, {(1, (i, j)) for _, (i, j) in rightmost_obj})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`rightmost_index(obj)`:**  This helper function determines the rightmost column index of a given object.
2. **`max(objs, key=rightmost_index)`:** This identifies the object with the largest rightmost column index, selecting the rightmost '8'-object.
3. **`{(1, (i, j)) for _, (i, j) in rightmost_obj}`:** This directly creates a recolored version of the rightmost object by replacing all color values with '1' while preserving the indices.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1, -1, -1): # Iterate through columns from right to left.
    for i in range(len(I)): # Iterate through rows.
      if I[i][j] == 8:
        obj = toobject(flood_fill((i, j), I), I) # Find the connected '8'-object using flood fill.
        return paint(I, recolor(1, obj)) # Recolor and return immediately.
```

**Explanation:**

1.  This version iterates through columns from right to left, and within each column, it iterates through rows from top to bottom.
2. **`flood_fill((i, j), I)`:** If an '8' is encountered, this function finds all connected cells with '8's starting from the current cell (i, j), effectively extracting the entire connected object. 
3. The program immediately "paints" the recolored object onto the grid and returns, ensuring only the rightmost object is modified.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def rightmost_cell(obj):
    return max(obj, key=lambda cell: cell[1][1])
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  rightmost_obj = argmax(objs, rightmost_cell)
  new_grid = [[v if (v, (i, j)) not in rightmost_obj else 1 for j, v in enumerate(row)] for i, row in enumerate(I)] 
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`rightmost_cell(obj)`:** This helper function identifies the cell within an object with the highest column index.
2. **`argmax(objs, rightmost_cell)`:**  This determines the object containing the rightmost cell.
3.  The code directly modifies the input grid `I` to recolor the rightmost object to '1's using nested list comprehensions.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version leverages different functions and strategies, highlighting the diverse ways to solve a problem within a programming language.
