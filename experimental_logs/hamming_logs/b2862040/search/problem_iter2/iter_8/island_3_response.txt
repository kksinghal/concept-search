## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying objects of a specific color (color 8) and modifying a portion of the grid adjacent to these objects. 

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** 
- Identify the object with color 8.
- Fill the cells immediately to the right of this object with the color 1.

**Input_1:**
- Identify all objects with color 8.
- For each object, fill the cells immediately to the right, starting from the topmost row of the object to the bottommost row, with the color 1.

**Input_2:**
- Similar to Input_1, identify objects with color 8 and fill cells immediately to their right with color 1. 
- However, the fill extends to the right edge of the grid if the object touches the right boundary.

**Input_3:**
- Similar to Input_2, identify objects with color 8 and fill cells to their right with color 1.
- The fill extends to the right edge for boundary objects.
- Additionally, any pre-existing color 1 cells are maintained.


## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               merge(
                 recolor(1, 
                         product(interval(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1, 1),
                                 interval(rightmost(obj) + 1, len(I[0]), 1)))
                 for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if color(obj) == 8))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies all objects in the grid `I` where cells of the same color are connected (T), diagonal connections are not considered (F), and background is excluded (T).
2. **`color(obj) == 8`:** Filters the objects to keep only those with color 8.
3. **`product(...)`:** For each object, generates a set of indices representing the cells to the right of the object, extending to the grid's right edge.
4. **`recolor(1, ...)`:**  Assigns the color 1 to the generated indices.
5. **`merge(...)`:** Combines the indices from all objects into a single set.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Modifies the original grid `I` by painting the cells at the specified indices with color 1.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, 1, 
              merge(
                product(interval(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1, 1),
                        interval(rightmost(obj) + 1, len(I[0]), 1)) 
                for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if color(obj) == 8))
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly uses `fill` instead of `paint` and `recolor`. This simplifies the code while achieving the same outcome.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  modified_cells = set()
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 8:
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
        for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, len(I[0])):
          modified_cells.add((i, j))
  return fill(I, 1, frozenset(modified_cells)) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through the objects and explicitly constructs the set of cells to be modified. This approach offers a more procedural and potentially easier-to-understand implementation.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modify_row(row, start_j):
    return tuple(1 if j >= start_j else v for j, v in enumerate(row))
  
  modified_grid = []
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    start_j = len(row)
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
      if color(obj) == 8 and uppermost(obj) <= i <= lowermost(obj):
        start_j = min(start_j, rightmost(obj) + 1)
    modified_grid.append(modify_row(row, start_j))
  return tuple(modified_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

This version processes the grid row by row. For each row, it determines the starting column index for filling with 1s based on the presence of objects with color 8. It then modifies the row accordingly.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_fill_obj(grid, obj):
    return fill(grid, 1, product(interval(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1, 1),
                                 interval(rightmost(obj) + 1, len(grid[0]), 1)))
  return reduce(right_fill_obj, 
                (obj for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if color(obj) == 8), 
                I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version introduces a helper function `right_fill_obj` to handle filling cells to the right of a single object. It then utilizes the `reduce` function to apply `right_fill_obj` to each object with color 8 in the grid sequentially, accumulating the changes in the grid. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches and logic flow to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL.
