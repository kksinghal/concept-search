## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently targets objects composed of the digit "8" within the input grid. For each such object, the transformation identifies its rightmost column. It then fills the cells of this column with the digit "1". 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

* The largest '8' object's rightmost column is extended downwards, filling with "1"s.

**Input_1:**

* Three '8' objects are present. Each has its rightmost column filled with "1"s.

**Input_2:**

* Two '8' objects are present. Their rightmost columns are filled with "1"s, extending slightly beyond the bottom boundary of the original object in one case.

**Input_3:**

* Two '8' objects are present. The rightmost columns are filled with "1"s, again extending slightly beyond the original object boundaries in some cases.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  def rightmost_indices(obj):
    return frozenset((i, rightmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1))

  def process_object(obj):
    return fill(I, 1, rightmost_indices(obj))

  return merge(apply(process_object, sfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **rightmost_indices(obj):** This function takes an object and returns the indices of its rightmost column.
2. **process_object(obj):**  This function takes an object and fills its rightmost column with "1"s in the input grid.
3. **main program:**
   - It first identifies all objects in the grid using `objects(I, True, False, False)`.
   - It filters for objects with color '8' using `sfilter`.
   - It applies `process_object` to each filtered object using `apply`.
   - Finally, it merges the modified objects back onto the original grid using `merge`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  def rightmost_column(obj):
    return frozenset({(i, rightmost(obj)) for i in range(height(I))})

  return fill(I, 1, merge(apply(rightmost_column, sfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **rightmost_column(obj):** Returns a set of indices representing the entire column where the object's rightmost cell is located.
2. **main program:** 
   - Identifies '8' objects.
   - For each, it finds the rightmost column indices.
   - It merges the column indices from all objects.
   - Finally, it fills all these indices with "1" on the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
  def extend_right_edge(obj):
    return frozenset((i, rightmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1))

  modified_grid = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    if color(obj) == 8:
      modified_grid = fill(modified_grid, 1, extend_right_edge(obj))
  return modified_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **extend_right_edge(obj):** Similar to previous versions, it gets the indices of the object's rightmost column.
2. **main program:**
   - It iterates through each object in the grid.
   - If the object's color is '8', it fills its rightmost column with "1"s directly on a copy of the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
  def right_edge_indices(obj):
    j = rightmost(obj)
    return frozenset((i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1))

  return fill(I, 1, mapply(right_edge_indices, sfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **right_edge_indices(obj):**  Calculates and returns the indices of the rightmost column for the given object.
2. **main program:**
   - It filters the objects to get those with color '8'.
   - It uses `mapply` to apply `right_edge_indices` to each filtered object and merges the results.
   - Finally, it fills the identified indices with "1" on the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
  return fill(I, 1, mfilter(lambda loc: any(color(obj) == 8 and rightmost(obj) == loc[1] for obj in objects(I, True, False, False)), asindices(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **main program:**
   - This version uses `asindices(I)` to generate all possible indices of the input grid. 
   - For each index, it checks if it's part of the rightmost column of any '8' colored object.
   - It uses `mfilter` with a lambda function to perform this check and keep only the relevant indices.
   - Finally, it fills all those indices with "1".


These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation goal, leveraging different DSL functions and logic flow.
