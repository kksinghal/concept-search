## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be finding the connected components (objects) of 8s in the input grid, and then changing the rightmost column of each object to 1s. 

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

- There's one object of 8s.
- The rightmost column of this object is replaced with 1s.

**Input_1:**

- There are three objects of 8s.
- The rightmost column of each object is replaced with 1s.

**Input_2:**

- There are five objects of 8s.
- The rightmost column of each object is replaced with 1s.

**Input_3:**

- There are six objects of 8s.
- The rightmost column of each object is replaced with 1s.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 8:
      rightmost_col = rightmost(obj)
      rightmost_cells = frozenset((i, rightmost_col) for i in range(height(I)))
      I = fill(I, 1, intersection(toindices(obj), rightmost_cells))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** We use `objects(I, True, False, False)` to find connected components of 8s in the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate over objects:** We loop through each object (`obj`) in the identified objects set.
3. **Check object color:** If the object's color (`color(obj)`) is 8, we proceed.
4. **Find rightmost column:** We determine the rightmost column index (`rightmost_col`) of the current object.
5. **Find cells in rightmost column:** We create a set (`rightmost_cells`) containing all cell indices in that column.
6. **Find intersection and fill:** We find the intersection of the object's indices and the `rightmost_cells` set. This gives us the indices of the cells that need to be replaced. We then use `fill` to change these cells' values to 1.
7. **Return modified grid:** Finally, we return the modified grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if index(I,(i,j))==8 and ((j==width(I)-1) or index(I,(i,j+1))!=8):
        I = fill(I,1,{(i,j)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** This version iterates through each cell in the grid using nested loops.
2. **Identify rightmost 8s:** For each cell, it checks if the cell contains an 8 and if it's the rightmost 8 in its connected component. It does this by checking if the cell is on the right edge of the grid or if its right neighbor is not an 8.
3. **Replace with 1:** If the cell meets the conditions, it's replaced with a 1 using the `fill` function.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(1, mfilter(lambda obj: color(obj) == 8, objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: toindices(obj) & hfrontier((0, width(I) - 1)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Similar to version 1, we first identify the connected components of 8s using `objects`.
2. **Filter for rightmost column:** We then use `mfilter` to filter the objects, keeping only the indices that lie on the rightmost column (`hfrontier((0, width(I) - 1))`) and belong to objects of color 8.
3. **Recolor and paint:** We use `recolor` to change the color of the filtered indices to 1 and then use `paint` to apply this change to the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(1, merge(apply(lambda obj: sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda ind: ind[1] == rightmost(obj)), objects(I, True, False, False)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects and find rightmost cells:** This version identifies objects and, for each object, filters for its rightmost cells using `sfilter` and `rightmost`.
2. **Merge and recolor:** It then merges all rightmost cells from all objects into a single set and uses `recolor` to change their values to 1.
3. **Paint:** Finally, it uses `paint` to apply the changes to the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    if color(obj) == 8:
      I = paint(I, recolor(1, frozenset((i, rightmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1))))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects and check color:** This version iterates through each object and checks if its color is 8.
2. **Find rightmost column and recolor:** For each object of color 8, it identifies its rightmost column using `rightmost` and then uses `recolor` to create a new object with the rightmost column's cells colored as 1.
3. **Paint:** It then paints this new object onto the input grid.

These five programs provide diverse solutions to achieve the desired transformation, using various combinations of DSL functions and logic. Remember to test them thoroughly with different inputs to ensure their correctness.
