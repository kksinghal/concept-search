## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves identifying the rightmost object (a group of connected, non-background digits) and then shifting a copy of its indices one step upwards and leftwards. Finally, the grid is modified by replacing the values at these new shifted indices with the digit '1'.

**Let's break down the transformation for each example:**

* **Input_0:** The rightmost object consists of the digit '8' forming an L-shape. The transformation shifts this L-shape one step up and left, then fills the corresponding cells with '1'.

* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the rightmost object (a curved shape of '8's) is identified. The same shift and fill logic is applied, resulting in a '1' shape one step up and left of the original object.

* **Input_2:** Again, the rightmost object (a scattered group of '8's) is found.  The upward and leftward shift is applied, and the shifted positions are filled with '1'.

* **Input_3:**  The rightmost object here consists of the digits '1' at the bottom right corner. The transformation identifies this object and, following the established pattern, shifts it up and left, filling the resulting cells with '1'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  def rightmost_cell(obj):
    return max(obj, key=lambda cell: cell[1][1])
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  rightmost_obj = argmax(objs, rightmost_cell)
  shifted_indices = shift(toindices(rightmost_obj), (-1, -1))
  return fill(I, 1, shifted_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify the rightmost object:**  Similar to the provided programs, we define `rightmost_cell` and use `objects`, `argmax` to find the rightmost object.
2.  **Shift the indices:** `shift` is used to move the indices of the rightmost object one step up (-1 in the first dimension) and one step left (-1 in the second dimension).
3. **Fill with '1':** Finally, `fill` is used to modify the original grid by replacing the values at the `shifted_indices` with '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  def rightmost_corner(patch):
    return lrcorner(patch)
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  rightmost_obj = argmax(objs, rightmost_corner)
  shifted_obj = shift(rightmost_obj, (-1, -1))
  return paint(I, recolor(1, shifted_obj))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the rightmost object:** This version identifies the rightmost object by finding the object with the largest lower-right corner index (`lrcorner`).
2. **Shift and recolor:**  The entire object is shifted up and left using `shift`. Then, `recolor` changes the color of the shifted object to '1'.
3. **Paint to the grid:** Finally, `paint` is used to draw the recolored, shifted object onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  def rightmost_obj_indices(grid):
    objs = objects(grid, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
    return toindices(argmax(objs, lambda obj: rightmost(obj)))
  return fill(I, 1, shift(rightmost_obj_indices(I), (-1, -1)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract rightmost object indices:**  This version defines a helper function `rightmost_obj_indices` to directly extract the indices of the rightmost object within the grid.
2. **Shift and Fill:** Similar to previous versions, it shifts these indices up and left, then uses `fill` to modify the grid by placing '1' at the shifted locations.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  def shifted_rightmost(grid):
    return shift(toindices(argmax(objects(grid, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), lambda obj: rightmost(obj))), (-1, -1))
  return cellwise(I, fill(I, 1, shifted_rightmost(I)), I) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shifted rightmost indices:** This version defines a helper function `shifted_rightmost` to calculate the shifted indices of the rightmost object directly. 
2. **Cellwise modification:** It then utilizes `cellwise` to compare the original grid with a grid where the `shifted_rightmost` indices are filled with '1'. If the values match, the original value is kept; otherwise, '1' is used.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  def modify_rightmost(grid):
    objs = objects(grid, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
    rightmost_obj = argmax(objs, lambda obj: rightmost(obj))
    return paint(cover(grid, rightmost_obj), recolor(1, shift(rightmost_obj, (-1, -1))))
  return modify_rightmost(I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Modify rightmost object:** This version defines a function `modify_rightmost` to encapsulate the logic of modifying the grid with respect to the rightmost object.
2. **Paint and Recolor:** It first covers the original rightmost object using `cover`. Then, it paints a shifted and recolored (to '1') version of the object back onto the grid.

These five versions showcase distinct approaches and combinations of DSL functions while achieving the same desired transformation for the given input-output examples.
