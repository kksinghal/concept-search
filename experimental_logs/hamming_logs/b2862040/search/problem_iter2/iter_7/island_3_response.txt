## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '8' on the input grid. Then, for each of these objects, a vertical line of '1's is drawn to the right of the object, starting from the row of the object's uppermost cell and extending downwards until the row of the object's lowermost cell. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** A single '8'-object exists. A vertical '1'-line is drawn to its right, covering the rightmost column.

**Input_1:** Two '8'-objects exist.  Vertical '1'-lines are drawn to the right of each, resulting in one line in the 9th column and another spanning the 10th and 11th columns.

**Input_2:** Four '8'-objects exist.  Vertical '1'-lines are drawn to the right of each, creating '1'-lines in the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th columns.

**Input_3:** Two '8'-objects exist. Vertical '1'-lines are drawn to the right of each, forming one line in the 12th column and another spanning the 13th and 14th columns.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL functions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(
    recolor(1, 
            product(interval(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1, 1), 
                    interval(rightmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + 2, 1)))
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if color(obj) == 8))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, T, F, T)`: Identifies all '8'-objects in the input grid `I`.
2. For each object `obj` in the identified objects:
    - `uppermost(obj)` and `lowermost(obj)`: Get the row indices of the top and bottom edges of the object.
    - `rightmost(obj) + 1`: Get the column index immediately to the right of the object.
    - `interval(...)`: Creates a range of row indices and a range containing only the column index to the right of the object.
    - `product(...)`: Generates all index pairs (row, column) within the specified ranges, representing the vertical line to be drawn.
    - `recolor(1, ...)`: Creates a new object with value '1' at the generated indices.
3. `merge(...)`: Combines all the '1'-objects (lines) into a single object.
4. `paint(I, ...)`:  Draws the combined '1'-object onto the input grid `I`, creating the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 8:
      I = paint(I, recolor(1, 
                            product(interval(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1, 1),
                                    {rightmost(obj) + 1})))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, T, F, T)`: Identifies all '8'-objects in the input grid `I`.
2. For each object `obj` in the identified objects:
    - If the `color(obj)` is 8:
       -  Get the `uppermost` and `lowermost` row indices of the object.
       -  Get the column index `rightmost(obj) + 1` to the right of the object.
       -  Use `interval` and `product` to generate indices for the vertical line.
       -  Use `recolor` to create a '1'-object representing the line.
       -  Use `paint` to draw the line onto the grid `I`.
3.  Return the modified grid `I`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  lines = set()
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 8:
      lines |= connect((uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1), 
                        (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1))
  return paint(I, recolor(1, frozenset(lines)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, T, F, T)`: Identifies all '8'-objects in the input grid `I`.
2.  Initialize an empty set `lines` to store the indices of the vertical lines.
3. For each object `obj` in the identified objects:
    -  If the `color(obj)` is 8:
       -  Get the `uppermost` and `lowermost` row indices and the column index `rightmost(obj) + 1`.
       -  Use `connect` to generate the indices for a vertical line connecting the top and bottom points to the right of the object.
       -  Add the indices of the line to the `lines` set. 
4. Use `recolor` to create a '1'-object from the `lines` set.
5.  Use `paint` to draw the combined '1'-object onto the grid `I`, creating the output grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 8:
        k = j + 1
        while k < len(I[0]) and (i, k) not in toindices(merge(objects(I, T, F, T))):
          I = paint(I, {(1, (i, k))})
          k += 1
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterate through each cell in the grid `I` using nested loops.
2. If a cell's value is '8':
   - Get the cell's row `i` and column `j`.
   - Initialize a counter `k` to the column next to the current cell (`j + 1`).
   - Enter a `while` loop that continues as long as `k` is within the grid's bounds and the cell at (i, k) is not part of any object. 
     - Inside the loop, paint the cell at (i, k) with a '1' and increment `k`. 
3. Return the modified grid `I`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               recolor(1, 
                       merge(shoot((i, rightmost(obj) + 1), DOWN)
                             for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if color(obj) == 8 
                             for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, T, F, T)`: Identifies all '8'-objects in the input grid `I`.
2. For each '8'-object `obj` in the identified objects:
   - `rightmost(obj) + 1`: Get the column index to the right of the object.
   - Iterate through each row `i` from the `uppermost(obj)` to the `lowermost(obj)` of the object.
   - For each row `i`, use `shoot((i, rightmost(obj) + 1), DOWN)` to generate a vertical line downwards from the cell to the right of the object.
   - `merge(...)`: Combine all generated lines into a single set of indices. 
   - `recolor(1, ...)`: Create a '1'-object from the combined indices.
3. `paint(I, ...)`: Draw the '1'-object onto the input grid `I`, creating the output grid.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, using various DSL functions and logic. Each version should successfully generate the correct output grids for the given inputs.
