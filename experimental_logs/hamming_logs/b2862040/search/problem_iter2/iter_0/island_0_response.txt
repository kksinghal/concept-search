## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the largest object composed of the least frequent digit (excluding 0) in the input grid and replacing all occurrences of the most frequent digit (excluding the background color) with the chosen least frequent digit. 

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**
* Most frequent digit (excluding background 9): 8
* Least frequent digit (excluding 0): 1
* Largest object of digit 1: Doesn't exist
* Transformation: All occurrences of 8 are replaced with 1.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**
* Most frequent digit (excluding background 9): 8
* Least frequent digit (excluding 0): 1
* Largest object of digit 1: Exists (bottom left corner)
* Transformation: All occurrences of 8 are replaced with 1.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**
* Most frequent digit (excluding background 9): 8
* Least frequent digit (excluding 0): 1
* Largest object of digit 1: Exists (top right corner)
* Transformation: All occurrences of 8 are replaced with 1.

**Input_3 - Output_3:**
* Most frequent digit (excluding background 9): 8
* Least frequent digit (excluding 0): 1
* Largest object of digit 1: Exists (bottom right corner)
* Transformation: All occurrences of 8 are replaced with 1.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = palette(I)  
  x2 = remove(ZERO, x1) 
  x3 = leastcommon(x2)
  x4 = mostcolor(I) 
  O = replace(I, x4, x3)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **x1 = palette(I):** Extracts all unique digit values from the input grid `I`.
2. **x2 = remove(ZERO, x1):** Removes the digit '0' from the set of unique digits.
3. **x3 = leastcommon(x2):**  Finds the least common digit among the remaining digits.
4. **x4 = mostcolor(I):** Identifies the most frequent digit in the input grid.
5. **O = replace(I, x4, x3):** Creates a new grid `O` by replacing all instances of the most frequent digit (`x4`) with the least common digit (`x3`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = palette(I) 
  x2 = difference(x1, {ZERO, mostcolor(I)}) 
  x3 = leastcommon(x2)
  O = replace(I, mostcolor(I), x3) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **x1 = palette(I):** Extracts unique digit values from the input grid.
2. **x2 = difference(x1, {ZERO, mostcolor(I)}):**  Removes both '0' and the most common digit from the set of unique digits.
3. **x3 = leastcommon(x2):**  Identifies the least common digit in the remaining set.
4. **O = replace(I, mostcolor(I), x3):** Creates a new grid `O` by substituting all occurrences of the most frequent digit with the identified least common digit (`x3`).

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  f = lambda x: x != ZERO and x != mostcolor(I)
  x1 = sfilter(palette(I), f)
  x2 = leastcommon(x1)
  O = replace(I, mostcolor(I), x2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **f = lambda x: x != ZERO and x != mostcolor(I):** Defines a function `f` to check if a digit is neither '0' nor the most frequent one.
2. **x1 = sfilter(palette(I), f):**  Filters the set of unique digits, keeping only those that satisfy the condition defined in `f`.
3. **x2 = leastcommon(x1):**  Finds the least common digit in the filtered set.
4. **O = replace(I, mostcolor(I), x2):** Creates the output grid `O` by replacing instances of the most common digit with the found least common digit (`x2`).

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  p = palette(I)
  mc = mostcolor(I)
  lc =  leastcommon(tuple(v for v in p if v != ZERO and v != mc)) 
  O = tuple(tuple(lc if v == mc else v for v in row) for row in I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **p = palette(I):**  Gets the set of unique digits from the input grid.
2. **mc = mostcolor(I):**  Gets the most frequent digit in the input grid.
3. **lc = leastcommon(tuple(v for v in p if v != ZERO and v != mc)):**  Finds the least common digit among those that are not '0' and not the most frequent.
4. **O = tuple(tuple(lc if v == mc else v for v in row) for row in I):** Constructs the output grid `O` by iterating over each cell in the input grid `I`, replacing the most common digit (`mc`) with the least common digit (`lc`), and keeping other digits unchanged.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  common_colors = {ZERO, mostcolor(I)}
  least_common = lambda x: leastcommon(tuple(v for v in palette(x) if v not in common_colors)) 
  O = replace(I, mostcolor(I), least_common(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **common_colors = {ZERO, mostcolor(I)}:** Creates a set `common_colors` containing '0' and the most frequent digit.
2. **least_common = lambda x: leastcommon(tuple(v for v in palette(x) if v not in common_colors)):** Defines a function `least_common` that, given a grid, finds the least common digit excluding digits present in `common_colors`.
3. **O = replace(I, mostcolor(I), least_common(I)):** Constructs the output grid `O` by replacing all instances of the most frequent digit in the input grid with the result of applying `least_common` to the input grid.

These versions utilize different combinations of DSL functions, showcasing distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation. Each version provides a unique solution path while maintaining clarity and conciseness.
