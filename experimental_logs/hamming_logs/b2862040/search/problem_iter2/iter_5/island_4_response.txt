## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the rightmost cells of all objects with the color '8' and then extending those cells downwards to create a trailing line of '1's. This line stops either at the bottom of the grid or when it encounters a non-object cell.

**Input-Output Pair Examples:**

* **Input_0:** The rightmost '8's in each object have a trailing line of '1's extending downwards.
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the '1's form trailing lines from the rightmost '8's of each object.
* **Input_2 & Input_3:**  These examples demonstrate the trailing line stopping at the grid's edge or when hitting a non-object cell.


## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def trailing_cells(obj):
    return frozenset((i + k, rightmost(obj)) 
                    for i, j in toindices(obj) if j == rightmost(obj)
                    for k in range(1, height(I) - i))
  
  return fill(I, 1, 
              merge(apply(trailing_cells,
                          sfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 
                                  lambda obj: color(obj) == 8))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`trailing_cells(obj)`:** This function takes an object and returns a set of indices that form a trailing line downwards from each rightmost cell of the object.
2. **`sfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)`:** This filters the objects in the input grid (`I`) to only include those with color '8'.
3. **`apply(trailing_cells, ...)`:** This applies the `trailing_cells` function to each object with color '8'.
4. **`merge(...)`:** This combines the sets of trailing cell indices from all objects into a single set.
5. **`fill(I, 1, ...)`:** This fills the input grid with '1' at the indices identified as trailing cells.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_down(i, j, grid):
    k = i + 1
    while k < height(grid) and index(grid, (k, j)) == mostcolor(grid):
      grid = fill(grid, 1, {(k, j)})
      k += 1
    return grid

  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    if color(obj) == 8:
      for i, j in toindices(obj):
        if j == rightmost(obj):
          I = extend_down(i, j, I)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_down(i, j, grid)`:** This function takes a starting cell (i, j) and the grid. It extends a line of '1's downwards from the starting cell until it hits the bottom of the grid or a non-object cell.
2. The program iterates through each object in the grid. If the object's color is '8', it iterates through each cell of that object.
3. If a cell is a rightmost cell of the object, it calls `extend_down` to draw a trailing line downwards.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def trailing_line(obj):
    return frozenset(shoot((i, rightmost(obj)), DOWN) & backdrop(obj)
                    for i, j in toindices(obj) if j == rightmost(obj))

  return fill(I, 1,
              merge(apply(trailing_line,
                          sfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 
                                  lambda obj: color(obj) == 8))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`trailing_line(obj)`:** This function takes an object and returns a set of indices representing the trailing line. It achieves this by:
    * Finding the rightmost cells of the object.
    * For each rightmost cell, it creates a downwards line (`shoot`) starting from the cell.
    * It then intersects this line with the object's bounding box (`backdrop`) to ensure the line stays within the object's area.
2. The rest of the program is similar to Version 1, filtering for objects with color '8', applying the `trailing_line` function, merging the results, and finally filling the grid with '1's at the specified indices.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_edge(obj):
    return frozenset((i, rightmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1))

  edges = mfilter(right_edge, sfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8))
  return fill(I, 1,
              merge(apply(lambda loc: connect(loc, (height(I)-1, loc[1])) & backdrop(toobject(edges, I)), edges)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`right_edge(obj)`:** This function identifies all the cells on the right edge of an object.
2. The program identifies all the right edge cells of objects with color '8' and stores them in the `edges` variable.
3. For each cell in `edges`, it draws a line downwards (`connect`) to the bottom of the grid and intersects it with the bounding box of all the edges to get the trailing lines. 
4. Finally, it fills the grid with '1' at the indices of these trailing lines.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    if color(obj) == 8:
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
        j = rightmost(obj)
        k = i
        while k < height(I) and index(I, (k, j)) == mostcolor(I):
          I = fill(I, 1, {(k, j)})
          k += 1
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version iterates through every object in the grid and checks if its color is '8'.
2. For each object with color '8', it iterates through its potential right edge cells by going through each row occupied by the object.
3. For every potential right edge cell, it extends a line of '1's downwards as long as it encounters the background color, effectively creating the trailing lines. 

These five versions provide different approaches to achieve the same goal, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. Each version leverages different combinations of DSL functions and logic to achieve the desired transformation.
