## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves finding the rightmost occurrence of the digit '8' in the input grid and replacing it, along with its horizontally connected '8' neighbors, with the digit '1'. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**
- The rightmost '8' is at (4,7). 
- The horizontally connected '8's are at (4,6), (4,5), and (4,4).
- All these digits are replaced by '1'.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**
- The rightmost '8' is at (10,8).
- It has no horizontally connected '8' neighbors.
- Only the digit at (10,8) is replaced by '1'.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**
- The rightmost '8' is at (11,6).
- The horizontally connected '8's are at (11,5) and (11,4).
- All these digits are replaced by '1'.

**Input_3 - Output_3:**
- The rightmost '8' is at (13,13).
- It has no horizontally connected '8' neighbors.
- Only the digit at (13,13) is replaced by '1'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def rightmost_8_indices(grid):
    for j in range(len(grid[0])-1, -1, -1):
      for i in range(len(grid)):
        if grid[i][j] == 8:
          return frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j, -1, -1) if grid[i][k] == 8)
    return frozenset()
  indices = rightmost_8_indices(I)
  return paint(I, recolor(1, toobject(indices, I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`rightmost_8_indices(grid)` Function:** 
   - Iterates through the grid columns from right to left, then rows.
   - Finds the rightmost '8' and collects indices of all horizontally connected '8's to the left.
   - Returns a frozenset of these indices.
2. **Main Program:**
   - Calls `rightmost_8_indices(I)` to get the indices of the target '8's.
   - Uses `toobject` to convert the indices to an object within the grid context.
   - Uses `recolor` to change the color of the object to '1'.
   - Uses `paint` to apply this change to the input grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def rightmost_8_loc(grid):
    for j in range(len(grid[0])-1, -1, -1):
      for i in range(len(grid)):
        if grid[i][j] == 8:
          return (i, j)
    return None
  loc = rightmost_8_loc(I)
  if loc:
    i, j = loc
    return paint(I, recolor(1, toobject(frozenset({(i, k) for k in range(j, -1, -1) if I[i][k] == 8}), I)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`rightmost_8_loc(grid)` Function:** 
   - Iterates through the grid columns from right to left, then rows.
   - Finds the rightmost '8' and returns its location (row, column) as a tuple.
2. **Main Program:**
   - Calls `rightmost_8_loc(I)` to get the location of the rightmost '8'.
   - If an '8' is found:
     - Collects indices of all horizontally connected '8's to the left of the located '8'.
     - Uses `toobject` to convert the indices to an object within the grid context.
     - Uses `recolor` to change the color of the object to '1'.
     - Uses `paint` to apply this change to the input grid.
   - If no '8' is found, returns the original grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def rightmost_8_object(grid):
    for j in range(len(grid[0])-1, -1, -1):
      for i in range(len(grid)):
        if grid[i][j] == 8:
          return frozenset({(8, (i, k)) for k in range(j, -1, -1) if grid[i][k] == 8})
    return frozenset()
  obj = rightmost_8_object(I)
  return paint(I, recolor(1, obj))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`rightmost_8_object(grid)` Function:** 
   - Iterates through the grid columns from right to left, then rows.
   - Finds the rightmost '8' and directly constructs a frozenset representing the object containing it and its connected '8' neighbors.
   - Returns the object.
2. **Main Program:**
   - Calls `rightmost_8_object(I)` to directly get the object containing the target '8's.
   - Uses `recolor` to change the color of the object to '1'.
   - Uses `paint` to apply this change to the input grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1, -1, -1):
    for i in range(len(I)):
      if I[i][j] == 8:
        start = (i, j)
        end = (i, next((k for k in range(j, -1, -1) if I[i][k] != 8), 0))
        indices = connect(start, end) - {end}
        return paint(I, recolor(1, toobject(indices, I)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Main Program:**
   - Iterates through the grid columns from right to left, then rows.
   - Finds the rightmost '8' and stores its location as 'start'.
   - Finds the index of the first non-'8' to the left and stores it as 'end'.
   - Uses `connect` to generate indices of the line between 'start' and 'end'.
   - Removes the 'end' index from the set to avoid coloring non-'8's.
   - Uses `toobject` to convert the indices to an object within the grid context.
   - Uses `recolor` to change the color of the object to '1'.
   - Uses `paint` to apply this change to the input grid.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def replace_rightmost_8(grid):
    for j in range(len(grid[0])-1, -1, -1):
      for i in range(len(grid)):
        if grid[i][j] == 8:
          k = j
          while k >= 0 and grid[i][k] == 8:
            grid = paint(grid, recolor(1, toobject(frozenset({(i, k)}), grid)))
            k -= 1
          return grid
    return grid
  return replace_rightmost_8(I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`replace_rightmost_8(grid)` Function:**
   - Iterates through the grid columns from right to left, then rows.
   - Upon finding an '8':
     - It enters a loop to traverse leftward as long as it encounters '8's.
     - For each encountered '8', it recolors it to '1' using `recolor`, `toobject`, and `paint`.
   - Returns the modified grid.
2. **Main Program:**
   - Calls `replace_rightmost_8(I)` to directly modify the input grid.
