## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of color `8` in the input grid and extending them to the right by filling the cells with the color `1`. The extension stops at the right edge of the grid.

**Input 0:**
- The top two rows have no objects of color `8`.
- The remaining rows have objects of color `8` extending from the left. These objects are extended rightward, filling the space until the edge with `1`s.

**Input 1 & 2:**
- The transformation logic is consistent with Input 0, demonstrating robustness across different object sizes and positions.

**Input 3:**
- This input showcases the transformation's handling of multiple objects in a single row. Each object is individually extended rightward.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions for the "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(
      recolor(1, 
              product(interval(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1, 1), 
                      interval(rightmost(obj) + 1, len(I[0]), 1)))
      for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if color(obj) == 8))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies all connected objects in the grid `I` (treating it as univalued, non-diagonal, and without background).
2. **`if color(obj) == 8`:** Filters for objects with color `8`.
3. **`product(...)`:** For each object, creates a set of indices representing a rectangular area starting from the object's right edge and extending to the right edge of the grid.
4. **`recolor(1, ...)`:** Colors all indices within the generated rectangle with the color `1`.
5. **`merge(...)`:** Combines the recolored areas of all objects into a single set of indices.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Applies the color changes from the merged indices to the original grid `I`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        if color(obj) == 8:
            I = fill(I, 1,
                      product(interval(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1, 1),
                              interval(rightmost(obj) + 1, len(I[0]), 1)))
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates through each object and modifies the grid `I` directly using `fill`.
- The logic within the loop remains the same as in Version 1, but instead of creating a separate set of indices and merging them, this version directly modifies the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, 
                 merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(1, 
                                               product(interval(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1, 1),
                                                       interval(rightmost(obj) + 1, len(I[0]), 1))),
                            sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: color(o) == 8))))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version utilizes the `apply` function to apply a lambda function to each filtered object.
- The lambda function generates the rectangle indices and recolors them to `1`.
- The `merge` function then combines the results, and `paint` applies the changes to the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    extension = lambda obj: frozenset((1, (i, j)) 
                                     for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) 
                                     for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, w))
    return paint(I, merge(apply(extension, sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: color(o) == 8))))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version defines a separate `extension` function that takes an object and returns the set of indices for its rightward extension.
- The core logic remains similar, but using a separate function improves code readability.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def extend_object(obj):
        return recolor(1, product(
            interval(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1, 1),
            interval(rightmost(obj) + 1, len(I[0]), 1)))
    return paint(I, merge(apply(extend_object,
                             sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: color(o) == 8))))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version defines an inner function `extend_object` to encapsulate the logic of extending an object to the right. 
- The `apply` function is used to apply `extend_object` to each filtered object.
- The result is then merged and painted onto the original grid.

These five versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL. They showcase various programming styles, function compositions, and code structuring techniques while maintaining the core logic of identifying and extending objects of color `8`.
