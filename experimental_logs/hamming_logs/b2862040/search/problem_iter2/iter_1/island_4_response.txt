## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify diagonal lines of '8's within the input grid and replace the trailing '8' of each line with a '1', effectively marking the end of these diagonals. The replacement process considers diagonals that extend both down and to the right. 

Let's illustrate this with an example from Input_0:

```
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
9 8 8 8 9 9 9 8 9 9 9  <-- Diagonal line of '8's
9 8 9 8 9 9 9 8 9 9 9
9 8 9 8 9 9 8 8 8 8 9
9 8 8 8 9 9 9 8 9 9 9
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 8 9 9 9
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
```

The output replaces the last '8' of the diagonal with a '1':

```
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
9 8 8 8 9 9 9 1 9 9 9 
9 8 9 8 9 9 9 1 9 9 9
9 8 9 8 9 9 1 1 1 1 9 
9 8 8 8 9 9 9 1 9 9 9
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 1 9 9 9
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
```


## Program Versions:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I 
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) == 8 and (j == width(I) - 1 or index(I, (i + 1, j + 1)) != 8):
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Start with the output grid `O` being the same as the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Through Cells:**  Iterate through each cell of the input grid `I` using nested loops with indices `i` and `j`.
3. **Identify Diagonal End:**  For each cell containing an '8', check if it's the last element in the row (`j == width(I) - 1`) or if the diagonally adjacent element to its right is not an '8' (`index(I, (i + 1, j + 1)) != 8`). If either condition is true, it marks the end of a diagonal line of '8's.
4. **Replace with '1':** If the cell is the end of a diagonal, replace the cell in the output grid `O` with a '1' using the `fill` function.
5. **Return Output:** Return the modified output grid `O`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I) - 1):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
      if index(I, (i, j)) == 8 and index(I, (i + 1, j + 1)) != 8:
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is very similar to Version 1, but optimizes the loop bounds. Since we're checking the diagonally adjacent element to the right, we only need to iterate up to the second-to-last row and column. This avoids unnecessary checks and improves efficiency. 


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda ij: index(I, ij) == 8 and (ij[1] == width(I) - 1 or index(I, (ij[0] + 1, ij[1] + 1)) != 8))
  return fill(I, 1, indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Diagonal Ends:**  Use `mfilter` to directly find all indices of '8's that are at the end of a diagonal. This elegantly combines filtering and merging into a single step.
2. **Replace with '1':** Fill the output grid `O` with '1's at the identified indices using the `fill` function.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    if color(obj) == 8:
      i, j = uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj)
      O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Use the `objects` function to find all connected components ('objects') of the same color in the grid.
2. **Iterate Through Objects:**  Iterate through each object `obj`.
3. **Find Rightmost '8':** If the object's color is '8', find the coordinates `(i, j)` of its rightmost cell. This represents the end of the diagonal.
4. **Replace with '1':** Fill the output grid `O` with '1' at the identified coordinates `(i, j)` using the `fill` function.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I) - 1, -1, -1):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1, -1, -1):
      if index(I, (i, j)) == 8 and (j == 0 or index(I, (i + 1, j - 1)) != 8):
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
        break 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through the grid in reverse order, from the bottom right corner to the top left. This allows us to efficiently find the diagonal ends by checking the cell to the left and down. The `break` statement after each replacement optimizes the process, as we don't need to check further in the current row after finding and replacing the diagonal end.
