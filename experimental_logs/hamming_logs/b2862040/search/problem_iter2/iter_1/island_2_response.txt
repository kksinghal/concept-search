## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying the rightmost object composed of the digit '8' within the input grid. This object is then replaced with a new object where all its '8' digits are changed to '1's.

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0:** The rightmost '8'-object is a single cell at the end of the fifth row. This '8' is replaced by a '1'.
* **Input_1:** The rightmost '8'-object spans the eighth and tenth rows, containing a total of seven '8's. All these '8's are replaced by '1's.
* **Input_2:**  The rightmost '8'-object is on the tenth and twelfth rows and gets replaced with '1's.
* **Input_3:** Similar to previous examples, the rightmost '8'-object (located in the second and fourth rows) is replaced with '1's. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, each utilizing different DSL functions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  rightmost_obj = argmax(objs, lambda obj: rightmost(toindices(obj))) 
  O = paint(
      cover(I, rightmost_obj), 
      recolor(1, rightmost_obj) if color(rightmost_obj) == 8 else rightmost_obj
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies distinct objects within the grid.
2. **Find rightmost object with '8':**  `argmax(objs, lambda obj: rightmost(toindices(obj)))` finds the object with the highest column index ('rightmost') among those containing the digit '8'.
3. **Replace '8' with '1':** The `paint` and `cover` functions are used to replace the rightmost '8'-object with a recolored version where '8's are replaced with '1's.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_column(col):
    for i, v in enumerate(col):
      if v == 8:
        return [(1 if j == i else k) for j, k in enumerate(col)]
    return col
  O = dmirror(tuple(process_column(c) for c in dmirror(I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transpose the grid:** `dmirror(I)` transposes the grid so columns become rows for easier processing.
2. **Process each column:** `process_column` iterates through each transposed row (original column) and replaces the first occurrence of '8' with '1'.
3. **Transpose back:** `dmirror` is used again to revert to the original grid orientation.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def rightmost_8_index(grid):
    for j in range(len(grid[0])-1, -1, -1):
      for i in range(len(grid)):
        if grid[i][j] == 8:
          return (i, j)
    return None
  rm_index = rightmost_8_index(I)
  O = I if rm_index is None else paint(cover(I, toobject(frozenset({rm_index}), I)), recolor(1, toobject(frozenset({rm_index}), I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the rightmost '8':** `rightmost_8_index` iterates through the grid from right to left, top to bottom, returning the index of the first encountered '8'.
2. **Conditional replacement:** If an '8' is found, the program replaces it with a '1' using `paint` and `cover`. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def replace_8(grid, j):
    new_grid = [list(row) for row in grid] 
    for i, v in enumerate(grid):
      if grid[i][j] == 8:
        new_grid[i][j] = 1
        return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
    return grid
  for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1, -1, -1):
    I = replace_8(I, j)
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns:** The program iterates through each column of the grid from right to left.
2. **Replace '8' in the column:**  `replace_8` replaces the first '8' encountered in the current column with a '1'.

**Program Version 5:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  rightmost_obj = max(objs, key=lambda obj: max(j for _, (i, j) in obj)) 
  if color(rightmost_obj) == 8:
    new_obj = {(1, (i, j)) for _, (i, j) in rightmost_obj}
    O = paint(cover(I, rightmost_obj), new_obj) 
  else:
    O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get objects:** `objects` is used to extract individual objects from the grid.
2. **Find rightmost object with '8':** `max` is used with a custom key to find the object with the largest column index ('rightmost') containing the digit '8'.
3. **Replace '8' with '1':** If the rightmost object has the color '8', a new object (`new_obj`) is created with '1's at the same indices, then painted onto the grid after covering the original '8'-object. 


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
