## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation being applied to the input grid can be described as follows:

**For each input grid:**
1. **Identify the rightmost object** composed of the digit '8'.
2. **Replace** all occurrences of the digit '8' within that object with the digit '1'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def rightmost_8_loc(grid):
    for j in range(len(grid[0])-1, -1, -1):
      for i in range(len(grid)):
        if grid[i][j] == 8:
          return (i, j)
    return None
  loc = rightmost_8_loc(I)
  if loc:
    return paint(I, recolor(1, toobject(mfilter(prapply(lambda a, b: both(equality(b, 8), adjacent(a, loc)), asindices(I), (v for r in I for v in r)), lambda x: x), I)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`rightmost_8_loc(grid)` Function:** 
   - Iterates through the grid columns from right to left, then through each row.
   - Returns the (row, column) location of the first encountered '8'.
   - If no '8' is found, it returns `None`.
2. **Main Program Logic:**
   - Calls `rightmost_8_loc` to find the location (`loc`) of the rightmost '8'.
   - If `loc` is not `None` (meaning an '8' was found):
      - Uses `prapply` to create a set of all indices adjacent to `loc` and containing '8'.
      - Converts the indices to an object using `toobject`.
      - Recolors the object from '8' to '1' using `recolor`.
      - Paints the recoloured object onto the original grid using `paint`.
   - Returns the modified grid, or the original if no '8' was found.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1, -1, -1):
    for i in range(len(I)):
      if I[i][j] == 8:
        return paint(I, recolor(1, toobject(mfilter(prapply(lambda a, b: both(equality(b, 8), manhattan(astuple(i, j), a) <= 2), asindices(I), (v for r in I for v in r)), lambda x: x), I)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterating through the Grid:** The code uses nested loops to iterate through each cell in the input grid `I`, starting from the rightmost column and moving towards the left.
2. **Finding the Rightmost '8':** Inside the loops, the code checks if the current cell contains the value '8'.
3. **Recoloring the Object:** If the current cell contains an '8', the code identifies the object containing that '8' and recolors it to '1'. 
    - `prapply` is used here to iterate over all indices and values of the grid, filtering for those that are both equal to '8' and within a Manhattan distance of 2 from the current cell (ensuring we are recoloring the connected object).
    - `mfilter` filters the resulting pairs to keep only the indices.
    - `toobject` converts these indices into an object.
    - `recolor` then recolors this object to '1'.
4. **Painting the Object:** Finally, the `paint` function paints the recoloured object back onto the original grid.
5. **Returning the Result:** The function then returns the modified grid. If no '8' is found, the original grid is returned.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  rightmost_obj = argmax(objs, lambda obj: rightmost(obj))
  return paint(I, recolor(1, rightmost_obj)) if rightmost_obj else I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, False)`:** This identifies all connected objects in the grid `I`, where objects are formed by directly adjacent cells (not diagonally) with the same value.
2. **`argmax(objs, lambda obj: rightmost(obj))`:** This finds the object among `objs` with the highest rightmost column index.  Essentially, it identifies the rightmost object.
3. **Conditional Painting:**
   -  If a `rightmost_obj` is found, it recolors it to '1' using `recolor` and paints it back onto the grid using `paint`. 
   -  If no such object exists, it simply returns the original grid `I`.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def rightmost_obj(grid):
    for j in range(len(grid[0]) - 1, -1, -1):
      for i in range(len(grid)):
        if grid[i][j] == 8:
          return toobject(mfilter(prapply(lambda a, b: both(equality(b, 8), adjacent(a, (i,j))), asindices(I), (v for r in I for v in r)), lambda x: x), grid)
    return None
  obj = rightmost_obj(I)
  if obj:
    return paint(I, recolor(1, obj))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`rightmost_obj(grid)` Function:**
    - Iterates through the grid from right to left, then row by row.
    - Upon finding an '8', it constructs the object containing that '8' using `toobject`, `mfilter`, `prapply`, and `adjacent` to find connected '8' cells.
    - Returns the found object or `None` if no '8' is present.
2. **Main Logic:**
    - Finds the rightmost '8' object using `rightmost_obj(I)`.
    - If an object is found, it recolors it to '1' using `recolor` and paints it back onto the grid with `paint`.
    - Returns the modified grid or the original if no '8' object exists.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for x, row in enumerate(I):
    for y, v in enumerate(row[::-1]):
      if v == 8:
        return paint(I, recolor(1, toobject(
          mfilter(
            prapply(
              lambda a, b: both(equality(b, 8), any(c in neighbors(a) for c in neighbors((x,len(row)-y-1)))),
              asindices(I),
              (I[k][l] for k in range(len(I)) for l in range(len(I[0])))
            ),
            lambda x: x
          ),
          I
        )))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iteration:** This code iterates through each row of the grid (`I`) and then each element (`v`) in the reversed row (`row[::-1]`). This allows it to efficiently locate the rightmost '8'.
2. **Identifying the Rightmost '8' Object:** Once an '8' is found, the code utilizes several functions to isolate the object containing that '8':
   - `prapply`: This applies a function to each cell of the grid. The applied function checks if a cell's value is '8' and if the cell is within a 2-cell radius of the initially found '8'.
   - `mfilter`: This function takes the output of `prapply` and filters it to keep only the indices of the cells that were identified as belonging to the target object.
   - `toobject`: This function converts the set of indices returned by `mfilter` into an object representation.
3. **Recoloring and Painting:** 
   - `recolor`: This function takes the object containing the rightmost '8' and recolors it to '1'. 
   - `paint`:  This function takes the recoloured object and paints it back onto the original grid.
4. **Output:** The code then returns the modified grid. If no '8' is found in the grid, the original grid is returned.
