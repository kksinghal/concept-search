## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of a specific color (8 in this case) and extending them to the right by filling the background color (9) with a new color (1). 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** The single 8-colored object is extended rightwards, filling the background until it reaches the right edge of the grid.

**Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0, the rightmost column of each 8-colored object is extended rightwards. Notice how the extension stops when encountering a different color.

**Input_2:**  The extension happens for all 8-colored objects, maintaining the same behavior of filling only the background.

**Input_3:**  The transformation behaves consistently, extending the rightmost part of 8-colored objects to the right edge of the grid.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def rightmost_indices(obj):
    j = rightmost(obj)
    return frozenset((i, j) for i in range(height(I)))

  def process_object(obj):
    return fill(I, 1, rightmost_indices(obj))

  return merge(apply(process_object, sfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **rightmost_indices(obj):** This function takes an object and returns a set of indices representing a vertical line starting from the top of the grid and extending down at the rightmost column of the object. 
2. **process_object(obj):**  Fills the grid `I` with the color `1` at the indices provided by `rightmost_indices(obj)`.
3. The main function iterates through each 8-colored object and applies `process_object` to achieve the desired extension.

**Program Version 2**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
      if color(obj) == 8 and any(index(I, (i,j)) == 8 for i in range(height(I))):
        I = fill(I, 1, frozenset((i, j) for i in range(height(I))))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterates through each column of the grid.
2. For each column, it checks if there's an 8-colored object with a cell in that column.
3. If so, it fills the entire column with the color 1.

**Program Version 3**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_extension(obj):
    j = rightmost(obj)
    return frozenset((i, k) for i in range(height(I)) for k in range(j, width(I)))

  return fill(I, 1, merge(apply(right_extension, sfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **right_extension(obj):** This function returns a set of indices that represent a rectangular region starting from the rightmost column of the given object and extending to the right edge of the grid.
2. The main function applies `right_extension` to all 8-colored objects and merges the resulting indices. Finally, it fills these indices with the color 1.

**Program Version 4**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    if color(obj) == 8:
      I = fill(I, 1, frozenset((i, j) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(rightmost(obj), width(I))))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterates through each object in the grid.
2. If the object's color is 8, it fills the grid with 1 starting from the object's rightmost column and extending to the grid's right edge.

**Program Version 5**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_fill_from(loc):
    return frozenset((loc[0], j) for j in range(loc[1], width(I)))

  target_indices = mfilter(lambda loc: any(contained(loc, obj) and color(obj) == 8 for obj in objects(I, True, False, False)),
                         frozenset((i, rightmost(obj)) for obj in objects(I, True, False, False) for i in range(height(I))))

  return fill(I, 1, merge(apply(right_fill_from, target_indices)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **right_fill_from(loc):**  This function takes a location and returns indices representing a horizontal line starting from that location and going to the right edge.
2. **target_indices:** This identifies locations at the rightmost edges of 8-colored objects.
3. The main function then applies `right_fill_from` to each `target_indices` to fill the grid.

These are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation. Each version utilizes different DSL functions and logic, offering a diverse set of solutions.
