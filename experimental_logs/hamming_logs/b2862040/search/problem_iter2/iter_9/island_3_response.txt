## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves identifying objects formed by the digit '8' and extending them to the right edge of the grid by filling with the digit '1'. Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** 
- Two objects are formed by the digit '8'.
- Both objects are extended rightward with '1's, reaching the grid's edge.

**Input_1:**
- Four '8' objects are present.
- Each object extends rightward with '1's to the edge.

**Input_2:**
- Notice the '8' objects are scattered.
- Each object, regardless of position, extends rightward with '1's to the edge.

**Input_3:**
- Despite a larger grid and more '8' objects, the pattern remains consistent. 
- Each object is extended rightward with '1's.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               merge(
                 recolor(1,
                         product(interval(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1, 1),
                                 interval(rightmost(obj) + 1, len(I[0]), 1)))
                 for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if color(obj) == 8))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies all objects in the input grid (`I`), considering connected cells with the same value (T), not allowing diagonal connections (F), and excluding the background color (T).
2. **`if color(obj) == 8`:** Filters objects to select only those formed by the digit '8'.
3. **`product(...)`:** Generates a set of indices representing the rectangle from the right edge of each '8' object to the grid's right edge. This uses the `uppermost`, `lowermost`, and `rightmost` functions to determine the object's boundaries.
4. **`recolor(1, ...)`:**  Creates a new object with the digit '1' at the generated indices, effectively "filling" the area.
5. **`merge(...)`:**  Combines all the filled rectangles into a single object.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the combined object onto the input grid, resulting in the desired output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, 1, 
              merge(
                product(interval(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1, 1),
                        interval(rightmost(obj) + 1, len(I[0]), 1)) 
                for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if color(obj) == 8))
```

**Explanation:**

- Similar to Version 1, this version identifies '8' objects and generates index sets for filling.
- Instead of `recolor` and `paint`, it directly uses `fill` to place '1's at the calculated indices, simplifying the code.

**Program Version 3:** (Using a hypothetical `reduce` function in the DSL)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_fill_obj(grid, obj):
    return fill(grid, 1, product(interval(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1, 1),
                                 interval(rightmost(obj) + 1, len(grid[0]), 1)))
  return reduce(right_fill_obj, 
                (obj for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if color(obj) == 8), 
                I)
```

**Explanation:**

- Introduces a helper function `right_fill_obj` to encapsulate the filling logic for a single object.
- Employs a hypothetical `reduce` function (not present in the provided DSL) to apply `right_fill_obj` iteratively to each '8' object, starting with the input grid. This approach offers a more functional programming style.

**Program Version 4:** (Iterative Approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 8:
      for i in interval(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1, 1):
        for j in interval(rightmost(obj) + 1, len(I[0]), 1):
          I = paint(I, {(1, (i, j))})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

- Uses nested loops to iterate through each cell to the right of an '8' object. 
- For every cell within the determined range, it paints a '1' onto the grid.
- This version is less efficient than the previous ones but demonstrates a different approach. 

**Program Version 5:** (Using `hconcat`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return hconcat(
                 crop(I, (0, 0), (len(I), rightmost(objects(I, T, F, T)[0]))),
                 canvas(1, (len(I), len(I[0]) - rightmost(objects(I, T, F, T)[0]))))
```
**Explanation:**

- This version directly manipulates the grid by identifying the rightmost edge of the first '8' object and splitting the grid at that point. It then concatenates the left part of the original grid with a new grid filled with '1's, effectively achieving the desired rightward extension. This approach utilizes `hconcat`, `crop`, and `canvas` functions.


Remember that these are just five examples; numerous other solutions could be devised using the provided DSL functions.
