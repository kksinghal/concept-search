## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently recolors the rightmost connected object (or sub-object when multiple objects exist) comprised of '8's in the input grid.  Let's break down each example:

**Input_0:**
- The rightmost '8'-object is a shape resembling the letter 'L'.
- **Output_0:** This 'L' shape is recolored to '1's.

**Input_1:**
- Two '8'-objects exist. The rightmost one forms a horizontal line at the bottom.
- **Output_1:**  Only this rightmost horizontal '8'-object is recolored to '1's.

**Input_2:**
-  Again, multiple '8'-objects are present. The rightmost one is in the bottom right corner.
-  **Output_2:**  The '8's in the bottom right corner are changed to '1's. 

**Input_3:**
-  Similar to previous examples, the rightmost '8'-object (a short line) is targeted.
-  **Output_3:** The target '8's are replaced by '1's.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def rightmost_8_cell(obj):
    return max(obj, key=lambda cell: cell[1][1])
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True) 
  rightmost_obj = argmax(sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj)==8), rightmost_8_cell) 
  return paint(I, recolor(1, rightmost_obj))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`rightmost_8_cell(obj)`:**  Helper function to find the rightmost cell within an object.
2. **`objects(...)`:** Extracts all connected objects from the grid.
3. **`sfilter(...)`:** Filters the objects to keep only those consisting of '8's.
4. **`argmax(...)`:** Finds the object with the rightmost cell among the filtered objects.
5. **`paint(...)`:**  Recolors the identified rightmost '8'-object on the grid to '1's.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1, -1, -1):
    for i in range(len(I)):
      if I[i][j] == 8:
        obj = toobject(
            mfilter(
              prapply(
                lambda a, b: both(equality(b, 8), adjacent(a, astuple(i, j))),
                asindices(I),
                (I[k][l] for k in range(len(I)) for l in range(len(I[0])))
              ),
              lambda x: x
            ),
            I
          )
        return paint(I, recolor(1, obj))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate from the rightmost column:** The code iterates through columns from right to left, and within each column, from top to bottom.
2. **Find the first '8':** When an '8' is encountered:
   -  It constructs a set of indices that are adjacent to the current cell `(i, j)` and have the value '8' in the grid `I`. This effectively identifies the connected component of '8's starting from the current cell.
   - The `toobject` function then converts these indices into an object representation.
3. **Recolor and return:** The object is recolored to '1' using `recolor`, and the modified grid is returned immediately.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def rightmost_obj_index(objs):
    return max((j, i) for i, obj in enumerate(objs) for j in (cell[1][1] for cell in obj if cell[0] == 8))
  objs = partition(I)
  ri, _ = rightmost_obj_index(objs)
  return tuple(
        tuple(
            1 if (v == 8 and (i, j) in (cell[1] for cell in objs[ri])) else v for j, v in enumerate(row)
        ) for i, row in enumerate(I)
    ) 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`partition(I)`:** Divides the grid into objects based on cell values.
2. **`rightmost_obj_index(objs)`:**  Finds the index of the object containing the rightmost '8' cell.
3. **Inline Recoloring:**  Iterates through the grid, recoloring cells to '1' if they are part of the rightmost '8'-object, otherwise preserving their original color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  j = width(I) - 1
  while j >= 0:
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if I[i][j] == 8:
        return paint(I, recolor(1, toobject(flood_fill((i, j), I), I)))
    j -= 1
  return I
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate from Right to Left:** Starts from the rightmost column (`j = width(I) - 1`) and moves leftward.
2. **Find First '8':**  In each column, it searches for the first occurrence of '8'.
3. **Flood Fill:** If an '8' is found, it performs a flood fill operation (`flood_fill((i, j), I)`) to get the indices of the connected '8'-object.
4. **Recolor and Return:** The identified object is recolored to '1' and the modified grid is returned. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def r8_filter(obj):
    return 1 if color(obj) == 8 and rightmost(obj) == rm_idx else 0
  rm_idx = max(j for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(row) if v == 8)
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  return paint(I, recolor(1, merge(sfilter(objs, r8_filter))))
```

**Explanation:**
1.  **`rm_idx = ...`:** Determines the column index of the rightmost '8' in the grid.
2.  **`objects(...)`:**  Extracts all connected objects.
3.  **`r8_filter(obj)`:** This helper function checks if an object is both composed of '8's and its rightmost point matches `rm_idx`. 
4.  **`sfilter(...)`:** Filters objects to keep only those satisfying `r8_filter`.
5.  **`merge(...)`:** Combines the filtered objects (which should be a single object in this case)
6.  **`paint(...)`:** Recolors the merged object to '1' on the grid.
