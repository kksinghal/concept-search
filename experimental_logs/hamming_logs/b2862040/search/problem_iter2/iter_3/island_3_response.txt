## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects with a specific color (in these examples, color 8) and extending them to the right edge of the grid, filling the new cells with the color 1. 

**Let's break down the transformation for each example:**

* **Input_0, Output_0:** The single 8-colored object is extended rightward, filling the space with 1s.
* **Input_1, Output_1:**  Both 8-colored objects are extended rightward, filling the space with 1s.
* **Input_2, Output_2:** This example highlights that the extension occurs from the rightmost point of each 8-colored object.
* **Input_3, Output_3:**  This reinforces the observation from Input_2 and shows multiple extensions on different rows. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each with an explanation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 8:
      I = fill(I, 1, product(interval(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1, 1), 
                              interval(rightmost(obj), len(I[0]), 1)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, T)` finds all objects in the input grid (`I`).
2. **Filter by Color:**  The `for` loop iterates through each object, and the `if color(obj) == 8` condition selects objects with color 8.
3. **Determine Fill Area:**  `product(interval(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1, 1), interval(rightmost(obj), len(I[0]), 1))` creates a set of indices representing the area to be filled. It starts from the rightmost column of the object (`rightmost(obj)`) and extends to the last column of the grid (`len(I[0])`), covering all rows where the object is present (`uppermost(obj)` to `lowermost(obj)`).
4. **Fill the Area:**  `fill(I, 1, ...)` fills the determined area with the color 1.
5. **Return Modified Grid:**  The modified grid (`I`) is returned.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               merge(recolor(1, product(interval(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1, 1),
                                       interval(rightmost(obj), len(I[0]), 1)))
                      for obj in sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: color(o) == 8)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Filter:**  Similar to Version 1, `sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: color(o) == 8)` finds all 8-colored objects.
2. **Generate Fill Objects:** For each object, `recolor(1, product(interval(...), interval(...)))` creates a new object with color 1, occupying the area to be filled (as explained in Version 1).
3. **Merge Objects:** `merge(...)` combines all the newly created fill objects into a single object.
4. **Paint Onto Grid:**  `paint(I, ...)` paints the merged fill object onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  target_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  right_edge = rightmost(target_obj)
  return fill(I, 1, product(interval(uppermost(target_obj), lowermost(target_obj) + 1, 1),
                            range(right_edge, len(I[0]))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Extract:** This version first identifies all objects but then uses `extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)` to select the first 8-colored object. This assumes there's only one such object, which might not always be true.
2. **Find Right Edge:** `rightmost(target_obj)` determines the rightmost column of the target object. 
3. **Fill Area:**  Similar to previous versions, it fills the area from the object's right edge to the grid's right edge with color 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I,
              merge(recolor(1, {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) 
                                    for j in range(rightmost(obj), len(I[0]))}) 
                    for obj in sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: color(o) == 8)))
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **Similar to Version 2:** This version is very similar to Version 2. The main difference is in how the fill area is generated. Instead of using `product` and `interval`, it directly uses nested loops within a set comprehension: `{(i, j) for i in range(...) for j in range(...)}`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 8:
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
        I = fill(I, 1, hfrontier((i, rightmost(obj))))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Objects and Rows:**  This version iterates through each 8-colored object and then iterates through the rows where the object is present.
2. **Fill Row-by-Row:** For each row, it uses `hfrontier((i, rightmost(obj)))` to create a horizontal line starting from the object's rightmost point on that row. It then uses `fill` to fill this line with color 1. 

**Note:** 

- Programs 1, 2, 4, and 5 are suitable for handling multiple 8-colored objects.
- Program 3 will only work correctly if there's a single 8-colored object in the grid. 
- Choose the program version that best suits your needs based on the potential variations in your input data.
