## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of the least common color (excluding the background and 0) and replacing the rightmost column of each object with the value '1'.

**Input_0:** The least common color is 8. The rightmost columns of all objects with color 8 are replaced by 1.

**Input_1:** The least common color is 8.  The rightmost columns of all objects with color 8 are replaced by 1.

**Input_2:** The least common color is 8.  The rightmost columns of all objects with color 8 are replaced by 1.

**Input_3:** The least common color is 8.  The rightmost columns of all objects with color 8 are replaced by 1.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" in the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  mc = mostcolor(I) # identify the most common color (background)
  p = palette(I) - {mc, 0} # find the palette excluding background and 0
  lc = leastcommon(tuple(v for v in p)) # determine the least common color
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True) # identify all objects
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, lc) # filter for objects of the least common color
  right_edges = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((1, (i, rightmost(obj))) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)), target_objs) # get right edge indices of target objects
  return paint(I, merge(right_edges)) # paint the right edges with '1' on the original grid
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify Key Colors:** Determine the background color (most common) and the least common color (excluding background and 0).
2.  **Isolate Target Objects:**  Identify all objects in the grid and filter for those with the least common color.
3.  **Mark Right Edges:** For each target object, mark the indices of its rightmost column.
4.  **Paint the Edges:** Overwrite the original grid by painting the marked edges with the value '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  mc = mostcolor(I)
  p = palette(I) - {mc, 0}
  lc = min(p)
  return tuple(tuple(1 if v == lc and any(j == rightmost(obj) and i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)) else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(I))
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through the grid, checking each cell:

- **Identify Target Cells:** If the cell color is the least common AND it's the rightmost cell of its object, mark it for replacement.
- **Replace:**  Replace the marked cells with '1', leaving others unchanged.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  mc = mostcolor(I)
  p = palette(I) - {mc, 0}
  lc = leastcommon(tuple(v for v in p))
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  return paint(I, merge(frozenset((1, (i, rightmost(obj))) for obj in objs for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) if color(obj) == lc)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version condenses the logic within the `paint` and `merge` functions for a more compact approach. It identifies the right edges of the target objects directly within the function arguments.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: frozenset((1, (i, rightmost(obj))) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)) if color(obj) == leastcommon(tuple(v for v in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I), 0})) else frozenset(), objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version further condenses the code by embedding the least common color calculation and the object filtering within the `apply` function. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    mc = mostcolor(I)
    target_color = leastcommon([c for c in palette(I) if c not in (mc, 0)])
    new_grid = []
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        new_row = list(row)
        for j, v in enumerate(row):
            if v == target_color and (j == len(row) - 1 or I[i][j + 1] != target_color):
                new_row[j] = 1
        new_grid.append(tuple(new_row))
    return tuple(new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a more iterative approach, going through each cell and checking if it's the rightmost cell of an object of the target color. This avoids using some of the more complex DSL functions while still achieving the desired result.
