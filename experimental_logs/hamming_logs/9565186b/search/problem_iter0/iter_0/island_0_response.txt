## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation replaces all occurrences of the digit '8' with the digit '5' in the input grid.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = replace(I, EIGHT, FIVE)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This program directly uses the `replace` function from the DSL. It takes the input grid `I`, replaces all occurrences of `EIGHT` with `FIVE`, and returns the modified grid `O`. 

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    f = rbind(equality, EIGHT)
    g = rbind(branch, FIVE, identity)
    h = compose(g, f)
    O = apply(h, I)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* `f`: This function checks if a given value is equal to `EIGHT`.
* `g`: This function takes a boolean and returns `FIVE` if True, otherwise returns the input value unchanged.
* `h`: This function composes `g` and `f`, effectively replacing `EIGHT` with `FIVE` and leaving other values unchanged.
* The program then applies function `h` to each element of the input grid `I` to get the output grid `O`.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = asobject(I)
    filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda x: x[0] == EIGHT)
    recolored_objs = apply(lambda x: (FIVE, x[1]), filtered_objs)
    O = paint(I, recolored_objs)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* `objs`: Converts the input grid `I` into a set of (value, index) pairs.
* `filtered_objs`: Filters `objs` to keep only the pairs where the value is `EIGHT`.
* `recolored_objs`:  Replaces the value '8' with '5' in the filtered object set.
* Finally, the program paints the `recolored_objs` onto the original grid `I` to generate the output grid `O`.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    indices = ofcolor(I, EIGHT)
    O = fill(I, FIVE, indices)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* `indices`: Identifies the indices of all cells in the input grid `I` where the value is `EIGHT`.
* `O`: Creates the output grid by filling the `indices` in the input grid `I` with the value `FIVE`.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == EIGHT:
        O = fill(O, FIVE, {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This program iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`. If the cell value is `EIGHT`, it uses the `fill` function to replace it with `FIVE` in the output grid `O`.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL. Each version utilizes distinct logic and function combinations, highlighting the diversity of possible solutions.
