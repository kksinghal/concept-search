## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in both examples involves expanding objects (clusters of non-background digits) by a single layer of a new digit (3). 

**Let's break it down:**

1. **Object Identification:** The input grid is analyzed to identify distinct objects. An object is a connected group of cells with the same digit, excluding the background digit (most common). 
2. **Expansion:** Each object is expanded outward by one layer. This means adding a layer of the new digit (3) around the perimeter of each object.
3. **Overlapping:**  If the expansions of two objects overlap, they merge seamlessly. There is no specific rule for resolving overlapping colors; the merged area simply adopts the new digit (3).

**Here's a visual representation:**

```
Input:
0 2 0 
2 2 0
0 0 0

Output:
0 3 3
3 2 3
3 3 0 
```

## Code Generation:

### Program Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Identify objects, excluding the background.
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, backdrop(toindices(obj))), objs) # Expand each object's backdrop and recolor to 3.
  return paint(fill(I, THREE, asindices(I)), expanded_objs) # Paint the expanded objects onto a canvas filled with 3s.
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We use `objects(I, T, F, T)` to find all objects in the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Expand Objects:**  For each object:
    - `toindices(obj)` gets the indices of the object's cells.
    - `backdrop(toindices(obj))` finds the indices of a bounding box encompassing the object.
    - `recolor(THREE, backdrop(toindices(obj)))` creates a new object with the new digit (3) at those expanded indices. 
3. **Paint to Canvas:**
    - `fill(I, THREE, asindices(I))` creates a blank canvas filled with the new digit (3).
    - `paint(canvas, expanded_objs)` paints the expanded objects onto the canvas.

### Program Version 2: 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expanded_indices = mpapply(lambda obj: merge(apply(lambda ind: dneighbors(ind) | {ind}, toindices(obj))), objs) 
  return fill(I, THREE, expanded_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Similar to Version 1.
2. **Expand Indices:**
    - For each object:
      - Get the object's indices.
      - For each index, find its direct neighbors (`dneighbors`) and combine them with the original index. 
      - Merge all these expanded indices.
3. **Fill Grid:** Fill the input grid with the new digit (3) at all the expanded indices. 

### Program Version 3: 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      fill(I, THREE, asindices(I)), 
      mapply(
          lambda obj: toobject(
              mpapply(lambda offset: shift(toindices(obj), offset), ((-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1))), 
              I), 
          objects(I, T, F, T))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Expand and Paint:** 
   - For each object:
     - Get the object's indices.
     - Shift the indices in all four cardinal directions using `((-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1))`.
     - Merge the shifted indices to get the expanded area.
     - Convert the expanded indices back to an object with `toobject`, taking colors from the input grid.
   - Paint all the expanded objects onto a canvas filled with the new digit. 

### Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    return fill(I, THREE, 
                difference(
                    merge(apply(lambda obj: backdrop(toindices(obj)), objs)), 
                    merge(apply(toindices, objs))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  As in previous versions.
2. **Find Expansion Area:**
    - Find the backdrop (bounding box indices) for each object.
    - Merge all backdrops into a single set of indices.
    - Find the indices of all objects and merge them.
    - Calculate the difference between the merged backdrops and the merged object indices. This leaves only the expanded perimeter.
3. **Fill Grid:** Fill the input grid with the new digit (3) at the indices representing the expanded perimeter.

### Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return paint(fill(I, THREE, asindices(I)), 
               mapply(lambda obj: toobject(
                   difference(backdrop(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj)), 
                   I), 
                   objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Expand and Paint:**
   - For each object:
     - Get its indices and find the backdrop.
     - Calculate the difference between the backdrop and object indices to get the perimeter indices.
     - Use `toobject` to create a new object with the perimeter indices, taking color values from the input grid.
   - Paint all the expanded perimeter objects onto a canvas filled with the new digit.
