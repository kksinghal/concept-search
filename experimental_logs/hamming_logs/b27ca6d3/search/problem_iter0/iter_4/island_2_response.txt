## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same color, excluding the background color 0) in the input grid and drawing a specific pattern around them using the color 3. 

**Pattern:**

The pattern drawn around each object consists of:
- **Horizontal lines:** Extending one cell to the left and right from the object's leftmost and rightmost cells, respectively. 
- **Vertical lines:** Extending one cell above and below the object's uppermost and lowermost cells, respectively.
- **Corners:** The four corners of the pattern are filled in.

Essentially, it creates an outline that is one cell larger than the bounding box of the object.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for cell in obj:
      i, j = cell[1]
      O = fill(O, 3, {(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)}) # Fill adjacent cells
    O = underfill(O, 3, box(obj)) # Fill the bounding box outline 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objs = objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate & Fill:** The code iterates through each object (`for obj in objs`) and each cell in the object (`for cell in obj`).  For every cell, it fills the adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) in the output grid `O` with color 3.
3. **Outline:** After filling adjacent cells, it uses `underfill(O, 3, box(obj))` to draw the bounding box outline of the object with color 3. This ensures that corners are filled even if they are not directly adjacent to an object cell.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = underfill(O, 3, backdrop(shift(obj, (1, 1)))) # Expand backdrop and fill
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Shift & Expand:** For each object, it shifts the object diagonally down-right by one unit (`shift(obj, (1, 1))`) and then calculates the backdrop (`backdrop(...)`), effectively creating a bounding box one unit larger in each direction.
3. **Fill:** It then uses `underfill` to fill this expanded backdrop with color 3, achieving the desired pattern.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    top, left = ulcorner(obj)
    bottom, right = lrcorner(obj)
    O = fill(O, 3, {(top - 1, j) for j in range(left, right + 2)}) # Top line
    O = fill(O, 3, {(bottom + 1, j) for j in range(left, right + 2)}) # Bottom line
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, left - 1) for i in range(top, bottom + 2)}) # Left line
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, right + 1) for i in range(top, bottom + 2)}) # Right line
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Calculate Boundaries:** For each object, it determines the coordinates of the upper-left (`ulcorner(obj)`) and lower-right (`lrcorner(obj)`) corners to determine the boundaries of the pattern.
3. **Draw Lines:**  It then explicitly draws the four lines of the pattern using `fill` with color 3, based on the calculated boundaries.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = underfill(O, 3, box(obj)) # Outline
    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for i, j in outbox(obj) if (i == 0 or i == len(I) - 1 or j == 0 or j == len(I[0]) - 1)}) # Outer corners 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Outline:**  Draws the bounding box outline using `underfill` and `box` like previous versions.
3. **Outer Corners:**  It then specifically identifies the corner cells of the `outbox` (a bounding box one unit larger in each direction) that lie on the edges of the grid and fills them with color 3. This ensures correct corner placement even when the object touches the grid boundary.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    shifted = shift(obj, (1, 1)) 
    O = underfill(O, 3, delta(shifted) - toindices(shifted)) # Fill delta excluding shifted object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Shift & Delta:** It shifts the object diagonally (`shift(obj, (1, 1))`) and then calculates the `delta`, which represents the cells within the shifted object's bounding box that are not part of the shifted object itself.
3. **Fill:**  It uses `underfill` to fill the `delta` with color 3, effectively drawing the desired pattern around the original object. 

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing different DSL functions and logic.
