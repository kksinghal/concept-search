## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of non-background digits) and then expanding these objects by one cell in all directions (excluding diagonals). The expanded cells are then filled with the digit '3'.

**Example:**

Input Grid:

```
0 0 2 0
0 2 2 0
0 0 0 0
```

1. **Identify Objects:**  There is one object formed by the digit '2'.
2. **Expand Objects:** The object is expanded by one cell in each direction.
3. **Fill Expanded Cells:** The expanded cells are filled with '3'.

Output Grid:

```
0 3 2 2 3 0
0 3 2 2 3 0
0 3 3 3 3 0
```

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Identify objects, excluding background
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: toobject(backdrop(toindices(obj)), I), objs)
  return paint(fill(I, THREE, asindices(I)), merge(expanded_objs)) # Paint expanded objects onto a canvas filled with '3'
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`: This line identifies all objects within the input grid (`I`), treating connected regions of the same non-background color as distinct objects.
2.  `expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: toobject(backdrop(toindices(obj)), I), objs)`: This line expands each identified object by one cell in all directions. `backdrop` calculates the indices encompassing the object and its surrounding cells. `toobject` then uses these indices to create a new object from the corresponding cells in the input grid.
3. `return paint(fill(I, THREE, asindices(I)), merge(expanded_objs))`: This line first creates a new grid filled entirely with the value `THREE`. It then overlays the expanded objects onto this grid using the `paint` function, resulting in the final output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) 
  expanded_indices = mpapply(lambda obj: merge(apply(dneighbors, toindices(obj))), objs)
  return fill(I, THREE, difference(expanded_indices, toindices(merge(objs))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`: This line extracts all foreground objects from the input grid `I`, excluding the background. 
2. `expanded_indices = mpapply(lambda obj: merge(apply(dneighbors, toindices(obj))), objs)`: This line generates the indices of cells surrounding each object. For every object, it first retrieves its cell indices using `toindices(obj)`. Then, for each cell index, it finds the directly adjacent neighbors using `dneighbors`. Finally, it merges all the neighbor indices into a single set, `expanded_indices`.
3. `return fill(I, THREE, difference(expanded_indices, toindices(merge(objs))))`: This line first merges all the objects into one set and gets their indices using `toindices(merge(objs))`. Then, it calculates the difference between the expanded indices and the original object indices (`difference(expanded_indices, ...)`). This results in a set of indices representing only the expanded cells. Finally, it fills these indices in the original grid `I` with the value `THREE` using the `fill` function and returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    expanded = mapply(lambda obj: toindices(shift(obj, (1, 0))) | toindices(shift(obj, (-1, 0))) | toindices(shift(obj, (0, 1))) | toindices(shift(obj, (0, -1))), objs)
    return fill(I, THREE, difference(expanded, toindices(merge(objs))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`: This identifies all non-background objects in the input grid.
2. `expanded = ...`: This line calculates the indices of the expanded cells around each object. It does this by shifting each object one cell in each of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) using `shift(obj, (1, 0))`, `shift(obj, (-1, 0))`, `shift(obj, (0, 1))`, and `shift(obj, (0, -1))`. For each shifted object, it gets the indices using `toindices`. Finally, it combines the indices of all shifted versions of an object using the `|` operator. The result is stored in `expanded`.
3. `return fill(I, THREE, difference(expanded, toindices(merge(objs))))`: This line calculates the final output grid. It first finds the difference between the `expanded` indices and the indices of the original objects, effectively isolating the indices of the cells that were added during expansion.  It then calls the `fill` function to fill these indices in the original grid `I` with the value `THREE`. The resulting grid is then returned.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    expansion_offsets = ((1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1))
    expanded_cells = mpapply(lambda obj:  mpapply(lambda offset: toindices(shift(obj, offset)), expansion_offsets), objs)
    return fill(I, THREE, difference(expanded_cells, toindices(merge(objs))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`: This line identifies all objects within the input grid (`I`), treating connected regions of the same non-background color as distinct objects.
2. `expansion_offsets = ((1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1))`: This line defines a tuple containing the four cardinal directions as offsets, which will be used to expand the objects.
3. `expanded_cells = mpapply(lambda obj:  mpapply(lambda offset: toindices(shift(obj, offset)), expansion_offsets), objs)`: This line iterates through each object and applies the expansion offsets. For each offset, it shifts the object using `shift(obj, offset)` and gets the indices of the shifted object using `toindices`. The `mpapply` function is used twice here to merge the results of shifting each object with different offsets and then to merge the expanded cells of all objects.
4. `return fill(I, THREE, difference(expanded_cells, toindices(merge(objs))))`: This line fills the cells that are part of the expansion but not part of the original objects with the value `THREE`. It first merges all objects into a single set using `merge(objs)`, then extracts their indices with `toindices`. Finally, it calculates the difference between the `expanded_cells` and the original object indices, giving the indices to be filled. The `fill` function then modifies the input grid `I` by placing the value `THREE` at those specific indices.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    expanded = frozenset()
    for obj in objs:
        for i, j in toindices(obj):
            expanded |= dneighbors((i, j)) 
    return fill(I, THREE, difference(expanded, toindices(merge(objs))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`: This line identifies all the objects in the input grid (`I`), excluding the background. It treats each group of connected, non-background cells with the same value as a single object.
2. `expanded = frozenset()`: Initializes an empty frozenset called `expanded`. This set will store the indices of all the cells that need to be filled with the value `THREE`.
3. `for obj in objs:`: Starts a loop that iterates over each identified object in the input grid.
4. `for i, j in toindices(obj):`:  Starts a nested loop that iterates over the indices of each cell belonging to the current object.
5. `expanded |= dneighbors((i, j))`: For each cell within the object, it calculates the indices of its direct neighbors (up, down, left, right) using the `dneighbors` function. It then adds these neighbor indices to the `expanded` set using the `|=` operator (union operation for sets).
6. `return fill(I, THREE, difference(expanded, toindices(merge(objs))))`: This line calculates the final output.  It first finds the difference between the indices in the `expanded` set and the indices of all the cells belonging to the original objects (`difference(expanded, toindices(merge(objs)))`). This effectively isolates the indices of cells that were added during the expansion process.  It then calls the `fill` function to fill these specific indices in the original grid `I` with the value `THREE`. The resulting modified grid is then returned as the final output.

These five program versions provide distinct approaches to solving the problem using different DSL function combinations.
