## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

The transformation involves identifying horizontal lines of the digit "2" and extending them to the right with the digit "3", stopping at the grid boundary or another "2". Single occurrences of "2" are also extended.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

This transformation is similar to the first. It identifies horizontal lines of "2" and extends them to the right with "3", stopping at the grid boundary or another "2". However, single "2"s are extended both to the left and right.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      O = paint(O, {(value, (i, j))})
      if value == 2:
        obj_width = width(objects(crop(I, (i,0), (1,w)), True, False, True)[0])
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j + 1, min(j + obj_width, w)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas `O` with the same dimensions as the input `I`.
2. **Iteration:** Iterates over each cell in the input grid.
3. **Value Copying:** Copies the value from the input cell to the corresponding output cell.
4. **Extension Logic:** 
   - If the current value is "2", it calculates the width of the "2" object on that row using `objects` and `width`.
   - It then paints a line of "3"s to the right, starting from the next column and extending for the calculated object width or until the grid boundary, whichever comes first.
5. **Output:** Returns the modified canvas `O`.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      start_j = leftmost(obj)
      end_j = rightmost(obj) + width(obj)
      row_i = uppermost(obj)
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, frozenset((row_i, k) for k in range(start_j + 1, min(end_j, len(I[0]))))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Detection:** Identifies all objects in the input grid `I` using `objects`.
2. **Iteration:** Iterates over each detected object.
3. **Color Check and Extension:**
   - If the object's color is "2", it determines the starting and ending column indices for extension.
   - It then paints a line of "3"s from the column next to the starting index up to the calculated ending index (considering the grid boundary).
4. **Output:** Returns the modified grid `O`.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 2:
        k = j + 1
        while k < len(row) and row[k] != 2:
          O = paint(O, {(3, (i, k))})
          k += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input `I`.
2. **Iteration:** Iterates through each cell in the input grid.
3. **Extension:** 
   - If a "2" is encountered, it initiates a loop that continues rightward until a "2" or the grid boundary is met.
   - Within the loop, each cell is painted with "3".
4. **Output:** Returns the modified grid `O`.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    j = 0
    while j < w:
      if row[j] == 2:
        O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j))})
        k = j + 1
        while k < w and row[k] != 2:
          O = paint(O, {(3, (i, k))})
          k += 1
        j = k
      else:
        O = paint(O, {(row[j], (i, j))})
        j += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas `O`.
2. **Iteration:** Iterates through each cell in the input grid.
3. **Value Handling:**
   - If a "2" is encountered:
     - It's painted to the output grid.
     - A nested loop starts, painting "3"s rightward until another "2" or the boundary is encountered.
     - The outer loop's index `j` is updated to skip the extended "3" section.
   - If the value isn't "2", it's directly copied to the output grid.
4. **Output:** Returns the modified grid `O`.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    extension = False
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 2:
        extension = True
      elif extension:
        O = paint(O, {(3, (i, j))})
      else:
        O = paint(O, {(value, (i, j))})
    O = paint(O, {(row[-1], (i, len(row) - 1))})  # Handle last cell
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input `I`.
2. **Iteration and Extension:** 
   - Iterates through each cell, using a boolean flag `extension` to track if a "2" has been encountered on the current row.
   - If a "2" is encountered, `extension` is set to True.
   - While `extension` is True, every subsequent cell is painted with "3".
   - `extension` is reset to False when another "2" or the end of the row is reached.
3. **Last Cell Handling:** Ensures the last cell of each row retains its original value.
4. **Output:** Returns the modified grid `O`.
