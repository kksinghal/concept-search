## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying objects with the color "2" and then extending them to the right by painting with color "3" for a distance equal to their width. 

**Input 0:**

- Each "2" object is extended to the right by a length equal to its width, filling with "3".
- Notice how objects at the edge of the grid are only extended within the grid boundaries.

**Input 1:**

- The same logic applies here. Each "2" object, regardless of its shape, is extended rightward by its own width, filling with "3". 

## Code Generation:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 2:
        obj_width = width(extract(objects(crop(I, (i,0), (1,w)), True, False, True), lambda obj: (i,j) in toindices(obj)))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j + 1, min(j + obj_width, w)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - `h, w = len(I), len(I[0])`:  Gets the height and width of the input grid `I`.
   - `O = I`: Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid.

2. **Iterating through the Grid:**
   - `for i, row in enumerate(I)`: Iterates through each row `row` of the input grid `I` with its index `i`.
   - `for j, value in enumerate(row)`: Iterates through each cell `value` in the current `row` with its index `j`.

3. **Identifying Objects to Extend:**
   - `if value == 2:`: Checks if the current cell's value is "2". This condition ensures we're only operating on objects we want to extend.

4. **Calculating Object Width:**
   - `obj_width = width(...)`: Calculates the width of the object containing the current cell. 
     - `crop(I, (i,0), (1,w))`: Creates a subgrid from the current row.
     - `objects(..., True, False, True)`: Finds objects in the subgrid. `True, False, True` means univalued objects, no diagonal connections, and excluding background.
     - `extract(..., lambda obj: (i,j) in toindices(obj))`: Extracts the object containing the current cell `(i, j)`.
     - `width(...)`: Gets the width of the extracted object.

5. **Extending the Object:**
   - `O = paint(...)`:  Paints the output grid `O` to reflect the extended object.
     - `recolor(3, ...)`:  Creates an object of color "3" representing the extension.
     - `frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j + 1, min(j + obj_width, w)))`: Generates the indices for the extension, starting from the cell to the right of the current cell `(j+1)` and extending for `obj_width` cells or until the edge of the grid, whichever comes first.

6. **Returning the Output:**
   - `return O`: Returns the modified output grid `O`.

This code accurately implements the transformation logic described in the analysis section for both input-output pairs.
