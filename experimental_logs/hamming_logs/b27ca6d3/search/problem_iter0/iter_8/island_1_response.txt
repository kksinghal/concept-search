## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same color, excluding the background color 0) and drawing a box around them using the color 3. 

**Input_0:**

- Several single-cell objects with color 2 exist.
- The output replaces these single cells with a 3x3 box of 3s, centered on the original 2.

**Input_1:**

- Similar to Input_0, single-cell objects (color 2) are replaced by 3x3 boxes of 3s.
- Additionally, some 2-cell objects exist. These are also enclosed in 3x3 boxes.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Identify objects, not considering diagonals, excluding background
  boxes = mapply(lambda obj: box(toindices(obj)), objs) # Draw a box around each object's indices
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(boxes)) # Fill the box indices with color 3 

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Create Boxes:** For each object, `box(toindices(obj))` calculates the indices forming a box around it.
3. **Fill Boxes:**  `fill(I, THREE, merge(boxes))` fills the box indices on the input grid with the color 3.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = partition(I)  # Partition the grid into objects based on color
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: len(obj) == 1) # Select only single-cell objects
  boxes = mapply(lambda obj: backdrop(toindices(obj)), filtered_objs) # Get the 3x3 backdrop for each object
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(boxes)) # Fill the backdrop indices with 3

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition Grid:** `partition(I)` divides the grid into objects based on color.
2. **Filter Single Cells:** `sfilter(objs, lambda obj: len(obj) == 1)` keeps only objects containing a single cell. 
3. **Get Backdrop:** `backdrop(toindices(obj))` determines the 3x3 area around each single-cell object.
4. **Fill Backdrop:**  `fill(I, THREE, merge(boxes))` fills the identified backdrop areas with color 3.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != 0:  # Check for non-background colors
        I = fill(I, THREE, backdrop((i,j)))  # Fill a 3x3 area around the non-background cell
  return I

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Cells:**  The code iterates through each cell of the grid.
2. **Identify Non-Background:** If a cell doesn't have the background color (0), it's considered part of an object.
3. **Fill Backdrop:** `fill(I, THREE, backdrop((i,j)))` fills a 3x3 area centered on the non-background cell with color 3.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (1, 1)), objs)
  return paint(fill(I, THREE, asindices(I)), shifted_objs)
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts objects from the grid.
2. **Shift Objects:** `shift(obj, (1, 1))` moves each object one cell down and one cell to the right.
3. **Fill Grid with 3:** `fill(I, THREE, asindices(I))` creates a new grid filled entirely with the color 3.
4. **Paint Shifted Objects:** `paint()` overlays the shifted objects onto the grid filled with 3. This effectively creates a 3x3 box around each original object because the shifted object will overlap the 3s in the desired box shape. 

**Program Version 5**
```python
def program_v5(I):
  def box_around_cell(i, j):
    return {(i-1,j-1), (i-1,j), (i-1,j+1), 
            (i,j-1),   (i,j),   (i,j+1),
            (i+1,j-1), (i+1,j), (i+1,j+1)}
  boxes = set()
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != 0:
        boxes.update(box_around_cell(i, j))
  return fill(I, THREE, boxes)
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Define `box_around_cell`:** This helper function takes cell coordinates (i, j) and returns a set of indices representing a 3x3 box around that cell. 
2. **Iterate and Collect Boxes:** The code iterates through the grid. If a cell is not the background color, it adds the indices of the box around that cell to the `boxes` set.
3. **Fill Boxes:** Finally, `fill(I, THREE, boxes)` fills all the collected box indices with the color 3.

These are just a few examples. You can create many other variations by combining DSL functions differently or changing the order of operations.
