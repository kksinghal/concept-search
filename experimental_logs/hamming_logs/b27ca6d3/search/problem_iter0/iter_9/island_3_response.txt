## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects with a specific color (2 in this case) and then outlining these objects with another color (3 in this case). 

**Input_0:** 

* The objects formed by the digit '2' are identified.
* A border of '3' is drawn around each '2' object. This border includes directly adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) to any '2'.

**Input_1:**

* The same logic applies as in Input_0. 
* The border is drawn even when the adjacent cell falls outside the input grid.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=True, without_bg=True)
  target_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  border_cells = mapply(
      lambda obj: sfilter(
          neighbors(centerofmass(obj)),
          lambda n: index(I, n) != 2 if n in asindices(I) else False
      ),
      target_objs
  )
  O = fill(I, 3, merge(border_cells))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=True, without_bg=True)` extracts all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Filter Target Objects:** `sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)` selects objects with color value 2.
3. **Find Border Cells:**  For each target object, `neighbors(centerofmass(obj))` gets the neighboring cells. Then, `sfilter` keeps only those neighbors that are not color 2 or are outside the grid.
4. **Merge and Fill:** `merge(border_cells)` combines all the border cells, and `fill(I, 3, merge(border_cells))` fills these cells with color value 3 in the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=True, without_bg=True)
  border_cells = mfilter(
      objs,
      lambda obj: color(obj) == 2 and any(
          index(I, add(c, d)) != 2 and add(c, d) in asindices(I)
          for c in toindices(obj)
          for d in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]
      )
  )
  O = fill(I, 3, toindices(merge(border_cells)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Filter Border Objects:** `mfilter` directly finds objects that have color 2 and at least one neighboring cell that is either not color 2 or is outside the grid.
3. **Extract Indices and Fill:** `toindices` gets the indices of the border objects, and the rest is similar to version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=True, without_bg=True)
    border_cells = set()
    for obj in objs:
        if color(obj) == 2:
            for cell in toindices(obj):
                for d in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]:
                    neighbor = add(cell, d)
                    if neighbor not in asindices(I) or index(I, neighbor) != 2:
                        border_cells.add(cell)
                        break 
    O = fill(I, 3, frozenset(border_cells))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Iterate and Check Neighbors:** This version iterates through each cell of the target objects and checks if any neighbor is either not color 2 or outside the grid. If so, the cell is added to the `border_cells` set.
3. **Fill Border:** Similar to previous versions.

**Program Version 4:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] == 2:
                for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]):
                        if I[ni][nj] != 2:
                            O = fill(O, 3, {(i,j)})
                    else:
                        O = fill(O, 3, {(i,j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Grid:** This version iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check Neighbors:**  If a cell has value 2, it checks its four neighbors (up, down, left, right). 
3. **Fill Border:** If a neighbor is not 2 or is outside the grid, the current cell is considered a border cell and is filled with 3. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_border(i, j):
    if I[i][j] != 2: 
        return False
    for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]:
        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
        if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]):
            if I[ni][nj] != 2:
                return True
        else:
            return True
    return False

  O = [[3 if is_border(i, j) else I[i][j] for j in range(len(I[0]))] for i in range(len(I))]
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `is_border` Function:** This function checks if a given cell is a border cell by examining its neighbors.
2. **List Comprehension:** It uses nested list comprehensions to iterate through the grid and apply the `is_border` function to each cell. 
3. **Construct Output:** It builds a new grid where border cells are filled with 3 and other cells retain their original values. 

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL.
