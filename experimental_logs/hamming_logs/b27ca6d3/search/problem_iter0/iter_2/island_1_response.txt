## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid and expanding them by one layer of '3's. The original digits within the object remain unchanged. 

**Example:**

Input Grid:

```
0 0 2 0
0 2 2 0
0 2 0 0 
```

Output Grid:

```
0 3 3 3
3 2 2 3
3 2 3 0
```


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Identify objects in the grid, excluding background
  expanded_indices = mpapply(lambda obj: merge(apply(dneighbors, toindices(obj))), objs)
  return fill(I, THREE, difference(expanded_indices, toindices(merge(objs)))) # Fill expanded indices with '3' 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid `I`, excluding the background.
2. **Expand Objects:** For each object, we find its neighboring indices using `dneighbors` and merge them using `mpapply` and `merge`.
3. **Fill with '3's:**  We calculate the difference between expanded indices and original object indices using `difference`. This gives us the indices to be filled with '3'. Finally, we fill those indices with '3' using the `fill` function. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return paint(I, merge({(THREE, idx) for obj in objs for idx in delta(toindices(obj)) if manhattan(idx, toindices(obj))==1 }))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Find Delta Indices:** For each object,  `delta(toindices(obj))` finds the indices surrounding the object within its bounding box. We filter these indices to only include those directly adjacent (Manhattan distance of 1) to the object. 
3. **Paint with '3's:** We create a new object with the value '3' at each filtered delta index and paint it onto the input grid using `paint`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(apply(lambda obj: difference(backdrop(toindices(obj)),toindices(obj)), objs))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Backdrop and Difference:** For each object, `backdrop` gets the indices within its bounding box. Then, `difference`  finds the indices that are in the backdrop but not part of the object itself.
3. **Fill with '3's:** We merge all the difference indices from all objects and fill them with '3' using `fill`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, delta(toindices(obj))), objs))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Recolor Delta:** For each object, we find the delta indices using `delta` and then recolor them to '3' using `recolor`.
3. **Paint to Grid:** We merge all the recolored delta indices from all objects and paint them onto the input grid using `paint`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expanded_objects = apply(lambda obj: toobject(backdrop(toindices(obj)), fill(I, THREE, toindices(obj))), objs)
  return paint(I, merge(difference(expanded_objects, objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Expand and Recolor:** For each object, we get its backdrop indices and fill the original object indices with '3's within a copy of the input grid. Then, using `toobject`, we convert the backdrop indices to an object using the modified grid, effectively creating an expanded object filled with '3's.
3. **Paint Difference:**  We find the difference between the expanded objects and the original objects. This difference represents the '3' border. We merge these border objects and paint them onto the input grid.


## Conclusion:

These five versions utilize various DSL functions and logic to achieve the desired transformation. Each version highlights the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for manipulating spatial data.
