## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same color, excluding the background) and drawing a border around them using the color '3'.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:**  Several '2' objects are scattered on a background of '0'.
* **Output_0:** A '3' border surrounds each '2' object. The border is one cell thick and directly adjacent to the object.

* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0 but with a different arrangement of '2' objects.
* **Output_1:**  Again, a '3' border surrounds each '2' object.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve this transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Identify all objects
  border_indices = set()
  for obj in objs:
    border_indices = border_indices | delta(obj)  # Find indices surrounding each object
  O = fill(I, 3, border_indices)  # Fill border indices with color '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` finds all connected regions of the same color, excluding the background.
2. **Find Border Indices:**  For each object, `delta(obj)` finds the indices that form a one-cell thick border around it. The border indices are collected in the `border_indices` set.
3. **Fill Border:** `fill(I, 3, border_indices)` fills the identified border indices with the color '3'.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) 
  O = I  # Start with the input grid
  for obj in objs:
    O = fill(O, 3, backdrop(obj) - toindices(obj))  # Fill the backdrop, excluding the object itself 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Iterative Filling:**  Iterates through each object. For every object, it fills its backdrop (area covered by the object and its border) with '3' using `fill(O, 3, backdrop(obj))`.  Then, it overwrites the object's original cells using `toindices(obj)` to leave only the border.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  shifted_grid = shift(asobject(I), (1,1)) # Shift the entire grid by (1,1)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(obj, (1, 1))))  # Paint shifted objects with '3'
  O = cellwise(O, I, 3) # Prioritize original grid values, otherwise fill with 3
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Grid & Identify Objects:** Shifts the entire grid and then identifies objects on the original grid.
2. **Paint Shifted Objects:**  Paints the shifted versions of identified objects onto the original grid using the color '3'. This effectively draws a border. 
3. **Cellwise Merging:** Uses `cellwise` to combine the original grid with the painted borders.  It prioritizes the original grid's color unless it encounters a '3' from the border painting.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  border_cells = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for cell in obj:
      neighbors_set = neighbors(cell[1]) & asindices(I) # Find valid neighbor indices within the grid
      for neighbor in neighbors_set:
        if (grid[neighbor[0]][neighbor[1]] != cell[0]):
          border_cells.add(((3, neighbor))) # If neighbor has different color, add to border
  O = paint(I, frozenset(border_cells)) # Paint identified border cells
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Same as previous versions.
2. **Iterate and Check Neighbors:** Iterates through each cell of each object. For every cell, it examines its neighboring cells. If a neighbor has a different color than the current cell, it's considered a border cell and added to the `border_cells` set.
3. **Paint Border Cells:**  Finally, it paints the identified border cells onto the input grid.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
    border_cells = set()
    for obj in objs:
        for i, j in toindices(obj):
            for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]: # Directions to check neighbors
                ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                if (0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and
                        (ni, nj) not in toindices(obj)):
                    border_cells.add((3, (ni, nj)))
    return paint(I, frozenset(border_cells)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Iterate and Check Neighbors (Directional):** Similar to Version 4, it iterates through each cell of each object. However, it explicitly checks neighbors in four directions (up, down, left, right) using a list of direction tuples.
3. **Validate and Add Border:** For each neighbor, it verifies if it falls within the grid boundaries and if it belongs to the current object. If not, it's a border cell and added to `border_cells`.
4. **Paint Border Cells:**  Same as Version 4.


These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
