## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The program should identify each cell with value 2. Then, it should paint a horizontal line of 3s to the right of each 2, extending to the edge of the object containing the 2. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:** This transformation is similar to the previous one, but the line of 3s starts one cell to the right and one cell up from each 2. 


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      O = paint(O, {(value, (i, j))})
      if value == 2:
        obj = first(objects(crop(I, (i,0), (1,w)), True, False, True))
        obj_width = width(obj) 
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j + 1, min(j + obj_width, w)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create a blank canvas (`O`) with the same dimensions as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate and Paint Original Values:**  Iterate through each cell of the input grid. For each cell, paint the corresponding cell in the output grid with the original value.
3. **Identify 2s and Objects:** If a cell's value is 2, identify the object it belongs to using `objects` function on a row slice of the input grid.
4. **Calculate Object Width:**  Determine the width of the object using the `width` function.
5. **Paint the Line:** Paint a horizontal line of 3s starting from the cell to the right of the current cell and extending to the right edge of the object.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 2:
        obj_width = width(extract(objects(crop(I, (i,0), (1,w)), True, False, True), lambda obj: (i,j) in toindices(obj)))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j + 1, min(j + obj_width, w)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to version 1 but instead of iterating through all objects in a row, it directly extracts the object containing the current cell with value 2 using the `extract` function and then calculates the object width.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      for i, j in toindices(obj):
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j + 1, rightmost(obj) + 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** Directly iterate through each object in the input grid using the `objects` function.
2. **Check for Color 2:** If the object's color is 2, proceed.
3. **Paint Line for Each Cell:** For each cell in the object, paint a horizontal line of 3s from the cell to the right of the current cell to the rightmost edge of the object.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 2:
        obj_end = next((k for k in range(j + 1, len(row)) if I[i][k] != 2), len(row))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j + 1, obj_end))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version simplifies the process by directly finding the end of the object within the row, avoiding the need for separate object extraction and width calculation. 

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    j = 0
    while j < w:
      value = row[j]
      O = paint(O, {(value, (i, j))})
      if value == 2:
        obj_end = next((k for k in range(j + 1, w) if I[i][k] != 2), w)
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j + 1, obj_end))))
        j = obj_end 
      else:
        j += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version further optimizes the iteration process by jumping directly to the end of an object when encountering a 2, avoiding unnecessary checks for cells within the object already painted with 3s.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, using various DSL functions and logic. Each version offers a distinct approach to solving the problem.
