## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The program identifies all objects with the color '2'. Then, it finds the "outer border" of these objects. The outer border consists of cells that are directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to the object and are not part of the object itself. Finally, it fills these border cells with the color '3'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  The transformation follows the same logic as in the previous example. It identifies objects with color '2', finds their outer borders (cells directly adjacent but not part of the object), and fills these border cells with color '3'.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

### Program Version 1: 
**Code:**
```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=True, without_bg=True)
  target_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  border_cells = mapply(
      lambda obj: frozenset(
          add(cell, direction) 
          for cell in toindices(obj) 
          for direction in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT] 
          if add(cell, direction) in asindices(I) and index(I, add(cell, direction)) != 2
      ),
      target_objs
  )
  O = fill(I, 3, merge(border_cells))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify target objects:** `objects`, `sfilter`, and `color` are used to select objects with color '2'.
2. **Find border cells:** For each target object, `mapply` iterates over its cells and checks adjacent cells (using `add` and direction vectors). If the adjacent cell is within the grid (`asindices(I)`) and does not belong to the object (color is not '2'), it's added to the `border_cells` set.
3. **Fill border cells:**  Finally, `fill` is used to color the `border_cells` with the value '3'.

### Program Version 2:
**Code:**
```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=True, without_bg=True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      for cell in toindices(obj):
        for n in dneighbors(cell):
          if n in asindices(I) and index(I, n) != 2:
            O = fill(O, 3, {n})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** This version iterates through all objects and processes those with color '2'.
2. **Iterate through cells and neighbors:** For each cell in a target object, it iterates through its direct neighbors.
3. **Fill border cells:** If a neighbor is within the grid and doesn't belong to the object, it's filled with '3'. This approach directly modifies the grid `O` in each iteration.

### Program Version 3:
**Code:**
```python
def program_v3(I):
    border_cells = frozenset()
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] == 2:
                for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] != 2:
                        border_cells = border_cells | {(ni, nj)}
    return fill(I, 3, border_cells)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Grid Iteration:** This version iterates directly through the grid cells using nested loops.
2. **Neighbor Check:**  For every cell with value '2', it checks its four direct neighbors. 
3. **Border Cell Collection:**  If a neighbor is within the grid bounds and doesn't have the value '2', its coordinates are added to the `border_cells` set.
4. **Fill Border Cells:** Finally, it uses the `fill` function to fill all identified `border_cells` with the value '3'.

### Program Version 4:
**Code:**
```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=True, without_bg=True)
  border_indices = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2 and any(index(I, n) != 2 for n in  dneighbors(centerofmass(obj))))
  O = fill(I, 3, toindices(merge(border_indices)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Objects:**  Similar to other versions, it first identifies objects with color '2' using `objects`, `mfilter`, and `color`.
2. **Filter for Border Objects:** It then uses `mfilter` with a lambda function to filter for objects where at least one direct neighbor of the object's center of mass has a value different from '2'. This effectively identifies objects on the border.
3. **Fill Border Cells:** Finally, it fills all cells belonging to these border objects with the value '3' using `fill`, `toindices`, and `merge`.

### Program Version 5:
**Code:**
```python
def program_v5(I):
  def check_neighbor(cell):
    for n in dneighbors(cell):
      if n in asindices(I) and index(I, n) != 2:
        return True
    return False
  
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=True, without_bg=True)
  border_cells = frozenset(
      cell
      for obj in objs
      if color(obj) == 2
      for cell in toindices(obj)
      if check_neighbor(cell)
  )
  O = fill(I, 3, border_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`check_neighbor` Function:** A helper function `check_neighbor` is defined to determine if a cell has a non-'2' neighbor within the grid.
2. **Target Object and Cell Iteration:**  It iterates through all objects and, for those with color '2', it further iterates through their individual cells.
3. **Border Cell Identification:** For each cell of a target object, it calls `check_neighbor`. If the function returns `True`, indicating the cell has a non-'2' neighbor, the cell's coordinates are added to the `border_cells` set.
4. **Fill Border Cells:** Finally, it uses the `fill` function to fill the identified `border_cells` with the value '3'. 

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, leveraging various DSL functions and logic structures. Each version highlights the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
