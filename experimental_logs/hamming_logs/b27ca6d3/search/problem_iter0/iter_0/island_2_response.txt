## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same color) in the input grid and drawing a rectangular frame around them using a new color (3). The original colors within the frame remain unchanged.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:**  A single '2' object exists in various locations. In the output, a 3x3 frame surrounds each '2' object.
* **Input_1:** Multiple '2' objects exist, some adjacent. Each object in the output is independently framed by '3's.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:** (Inspired by object identification and canvas creation)

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    ul = ulcorner(obj)
    lr = lrcorner(obj)
    for i in range(ul[0]-1, lr[0]+2):
      for j in range(ul[1]-1, lr[1]+2):
        if 0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0]):
          if (i,j) not in toindices(obj):
            O = fill(O, 3, {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all objects (connected regions of the same color).
2. **Iterate and Frame:** The code iterates through each object.
3. **Find Corners:** `ulcorner(obj)` and `lrcorner(obj)` find the upper-left and lower-right corners of the object's bounding box.
4. **Draw Frame:** It iterates around the object's bounding box, filling cells with '3' if they are not part of the object itself.

**Version 2:** (Leveraging 'box' function for conciseness)

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    frame = box(shift(obj, (1,1)))
    O = fill(O, 3, frame)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Calculate Frame:**  `box(shift(obj, (1,1)))` calculates the indices of the frame directly by finding the box of a slightly shifted object.
3. **Draw Frame:**  Fills the frame indices with '3'.

**Version 3:** (Using 'underfill' to simplify frame drawing)

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = underfill(O, 3, backdrop(shift(obj,(1,1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Calculate Frame Backdrop:**  `backdrop(shift(obj,(1,1)))` gets indices covering the frame area.
3. **Draw Frame:** `underfill` fills '3' only in the frame backdrop if the cell is background color.

**Version 4:** (Combining object iteration and frame drawing)

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if index(I,(i,j)) != mostcolor(I): 
        O = underfill(O, 3, backdrop({(i+1,j+1)})) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:**  Iterates through each cell, checking if it's not the background color.
2. **Draw Frame:** If not background, it directly draws a frame around the cell using `underfill` and `backdrop`.

**Version 5:** (Leveraging set operations for frame calculation)

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  frame_indices = set()
  for obj in objs:
    frame_indices = frame_indices | backdrop(shift(obj,(1,1)))
  O = fill(I, 3, frame_indices - toindices(merge(objs)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Gather Frame Indices:**  Iterates through objects, gathering all indices covered by their frames.
3. **Remove Object Indices:** Subtracts the indices of all objects from the gathered frame indices.
4. **Draw Frame:** Fills the remaining indices (representing the frame) with '3'.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL. Each version utilizes distinct function combinations and logic flow, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL.
