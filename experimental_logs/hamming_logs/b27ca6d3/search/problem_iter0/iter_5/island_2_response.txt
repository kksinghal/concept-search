## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**  The transformation identifies each object (connected groups of the same digit excluding the background color 0) in the input grid. Then, it draws a 3-pixel wide frame around each object. The frame overlaps with the object itself but not with other frames or the background.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** This transformation follows the same logic as the first one. It identifies objects (groups of the same digit), draws a 3-pixel wide frame around each, and ensures no overlap between frames or with the background.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  frame_indices = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for direction in ((-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)):
      frame_indices = frame_indices | toindices(shift(obj, direction))
  O = fill(I, 3, frame_indices - toindices(merge(objs)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This program first identifies all objects in the input grid. Then, it iterates over each object and expands its indices in four directions (up, down, left, right) by 1 pixel. These expanded indices represent the frame. Finally, it fills these frame indices with the value 3, excluding any overlap with existing objects.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  frame_indices = mapply(lambda obj: mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj)), objs)
  O = fill(I, 3, frame_indices - toindices(merge(objs)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version utilizes nested `mapply` calls for a more concise approach. It first extracts all object indices and applies the `dneighbors` function to each, effectively creating the frame indices. Finally, it fills the frame indices with 3 while excluding the original object indices.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    for d in range(1, 4):
      for direction in ((-d, 0), (d, 0), (0, -d), (0, d)):
        O = underfill(O, 3, toindices(shift(obj, direction)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version iterates through each object and progressively fills the surrounding pixels with value 3 using `underfill`. It ensures a 3-pixel wide frame by iterating with `d` from 1 to 3 (representing frame thickness). The `underfill` function ensures no overlap with existing objects. 

**Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    O = paint(fill(O, 3, box(obj)), obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version leverages the `box` function to directly obtain the frame indices for each object. It first fills the entire bounding box of the object with value 3. Then, it repaints the original object on top, ensuring the final output has a frame around the object.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    O = fill(O, 3, delta(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version uses the `delta` function, which directly provides the indices within the bounding box of an object, excluding the object's indices. This allows a very concise solution: for each object, it fills its delta (the frame area) with the value 3.
