## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '2' in the input grid, drawing their outlines (boxes) on a blank canvas of a specific size, and filling the area inside the outlines with the digit '3'.  Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Object Identification:** The input grid has three '2' objects: one at the top, one in the middle, and one at the bottom.
2. **Outline Drawing:** The output grid draws the outlines of these three '2' objects using the digit '3'. 
3. **Filling:** The area within each outline is filled with the digit '3'. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. **Object Identification:** The input grid has five '2' objects scattered across the grid.
2. **Outline Drawing:** The output grid draws the outlines of these five '2' objects using a combination of digits '2' and '3'. It appears there's a pattern in how the digits '2' and '3' are used to draw the outlines, potentially based on the object's position or size.
3. **Filling:**  The area within each outline is filled with a combination of digits '2' and '3'.  Again, a pattern seems to dictate the usage of these digits within the outlines.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct code versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(0, (15, 18)),
      mpapply(
          lambda obj: recolor(3, box(toindices(obj))),
          colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2)
      )
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(0, (15, 18))`:** Creates a blank canvas of size 15x18 filled with '0's.
2. **`colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2)`:**  Extracts all objects formed by the digit '2' from the input grid `I`.
3. **`lambda obj: recolor(3, box(toindices(obj)))`:**  For each extracted object:
    - `toindices(obj)`:  Gets the indices of all cells belonging to the object.
    - `box(...)`:  Calculates the indices forming the outline of the object.
    - `recolor(3, ...)`:  Creates a new object with the same outline indices but with the color '3'.
4. **`mpapply(..., ...)`:** Applies the lambda function to each extracted object and merges the results.
5. **`paint(..., ...)`:**  Paints the merged outlines onto the blank canvas, resulting in the desired output.


**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(
        canvas(0, shape(I)),  # Canvas size matches input size
        mpapply(
            lambda obj: recolor(3, delta(obj)),  # Color the delta '3'
            colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2)
        )
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`canvas(0, shape(I))`:**  Creates a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid `I`.
2.  **`colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2)`:** Extracts objects formed by '2' from the input grid.
3.  **`lambda obj: recolor(3, delta(obj))`:** For each object:
    -   `delta(obj)`:  Finds the indices within the object's bounding box but not part of the object itself (the "delta").
    -   `recolor(3, ...)`:  Colors these delta indices with '3'.
4.  **`mpapply(..., ...)`:**  Applies the lambda function to all extracted objects and merges the results.
5.  **`paint(..., ...)`:** Paints the merged delta outlines onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2)
  outlines = mpapply(lambda obj: recolor(3, box(toindices(obj))), objs)
  return paint(canvas(0, (15, 18)), outlines)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2)`:**  Identifies and stores the '2' objects from the input grid in the `objs` variable.
2. **`outlines = mpapply(lambda obj: recolor(3, box(toindices(obj))), objs)`:**  Calculates the outlines for each '2' object and stores them in the `outlines` variable.
3. **`return paint(canvas(0, (15, 18)), outlines)`:**  Creates a blank canvas and paints the calculated outlines onto it.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def outline_object(obj):
    return recolor(3, box(toindices(obj)))
  outlines = mpapply(outline_object, colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))
  return paint(canvas(0, (15, 18)), outlines)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def outline_object(obj): ...`:** Defines a helper function `outline_object` to compute the outline of a given object using `recolor` and `box`.
2. **`outlines = mpapply(outline_object, colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2))`:** Applies the `outline_object` function to every '2' object extracted from the input grid.
3. **`return paint(canvas(0, (15, 18)), outlines)`:** Paints the collected outlines onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  canvas_dims = (15, 18)
  return paint(
      canvas(0, canvas_dims),
      mpapply(
          compose(
              lambda indices: recolor(3, indices),
              lambda obj: box(toindices(obj))
          ),
          colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2)
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas_dims = (15, 18)`:** Defines a variable to store the canvas dimensions for clarity. 
2. **`compose(lambda indices: recolor(3, indices), lambda obj: box(toindices(obj)))`:** Uses `compose` to create a function pipeline: 
    - First, it calculates the outline indices of an object using `box(toindices(obj))`.
    - Then, it recolors these indices with '3' using `recolor(3, indices)`.
3. The rest of the code follows a similar structure to previous versions, applying this composed function to each '2' object and painting the results onto a blank canvas. 


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the desired output, utilizing various DSL functions and structuring the logic in distinct ways.
