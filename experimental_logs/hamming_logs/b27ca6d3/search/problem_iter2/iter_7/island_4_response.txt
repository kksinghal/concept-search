## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation involves two main steps:
1. **Upscaling:** The input grid is upscaled by a factor of 2, meaning each cell in the input grid is replaced by a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid.
2. **Conditional Filling:** For every '2' in the upscaled grid, a horizontal line of '3's is drawn to the right, extending until it encounters another non-zero value or the grid border.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** This transformation also consists of upscaling and conditional filling, but with different rules:
1. **Upscaling:**  Similar to the first transformation, the input grid is upscaled by a factor of 2.
2. **Conditional Filling:** This time, for each '2' in the upscaled grid, two lines of '3's are drawn:
   - **Diagonal Line:**  A diagonal line of '3's is drawn towards the bottom-right, extending until it encounters another non-zero value or the grid border.
   - **Horizontal Line:** A horizontal line of '3's is drawn to the right, starting one cell to the right of the diagonal line's starting point and extending until it encounters another non-zero value or the grid border.



## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, 2)
  for i, row in enumerate(O):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v == 2:
        k = j + 1
        while k < len(row) and row[k] == 0:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, k)})
          k += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:**  The code first uses the `upscale` function to double the dimensions of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterating & Filling:** It then iterates through each cell of the upscaled grid `O`.  
3. **Horizontal Line:** If a cell contains '2', it enters a loop that fills cells to the right with '3' until a non-zero value or the grid border is encountered.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, 2)
  for (i, j) in ofcolor(O, 2):
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, connect((i, j + 1), (i, len(O[0]) - 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:** Similar to version 1, the input grid is upscaled using the `upscale` function.
2. **Finding '2's:** The code identifies the indices of all cells containing '2' in the upscaled grid using `ofcolor`.
3. **Drawing Lines:** For each '2', it draws a horizontal line of '3's starting from the cell to the right of the '2' and extending to the edge of the grid using `connect` and `recolor`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, 2)
  for obj in objects(O, True, False, False):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      i, j = ulcorner(obj)
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, connect((i, j + 2), (i, len(O[0]) - 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:**  Upscales the input grid `I` using the `upscale` function.
2. **Object Identification:**  Identifies objects (connected components) in the upscaled grid `O` using `objects`.
3. **Conditional Line Drawing:** For each object, it checks if its color is '2'. If so, it draws a horizontal line of '3's, similar to previous versions, but starting two cells to the right of the object's upper-left corner.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (len(I) * 2, len(I[0]) * 2))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      O = fill(O, v, {(2*i, 2*j), (2*i + 1, 2*j), (2*i, 2*j + 1), (2*i + 1, 2*j + 1)})
      if v == 2:
        for k in range(j + 2, len(O[0])):
          if O[2*i][k] == 0:
            O = fill(O, 3, {(2*i, k)})
          else:
            break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:**  Instead of directly upscaling, this version initializes an empty canvas `O` with double the dimensions of the input grid `I`.
2. **Upscaling & Filling:** It then iterates through the input grid and fills the corresponding 2x2 blocks in the canvas with the appropriate values.
3. **Conditional Line Drawing:** For cells containing '2', it draws a horizontal line of '3's, similar to version 1, but ensures the line doesn't overwrite existing non-zero values.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, 2)
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 2:
        k = 2 * j + 2
        while k < len(O[0]) and O[2 * i][k] == 0:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(2 * i, k)})
          k += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:** Similar to other versions, this version starts by upscaling the input grid using the `upscale` function.
2. **Iterating & Filling:** It iterates through the original input grid `I` to locate the '2's.
3. **Conditional Line Drawing:** For each '2' found, it calculates the starting point of the horizontal line in the upscaled grid and fills cells with '3' to the right, stopping at non-zero values or the grid border.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation, each leveraging different combinations of DSL functions.
