## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking the input grids to the output grids can be described as follows:

**For each object with color '2' in the input grid:**

1. **Identify the outer boundary (outbox) of the object.**
2. **Recolor the outer boundary cells to '3'.**
3. **Place the transformed object onto a larger canvas filled with '0'.** 

The size of the output canvas appears to be consistent across examples, suggesting a fixed output dimension might be used.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation, along with explanations:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(0, (15, 18)),  # Fixed canvas size
      mpapply(
          lambda obj: recolor(3, outbox(toindices(obj))), # Outbox recoloring
          colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2)  # Filter for color '2' objects
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2)`: This part extracts all objects with color '2' from the input grid `I`.
2.  `lambda obj: recolor(3, outbox(toindices(obj)))`: For each extracted object, this lambda function calculates its outer boundary (`outbox`) and recolors it to '3'.
3.  `mpapply`: Applies the lambda function to each object and merges the results.
4.  `paint(canvas(0, (15, 18)), ...)`: Finally, the transformed objects are painted onto a canvas of size (15, 18) filled with '0'.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    canvas(0, add(shape(I), (4, 4))), # Canvas size based on input shape with padding
    merge(
        apply(
            lambda obj: recolor(3, outbox(toindices(obj))),
            colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2)
        )
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

* Similar to Version 1, but instead of a fixed canvas size, it calculates the canvas dimensions based on the input grid's shape and adds padding of (4, 4).

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  transformed_objs = frozenset()  # Initialize an empty set
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      transformed_objs = transformed_objs.union(frozenset({recolor(3, outbox(toindices(obj)))}))
  return paint(canvas(0, (15, 18)), transformed_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

* Iterates through all objects in the input grid, applies the outbox and recolor transformation if the object's color is '2', and accumulates the transformed objects in a set before painting them on the canvas.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(
        canvas(0, (15, 18)),
        frozenset(
            recolor(3, outbox(toindices(obj)))
            for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if color(obj) == 2
        )
    )
```

**Explanation:**

* Uses a more compact set comprehension syntax to achieve the same result as Version 3.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(0, (15, 18)),
      mapply(
          lambda obj: recolor(3, outbox(toindices(obj))),
          sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)  
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

* Instead of using `colorfilter` directly, it uses `sfilter` with a lambda function to filter for objects with color '2' and then applies the `mapply` function for transformation and merging.

These five versions demonstrate diverse ways to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL functions. Each version leverages different function combinations and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
