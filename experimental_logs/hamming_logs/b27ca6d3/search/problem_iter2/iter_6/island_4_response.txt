## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves these steps:

1. **Upscaling:** The input grid is upscaled by a factor of 2.
2. **Horizontal Connection:** For each row, consecutive occurrences of the digit '2' in the input grid are connected in the output grid. This connection is represented by filling the corresponding cells in the upscaled grid with the digit '3'.
3. **Edge Extension:** If a '2' occurs at the end of a row in the input grid, the connection extends to the edge of the corresponding row in the output grid. 


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, 2)
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 2:
        try:
          next_two = next(k for k in range(j + 1, len(row)) if row[k] == 2)
          O = fill(O, 3, {(2 * i, l) for l in range(2 * j, 2 * next_two)})
        except StopIteration:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(2 * i, l) for l in range(2 * j, len(O[0]))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly implements the transformation logic. 

* It first upscales the input grid `I` by 2 using the `upscale` function. 
* Then, it iterates over each cell in the input grid. 
* If a cell contains the digit '2', it searches for the next occurrence of '2' in the same row.
    * If found, it fills the corresponding cells in the upscaled grid `O` with '3' using the `fill` function.
    * If not found, it fills the cells from the current position to the edge of the row in `O` with '3'.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, 2)
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    indices = [j for j, val in enumerate(row) if val == 2]
    for k in range(len(indices) - 1):
      start, end = indices[k], indices[k+1]
      O = fill(O, 3, {(2 * i, l) for l in range(2 * start, 2 * end)})
    if indices:
      O = fill(O, 3, {(2 * i, l) for l in range(2 * indices[-1], len(O[0]))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version first identifies all the indices of '2' in each row and stores them in a list `indices`. 

* It then iterates over this list, connecting consecutive indices by filling the corresponding cells in the upscaled grid `O` with '3'. 
* Finally, it handles the edge case by extending the connection to the edge if the last index in `indices` is less than the width of the upscaled grid.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, 2)
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    start = None
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 2:
        if start is None:
          start = j
        else:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(2 * i, l) for l in range(2 * start, 2 * j)})
          start = j
    if start is not None:
      O = fill(O, 3, {(2 * i, l) for l in range(2 * start, len(O[0]))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates over each row and uses a variable `start` to keep track of the starting index of a connection. 

* When it encounters a '2', it checks if `start` is set.
    * If `start` is None, it means this is the start of a new connection, so it sets `start` to the current index.
    * If `start` is already set, it means this is the end of a connection, so it fills the cells between `start` and the current index with '3' and updates `start` to the current index. 
* Finally, it handles the edge case similar to previous versions.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, 2)
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    connected = False
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 2:
        connected = True
        O = fill(O, 3, {(2 * i, 2 * j), (2 * i, 2 * j + 1)})
      else:
        connected = False
    if connected:
      O = fill(O, 3, {(2 * i, l) for l in range(2 * len(row) - 2, len(O[0]))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates over each cell and maintains a `connected` flag. 

* If it finds a '2', it sets `connected` to True and fills the corresponding two cells in the upscaled grid with '3'.
* If it encounters a value other than '2', it resets `connected` to False.
* After processing each row, if `connected` is still True, it means the connection needs to extend to the edge, so it fills the remaining cells in the row with '3'.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, 2)
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j in range(len(row) - 1):
      if row[j] == 2 and row[j + 1] == 2:
        O = fill(O, 3, {(2 * i, 2 * j), (2 * i, 2 * j + 1), (2 * i, 2 * j + 2), (2 * i, 2 * j + 3)})
    if row and row[-1] == 2:
      O = fill(O, 3, {(2 * i, l) for l in range(2 * (len(row) - 1), len(O[0]))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly checks for consecutive '2's in each row. 

* If it finds two consecutive '2's, it fills the corresponding four cells in the upscaled grid with '3'. 
* It handles the edge case separately by checking if the last element of the row is '2' and filling the remaining cells accordingly. 

These are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code that accomplish the desired transformation. Each version leverages different logic or DSL function combinations, making them diverse solutions to the problem.
