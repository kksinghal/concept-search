## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects made of the digit '2' in the input grid and drawing a specific pattern around them in the output grid. The pattern is a kind of frame with the following characteristics:

* **Expansion:** The output grid is wider than the input grid by 8 columns.
* **Shifting:** The '2' objects are shifted to the right by a certain amount. 
* **Frame:** A frame of '3's is drawn around each shifted '2' object. 
* **Specific Gaps:** The frame has specific gaps where '3's are not drawn. These gaps seem intentional to the pattern.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(0, (height(I), width(I) + 8)) # Expand width
  for obj in colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2):
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 13))) # Shift '2' objects right by 13
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      for di in range(-1, 2):
        for dj in range(1, 4):
          if (di != 0 or dj != 1) and (di != 0 or dj != 2): # Specific gaps in the frame
            O = fill(O, 3, {(i + di, j + dj + 13)}) # Draw the frame with '3's
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Create an output grid `O` with the same height as input `I` but wider by 8 columns.
2. **Iterate through '2' Objects:** Find all objects made of '2' in the input.
3. **Shift and Paint:** Shift each object 13 columns to the right and paint it on the output grid.
4. **Draw the Frame:** For each cell in the object, draw a frame of '3's around it. The conditional statement `(di != 0 or dj != 1) and (di != 0 or dj != 2)` ensures specific gaps in the frame as required by the pattern.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(0, add(shape(I), (0, 8))) # Using 'add' for expansion
  for obj in colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2):
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, width(I) + 3))) # Shift by input width + 3
    box_indices = difference(outbox(shift(obj, (0, width(I) + 3))),
                            shift(obj, (0, width(I) + 3))) # Calculate outbox and remove object
    O = fill(O, 3, box_indices) # Fill the frame using 'outbox'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and Shift:** Similar to version 1, but using `add` function for calculating the output grid dimensions and shifting the object by `width(I) + 3` to the right.
2. **Outbox for Frame:** Calculate the indices for the frame using the `outbox` function and remove the object itself from those indices.
3. **Fill Frame:** Fill the calculated indices with '3' to draw the frame.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(0, (height(I), width(I) + 8))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 13)))
      shifted_obj = shift(obj, (0, 13))
      for index in backdrop(shifted_obj):
        if index not in shifted_obj and abs(index[0] - centerofmass(shifted_obj)[0]) <= 1: # Conditional frame drawing
          O = fill(O, 3, {index})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and Shift:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Iterate and Check Color:** Iterate through all objects and draw the frame only if the object's color is '2'.
3. **Backdrop and Center of Mass:** Use `backdrop` to get indices around the object. Use `centerofmass` and a conditional to draw the frame selectively, leaving specific gaps.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(0, (height(I), width(I) + 8))
  for obj in colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2):
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 13)))
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      for (di, dj) in {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (0, 3), (-1, 1), (-1, 2), (-1, 3)}: # Hardcoded frame indices
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i + di, j + dj + 13)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and Shift:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Hardcoded Frame Indices:** This version directly hardcodes the relative indices for the frame around each object cell, offering a simple but less flexible approach.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(0, (height(I), width(I) + 8))
  for obj in colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2):
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 13)))
    upper_part = {(i, j) for (i, j) in delta(shift(obj, (0, 13))) if i < centerofmass(obj)[0]} # Calculate upper frame indices
    lower_part = {(i, j) for (i, j) in delta(shift(obj, (0, 13))) if i > centerofmass(obj)[0]} # Calculate lower frame indices
    O = fill(O, 3, upper_part)
    O = fill(O, 3, lower_part)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and Shift:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Delta and Center of Mass:**  Use `delta` to get the bounding box indices excluding the object itself.  Then use `centerofmass` to separate the frame indices into upper and lower parts, creating the desired gaps in the process. 


These five versions showcase different ways to achieve the same visual transformation using various functions and logic within the provided DSL. Each version attempts to represent the pattern generation in a distinct manner.
