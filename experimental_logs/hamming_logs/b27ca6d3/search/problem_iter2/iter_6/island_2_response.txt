## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of color '2' in the input grid and drawing a border around them using the color '3'. The border extends one cell outwards in all directions, including diagonals, effectively creating an "outbox" around each object.  The output grid is larger than the input grid, suggesting padding is added around the original grid before drawing the border. 

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. Objects of color '2' are identified.
2. An "outbox" border of color '3' is drawn around each object.
3. The output grid is padded to accommodate the border without overlapping with the original objects.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

The same transformation logic applies to Input_1. The only difference is the shape and position of the objects, leading to a different border placement on the output grid.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, along with explanations:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(0, add(shape(I), (4, 4))),  # Create a canvas with padding
      mpapply(
          lambda obj: recolor(3, outbox(toindices(obj))), # Get outbox and recolor
          colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2)  # Filter for objects with color 2
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(0, add(shape(I), (4, 4)))`**: Creates a canvas filled with '0's. The dimensions are calculated by adding (4, 4) to the original grid's shape to create padding. 
2. **`colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2)`**: Extracts objects from the input grid ('I') that are of color '2'.
3. **`lambda obj: recolor(3, outbox(toindices(obj)))`**: For each extracted object, this lambda function:
    -  Calculates the "outbox" indices using `outbox(toindices(obj))`.
    - Recolors the "outbox" indices to '3' using `recolor(3, ...)`.
4. **`mpapply(...)`**: Applies the lambda function to each object and merges the results.
5. **`paint(...)`**:  Paints the re-colored outboxes onto the initially created canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  padded_grid = canvas(0, add(shape(I), (4, 4)))
  return paint(
      padded_grid,
      merge(
          apply(
              lambda obj: recolor(3, outbox(toindices(obj))),
              colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2)
          )
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version achieves the same outcome as Version 1 but structures the code differently for clarity. It first creates the padded canvas and then separately applies the outbox and recoloring logic before painting onto the canvas.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(0, (len(I) + 4, len(I[0]) + 4)),  # Canvas with padding
      merge([recolor(3, outbox(toindices(obj))) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if color(obj) == 2])
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses list comprehension to iterate through objects and recolor the outboxes, offering a more compact syntax than previous versions.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2)  # Get objects of color 2
  border = merge(apply(lambda obj: outbox(obj), objs)) # Get all outboxes
  return paint(canvas(0, add(shape(I), (4, 4))), recolor(3, border)) # Paint re-colored borders
```

**Explanation:**

This version first identifies the target objects and calculates their outboxes. Then, it merges all outboxes into a single set of indices and paints them onto the padded canvas.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    canvas(0, (height(I) + 4, width(I) + 4)), # Create padded canvas
    merge([recolor(3, delta(obj) | box(obj)) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if color(obj) == 2])
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses the `delta` function to get the cells immediately surrounding the objects and then combines them with the `box` of the object to create the outer border. This approach directly targets the border cells instead of relying on the `outbox` function.

## Code Extraction:

You can easily copy and paste the code for each program version from the "Code" sections above. These versions provide different ways to achieve the same transformation, allowing you to experiment and choose the most suitable one for your needs.
