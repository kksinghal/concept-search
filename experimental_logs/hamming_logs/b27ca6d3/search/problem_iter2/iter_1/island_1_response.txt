## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves these steps:

1. **Upscaling:** The input grid is upscaled by a factor of 2, effectively doubling the size of the grid.
2. **Color Filling:** A new color (3 in the provided examples) is used to fill a specific pattern around the upscaled objects from the original grid.  
    * The pattern appears to be a kind of "border" around the upscaled objects, but not a simple bordering box.
    * The exact pattern of the color filling needs further analysis to be precisely defined.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0, Output_0:** The two '2' digits in the top-left corner are upscaled and surrounded by '3's. Similarly, other '2's are upscaled and have '3' borders.
* **Input_1, Output_1:** The same pattern is applied. Each '2' from Input_1 is upscaled, and the '3' border is placed in the corresponding position in Output_1.

## Code Generation:

Since I don't have access to the two unprovided programs you mentioned, I'll provide five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" based on the provided programs and the transformation analysis.

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_dae9d2b5(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), multiply(shape(I), TWO))
    for obj in objects(I, univalued=T, diagonal=F, without_bg=T):
        upscaled_obj = shift(upscale(obj, TWO), (ONE, ONE))
        O = paint(O, upscaled_obj)
        for (v, (i, j)) in upscaled_obj:
            if i > 0 and j > 0 and i < len(O)-1 and j < len(O[0])-1:
                O = fill(O, THREE, {(i-1,j),(i+1,j),(i,j-1),(i,j+1)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Create an empty canvas `O` with the background color of the input and twice the dimensions.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterate over each object in the input grid `I`.
3. **Upscaling and Shifting:** Upscale each object by a factor of 2 and shift it by (1, 1).
4. **Painting:** Paint the upscaled object onto the canvas.
5. **Border Filling:**  Iterate over each cell of the upscaled object and fill its direct neighbors with color 3.
6. **Return Output:** Return the filled canvas `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_dae9d2b5(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), multiply(shape(I), TWO))
    for obj in objects(I, univalued=T, diagonal=F, without_bg=T):
        O = paint(O, shift(upscale(obj, TWO), (ONE, ONE)))
        O = underfill(O, THREE, shift(box(shift(upscale(toindices(obj), TWO), (ONE, ONE))), (-ONE, -ONE)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Object Iteration:** Similar to Version 1.
3. **Upscaling, Shifting, and Painting:**  Upscale and shift the object, then paint it onto the canvas.
4. **Border Filling:** Calculate the bounding box of the upscaled and shifted object, shift it by (-1, -1) to create an "outer box", and fill this outer box with color 3 only where the background color is present.
5. **Return Output:** Similar to Version 1.

**Program Version 3:** (Requires further analysis of the pattern)

```python
def solve_dae9d2b5(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), multiply(shape(I), TWO))
    for obj in objects(I, univalued=T, diagonal=F, without_bg=T):
        O = paint(O, shift(upscale(obj, TWO), (ONE, ONE)))
        # TODO: Define a function 'pattern_indices(obj)' that returns the indices to be filled with color 3 based on the object's shape and position.
        O = fill(O, THREE, pattern_indices(obj)) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Object Iteration:** Similar to previous versions.
3. **Upscaling, Shifting, and Painting:**  Similar to Version 2.
4. **Pattern-Based Filling:** A dedicated function `pattern_indices(obj)` would be defined to determine the exact indices to fill with color 3 based on the object's characteristics. This function needs to be implemented based on a thorough analysis of the desired pattern.
5. **Return Output:** Similar to previous versions.

**Program Versions 4 and 5:** 

(Would require seeing the unprovided programs and understanding their logic to propose meaningful improvements)


## Note:

The provided code versions are based on assumptions about the desired pattern for color filling. Further analysis of more input-output examples is needed to confirm the pattern and refine the code, especially for Version 3 and the potential versions 4 and 5.
