## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '2' (excluding background '0'). For each object, a bounding box is drawn around it using the digit '3'. The bounding box extends one cell beyond the object's outermost cells in all directions. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

This transformation is similar to the previous one. It identifies objects formed by the digit '2', excluding the background '0'. For each object, a bounding box is drawn using the digits '3' and '2' alternately. The bounding box again extends one cell beyond the object's outermost cells in all directions. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct programs that achieve the desired transformations:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve_239be575(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) 
  def modify_obj(obj):
    return recolor(3, outbox(toindices(obj))) if color(obj) == 2 else initset(0)
  bordered_objs = mfilter(objs, modify_obj)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), bordered_objs) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, T, F, T)`: Extracts all objects from the input grid `I`. Objects are formed by connected components of the same digit, excluding the background (digit '0' in this case).
2. `modify_obj(obj)`: This function checks the color of each object. If the color is '2', it calculates the outer box (`outbox`) of the object and recolors it to '3'. Otherwise, it returns an empty set.
3. `mfilter(objs, modify_obj)`: Applies the `modify_obj` function to each object and merges the results.
4. `paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), bordered_objs)`: Creates a canvas of the same size as the input grid, filled with '0', and then paints the modified objects (with bounding boxes) onto it.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve_239be575(I):
  def process_cell(i, j):
    obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: contained((i, j), toindices(o)))
    return 3 if color(obj) == 2 and contained((i, j), outbox(toindices(obj))) else 0
  h, w = shape(I)
  return tuple(tuple(process_cell(i, j) for j in range(w)) for i in range(h))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `process_cell(i, j)`: Defines a function that processes each cell at coordinates (i, j) of the grid.
2. `extract(...)`: Finds the object containing the current cell.
3. `color(obj) == 2 and contained((i, j), outbox(toindices(obj)))`: Checks if the object's color is '2' and if the current cell is part of its outer box.
4. `3 if ... else 0`:  Sets the cell value to '3' if the condition is met, otherwise '0'. 
5. `tuple(tuple(...) for i in range(h)) for j in range(w))`:  Constructs the output grid by applying `process_cell` to each cell.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve_239be575(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  box_indices = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: outbox(toindices(obj)) if color(obj) == 2 else initset(0))
  output_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))
  return fill(output_grid, 3, box_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, T, F, T)`:  Extracts all objects from the input grid.
2. `box_indices = mfilter(...)`:  Collects the indices of the bounding boxes for objects with color '2'.
3. `output_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))`: Creates an empty canvas of the same size as the input.
4. `fill(output_grid, 3, box_indices)`:  Fills the canvas with '3' at the indices defined by `box_indices`.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve_239be575(I):
    return paint(
        canvas(0, shape(I)), 
        mpapply(
            lambda obj: recolor(3, outbox(toindices(obj))), 
            colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2)
        )
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, T, F, T)`: Extracts all objects from the input grid.
2. `colorfilter(..., 2)`: Filters the objects, keeping only those with color '2'.
3. `mpapply(lambda obj: recolor(3, outbox(toindices(obj))), ...)`: Calculates the outer box for each object and recolors it to '3', then merges the results.
4. `paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), ...)`: Creates a canvas of the same size as the input grid filled with '0' and paints the modified objects onto it.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve_239be575(I):
  def process_object(obj):
    if color(obj) != 2:
      return initset(0)
    indices = toindices(obj)
    min_i, min_j = ulcorner(indices)
    max_i, max_j = lrcorner(indices)
    return frozenset((i, j) 
                      for i in range(max(0, min_i - 1), min(max_i + 2, len(I))) 
                      for j in range(max(0, min_j - 1), min(max_j + 2, len(I[0]))))
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), process_object)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. `process_object(obj)`:  Checks if the object's color is '2'. If not, it returns an empty set.
2. `indices = toindices(obj)`: Gets the indices of the object.
3. `min_i, min_j = ulcorner(indices)` and `max_i, max_j = lrcorner(indices)`: Calculates the bounding box corners of the object.
4. `frozenset((i, j) for ...)`: Generates the indices for the bounding box, ensuring it stays within the grid boundaries. 
5. `mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), process_object)`: Applies `process_object` to each object and merges the results.
6. `paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), ...)`: Creates a canvas and paints the modified objects. 

These five versions use distinct logic and DSL function combinations to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
