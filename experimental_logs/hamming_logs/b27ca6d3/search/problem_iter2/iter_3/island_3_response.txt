## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected components of the same color) in the input grid, then drawing a 3-cell thick outline around each object on an upscaled version of the input grid. The outline extends one cell beyond the object's boundaries on all sides except the bottom.

**Example:**

Input:

```
0 0 2
0 2 0
0 0 0
```

Output:

```
0 0 0 3 2 2 3 0 0 
0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
```


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" utilizing different DSL functions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = upscale(I, 2) # Upscale input grid
  x2 = objects(x1, T, F, F) # Find objects in the upscaled grid
  x3 = mapply(lambda o: difference(outbox(toindices(o)), {(lowermost(o) + 1, j) for j in range(leftmost(o) - 1, rightmost(o) + 2)}), x2) # Calculate outline indices
  O = paint(x1, recolor(THREE, x3)) # Paint the outline on the upscaled grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscale:** The input grid `I` is upscaled by a factor of 2 using `upscale(I, 2)`.
2. **Object Identification:** Objects in the upscaled grid `x1` are identified using `objects(x1, T, F, F)`. 
3. **Outline Calculation:**  For each object `o`, `outbox(toindices(o))` calculates the indices of its bounding box, and  `{(lowermost(o) + 1, j) for j in range(leftmost(o) - 1, rightmost(o) + 2)}` removes the bottom edge, creating the outline. 
4. **Painting:**  The outline indices `x3` are painted with the color `THREE` on the upscaled grid `x1` using `paint(x1, recolor(THREE, x3))`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = upscale(I, 2)
  x2 = objects(x1, T, F, F)
  x3 = mapply(lambda o: box(shift(toindices(o), (1, 1))), x2)
  x4 = mapply(lambda o: box(shift(toindices(o), (-1, -1))), x2)
  x5 = mapply(lambda o: box(toindices(o)), x2)
  O = paint(x1, recolor(THREE, difference(merge((x3, x4, x5)), toindices(merge(x2)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscale & Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Outline Layers:** This version creates the outline by merging three layers of boxes: 
    - `x3`:  Box shifted one cell down and right.
    - `x4`: Box shifted one cell up and left.
    - `x5`: Original box.
3. **Combine and Paint:** Merges the three layers (`x3`, `x4`, `x5`) and removes the original object's indices. The result is painted with `THREE` on the upscaled grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = upscale(I, 2)
  x2 = objects(x1, T, F, F)
  x3 = mapply(lambda o: {(i + 1, j) for i, j in toindices(o)} | {(i - 1, j) for i, j in toindices(o)} | {(i, j + 1) for i, j in toindices(o)} | {(i, j - 1) for i, j in toindices(o)}, x2)
  O = paint(x1, recolor(THREE, difference(x3, toindices(merge(x2)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscale & Objects:** Same as Version 1 and 2.
2. **Direct Outline:**  Calculates outline indices by directly finding all cells one step away from each object cell in all four directions.
3. **Paint:** Similar to Version 2, it removes the original object indices and paints the remaining outline with `THREE`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = upscale(I, 2)
  x2 = objects(x1, T, F, F)
  x3 = mapply(lambda o: delta(shift(backdrop(toindices(o)), (1, 1))), x2)
  x4 = mapply(lambda o: delta(shift(backdrop(toindices(o)), (-1, -1))), x2)
  O = paint(x1, recolor(THREE, merge((x3, x4, mapply(delta, x2)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscale & Objects:** As before.
2. **Outline Deltas:**  Calculates outline using `delta`, which finds indices inside the bounding box but outside the object:
    - `x3`:  Delta of the bounding box shifted down and right.
    - `x4`: Delta of the bounding box shifted up and left.
3. **Merge and Paint:** Merges the calculated deltas with the delta of the original object and paints with `THREE`.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = upscale(I, 2)
  x2 = objects(x1, T, F, F)
  x3 = mapply(lambda o: {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(o) - 1, lowermost(o) + 2) for j in range(leftmost(o) - 1, rightmost(o) + 2) if (i < uppermost(o) or i > lowermost(o) or j < leftmost(o) or j > rightmost(o)) and i != lowermost(o) + 1}, x2)
  O = paint(x1, recolor(THREE, x3))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscale & Objects:** Standard first steps.
2. **Iterative Outline:** This version iterates through a range of indices around each object, including those one cell outside the object's boundaries, excluding the bottom edge.
3. **Paint:**  Paints the identified outline indices `x3` with `THREE` on the upscaled grid.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the desired transformation using various DSL function combinations. Each version offers a unique perspective on manipulating and processing the grid and object data.
