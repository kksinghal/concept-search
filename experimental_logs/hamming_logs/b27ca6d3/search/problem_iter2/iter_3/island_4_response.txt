## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:** The transformation involves upscaling the grid by a factor of 2 and then selectively filling cells with the value '3'. The filling pattern suggests that for every cell with the value '2' in the original grid, a horizontal line of '3's is drawn to the right in the upscaled grid, extending up to the next occurrence of '2' or the grid border. 

**Input 1 to Output 1:**  Similar to the previous transformation, the grid is upscaled by a factor of 2. This time,  for each '2' in the original grid, a '3' border is created around the corresponding '2's in the upscaled grid. Additionally, horizontal lines of '3's extend from these bordered '2's towards the right, stopping at the next occurrence of '2' or the grid's edge.

## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, 2)
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 2:
        start_j = 2 * j 
        end_j = len(O[0])
        for k in range(j + 1, len(I[0])):
          if I[i][k] == 2:
            end_j = 2 * k 
            break
        fill_indices = {(2 * i, l) for l in range(start_j, end_j)}
        O = underfill(O, 3, fill_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:** The input grid `I` is upscaled by a factor of 2 using the `upscale` function.
2. **Iterating and Filling:** The code iterates through each cell of the original grid `I`. 
   - If a '2' is encountered, it calculates `start_j` (the starting column index in the upscaled grid) and `end_j` (the ending column index). `end_j` is determined by finding the next '2' in the same row or reaching the grid border.
   - A set `fill_indices` is created, representing all the cell indices between `start_j` and `end_j` in the corresponding row of the upscaled grid.
   -  `underfill` function fills these `fill_indices` in the upscaled grid `O` with the value '3'. 

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, 2)
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 2:
        next_two = next((k for k in range(j + 1, len(row)) if row[k] == 2), len(row))
        O = underfill(O, 3, {(2 * i, l) for l in range(2 * j, 2 * next_two)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:**  Same as version 1.
2. **Iteration and Filling:** This version iterates through the original grid using `enumerate` for more readable code. 
   - It uses `next` function to efficiently find the index (`next_two`) of the next '2' in the same row, defaulting to the row's end if no '2' is found.
   - The `underfill` logic remains similar, filling the horizontal line from the current '2' to the next.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, 2)
  two_indices = [(i, j) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0])) if I[i][j] == 2]
  for i, j in two_indices:
    right_twos = [(i, k) for k in range(j + 1, len(I[0])) if I[i][k] == 2]
    end_j = min(right_twos, key=lambda x: x[1], default=(i, len(I[0])))[1]
    O = underfill(O, 3, {(2 * i, l) for l in range(2 * j, 2 * end_j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:**  Same as versions 1 and 2.
2. **Pre-calculate '2' Indices:** This version first identifies all indices of '2's in the original grid and stores them in `two_indices`.
3. **Iterate and Fill:** It iterates through `two_indices`. 
   - For each '2', it finds the next '2' to the right (`right_twos`) and uses `min` to get the closest one based on the column index.
   -  It then fills the upscaled grid similarly to previous versions.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, 2)
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    j = 0
    while j < len(row):
      if row[j] == 2:
        try:
          next_two = next(k for k in range(j + 1, len(row)) if row[k] == 2)
          O = underfill(O, 3, {(2 * i, l) for l in range(2 * j, 2 * next_two)})
          j = next_two 
        except StopIteration:
          O = underfill(O, 3, {(2 * i, l) for l in range(2 * j, len(O[0]))})
          break 
      j += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **Upscaling:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Iterating with `while` and `try-except`:** This version uses a `while` loop to iterate through each row. 
   - A `try-except` block handles cases where a next '2' is not found (raising `StopIteration`). 
   - If a '2' is found, it fills the line up to the next '2' and updates `j`.
   - If no more '2's are found in the row, it fills the line to the end of the grid. 

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, 2)
  for i in range(len(I)):
    line_start = None
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 2:
        if line_start is not None:
          O = underfill(O, 3, {(2 * i, l) for l in range(2 * line_start, 2 * j)})
        line_start = j
    if line_start is not None:
      O = underfill(O, 3, {(2 * i, l) for l in range(2 * line_start, len(O[0]))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Iterating and Tracking Line Start:** This version focuses on tracking the starting point (`line_start`) of the horizontal '3' line. 
   -  If a '2' is encountered and `line_start` is not `None` (meaning a line is being drawn), it fills the line from the previous `line_start` to the current '2'. 
   -  It then updates `line_start` to the current '2's column index.
   -  After processing each row, it checks if a line was being drawn (`line_start` is not `None`) and fills the remaining part of the line to the grid border. 


These five versions provide distinct implementations using different looping constructs, search methods, and logic for determining the filling range, demonstrating diverse solutions within the DSL's constraints.
