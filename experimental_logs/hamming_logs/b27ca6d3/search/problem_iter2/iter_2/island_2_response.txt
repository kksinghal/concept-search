## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of a specific color (color 2) in the input grid and drawing their "outboxes" in a new grid with a different color (color 3). The outbox of an object is defined as the perimeter of the smallest rectangle that encloses the object, expanded outward by one cell in all directions.

**Example:**

Input Grid:

```
0 0 0 0
0 2 2 0
0 2 0 0
0 0 0 0
```

Output Grid:

```
0 0 0 0
0 3 3 3 0
0 3 2 3 0
0 3 3 3 0
0 0 0 0
```


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(0, add(shape(I), (2, 4))), 
      mpapply(
          lambda obj: recolor(3, outbox(toindices(obj))), 
          colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2)
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`colorfilter(..., 2)`:** Filters the objects to keep only those with color 2.
3. **`mpapply(..., lambda obj: ...)`:**  Applies the lambda function to each object with color 2.
4. **`lambda obj: recolor(3, outbox(toindices(obj)))`:**  For each object, it calculates the indices of its outbox and recolors them to 3.
5. **`paint(canvas(0, add(shape(I), (2, 4))), ...)`:** Creates a canvas of zeros with dimensions two rows and four columns larger than the input grid and paints the recoloured outboxes onto it.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_object(obj):
    return recolor(3, outbox(toindices(obj))) if color(obj) == 2 else initset(0)
  return paint(canvas(0, add(shape(I), (2, 4))), mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), process_object)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`process_object(obj)`:** Defines a function that takes an object as input and returns its outbox recoloured to 3 if the object's color is 2, otherwise returns an empty set.
2. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the input grid.
3. **`mfilter(..., process_object)`:** Applies the `process_object` function to each object and merges the results.
4. **`paint(canvas(0, add(shape(I), (2, 4))), ...)`:** Creates a canvas of zeros with dimensions two rows and four columns larger than the input grid and paints the merged outboxes onto it. 

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def draw_outbox(obj):
    return paint(canvas(0, add(shape(I), (2, 4))), recolor(3, outbox(toindices(obj))))
  return merge(apply(draw_outbox, colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`draw_outbox(obj)`:** Defines a function that draws the outbox of a given object with color 3 on a canvas of zeros with dimensions two rows and four columns larger than the input grid.
2. **`colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2)`:**  Extracts objects with color 2 from the input grid.
3. **`apply(draw_outbox, ...)`:** Applies the `draw_outbox` function to each object with color 2.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the resulting grids from applying the `draw_outbox` function, effectively drawing all outboxes on a single canvas. 

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    new_grid = canvas(0, add(shape(I), (2, 4)))
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        if color(obj) == 2:
            new_grid = paint(new_grid, recolor(3, outbox(toindices(obj))))
    return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`new_grid = canvas(0, add(shape(I), (2, 4)))`:** Creates a canvas of zeros with dimensions two rows and four columns larger than the input grid.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):`:** Iterates through all objects in the input grid.
3. **`if color(obj) == 2:`:**  Checks if the object's color is 2.
4. **`new_grid = paint(new_grid, recolor(3, outbox(toindices(obj))))`:** If the object's color is 2, it calculates the indices of its outbox, recolors them to 3, and paints them onto the `new_grid`.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_cell(i, j):
    obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: contained((i, j), toindices(o)))
    return 3 if color(obj) == 2 and contained((i, j), outbox(toindices(obj))) else 0
  h, w = shape(I)
  return tuple(tuple(process_cell(i, j) for j in range(w + 4)) for i in range(h + 2)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`process_cell(i, j)`:** Defines a function that checks if a given cell (i, j) belongs to the outbox of an object with color 2. 
2. **`extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: contained((i, j), toindices(o)))`:**  Finds the object containing the cell (i, j).
3. **`color(obj) == 2 and contained((i, j), outbox(toindices(obj)))`:**  Checks if the object's color is 2 and if the current cell belongs to its outbox.
4. **`return 3 if ... else 0`:** Returns 3 if the condition is met (part of the outbox of a color 2 object), otherwise 0.
5. **`tuple(tuple(process_cell(i, j) for j in range(w + 4)) for i in range(h + 2))`:**  Iterates through all cells of a grid with dimensions two rows and four columns larger than the input grid and applies the `process_cell` function, effectively constructing the output grid.
