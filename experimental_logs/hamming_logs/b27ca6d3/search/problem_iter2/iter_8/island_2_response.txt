## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of a specific color (color 2) in the input grid, then drawing a border around them with a different color (color 3) on a blank canvas of a fixed size (15x18). 

**Key Observations:**

- The transformation preserves the shape, size, and position of the original objects.
- Only the color of the border is changed, not the object itself.
- The background remains unchanged.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(0, (15, 18)), 
      mpapply(
          lambda obj: recolor(3, outbox(obj)), 
          colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2)
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid (`I`).
2. **`colorfilter(..., 2)`:** Filters the objects, keeping only those with color `2`.
3. **`lambda obj: recolor(3, outbox(obj))`:**  For each filtered object:
    - **`outbox(obj)`:**  Calculates the indices forming the outer border of the object.
    - **`recolor(3, ...)`:**  Creates a new object with color `3` at the border indices.
4. **`mpapply(..., ...)`:** Applies the lambda function to each filtered object and merges the results into a single set of objects.
5. **`paint(canvas(0, (15, 18)), ...)`:** Paints the merged border objects onto a blank canvas of size 15x18.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(0, (15, 18)),
      merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(3, outbox(obj)), colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2)))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version achieves the same result as version 1 but uses `apply` and `merge` instead of `mpapply` for clarity:

1. **`colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2)`:**  Same as in version 1.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: recolor(3, outbox(obj)), ...)`:** Applies the border-creating lambda function to each filtered object, resulting in a set of sets.
3. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the sets of border objects into a single set.
4. **`paint(canvas(0, (15, 18)), ...)`:** Same as in version 1.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bordered_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      bordered_objs = bordered_objs.union(frozenset({recolor(3, outbox(obj))}))
  return paint(canvas(0, (15, 18)), bordered_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses an explicit loop for clarity:

1. **`bordered_objs = frozenset()`:** Initializes an empty set for the bordered objects.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):`:** Iterates through all objects in the input grid.
3. **`if color(obj) == 2:`:**  Checks if the object's color is 2.
4. **`bordered_objs = bordered_objs.union(...)`:**  If the color is 2, calculates the border using `outbox`, recolors it to `3`, and adds it to the `bordered_objs` set.
5. **`return paint(canvas(0, (15, 18)), bordered_objs)`:** Paints the collected bordered objects onto a blank canvas.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(
        canvas(0, (15, 18)),
        frozenset({
            recolor(3, outbox(obj))
            for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if color(obj) == 2
        })
    )
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a set comprehension for conciseness:

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Extracts all objects from the input grid.
2. **`if color(obj) == 2`:**  Filters for objects with color `2`.
3. **`recolor(3, outbox(obj))`:** For each filtered object, creates a new object with color `3` at its outer border.
4. **`frozenset({...})`:** Collects the re-colored bordered objects into a frozenset.
5. **`paint(canvas(0, (15, 18)), ...)`:**  Paints the bordered objects onto a blank canvas.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(0, (15, 18)), 
      frozenset(
          recolor(3, outbox(obj)) 
          for obj in sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: color(o) == 2)
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version introduces `sfilter` for filtering:

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts all objects.
2. **`sfilter(..., lambda o: color(o) == 2)`:**  Filters the objects, keeping only those with color `2`.
3. The rest is similar to version 4, creating the border objects and painting them onto a blank canvas.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL. They highlight various ways to filter objects, apply transformations, and combine results, providing a comprehensive understanding of the problem and its solutions within the provided DSL.
