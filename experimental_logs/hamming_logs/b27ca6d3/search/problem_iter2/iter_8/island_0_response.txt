## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The transformation upscales the input grid by a factor of 3 (each cell becomes a 3x3 block).
* For each original '2' cell, the corresponding 3x3 block is filled with '3's except for the center cell which retains the value '2'.
* All other cells retain their original values.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* The transformation doesn't follow a simple scaling rule like in the previous example. 
* Each original '2' cell seems to spawn a unique object composed of '2's and '3's in the output grid.
* The position and shape of these spawned objects are not immediately clear from a single example. More input-output pairs might be needed to decipher the exact pattern.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, THREE)
  for i, j in asindices(I):
    if I[i][j] == TWO:
      O = fill(O, THREE, crop(O, (THREE * i, THREE * j), (THREE, THREE)))
      O = fill(O, TWO, {(THREE * i + ONE, THREE * j + ONE)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:** `O = upscale(I, THREE)` upscales the input grid `I` by a factor of 3.
2. **Iterating through original cells:** `for i, j in asindices(I)` iterates over the indices of the original input grid.
3. **Identifying '2' cells:** `if I[i][j] == TWO` checks if the cell at the current index in the original grid is '2'.
4. **Filling with '3's:**  `O = fill(O, THREE, crop(O, (THREE * i, THREE * j), (THREE, THREE)))` fills the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid with '3's.
5. **Restoring center to '2':** `O = fill(O, TWO, {(THREE * i + ONE, THREE * j + ONE)})` puts a '2' back in the center of the 3x3 block.
6. **Returning the output:** The function returns the transformed grid `O`.
