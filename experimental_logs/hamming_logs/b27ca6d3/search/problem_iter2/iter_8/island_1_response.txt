## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

1. **Upscaling:** The input grid is upscaled by a factor of two, meaning each cell is replaced by a 2x2 block of the same color.
2. **Outline Generation:** A one-pixel wide outline with color '3' is drawn around each upscaled object, but only where the background color was present in the upscaled grid. This means the outline doesn't appear where two upscaled objects touch.

**Example:**

Let's consider a single cell with color '2' in the input grid:

```
Input:
2
```

After upscaling:

```
Upscaled:
2 2
2 2
```

And finally, with the outline:

```
Output:
3 3 3 3
3 2 2 3
3 2 2 3
3 3 3 3 
```

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") that achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, TWO)  # Upscale input grid
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=T, diagonal=F, without_bg=T):
    obj_indices = shift(upscale(toindices(obj), TWO), (ONE, ONE))  # Upscale and shift object indices
    border = box(obj_indices) # Calculate the bounding box of the upscaled object
    shifted_border = shift(border, (ONE, ONE))  # Shift the bounding box to create an outer border
    outline = shifted_border - border  # Calculate the outline by subtracting inner border from outer border
    O = underfill(O, THREE, outline)  # Fill the outline with color 3
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:** The input grid `I` is upscaled by a factor of two using `upscale(I, TWO)`.
2. **Object Iteration:** It iterates through each object in the original input grid using `objects(I, univalued=T, diagonal=F, without_bg=T)`.
3. **Index Calculation:** For each object, it calculates the indices of its upscaled and shifted version using `shift(upscale(toindices(obj), TWO), (ONE, ONE))`.
4. **Outline Generation:**  It calculates the outline by first finding the bounding box of the upscaled object using `box(obj_indices)`. Then, it shifts this bounding box to create an "outer" border.  The outline is then the difference between the outer and inner borders (`shifted_border - border`).
5. **Outline Filling:**  Finally, it fills the calculated outline with color '3' using `underfill(O, THREE, outline)`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, TWO)  # Upscale input grid
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=T, diagonal=F, without_bg=T):
    obj_indices = shift(upscale(toindices(obj), TWO), (ONE, ONE))  # Upscale and shift object indices
    outline = mapply(lambda d: dneighbors(d) - obj_indices, obj_indices)  # Find outline using direct neighbors
    O = underfill(O, THREE, outline)  # Fill outline with color 3
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling and Iteration:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Outline Generation:** This version utilizes `mapply` and `dneighbors` to find the outline. For each cell in the upscaled object, it finds the direct neighbors that are NOT part of the object.  The union of these neighbors forms the outline.
3. **Outline Filling:** Similar to Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = upscale(I, TWO) # Upscale the input grid
    for obj in objects(I, univalued=T, diagonal=F, without_bg=T):
        obj_indices = shift(upscale(toindices(obj), TWO), (ONE, ONE))  # Upscale and shift object indices
        outline = set()
        for i, j in obj_indices:  # Iterate through upscaled object indices
            for di, dj in [(0,1),(1,0),(-1,0),(0,-1)]:  # Check four directions for outline
                ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                if (ni, nj) not in obj_indices and 0 <= ni < len(O) and 0 <= nj < len(O[0]):
                    outline.add((ni, nj))  # Add valid outline cells to the set
        O = underfill(O, THREE, frozenset(outline)) # Fill outline with color 3
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling and Iteration:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Outline Generation:** This version iterates through each cell in the upscaled object and checks its four direct neighbors. If a neighbor is not part of the object and lies within the grid boundaries, it's added to the outline set.
3. **Outline Filling:** Similar to previous versions.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, TWO)  # Upscale input grid
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=T, diagonal=F, without_bg=T):
    obj_indices = shift(upscale(toindices(obj), TWO), (ONE, ONE))  # Upscale and shift object indices
    outline =  delta(shrink(obj_indices, ONE))
    O = underfill(O, THREE, outline)  # Fill outline with color 3
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling and Iteration:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Outline Generation:** This version shrinks the upscaled object by one pixel using `shrink(obj_indices, ONE)` and then calculates the difference between the bounding boxes of the original upscaled object and the shrunk one using `delta`. This difference represents the outline.
3. **Outline Filling:** Similar to previous versions.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, TWO)  # Upscale input grid
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=T, diagonal=F, without_bg=T):
    obj_indices = shift(upscale(toindices(obj), TWO), (ONE, ONE))  # Upscale and shift object indices
    O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, box(obj_indices))) # Paint the bounding box of the upscaled object with color 3
    O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), obj_indices)) # Paint the upscaled object on top
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling and Iteration:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Outline Generation:** This version first paints the bounding box of the upscaled object with color '3' using `paint(O, recolor(THREE, box(obj_indices)))`.
3. **Object Painting:** Then, it paints the upscaled object itself on top of the outline using `paint(O, recolor(color(obj), obj_indices))`. This effectively creates an outline as the object will overwrite the color '3' where they overlap.
