## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

1. **Upscaling:** The input grid is upscaled by a factor of 2.
2. **Horizontal Line Extension:**  For every '2' in the input, a horizontal line of '3's is drawn to the right, extending to the right edge of the upscaled grid.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

1. **Upscaling:** The input grid is upscaled by a factor of 2.
2. **Diagonal Line Extension:** For every '2' in the input, a diagonal line of '3's is drawn towards the upper right, extending to the edge of the upscaled grid. The original '2' is replaced with a '3'.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, 2)
  for i, r in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(r):
      if v == 2:
        O = fill(O, 3, connect((i * 2, j * 2), (i * 2, len(O[0]) - 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:** Uses `upscale(I, 2)` to double the size of the input grid `I`, storing the result in `O`.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** Iterates through each cell of the original grid `I`. If a cell contains '2', it calls `fill` to draw a horizontal line of '3's in the upscaled grid `O`.  The line starts at the corresponding position in `O` and extends to the right edge.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, 2)
  twos = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  filled =  mapply(lambda loc: connect(loc, (loc[0], len(I[0]) * 2 - 1)), apply(lambda x: (x[1][0] * 2, x[1][1] * 2), twos))
  return paint(O, recolor(3, merge(filled)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:**  Doubles the size of the input grid using `upscale`.
2. **Locate '2's:** Identifies the positions of all '2's in the input using `toobject` and `ofcolor`.
3. **Calculate Lines:**  For each '2' position, it determines the corresponding start point in the upscaled grid and uses `connect` to get the indices for a horizontal line extending to the right edge.
4. **Fill Lines:**  Combines all line indices using `merge` and then colors them with '3' in the upscaled grid using `paint` and `recolor`.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, 2)
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 2:
        for k in range(j * 2, len(O[0])):
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i * 2, k)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:** Doubles the size of the input grid.
2. **Nested Iteration:** Employs nested loops to iterate through each cell of the input grid.
3. **Conditional Filling:**  If a cell in the input grid contains '2', it initiates another loop to fill the corresponding row in the upscaled grid with '3's from the calculated starting column to the right edge.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, 2)
  h = len(O)
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v == 2:
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(a, j * 2) for a in range(i * 2, h)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:** Similar to previous versions, it starts by upscaling the grid.
2. **Vertical Line Marking:** Iterates through the original grid and, for each '2', it paints a vertical line of '3's in the upscaled grid.  This line begins at the corresponding upscaled position and continues downwards.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, 2)
  return paint(O, recolor(3, merge(apply(lambda x: connect(x, (x[0], len(O[0]) - 1)), apply(lambda x: (x[1][0] * 2, x[1][1] * 2), toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I))))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling and Line Calculation:** Similar to version 2, this version first upscales the grid and identifies '2' locations.  It then calculates the indices for horizontal lines starting at the '2' positions and extending to the right edge.
2. **Concise Filling:**  However, this version uses a more concise approach by combining `merge`, `apply`, and `recolor` to directly paint the calculated lines with '3' in the upscaled grid.

These programs demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformations, offering varying levels of conciseness and readability.
