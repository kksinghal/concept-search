## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:**

1. The transformation identifies all objects formed by the digit '2' in the input grid.
2. For each identified object, it draws a bounding box around the object, effectively outlining it.
3. The bounding box is drawn using the digit '3'.
4. The rest of the grid is filled with the digit '0'.
5. The output grid has a fixed size of 15x18, regardless of the input grid's size.

**Input 1 -> Output 1:**

The same transformation logic applies to Input 1 as described for Input 0. The difference lies in the shape and position of the objects formed by the digit '2' in the input, resulting in different bounding boxes in the output.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, along with explanations for each:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(0, (15, 18)),  # Create a 15x18 canvas filled with 0s
      mpapply(
          lambda obj: recolor(3, outbox(obj)),  # Recolor the outbox of each object to 3
          colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2)  # Filter for objects with color 2
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. `canvas(0, (15, 18))`: Creates a 15x18 grid filled with the value 0, serving as the base canvas.
2. `objects(I, T, F, T)`: Identifies all objects in the input grid `I` formed by connected cells of the same value (T), not considering diagonal connections (F), and excluding the background (T).
3. `colorfilter(..., 2)`: Filters the identified objects, keeping only those where the color of the object (first element of a cell tuple) is 2.
4. `lambda obj: recolor(3, outbox(obj))`: Defines an anonymous function applied to each filtered object. It recolors the 'outbox' (the cells immediately surrounding the object) to the value 3.
5. `mpapply(..., ...)`: Applies the anonymous function to each object from the `colorfilter` output and merges the resulting objects.
6. `paint(..., ...)`: Paints the merged objects onto the canvas created in the first step, effectively drawing the bounding boxes with the value 3.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(0, (15, 18)),
      merge(
          apply(
              lambda obj: recolor(3, box(toindices(obj))),
              colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2)
          )
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 1, but instead of using `mpapply`, it uses `apply` and `merge` to achieve the same result.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  bordered_objs = frozenset(
      recolor(3, outbox(obj)) for obj in objs if color(obj) == 2
  )
  return paint(canvas(0, (15, 18)), bordered_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

This version first extracts all objects and then iterates through them to find those with color 2. It then generates the bordered objects and finally paints them onto the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(0, (15, 18)),
      frozenset(
          recolor(3, outbox(obj))
          for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if color(obj) == 2
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a more compact syntax with set comprehension to achieve the same result as Version 3.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(0, (15, 18)),
      merge(
          apply(
              lambda obj: recolor(3, box(obj)),
              sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: color(o) == 2)
          )
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version combines elements from previous versions, using `sfilter` and `lambda` to filter objects within the `apply` function.

These five versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the same transformation using the DSL. Each version utilizes different function combinations and syntax, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
