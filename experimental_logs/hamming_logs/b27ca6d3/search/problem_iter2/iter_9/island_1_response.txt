## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves two main steps:

1. **Upscaling:** The input grid is upscaled by a factor of 2, meaning each cell in the input grid is replaced by a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid. 
2. **Outline Drawing:** A 3-cell thick outline is drawn around each upscaled object in the output grid. The outline is drawn only on background cells, preserving the upscaled objects themselves.

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

- Each '2' in the input grid becomes a 2x2 block of '2's in the output grid.
- A 3-cell thick outline of '3's surrounds each 2x2 block, but only where the background color '0' was present in the upscaled grid.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

-  Similar to Input 0, each '2' becomes a 2x2 '2' block in the output grid.
-  Again, a 3-cell thick outline of '3's surrounds each block, appearing only on the background cells.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, TWO)  # Upscale the input grid
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=T, diagonal=F, without_bg=T):
    obj_indices = shift(upscale(toindices(obj), TWO), (ONE, ONE))  # Upscale and shift object indices
    for di in range(-THREE, FOUR):
        for dj in range(-THREE, FOUR):
            if abs(di)  in (ONE, TWO) or abs(dj) in (ONE, TWO):
              O = underfill(O, THREE, shift({(ONE,ONE)}, (di, dj)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), obj_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:** Upscales the input grid `I` by a factor of 2 using `upscale(I, TWO)`.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each object in the input grid using `objects(I, univalued=T, diagonal=F, without_bg=T)`.
3. **Index Upscaling and Shifting:**  For each object, its indices are upscaled and shifted to match the output grid using `shift(upscale(toindices(obj), TWO), (ONE, ONE))`.
4. **Outline Drawing:** Draws a 3-cell thick outline around each upscaled object by iterating through a 7x7 neighborhood around the center of each upscaled object cell and filling the appropriate cells with '3' using `underfill(O, THREE, shift({(ONE,ONE)}, (di, dj)))`.
5. **Object Painting:** Paints the upscaled object on top of the outline using `paint(O, recolor(color(obj), obj_indices))`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, TWO) # Upscale the input grid
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=T, diagonal=F, without_bg=T):
    obj_indices = shift(upscale(toindices(obj), TWO), (ONE, ONE)) # Upscale and shift object indices
    outline = mapply(lambda d: dneighbors(d) | ineighbors(d),  box(obj_indices)) - obj_indices
    O = underfill(O, THREE, outline)  # Fill outline with color 3
    O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), obj_indices))  # Paint the upscaled object on top
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:** Same as in Version 1.
2. **Object Iteration:** Same as in Version 1.
3. **Index Upscaling and Shifting:** Same as in Version 1.
4. **Outline Calculation:** Calculates the outline by finding all direct and indirect neighbors of the bounding box of the upscaled object and then subtracting the object's cells using `mapply(lambda d: dneighbors(d) | ineighbors(d),  box(obj_indices)) - obj_indices`.
5. **Outline Filling:** Fills the calculated outline with '3' using `underfill(O, THREE, outline)`.
6. **Object Painting:** Same as in Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, TWO) # Upscale the input grid
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=T, diagonal=F, without_bg=T):
    obj_indices = shift(upscale(toindices(obj), TWO), (ONE, ONE)) # Upscale and shift object indices
    shifted_obj_indices = shift(obj_indices, (TWO, TWO)) # Shift the indices by 2 in both directions
    outline = difference(backdrop(shifted_obj_indices), backdrop(obj_indices)) # Calculate the outline by subtracting the original object's backdrop from the shifted object's backdrop
    O = underfill(O, THREE, outline) # Fill the outline with color 3
    O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), obj_indices)) # Paint the upscaled object on top
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:** Same as in Version 1.
2. **Object Iteration:** Same as in Version 1.
3. **Index Upscaling and Shifting:** Same as in Version 1.
4. **Outline Calculation:** Calculates the outline by finding the difference between the backdrops of the upscaled object and a shifted version of the upscaled object using `difference(backdrop(shifted_obj_indices), backdrop(obj_indices))`.
5. **Outline Filling:** Same as in Version 2.
6. **Object Painting:** Same as in Version 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = upscale(I, TWO) # Upscale input grid
    for obj in objects(I, univalued=T, diagonal=F, without_bg=T):
        obj_indices = shift(upscale(toindices(obj), TWO), (ONE, ONE))  # Upscale and shift object indices
        outline =  (inbox(shift(obj_indices, (TWO, TWO))) | outbox(shift(obj_indices, (TWO, TWO)))) - backdrop(obj_indices)
        O = underfill(O, THREE, outline)  # Fill outline with color 3
        O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), obj_indices)) # Paint the upscaled object on top
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:** Same as in Version 1.
2. **Object Iteration:** Same as in Version 1.
3. **Index Upscaling and Shifting:** Same as in Version 1.
4. **Outline Calculation:** Calculates the outline by taking the union of the inbox and outbox of a shifted version of the upscaled object and then subtracting the backdrop of the original upscaled object using `(inbox(shift(obj_indices, (TWO, TWO))) | outbox(shift(obj_indices, (TWO, TWO)))) - backdrop(obj_indices)`.
5. **Outline Filling:** Same as in Version 2.
6. **Object Painting:** Same as in Version 1.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = upscale(I, TWO) # Upscale input grid
    for obj in objects(I, univalued=T, diagonal=F, without_bg=T):
      for dx in (-ONE, ONE):
        for dy in (-ONE, ONE):
          O = underpaint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(upscale(toindices(obj), TWO), (dx, dy)))) # Paint the shifted boundaries with color 3
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:** Same as in Version 1.
2. **Object Iteration:** Same as in Version 1.
3. **Outline Drawing:**  Draws the outline directly by iterating through the four possible shifts ((-1,-1), (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1)) of the upscaled object's indices and painting them with color '3' using `underpaint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(upscale(toindices(obj), TWO), (dx, dy))))`. This ensures that the outline is only drawn on the background cells.

Each version utilizes different DSL functions and logic to achieve the same goal, showcasing diverse solutions within the provided DSL.
