## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves upscaling the input grid by a factor of 3 and introducing a new color (3) to create a specific pattern around the existing objects (color 2).

**Input 0:**

* Each cell with value 2 in the input grid is replaced by a 3x3 block of 3s in the output grid.
* The original 2s are placed in the center of these 3x3 blocks. 
* The rest of the grid retains its original value (0).

**Input 1:**

* The transformation follows the same logic as Input 0, with each 2 becoming a 3x3 block of 3s with the original 2 at the center. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = upscale(I, THREE)
  O = replace(O, TWO, THREE)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      O = fill(O, v, {(THREE * i + ONE, THREE * j + ONE)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:** The input grid `I` is upscaled by a factor of 3 using `upscale(I, THREE)`.
2. **Replacing with New Color:** All occurrences of the value 2 in the upscaled grid are replaced with 3 using `replace(O, TWO, THREE)`.
3. **Identifying Objects:** The function `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies objects (connected components) of value 2 in the original input grid `I`.
4. **Placing Original Values:** For each object, the code iterates over its cells and fills the corresponding center cell in the upscaled grid `O` with the original value (2). 

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, multiply(shape(I), THREE))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == TWO:
        O = paint(O, recolor(val, {(THREE * i + ONE, THREE * j + ONE)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, backdrop({(THREE * i + ONE, THREE * j + ONE)})))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Creating Empty Canvas:** An empty canvas `O` is created with dimensions three times larger than the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterating and Painting:** The code iterates through each cell of the input grid. If a cell contains the value 2, it paints a 3x3 block of 3s centered at the corresponding location in `O` and then paints the center cell of this block with the original value 2.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = upscale(replace(I, TWO, THREE), THREE)
  indices = mapply(lambda x: {(THREE * x[0] + ONE, THREE * x[1] + ONE)}, ofcolor(I, TWO))
  return paint(O, recolor(TWO, indices)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling & Replacing:**  The input grid `I` has its 2s replaced with 3s and is then upscaled by a factor of 3.
2. **Identifying Target Indices:** The `ofcolor` function finds the indices of all cells with value 2 in the input. These indices are then transformed to their corresponding centers in the upscaled grid.
3. **Painting Original Values:**  The `paint` function places the original value (2) at the identified target indices in the upscaled grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = upscale(I, THREE)
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == TWO:
        O = fill(O, THREE,  crop(O, (THREE * i, THREE * j), THREE_BY_THREE))
        O = fill(O, TWO, {(THREE * i + ONE, THREE * j + ONE)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:** Upscales the input grid `I` by a factor of 3.
2. **Iterating and Filling:** Iterates through the input grid and for each cell with value 2:
    * Fills the corresponding 3x3 block in the upscaled grid with the value 3.
    * Fills the center cell of that 3x3 block with the original value 2.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = canvas(ZERO, multiply(shape(I), THREE))
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, backdrop({(THREE * i + ONE, THREE * j + ONE)})))
      O = paint(O, recolor(v, {(THREE * i + ONE, THREE * j + ONE)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identifying Objects:** Identifies the objects (connected components) of value 2 in the input grid.
2. **Creating Empty Canvas:** Creates an empty canvas three times the size of the input.
3. **Iterating and Painting:** For each object and its cells:
    * Paints a 3x3 block of 3s centered at the corresponding location in the canvas.
    * Paints the center cell of this block with the object's original value.
