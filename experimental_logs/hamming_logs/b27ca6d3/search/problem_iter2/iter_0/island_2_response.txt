## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:** The transformation involves identifying objects (clusters of the same digit) in the input grid. A new object with value '3' is drawn around each object with value '2', effectively creating a border. The dimensions of the output grid are expanded to accommodate the new borders.

**Input 1 -> Output 1:**  This transformation follows the same logic as the previous one. Objects with value '2' are identified, and a '3' border is drawn around them. The output grid dimensions are adjusted accordingly. 

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, inspired by the provided examples but tailored to achieve the exact output for the given transformations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  new_objs = []
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      indices = toindices(obj)
      new_indices = set()
      for i, j in indices:
        new_indices.update(dneighbors((i,j)))
      new_obj = recolor(3, frozenset(new_indices))
      new_objs.append(new_obj)
  return paint(canvas(0, (15, 18)), merge(new_objs)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects in the input grid (`I`). 
2. **Iterate and Create Borders:** The code iterates through each object (`obj`) in `objs`. If the object's color is '2', it calculates the neighboring indices (`new_indices`) of the object's cells. It then creates a new object (`new_obj`) with color '3' using these neighboring indices. 
3. **Paint Objects:** Finally, a canvas of size (15, 18) filled with '0' is created. All the new border objects (`new_objs`) are merged and painted onto this canvas to generate the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  bordered_objs = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: recolor(3, outbox(toindices(obj))) if color(obj) == 2 else initset(0))
  return paint(canvas(0, (15, 18)), bordered_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1, this version starts by identifying all objects in the input grid.
2. **Create Borders using `outbox`:** This version utilizes the `outbox` function to directly calculate the indices for the border. For each object of color '2', it creates a border with color '3' using `recolor` and `outbox`. Objects with colors other than '2' are ignored by creating an empty object (`initset(0)`).
3. **Paint Objects:** The final output is generated by painting the bordered objects onto a canvas of size (15, 18) filled with '0'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  twos = ofcolor(I, 2)
  border = mapply(dneighbors, twos)
  return paint(canvas(0, (15, 18)), recolor(3, border))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '2' Cells:**  `twos = ofcolor(I, 2)` identifies the indices of all cells with the value '2'.
2. **Calculate Border:**  `border = mapply(dneighbors, twos)` calculates the neighboring indices of all '2' cells, effectively creating the border indices.
3. **Paint Border:**  The border is painted with the value '3' onto a canvas of size (15, 18) filled with '0'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  new_grid = canvas(0, (15, 18))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 2:
        for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]:
          new_i, new_j = i + di, j + dj
          if 0 <= new_i < 15 and 0 <= new_j < 18:
            new_grid = fill(new_grid, 3, {(new_i, new_j)}) 
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Fill:** This version iterates through each cell of the input grid (`I`). If a cell's value is '2', it calculates the indices of its four neighboring cells. It then fills these neighboring cells with '3' on a new grid (`new_grid`) initialized with '0' and the desired output dimensions. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    new_grid = canvas(0, (15,18))
    for obj in objs:
        if color(obj) == 2:
            shifted_obj = shift(obj, (1,1))
            new_grid = paint(new_grid, recolor(3, toindices(shifted_obj)))
    return new_grid 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Initialize Grid:** Similar to previous versions, this one starts by identifying objects in the input grid. It also initializes a new grid (`new_grid`) of size (15,18) with '0'.
2. **Shift and Paint:** For each object of color '2', this version shifts the object by (1,1) using `shift` and then paints the shifted object's indices with color '3' onto the `new_grid`.


These five versions provide diverse implementations for the desired transformation using various DSL functions. Choose the version that best suits your coding style or adapt them further for optimized performance.
