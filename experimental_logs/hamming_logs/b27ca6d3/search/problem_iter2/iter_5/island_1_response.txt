## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in both input-output pairs follows a consistent pattern:

1. **Upscaling:** The input grid is upscaled by a factor of 2. Each cell in the original grid is replaced by a 2x2 block in the output grid.
2. **Object Outlining:** A border of a different color (here, '3') is drawn around each upscaled object, except for the background color. 
3. **Object Coloring:** The upscaled objects retain their original color from the input grid.

**Example Breakdown:**

Let's take a single cell from `Input_0` with value '2' as an example:

```
Input_0 Cell:
2
```

After transformation, this cell becomes:

```
Output_0 Block:
3 2
3 2
```

Here's how each step contributes:

* **Upscaling:** The single '2' becomes a 2x2 block of '2's.
* **Object Outlining:** A border of '3's is drawn around this 2x2 block.
* **Object Coloring:** The inner 2x2 block retains its original value '2'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation, along with explanations:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = upscale(I, TWO)  # Upscale the input grid
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=T, diagonal=F, without_bg=T):
    obj_indices = shift(upscale(toindices(obj), TWO), (ONE, ONE))  # Upscale and shift object indices
    O = underfill(O, THREE, outbox(obj_indices))  # Draw the outline using outbox
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:** `upscale(I, TWO)` doubles the size of the input grid `I`.
2. **Object Iteration:**  It iterates through each object (excluding the background) in the input grid `I` using `objects(I, univalued=T, diagonal=F, without_bg=T)`.
3. **Index Transformation:** For each object, its indices are upscaled and shifted to align with the upscaled grid using `shift(upscale(toindices(obj), TWO), (ONE, ONE))`.
4. **Outline Drawing:** `underfill(O, THREE, outbox(obj_indices))` draws the outline by filling the cells surrounding the upscaled object (`outbox`) with color '3' only if those cells are background color in the upscaled grid `O`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), multiply(shape(I), TWO)) # Create a canvas with background color and double size
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value != mostcolor(I): # Check for non-background cells
        O = paint(O, recolor(value, {(2*i+1, 2*j+1), (2*i+1, 2*j+2), (2*i+2, 2*j+1), (2*i+2, 2*j+2)}))  # Paint 2x2 block
        O = underfill(O, THREE, outbox({(2*i+1, 2*j+1)})) # Draw outline
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** `canvas(mostcolor(I), multiply(shape(I), TWO))` creates an upscaled canvas filled with the background color of the input.
2. **Iterating and Painting:** It iterates through each cell in the input and paints a 2x2 block with the cell's value in the upscaled grid `O` if the cell is not a background cell.
3. **Outline Drawing:** It uses `underfill` and `outbox` similarly to version 1 to draw the outline around the painted blocks.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = upscale(I, TWO)  # Upscale the input grid
    for obj in objects(I, univalued=T, diagonal=F, without_bg=T):
        for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
            O = underfill(O, THREE, outbox({(2*i+1, 2*j+1)}))  # Draw outline
            O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(2*i+1, 2*j+1), (2*i+1, 2*j+2), (2*i+2, 2*j+1), (2*i+2, 2*j+2)}) # Paint 2x2 block
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Object Iteration:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Cell-wise Operation:** It iterates directly over the indices of each object in the input grid.
4. **Outline and Painting:** For each cell, it first draws the outline around the corresponding 2x2 area in the output grid using `underfill` and `outbox`, then fills the 2x2 block with the original cell's color. 

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = upscale(I, TWO)  # Upscale the input grid
    for obj in objects(I, univalued=T, diagonal=F, without_bg=T):
        obj_indices = shift(upscale(toindices(obj), TWO), (ONE, ONE))
        O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, delta(obj_indices))) # Paint the outline using delta
    return O
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **Upscaling:**  Same as Version 1.
2. **Object Iteration:**  Same as Version 1.
3. **Outline with Delta:** This version uses `delta` function to find the indices that form the outline directly and paints them with color '3'.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = upscale(I, TWO)  # Upscale the input grid
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I): # For non-background cells
                O = underfill(O, THREE, box({(2*i+1, 2*j+1)})) # Draw outline using box 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscaling:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Cell-based Iteration and Outline:** This version iterates through every cell in the input grid. If a cell is not a background color, it draws the outline in the upscaled grid `O` using the `box` function, which directly provides the outline indices. This avoids the need for explicitly upscaling and shifting object indices.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the same outcome, showcasing the flexibility and versatility of the provided DSL for image manipulation tasks.
