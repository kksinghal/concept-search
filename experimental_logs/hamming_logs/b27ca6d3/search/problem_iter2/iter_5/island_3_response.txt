## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Canvas Expansion:** The output grid is expanded horizontally, becoming 18 columns wide (from the original 9).
2. **Object Replication:**  Each '2' digit from the input grid is replicated in the output grid at its corresponding position.
3. **Horizontal Line Extension:** A horizontal line of '3' digits is drawn to the right of each '2' digit, extending to the edge of the output grid.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. **Canvas Expansion:** The output grid is expanded, becoming 16 columns wide (from the original 8).
2. **Object Replication:** Each '2' digit from the input grid is replicated in the output grid at its corresponding position.
3. **Surrounding Pattern:** A pattern of '3' digits is drawn around each '2' digit. The pattern extends three cells to the right and one cell up, down, and diagonally up-right from the '2' digit. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions for the `Program_to_be_generated`, utilizing the provided DSL and inspired by the existing code snippets:


**Version 1 (Inspired by Program_A's horizontal line logic):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (height(I), width(I) * 2))  # Double the width
  for obj in colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2):
    i, j = centerofmass(obj)
    O = paint(O, obj)  # Replicate object
    O = fill(O, 3, connect((i, j), (i, width(O) - 1))) # Draw horizontal line
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Creates an output grid `O` with double the width of the input grid `I`, filled with '0's.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through objects (connected components of '2's) in the input grid.
3. **Replication & Line Drawing:** For each object, replicates it onto the output grid `O` and draws a horizontal line of '3's from the object's center of mass to the right edge of the grid.


**Version 2 (Leveraging surrounding pattern logic):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (height(I), width(I) + 8))  # Expand width by 8
  for obj in colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2):
    i, j = centerofmass(obj)
    O = paint(O, obj) # Replicate object
    for di in range(-1, 2):  
      for dj in range(4):
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i + di, j + dj)})  # Draw surrounding pattern
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Creates an output grid `O` with width increased by 8 compared to input grid `I`.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through objects of '2's in the input grid.
3. **Replication & Pattern:** For each object, replicates it onto `O`. Then, it draws a pattern of '3's around the object's center of mass using nested loops to cover the desired offsets.


**Version 3 (Combining elements from Program_A and surrounding logic):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, (height(I), width(I) * 2 - 1)) # Adjust width 
    for obj in colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2):
        i, j = centerofmass(obj)
        O = paint(O, obj) # Replicate object
        O = fill(O, 3, connect((i, j), (i, j + 2))) # Horizontal segment
        for di in range(-1, 2):
            O = fill(O, 3, {(i + di, j + 3)}) # Vertical segment
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:**  Creates an output grid `O` with width adjusted to accommodate the pattern.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through objects of '2's in the input.
3. **Replication & Pattern:** For each object, replicates it onto `O`, draws a horizontal segment of '3's, and then adds vertical segments to complete the pattern.


**Version 4 (Using `shift` for pattern generation):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (height(I), width(I) + 8))  # Expand width 
  for obj in colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2):
    O = paint(O, obj)  # Replicate object
    for dj in range(1, 4):
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(obj, (0, dj)))) # Shift and paint pattern
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(obj, (-1, 3)))) # Additional shift for pattern 
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, shift(obj, (1, 3))))  # Additional shift for pattern
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Creates an output grid `O` with expanded width.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through objects of '2's.
3. **Replication & Pattern:**  Replicates each object onto `O`.  The pattern is drawn by shifting the object horizontally and recoloring it to '3' before painting it onto the output grid.


**Version 5 (A more concise approach using nested loops):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, (height(I), width(I) + 8))  # Expand width
  for obj in colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 2):
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      O[i][j] = v # Direct replication
      for di in range(-1, 2):
        for dj in range(1, 4):
          if di == 0 or dj == 3:
            O = fill(O, 3, {(i + di, j + dj)}) # Pattern drawing
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:**  Creates an output grid `O` with expanded width.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through objects of '2's.
3. **Direct Replication & Pattern:** Directly replicates each cell of the object onto `O`.  The pattern of '3's is drawn using nested loops and a conditional statement to control which cells are filled. 

These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL.
