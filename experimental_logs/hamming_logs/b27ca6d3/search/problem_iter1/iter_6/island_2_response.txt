## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same color, excluding the background color 0) and drawing a border around them using the color 3. The border is 1-cell thick and directly adjacent to the object.

**Input_0:**

* Objects with color 2 are identified.
* A one-cell thick border with color 3 is drawn around each object.

**Input_1:**

*  The same logic is applied here. Objects with color 2 are identified and a color 3 border is drawn around them.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def dfecffbafaideafgaggdajdebjggbfde(I):
  padded = canvas(ZERO, add(shape(I), (2, 2)))
  padded = paint(padded, shift(asobject(I), (1, 1)))
  bordered = mapply(lambda loc: frozenset({(THREE, add(loc, d)) for d in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]}), ofcolor(padded, TWO))
  O = trim(paint(padded, bordered))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Padding:** The input grid is padded with a border of zeros to handle edge cases.
2. **Shifting:** The padded grid is shifted by (1,1) to accommodate the new border.
3. **Bordering:**  The `ofcolor` function identifies indices of color 2. For each such index, a set of border cells is generated using `mapply`. `frozenset` is used to make each set of border cells hashable. 
4. **Painting and Trimming:** The border cells are painted onto the padded grid, and finally, the padding is trimmed to get the output grid. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def dfecffbafaideafgaggdajdebjggbfde(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
      O = paint(O, recolor(THREE,  dneighbors(centerofmass(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iteration:** The program iterates through each object (excluding background) in the input grid.
2. **Center and Neighbors:** For each object, its center of mass and its direct neighbors are calculated.
3. **Painting:** The cells corresponding to the direct neighbors are painted with the color 3, creating the border.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def dfecffbafaideafgaggdajdebjggbfde(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    for cell in obj:
      O = paint(O, recolor(THREE,  dneighbors(cell[1])))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iteration:** This version iterates through each cell of each object (excluding background).
2. **Neighbors:** For each cell, its direct neighbors are calculated.
3. **Painting:** The neighbor cells are painted with color 3, effectively drawing the border.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def dfecffbafaideafgaggdajdebjggbfde(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, delta(toindices(obj)))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:** This version identifies objects in the input grid.
2. **Delta Calculation:** It calculates the delta of each object, which represents the border cells.
3. **Painting:**  The border cells (delta) are painted with color 3.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def dfecffbafaideafgaggdajdebjggbfde(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  border_cells = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)))
  O = paint(I, recolor(THREE, border_cells))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object and Border Identification:** The program identifies objects and calculates the border cells for each object using `delta`.
2. **Merging:**  It merges all border cells into a single set.
3. **Painting:** Finally, it paints the merged border cells onto the input grid with color 3.


Each of these program versions uses a different approach to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and power of the DSL.
