## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects composed of the digit '2' and then extending them horizontally by adding the digit '3' to their left and right sides, but only if those cells were initially '0'. 

**Example Breakdown:**

Let's take a simple example to illustrate:

**Input:**

```
0 0 2 0 0
0 2 2 2 0 
0 0 2 0 0
```

**Output:**

```
0 0 2 0 0
0 3 2 2 3 
0 0 2 0 0 
```

Here's how the transformation works:

1. **Object Identification:** The program identifies the object formed by the '2' digits.
2. **Horizontal Extension:** It checks the cells immediately to the left and right of each '2' in the object.
3. **Conditional Filling:** If these neighboring cells contain a '0', they are replaced with a '3'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program_version_1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: frozenset((3, n) for loc in toindices(obj) for n in {(loc[0],loc[1]-1),(loc[0],loc[1]+1)} if index(I, n)==0), sfilter(lambda obj: color(obj) == 2, objs))))

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '2' Objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid `I`.
2. **Filter by Color:** `sfilter(lambda obj: color(obj) == 2, objs)` selects only the objects consisting of the digit '2'.
3. **Generate Extension Cells:**  For each '2' object, the code iterates through its cells (`loc`) and generates two new cells to the left and right (`(loc[0],loc[1]-1),(loc[0],loc[1]+1)`) with the value '3', but only if the original cell in the input grid at that location is '0' (`if index(I, n)==0`).
4. **Merge and Paint:** The extension cells for all objects are merged (`merge`) and then painted onto the original input grid `I` using `paint`.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program_version_2(I):
  return paint(I, merge({frozenset({(3, (i, j - 1)), (3, (i, j + 1))} for (i, j) in toindices(obj) if index(I, (i, j - 1)) == 0 and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0) for obj in sfilter(lambda obj: color(obj) == 2, objects(I, T, F, F))}))

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object and Color Filtering:** Similar to version 1, this code first identifies all objects and filters for those with color '2'.
2. **Direct Extension Generation:** For each cell (`(i, j)`) within a '2' object, it checks if both its left and right neighbors (`(i, j - 1)` and `(i, j + 1)`) are '0'. If true, it directly creates a set of two extension cells with the value '3' at these locations. 
3. **Merging and Painting:** The extension cell sets are merged and painted onto the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program_version_3(I):
    for obj in sfilter(lambda obj: color(obj) == 2, objects(I, T, F, F)):
        for i, j in toindices(obj):
            if index(I, (i, j - 1)) == 0:
                I = fill(I, 3, {(i, j - 1)})
            if index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0:
                I = fill(I, 3, {(i, j + 1)})
    return I 

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterative Filling:** This version takes a more iterative approach. It loops through each '2' object and then through each cell of that object.
2. **Conditional Filling:**  For each cell, it checks its left and right neighbors individually. If a neighbor is '0', it directly fills that cell with '3' using `fill`. The modified grid is used in subsequent iterations.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def program_version_4(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda loc: frozenset({(3, (loc[0], loc[1] - 1))}) if index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] - 1)) == 0 else frozenset() | frozenset({(3, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1))}) if index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0 else frozenset(), ofcolor(I, 2))))

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '2' Cells:** `ofcolor(I, 2)` directly retrieves the indices of all cells containing the digit '2'.
2. **Apply Extension Logic:** It uses `apply` to apply a lambda function to each '2' cell location (`loc`).
3. **Conditional Set Creation:** The lambda function checks the left and right neighbors. For each neighbor that's '0', it creates a singleton set containing a new cell with value '3' at that location. Otherwise, it returns an empty set.  
4. **Union and Painting:** The sets are merged and then painted onto the original grid.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def program_version_5(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  new_grid = [[I[i][j] for j in range(w)] for i in range(h)]
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(1, w-1):
      if I[i][j] == 2:
        if I[i][j - 1] == 0:
          new_grid[i][j - 1] = 3
        if I[i][j + 1] == 0:
          new_grid[i][j + 1] = 3
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a Copy:** This version first creates a copy of the input grid (`new_grid`).
2. **Iterate and Modify:** It then iterates through each cell of the input grid. If a cell contains '2', it checks its left and right neighbors.
3. **Direct Modification:** If a neighbor is '0' in the original grid, the corresponding cell in the `new_grid` copy is directly modified to '3'.
4. **Return Modified Grid:** Finally, the modified `new_grid` is returned.

These diverse program versions highlight different ways to achieve the same data transformation within the constraints of the provided DSL.
