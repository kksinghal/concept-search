## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects with the value '2' and then expanding these objects by one cell in all directions. This expansion is filled with the value '3'. 

**Example:**

Let's take a simple example:

**Input:**

```
0 0 0
0 2 0
0 0 0
```

**Output:**

```
0 3 0
3 2 3
0 3 0
```

Here, the object formed by the digit '2' is expanded by adding '3' to all its neighboring cells.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  """
  Expands objects of value '2' by one cell in all directions and paints the expansion with '3'.
  """
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)
  expanded_indices = mapply(lambda obj: delta(obj), twos)  
  O = fill(I, 3, merge(expanded_indices)) 
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)`**:  Identifies all objects in the grid `I`.
2. **`colorfilter(objs, 2)`**: Filters the objects to select only those with the color '2'.
3. **`mapply(lambda obj: delta(obj), twos)`**:  For each object with color '2', it finds the indices surrounding the object (its "delta").
4. **`merge(expanded_indices)`**: Combines all the delta indices into a single set.
5. **`fill(I, 3, merge(expanded_indices))`**: Fills the cells at the identified delta indices with the value '3'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  """
  Expands objects of value '2' by one cell and paints the expansion with '3'.
  """
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  return paint(I, recolor(3, merge(mapply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), colorfilter(objs, 2)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Filter:** Similar to Version 1, it identifies objects and filters for those with color '2'.
2. **Calculate Delta:** It calculates the delta (surrounding cells) for each '2' object.
3. **Recolor and Merge:**  It recolors the delta indices to '3' and merges them.
4. **Paint:** Finally, it paints the recoloured delta indices onto the original grid `I`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  """
  Expands objects of value '2' outwards and fills with '3'.
  """
  twos = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  expanded = mapply(lambda obj: backdrop(shift(obj, (1, 0))) | 
                        backdrop(shift(obj, (-1, 0))) | 
                        backdrop(shift(obj, (0, 1))) | 
                        backdrop(shift(obj, (0, -1))), twos)
  return fill(I, 3, merge(expanded))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Detection:**  Finds all objects with value '2'.
2. **Shifted Backdrops:** For each object, it calculates backdrops (bounding boxes) of the object shifted in all four directions.
3. **Union of Backdrops:** It creates a union of all the shifted backdrops.
4. **Fill:**  Finally, it fills the cells at the unioned indices with the value '3'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  """
  Finds objects of '2' and expands them with '3' using outbox.
  """
  twos = colorfilter(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False), 2) 
  return fill(I, 3, merge(mapply(outbox, twos)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Detection and Filtering:**  Identifies objects and filters them for those with the value '2'.
2. **Calculate Outbox:**  Calculates the 'outbox' of each object with value '2'. 
3. **Merge and Fill:**  Merges the outboxes of all '2' objects and fills the corresponding indices on the grid with '3'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  """
  Expands objects of value '2' by one layer and fills the expansion with '3'.
  """
  object_indices = toindices(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False))
  expanded_indices = merge(mapply(neighbors, object_indices))
  filtered_indices = sfilter(expanded_indices, lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0)
  return fill(I, 3, filtered_indices) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Object Indices:** Finds indices of all objects in the grid.
2. **Expand Indices:** Expands those indices by one cell in all directions.
3. **Filter Expanded Indices:**  Filters the expanded indices to only include cells with value '0' (the background).
4. **Fill:** Fills the filtered indices with '3'. 

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the same transformation using the DSL's capabilities. Each version provides a unique combination of functions and logic, offering flexibility and efficiency in code generation.
