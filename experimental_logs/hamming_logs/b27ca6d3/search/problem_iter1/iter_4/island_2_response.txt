## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:** The transformation identifies each horizontally aligned group of '2's. For each such group, it draws a horizontal line of '3's one row above the group, extending one cell to the left and right of the outermost '2's.

**Input 1 to Output 1:** This transformation is similar to the previous one but operates on vertically aligned groups of '2's. For each group, it draws a vertical line of '3's one column to the right of the group, extending one cell above and below the outermost '2's.


## Program_to_be_generated:

### Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  twos = colorfilter(objs, TWO)
  line = frozenset()
  for obj in twos:
    if hline(obj):
      for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1):
        line = insert((THREE, (uppermost(obj) - 1, j)), line)
    elif vline(obj):
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
        line = insert((THREE, (i, rightmost(obj) + 1)), line)
  O = paint(I, line)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Like Program A, we find all objects in the input grid (`I`) but allow for multi-valued objects.
2. **Filter by Color:** We isolate objects made of the color '2'.
3. **Iterate and Draw:** For each object:
    * **Horizontal Check:** If the object forms a horizontal line (`hline`), we draw a horizontal line of '3's above it (similar to Program A).
    * **Vertical Check:** If the object forms a vertical line (`vline`), we draw a vertical line of '3's to its right.
4. **Paint:** Finally, we paint the drawn lines onto the original grid.

### Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  lines = frozenset()
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == TWO:
        if (i > 0 and I[i - 1][j] == TWO) and (j > 0 and I[i][j - 1] != TWO):
          lines = insert((THREE, (i, j + 1)), lines)
        elif (j > 0 and I[i][j - 1] == TWO) and (i > 0 and I[i - 1][j] != TWO):
          lines = insert((THREE, (i - 1, j)), lines)
  O = paint(I, lines)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:** This version directly iterates over each cell in the grid.
2. **Detect Line Start:** For each '2', it checks if it's the start of a horizontal or vertical line by looking at its left and upper neighbors.
3. **Draw Line:** If a line start is detected, it draws a single '3' at the appropriate end of the line (above for horizontal, right for vertical).
4. **Paint:** Like before, it paints the drawn lines onto the original grid.

### Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  h_lines = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), hline)
  v_lines = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), vline)
  h_extended = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((THREE, (uppermost(obj) - 1, j)) for j in range(leftmost(obj) - 1, rightmost(obj) + 2)), h_lines)
  v_extended = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((THREE, (i, rightmost(obj) + 1)) for i in range(uppermost(obj) - 1, lowermost(obj) + 2)), v_lines)
  O = paint(I, h_extended | v_extended)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Lines:**  We find all horizontal (`h_lines`) and vertical (`v_lines`) lines of '2's using `mfilter` and `hline`/`vline`.
2. **Extend Lines:**  We use `mapply` to efficiently extend each horizontal line upwards and each vertical line rightwards with '3's.
3. **Paint:** Finally, we paint the extended lines onto the original grid.

### Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = I
  for obj in colorfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), TWO):
    if hline(obj):
      O = fill(O, THREE, {(uppermost(obj) - 1, j) for j in range(leftmost(obj) - 1, rightmost(obj) + 2)})
    elif vline(obj):
      O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, rightmost(obj) + 1) for i in range(uppermost(obj) - 1, lowermost(obj) + 2)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Modify:** This version iterates through '2'-colored objects and directly modifies the grid (`O`).
2. **Conditional Fill:** For each object:
    * **Horizontal Line:** If it's a horizontal line, it fills the row above with '3's, extending one cell left and right.
    * **Vertical Line:** If it's a vertical line, it fills the column to the right with '3's, extending one cell above and below.

### Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  def extend_line(obj):
    if hline(obj):
      return frozenset((THREE, (uppermost(obj) - 1, j)) for j in range(leftmost(obj) - 1, rightmost(obj) + 2))
    elif vline(obj):
      return frozenset((THREE, (i, rightmost(obj) + 1)) for i in range(uppermost(obj) - 1, lowermost(obj) + 2))
    else:
      return frozenset()
  
  extended_lines = mfilter(objects(I, F, F, T), extend_line)
  return paint(I, extended_lines)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Helper Function:** We define a helper function `extend_line` that encapsulates the line extension logic for both horizontal and vertical lines.
2. **Apply and Paint:** We use `mfilter` to apply `extend_line` to all objects in the grid and then paint the resulting extensions.


Each of these versions provides a distinct approach to solving the given transformation task using the provided DSL. They showcase different strategies, function combinations, and code structures, illustrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
