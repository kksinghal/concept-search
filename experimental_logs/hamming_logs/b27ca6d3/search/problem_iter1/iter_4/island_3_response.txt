## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (clusters of connected cells with the same value) of a specific color (2 in this case) and extending them horizontally. The extension is done by painting the background cells (value 0) adjacent to the object with a new color (3 in this case). 

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 
- Objects with value 2 are extended horizontally by one cell on either side. 
- This effectively creates horizontal lines of color 3 flanking the original objects.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The same logic applies here, with horizontal extensions added to objects with value 2.
- Notice how the extension does not "jump over" other objects or go beyond the grid boundaries.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" utilizing functions from the provided DSL (`dsl.py`) and inspired by the given sample programs.

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  extensions = set()
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      for i, j in toindices(obj):
        if j > 0 and I[i][j-1] == 0:
          extensions.add((3, (i, j-1)))
        if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j+1] == 0:
          extensions.add((3, (i, j+1)))
  return paint(I, frozenset(extensions))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` finds all connected components (objects) in the input grid `I`.
2. **Filter by Color:** The code iterates through each `obj` and checks if its color (`color(obj)`) is 2.
3. **Extend Horizontally:** For each cell `(i, j)` within the object:
    - It checks if the cell to the left (`j > 0`) is background (`I[i][j-1] == 0`) and adds an extension cell with value 3 to the `extensions` set.
    - It performs the same check for the right side (`j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j+1] == 0`).
4. **Paint Extensions:** Finally, it paints the `extensions` onto the original input grid `I` using `paint`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, mfilter(lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0 and any(index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + d)) == 2 for d in [-1, 1]), asindices(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over Indices:** `asindices(I)` generates all cell indices in the grid.
2. **Filter for Extension Points:**  The `mfilter` function keeps indices (`loc`) that meet two conditions:
    - The cell at the current index is background (`index(I, loc) == 0`).
    - At least one of the horizontally adjacent cells (`loc[1] + d` for `d` in `[-1, 1]`) has the value 2.
3. **Paint Extensions:**  The filtered indices are painted with value 3 onto the original grid `I` using `paint`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: frozenset((3, n) for loc in toindices(obj) for n in dneighbors(loc) if index(I, n) == 0 and abs(n[1] - loc[1]) == 1), sfilter(lambda obj: color(obj) == 2, objs)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Filter Objects:** Similar to Version 1, it identifies objects and filters for those with color 2.
2. **Generate Extensions:** For each object, it finds its direct neighbors (`dneighbors`) that are background cells and horizontally adjacent to the object's cells, marking them as extensions.
3. **Paint Extensions:** Merges all extension cells and paints them onto the original grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, hconcat(trim(hconcat(canvas(0,(1,1)), I)), canvas(0,(1,1))), 3)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Padding:** Generates a canvas of zeros with one extra column on each side of the input grid `I`.
2. **Concatenate and Trim:** Concatenates the padding with the input grid and then trims the outermost columns.
3. **Cellwise Comparison:** Performs a cellwise comparison between the original grid and the padded and trimmed grid. If the values differ (meaning an extension point is found), it fills in those cells with the value 3.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_left = hconcat(canvas(0, (len(I), 1)), I)[:, :-1]
  shifted_right = hconcat(I, canvas(0, (len(I), 1)))[:, 1:]
  return apply(lambda row, l, r: tuple(3 if (c == 0 and (l == 2 or r == 2)) else c for c, l, r in zip(row, l, r)), pair(I, pair(shifted_left, shifted_right)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Grid:** Creates left and right shifted versions of the grid by padding with zeros and then slicing.
2. **Zip and Compare:** Zips the original, left-shifted, and right-shifted grids together.
3. **Conditional Painting:** For each cell, if it's a background cell (`c == 0`) and either of its horizontal neighbors is 2, it gets painted with 3.

These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the desired horizontal object extension while highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
