## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in both examples can be described as:

1. **Identify '2' Objects:** Identify all connected regions of '2's in the input grid, treating each region as a distinct object.
2. **Expand Objects:** Expand each '2' object by one cell in all directions. This includes diagonal expansion.
3. **Paint Expanded Regions:**  Paint the expanded regions with the value '3'. The original '2's remain unchanged.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  """
  Treats '2' cells as objects, expands them by 1 cell, and paints them with '3'.
  """
  two_objects = colorfilter(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False), 2)
  expanded_objects = mapply(lambda obj: toobject(backdrop(obj), I), two_objects)  
  O = paint(I, recolor(3, merge(expanded_objects)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`two_objects = colorfilter(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False), 2)`:** 
   - Identifies all connected regions of '2's using `objects()` with `univalued=True` (each object has a single color) and `diagonal=False` (connectivity is only horizontal and vertical).
   - Filters the identified objects to keep only those containing '2' using `colorfilter()`.

2. **`expanded_objects = mapply(lambda obj: toobject(backdrop(obj), I), two_objects)`:**
   - Expands each '2' object using `backdrop()`, which returns the indices of a bounding box around the object.
   - Converts the expanded indices back into an object representation using `toobject()`.
   - Applies these operations to each object in `two_objects` using `mapply()`.

3. **`O = paint(I, recolor(3, merge(expanded_objects)))`:**
   - Merges all expanded objects into a single set of indices using `merge()`.
   - Recolors the merged object to '3' using `recolor()`.
   - Paints the recoloured object onto the original grid `I` using `paint()`, effectively filling the expanded regions with '3'.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  expanded = mapply(lambda obj: delta(obj) if color(obj)==2 else frozenset(), objs)
  O = fill(I, 3, merge(expanded))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)`:** Identifies connected '2' objects as in Version 1.
2. **`expanded = mapply(lambda obj: delta(obj) if color(obj)==2 else frozenset(), objs)`:**
   - Uses `delta(obj)` to get the indices surrounding each object (its "expansion").
   - Conditionally applies expansion only if the `color(obj)` is 2.
3. **`O = fill(I, 3, merge(expanded))`:** 
   - Merges all expanded areas and fills them with '3' on the original grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  twos = ofcolor(I, 2)
  expansion_area = mapply(neighbors, twos)
  O = fill(I, 3, expansion_area - twos)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`twos = ofcolor(I, 2)`:** Directly gets the indices of all '2' cells.
2. **`expansion_area = mapply(neighbors, twos)`:** Finds all neighbors of '2' cells for expansion.
3. **`O = fill(I, 3, expansion_area - twos)`:** Fills the expanded area (excluding the original '2's) with '3'.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  object_indices = partition(I)
  expanded_indices = mapply(lambda indices:  sfilter(lambda ij: any(manhattan(astuple(*ij), astruple(*ind)) <= 1 for ind in indices), product(interval(0, len(I), 1), interval(0, len(I[0]), 1))) if color(first(indices)) == 2 else frozenset(), object_indices)
  O = fill(I, 3, merge(expanded_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`object_indices = partition(I)`:** Partitions the grid into objects based on color.
2. **`expanded_indices = ...`:** This complex line iterates through each object:
   - `if color(first(indices)) == 2`: It only processes objects with color 2.
   - For each '2' object, it generates all possible grid indices using `product(interval(...), interval(...))`.
   - For each index, it checks if it's within a Manhattan distance of 1 from any cell in the object using nested loops and `manhattan`. If so, it's part of the expanded area.
3. **`O = fill(I, 3, merge(expanded_indices))`:** Fills the merged expanded areas with '3'. 

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] == 2:
                for di in range(-1, 2):
                    for dj in range(-1, 2):
                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                        if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] != 2:
                            O = fill(O, 3, {(ni, nj)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid `O` with the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate over each cell in the grid**: Two nested loops iterate over each cell in the grid.
3. **`if I[i][j] == 2`**: If a cell contains the value 2:
4. **Iterate over neighboring cells**: Two more nested loops iterate over the 8 neighboring cells (including diagonals) of the current cell.
5. **`if ... and I[ni][nj] != 2`**: If the neighboring cell is within the grid boundaries and does not contain the value 2:
6. **`O = fill(O, 3, {(ni, nj)})`**: Fill the neighboring cell in the output grid `O` with the value 3.

This version effectively expands each '2' cell by one unit in all directions, replacing any non-'2' neighbor with a '3'.
