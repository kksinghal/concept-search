## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking the input grid to the output grid involves the following steps:

1. **Identify "2" clusters:** The transformation targets groups of connected "2" digits in the grid. 
2. **Draw a border around clusters:**  A border of "3" digits is drawn around each "2" cluster, leaving one empty space ("0") between the cluster and the border.

**Example:**

Let's look at a small section from Input_0:

```
0 0 2 0 0 
0 0 2 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 
```

This section transforms to:

```
0 0 2 0 0 
0 0 2 0 0 
0 0 3 3 0
```

As you can see, the two "2" digits are treated as a single cluster, and a border of "3" is drawn around them.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: delta(inflate(toindices(obj), 1)), sfilter(lambda obj: color(obj) == 2, objs))))

def inflate(patch, n):
    return frozenset((i+di,j+dj) for i,j in patch for di in range(-n,n+1) for dj in range(-n,n+1)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Extracts all connected objects from the input grid `I`. 
2. **`sfilter(lambda obj: color(obj) == 2, objs)`:** Filters the objects, keeping only those composed of "2" digits.
3. **`apply(lambda obj: delta(inflate(toindices(obj), 1)), ...)`:** For each "2" cluster:
    - **`toindices(obj)`:** Gets the indices of the object's cells.
    - **`inflate(..., 1)`:** Expands the object's indices by 1 unit in all directions.
    - **`delta(...)`:**  Calculates the difference between the expanded object and the original, effectively finding the bordering cells.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Combines the border indices from all clusters.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the border cells on the input grid `I` with the value "3".


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, mfilter(lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0 and any(index(I, n) == 2 for n in neighbors(loc)), asindices(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asindices(I)`:** Gets the indices of all cells in the input grid `I`.
2. **`mfilter(lambda loc: ..., asindices(I))`:** Filters the indices, keeping only those that satisfy a condition:
    - **`index(I, loc) == 0`:** The cell at the current index `loc` must have a value of "0".
    - **`any(index(I, n) == 2 for n in neighbors(loc))`:** At least one neighbor of the current cell must have a value of "2".
3. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the filtered cells (the border cells) on the input grid `I` with the value "3".

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      for loc in delta(toindices(obj)):
        if any(index(I, n) == 2 for n in neighbors(loc)):
          O = fill(O, 3, {loc})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** Iterates through all connected objects in the input grid.
2. **Filter for "2" clusters:** Checks if the current object's color is "2".
3. **Iterate through border cells:** Iterates through each cell in the delta (outline) of the "2" cluster.
4. **Check for neighboring "2":** Checks if the current border cell has any neighboring cells with the value "2".
5. **Fill border cell:** If a neighboring "2" is found, fill the current border cell with "3".

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge({frozenset({n for n in neighbors(loc) if index(I, n) == 0 and any(index(I, nn) == 2 for nn in neighbors(n))} - {loc}) for loc in ofcolor(I, 2)}))
```
**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 2)`:** Identifies the indices of all cells in the input grid `I` with the value "2".
2. **Set comprehension:** Iterates over each "2" location and generates a set of border cells:
   - **`neighbors(loc)`:** Retrieves all neighboring cells of the current "2" cell.
   - **`... if index(I, n) == 0 ...`:** Filters neighbors to include only cells with value "0".
   - **`... if any(index(I, nn) == 2 ...`:** Further filters neighbors to ensure they are adjacent to another "2" cell.
   - **`... - {loc}`:**  Removes the original "2" cell from the set of potential border cells.
3. **`frozenset({...})`:** Converts the set of border cells to a frozenset for each "2" location.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Combines all the frozensets of border cells into a single frozenset.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the identified border cells on the input grid `I` with the value "3".

**Program Version 5:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, frozenset((i,j) for i in range(1,len(I)-1) for j in range(1,len(I[0])-1) if (I[i][j] == 0 and ((I[i-1][j] == 2 or I[i+1][j] == 2) or (I[i][j-1] == 2 or I[i][j+1] == 2)) and ((I[i-1][j-1] != 2 and I[i-1][j+1] != 2) and (I[i+1][j-1] != 2 and I[i+1][j+1] != 2)))))
```
**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through inner grid:**  The code iterates through the inner cells of the grid, excluding the borders.
2. **Check for "0" cell:** It identifies cells containing the value "0".
3. **Check for adjacent "2" cells:** It then checks if the identified "0" cell has any adjacent (up, down, left, right) cells with the value "2".
4. **Check for diagonal "2" cells:** It also checks if the identified "0" cell has any diagonal cells with the value "2". If a diagonal "2" is present, the cell should not be filled.
5. **Fill the border cell:** If a "0" cell has an adjacent "2" but no diagonal "2", it is considered a border cell and filled with the value "3". 


This transformation analysis and the five program versions provide a comprehensive solution, each utilizing distinct logic and DSL function combinations. Remember to test these programs with different input grids to ensure they meet the desired outcome in all cases.
