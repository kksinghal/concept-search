## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects made of '2's in the input grid and drawing a border of '3's around them. The border extends one cell beyond the object's boundaries in all directions.

**Example:**

Input:
```
0 0 2 0
0 2 0 0
0 0 0 0
```

Output:
```
0 0 3 3
0 3 2 3
0 0 3 3
```

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  twos = colorfilter(objs, TWO)
  bordered = mapply(lambda obj: outbox(obj), twos)
  O = paint(I, recolor(THREE, bordered))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, F, F, T)` finds all connected objects in the input grid (`I`), considering different colors (`F`), ignoring diagonal connections (`F`), and excluding the background (`T`).
2. **Filter by color:** `colorfilter(objs, TWO)` selects only the objects consisting of the color '2'.
3. **Generate border:** `outbox(obj)` calculates the indices for the outer border of each object. `mapply` applies this function to all objects in `twos` and merges the results.
4. **Recolor border:** `recolor(THREE, bordered)` assigns the color '3' to all indices in the `bordered` set.
5. **Paint the border:** `paint(I, ...)` draws the recoloured border onto a copy of the input grid.
6. **Return output:** The modified grid (`O`) with the added borders is returned.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  twos = ofcolor(I, TWO)
  bordered = mapply(neighbors, twos)
  O = paint(I, recolor(THREE, bordered - twos))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '2' cells:** `ofcolor(I, TWO)` returns the indices of all cells in the input grid (`I`) with the value '2'.
2. **Find neighbor cells:** `neighbors(loc)` returns the indices of all neighboring cells (including diagonals) for a given location (`loc`). `mapply` applies this to all indices in `twos` and merges the results.
3. **Remove original cells:** `bordered - twos` subtracts the original '2' cell indices from the `bordered` set, leaving only the border indices.
4. **Recolor and paint:** Similar to Version 1, the border indices are recolored to '3' and painted onto a copy of the input grid.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == TWO:
        for di in range(-1, 2):
          for dj in range(-1, 2):
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(row) and I[ni][nj] != TWO:
              O = fill(O, THREE, {(ni, nj)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** This version iterates directly through each cell in the input grid.
2. **Check for '2':** If a cell contains a '2', it iterates through its 8 neighboring cells.
3. **Fill border:** For each neighbor cell that's within the grid boundaries and doesn't contain a '2', it fills the cell with a '3' in the output grid (`O`).

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  padded = canvas(ZERO, add(shape(I), (2, 2)))
  padded = paint(padded, shift(asobject(I), (1, 1)))
  bordered = mapply(lambda loc: {(THREE, add(loc, d)) for d in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]}, ofcolor(padded, TWO))
  O = trim(paint(padded, bordered))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Pad the grid:** Creates a new grid (`padded`) with a border of '0's around the input grid.
2. **Shift and paint:** Shifts the input grid by one cell in both directions and paints it onto the padded grid.
3. **Generate border:** For each cell with '2' in the padded grid, it generates four surrounding border cells with the value '3'.
4. **Paint and trim:** Paints the border onto the padded grid and then trims the outer '0' border to return the final output grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  dilated = mapply(dneighbors, ofcolor(I, TWO))
  O = paint(I, recolor(THREE, dilated - ofcolor(I, TWO)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '2' cells and dilate:** Similar to Version 2, this version identifies the indices of cells with '2'. Then, `dneighbors` finds the directly adjacent neighbors of each cell, effectively expanding the object by one cell in each orthogonal direction.
2. **Remove original cells and recolor:** The original '2' cell indices are removed from the dilated set, leaving only the border cells. These border cells are then recolored to '3'.
3. **Paint the border:** The recolored border cells are painted onto a copy of the input grid to generate the final output grid.
