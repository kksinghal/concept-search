## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects with the color '2' and drawing a border around them with the color '3'. However, the border is drawn only within the existing grid boundaries and does not extend beyond them.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. All '2' objects are identified.
2. A '3' border is drawn around them, but only within the existing grid space. For example, the '2' in the top right corner only gets a two-sided border because it touches the grid edges.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. The same logic as above applies here.
2. The clustered '2's in the top right corner demonstrate the border-drawing behavior within confined spaces.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Find objects on the grid
  filtered = colorfilter(objs, 2)  # Filter objects with color '2'
  O = paint(I, recolor(3, merge(apply(inbox, filtered)))) # Paint the inbox of '2' objects with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Identifies all connected objects ('2' in this case) within the grid `I`.
2. **`colorfilter(objs, 2)`:** Filters the objects to keep only those with the color '2'.
3. **`merge(apply(inbox, filtered))`:**  Calculates the "inbox" (the inner border) of each '2' object and merges them into a single set of indices.
4. **`paint(I, recolor(3, ...))`:**  Paints the indices obtained in the previous step with the color '3', effectively drawing the inner border.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  twos = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  border = mapply(lambda obj: difference(box(obj), obj), twos)
  return fill(I, 3, border)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Finds all objects in the grid.
2. **`twos = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)`:** Filters out objects that are not color '2'.
3. **`border = mapply(lambda obj: difference(box(obj), obj), twos)`:** For each '2' object, it calculates the difference between its bounding box and the object itself, resulting in the border indices.
4. **`fill(I, 3, border)`:** Fills the calculated border indices with the color '3'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 2:
        for di, dj in [(0,1),(1,0),(-1,0),(0,-1)]:
          ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
          if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] == 0:
            O = fill(O, 3, {(ni, nj)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through the grid and replaces any '0' that is directly adjacent to a '2' with a '3'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    padded = canvas(0, (len(I) + 2, len(I[0]) + 2))
    padded = paint(padded, shift(asobject(I), (1, 1)))
    objs = objects(padded, True, False, True)
    filtered = colorfilter(objs, 2)
    O = paint(padded, recolor(3, mapply(lambda obj: difference(dneighbors(centerofmass(obj)),toindices(obj)), filtered)))
    return trim(O)
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Padding:** The code pads the input grid with a border of zeros using `canvas` and `paint`.
2. **Object Detection:** It detects objects (connected components of the same color) in the padded grid using `objects`.
3. **Filtering by Color:** It filters the detected objects to keep only those with color '2' using `colorfilter`.
4. **Border Calculation:** For each object, it calculates the border as the set difference between its direct neighbors (`dneighbors`) and the object itself. This effectively identifies the cells adjacent to the object but not part of it.
5. **Border Painting:** It paints the calculated border cells with color '3' using `recolor` and `paint`.
6. **Unpadding:** Finally, the code removes the padding to obtain the final output using `trim`.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  filtered = colorfilter(objs, 2)
  border_indices = set()
  for obj in filtered:
    for cell in toindices(obj):
      for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, -1)]:
        ni, nj = cell[0] + di, cell[1] + dj
        if (ni, nj) not in toindices(obj) and 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] == 0:
          border_indices.add((ni, nj))
  return fill(I, 3, frozenset(border_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

This program explicitly iterates over each cell of each '2' object and checks its four direct neighbors. If a neighbor is not part of the object, within the grid boundaries, and has color '0', it's added to the `border_indices` set. Finally, these indices are filled with '3'.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same goal, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
