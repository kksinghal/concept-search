## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '2' and then expanding them upwards by one cell, but only filling in cells that originally contained the digit '0'.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* Each '2' object is expanded upwards by one cell. 
* The expansion only occurs in cells originally containing '0'.
* For instance, the '2' object at (2,2) expands to (1,2) but not (1,1) as (1,1) is not '0' in input. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The same upward expansion logic applies.
* Notice how the expansion of the '2' at (1,0) is blocked by the '2's at (0,8) and (0,9).

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  shifted_indices = mapply(lambda idx: (idx[0] - 1, idx[1]), ofcolor(I, 2)) # Get indices shifted upwards
  filtered_indices = intersection(shifted_indices, ofcolor(I, 0)) # Keep only indices with '0' originally
  O = fill(I, 3, filtered_indices) # Fill those indices with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify shifted indices:** We first get all indices of '2' using `ofcolor`. Then, `mapply` shifts these indices one step upwards.
2. **Filter valid indices:**  Using `intersection`, we keep only the shifted indices where the original grid (`I`) has a '0'.
3. **Fill the grid:** Finally, `fill` replaces the values at the filtered indices with '3' in the original grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = I  # Initialize output as input
  for i, j in product(range(len(I) - 1), range(len(I[0]))): # Iterate through each cell (except last row)
    if I[i + 1][j] == 2 and I[i][j] == 0:  # Check if the cell above is '2' and current cell is '0'
      O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j)})  # If true, fill the current cell with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and check:**  This version iterates through the grid and checks for each cell if the cell above is '2' and the current cell is '0'.
2. **Fill if condition met:** If the condition is met, it fills the current cell with '3'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)  # Get all objects
  shifted_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (-1, 0)), objs) # Shift each object upwards
  filtered_cells = mfilter(lambda obj: intersection(toindices(obj), ofcolor(I, 0)), shifted_objs)  # Get valid cells from shifted objects
  O = fill(I, 3, filtered_cells) # Fill valid cells with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get shifted objects:**  Extract all objects using `objects` and shift them upwards.
2. **Filter valid cells:**  For each shifted object, get the intersection with indices of '0' in the original grid. Then, merge all valid cells using `mfilter`.
3. **Fill the grid:** Fill the valid cells with '3'.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  expansion_area = mapply(lambda idx: {(idx[0] - 1, idx[1])}, ofcolor(I, 2)) # Find potential expansion area above '2's.
  valid_expansion = intersection(expansion_area, asindices(I)) # Limit expansion within grid bounds.
  filtered_indices = intersection(valid_expansion, ofcolor(I, 0))  # Only expand into cells initially containing '0'.
  return fill(I, 3, filtered_indices)  # Fill the valid expansion cells with '3'.
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Potential Expansion:** Calculate potential expansion area by shifting '2' indices upwards.
2. **Bound Check:** Ensure expansion stays within the grid boundaries.
3. **Valid Expansion:** Identify valid expansion cells by intersecting with initial '0' cells.
4. **Fill:** Fill valid expansion cells with '3'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(3, mfilter(lambda idx: index(I, add(idx, (-1, 0))) == 2 and I[idx[0]][idx[1]] == 0, asindices(I)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Cells:** Iterate through all indices, checking if the cell above contains '2' and the current cell contains '0'.
2. **Recolor and Paint:** Recolor the filtered indices to '3' and paint them onto the original grid.
