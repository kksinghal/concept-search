## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying horizontally connected objects composed of the digit '2' and then extending them to the right and left by one cell, filling those cells with the digit '3'. 

**Example:**

In Input_0, there's a horizontal sequence of '2's:

```
0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
```

This sequence gets extended with '3's on both ends:

```
0 0 2 0 0 0 3 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
```

The transformation only applies to horizontal connections, not vertical. Single, isolated '2's remain unchanged.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = I
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
      if I[i][j] == 2 and (I[i][j - 1] == 2 or I[i][j + 1] == 2):
        if I[i][j - 1] == 0:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j - 1)})
        if I[i][j + 1] == 0:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate:** Loop through each cell of the input grid `I`.
2. **Identify Horizontal Connections:** Check if the current cell is '2' and has another '2' immediately to its left or right.
3. **Extend with '3's:** If the condition is met, check if the cells to the left and right are '0'. If they are, fill them with '3' in the output grid `O`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  extensions = set()
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      for i, j in toindices(obj):
        if j > 0 and I[i][j-1] == 0:
          extensions.add((3, (i, j-1)))
        if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j+1] == 0:
          extensions.add((3, (i, j+1)))
  return paint(I, frozenset(extensions))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Use the `objects` function to extract horizontally connected components from the input grid.
2. **Find Extension Points:** For each object composed of '2's, identify the cells to their left and right that are '0'.
3. **Create Extension Set:** Add the identified cells to a set `extensions` with the value '3'.
4. **Paint Extensions:** Use the `paint` function to draw the extensions onto the input grid, creating the output.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    row = I[i]
    for j in range(1, len(row) - 1):
      if row[j] == 2 and (row[j-1] == 2 or row[j+1] == 2):
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j-1)}) if row[j-1] == 0 else O
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j+1)}) if row[j+1] == 0 else O
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate by Row:** Loop through each row of the input grid `I`.
2. **Identify Connections:** Within each row, check if a cell is '2' and has another '2' immediately to its left or right.
3. **Conditional Filling:** Use conditional statements to fill the left and right cells with '3' only if they are '0'.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          3 if 0 < j < w - 1 and I[i][j] == 0 and (I[i][j-1] == 2 or I[i][j+1] == 2) else I[i][j]
          for j in range(w)
      )
      for i in range(h)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **List Comprehension:** Utilize nested list comprehensions to construct the output grid directly.
2. **Conditional Value Assignment:** Use a conditional expression within the comprehension to change the value of a cell to '3' if it meets the criteria: it's not a border cell, it's currently '0', and it has a '2' to its left or right.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})
        if j > 0 and I[i][j-1] == 0:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j-1)})
        if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j+1] == 0:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j+1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** Start with an empty grid `O` of the same size as the input.
2. **Process Objects:** Iterate through connected objects in the input.
3. **Copy and Extend:** For each object of '2's, copy it to the output grid `O`. Then, extend it with '3's to the left and right as before.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL and providing a range of options to consider for optimization and readability.
