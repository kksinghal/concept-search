## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying objects with the value '2' and extending them horizontally with the value '3' to fill the spaces with the value '0' between other objects.

**Input_0:**

1. **Identify objects:** Locate all connected groups of the digit '2'.
2. **Horizontal extension:** For each '2' object, extend it left and right with '3's, but only if the adjacent cell contains a '0' and does not connect to another object. 

**Input_1:**

The same transformation logic applies to Input_1, demonstrating the generality of the rule.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               merge(apply(lambda obj: 
                           recolor(3, 
                                   frozenset((i, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) 
                                            for di in [-1, 1] if 0 <= j + di < len(I[0]) 
                                            and I[i][j + di] == 0)), 
                           objects(I, T, F, F))))

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Identify all connected objects in the grid `I`.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: ... , objects(I, T, F, F))`:** Iterate through each identified object.
3. **`recolor(3, frozenset((i, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) for di in [-1, 1] if 0 <= j + di < len(I[0]) and I[i][j + di] == 0))`:** For each object, create a new object with color '3' at positions adjacent to the original object's cells if those positions contain '0' and are within the grid boundaries.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Combine all the new objects (extensions) into a single set of cells.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paint the original grid `I` with the combined set of extensions.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I,
               merge(apply(lambda obj:
                           recolor(3,
                                   (hconcat((dneighbors((i,j)) & asindices(I)), 
                                            (dneighbors((i,j)) & asindices(I)))) 
                                   if color(obj)==2 else frozenset()),
                           objects(I,T,F,F))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I,T,F,F)`:**  Get all objects in the input grid.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: ...)`:**  Iterate over each object.
3. **`if color(obj)==2`**: If the object's color is 2.
4. **`(hconcat((dneighbors((i,j)) & asindices(I)),(dneighbors((i,j)) & asindices(I))))`**:  Get the direct horizontal neighbors of each cell in the object if they are within the grid.
5. **`recolor(3, ...)`:**  Create a new object with color 3 at the identified neighbor positions.
6. **`merge(...)`:** Combine all new objects into a single set.
7. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paint the original grid with the combined set.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fill_indices = mfilter(lambda obj:
                       frozenset((i, j + dj) for i, j in toindices(obj) 
                                 for dj in [-1, 1] if 0 <= j + dj < len(I[0]) 
                                 and index(I, (i, j + dj)) == 0),
                       objects(I, T, F, F))
  return paint(I, recolor(3, fill_indices))

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Identify all connected objects in the grid `I`.
2. **`mfilter(lambda obj: ..., objects(I, T, F, F))`:** Iterate through each identified object and collect the results into a single set.
3. **`frozenset((i, j + dj) for i, j in toindices(obj) for dj in [-1, 1] if 0 <= j + dj < len(I[0]) and index(I, (i, j + dj)) == 0)`:** For each object, get the indices of its left and right neighbors if they are within the grid boundaries and contain '0'.
4. **`recolor(3, fill_indices)`:** Create a new object with color '3' at the collected neighbor positions.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paint the original grid `I` with the newly created object.


**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_objs = sfilter(lambda obj: color(obj) == 2, objects(I, T, F, F))
  fill_indices = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((i, j + dj) for i, j in toindices(obj) 
                                             for dj in [-1, 1] if 0 <= j + dj < len(I[0]) 
                                             and I[i][j + dj] == 0), 
                        target_objs)
  return paint(I, recolor(3, fill_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Identify all connected objects in the grid `I`.
2. **`sfilter(lambda obj: color(obj) == 2, ...)`:** Filter the objects to keep only those with color '2'.
3. **`mapply(lambda obj: ..., target_objs)`:** Iterate through the '2'-colored objects and collect the results into a single set.
4. **`frozenset((i, j + dj) for i, j in toindices(obj) for dj in [-1, 1] if 0 <= j + dj < len(I[0]) and I[i][j + dj] == 0)`:**  For each '2'-colored object, get the indices of its left and right neighbors if they are within the grid boundaries and contain '0'.
5. **`recolor(3, fill_indices)`:** Create a new object with color '3' at the collected neighbor positions.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paint the original grid `I` with the newly created object.


**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  extensions = set()
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      for i, j in toindices(obj):
        for di in [-1, 1]:
          new_j = j + di
          if 0 <= new_j < len(I[0]) and I[i][new_j] == 0:
            extensions.add((3, (i, new_j)))
  return paint(I, frozenset(extensions))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extensions = set()`:** Initialize an empty set to store the extension cells.
2. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Identify all connected objects in the grid `I`.
3. **`for obj in ... :`:** Iterate through each identified object.
4. **`if color(obj) == 2:`:** Check if the object's color is '2'.
5. **`for i, j in toindices(obj):`:** Iterate through each cell of the '2'-colored object.
6. **`for di in [-1, 1]:`:** Iterate through left and right directions.
7. **`new_j = j + di`:** Calculate the column index of the neighbor cell.
8. **`if 0 <= new_j < len(I[0]) and I[i][new_j] == 0:`:** Check if the neighbor cell is within grid boundaries and contains '0'.
9. **`extensions.add((3, (i, new_j)))`:** Add the neighbor cell with color '3' to the `extensions` set. 
10. **`paint(I, frozenset(extensions))`:** Paint the original grid `I` with the collected extension cells.
