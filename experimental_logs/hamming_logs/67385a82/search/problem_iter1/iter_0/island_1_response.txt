## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces the color '3' with the color '8' under specific conditions, while leaving other colors unchanged. 

- **Horizontal Condition:** If a '3' is found in a row and another '3' exists to its right in the same row, the left '3' is replaced with an '8'.
- **Vertical Condition:** If a '3' is found in a column and another '3' exists below it in the same column, the upper '3' is replaced with an '8'.

**Example Breakdown (Input_2):**

```
Input_2:      Output_2:
3 3 0 3      8 8 0 3
3 3 0 0      8 8 0 0 
3 0 0 3      8 0 0 8
0 0 3 3      0 0 8 8 
```

- Top row: Both '3's are replaced with '8's due to the horizontal condition.
- Second row: Both '3's are replaced with '8's due to the horizontal condition.
- Third row: The first '3' is replaced with an '8' due to the vertical condition. The last '3' is replaced due to both conditions.
- Fourth row: Both '3's are replaced with '8's due to the vertical condition.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      8 if (v == 3 and any(grid[i][j+1:])) or (v == 3 and any(grid[k][j] == 3 for k in range(i + 1, h))) 
      else v 
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(grid)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

- Iterates through each cell in the grid.
- Uses `any(grid[i][j+1:])` to check for the horizontal condition (existence of '3' to the right).
- Uses `any(grid[k][j] == 3 for k in range(i + 1, h))` to check for the vertical condition (existence of '3' below).
- Replaces the cell with '8' if either condition is true, otherwise keeps the original value.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  new_objs = frozenset(
    recolor(8, obj) if size(sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda ij: any(k == ij[0] and l > ij[1] for k, l in toindices(obj)) or any(k > ij[0] and l == ij[1] for k, l in toindices(obj)))) > 0 else obj
    for obj in objs
  )
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), merge(new_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

- Extracts objects from the grid.
- For each object:
    - Checks if it contains '3's that satisfy either the horizontal or vertical condition.
    - If such '3's exist, recolors the entire object to '8'.
    - Otherwise, keeps the original object.
- Paints the modified objects onto a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      8 if (v == 3 and j < w - 1 and any(grid[i][j+1:])) or (v == 3 and i < h - 1 and any(grid[k][j] == 3 for k in range(i + 1, h))) 
      else v 
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(grid)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

- Similar to Version 1, but with added boundary checks (`j < w - 1` and `i < h - 1`) to prevent `IndexError` when checking for '3's at the rightmost column or bottom row.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return rot180(
    tuple(
      tuple(
        8 if (v == 3 and j > 0 and any(grid[i][:j])) or (v == 3 and i > 0 and any(grid[k][j] == 3 for k in range(i)))
        else v
        for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(grid)
    )
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

- Rotates the grid by 180 degrees.
- Checks for the conditions in the opposite direction (left and above) due to the rotation.
- Rotates the modified grid back to its original orientation.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  hori = tuple(
    tuple(
      8 if (j < w - 1 and v == 3 and any(grid[i][j+1:])) else v 
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(grid)
  )
  return tuple(
      tuple(
        8 if (v == 3 and i < h - 1 and any(hori[k][j] == 3 for k in range(i + 1, h))) 
        else v 
        for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(hori)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

- First, iterates through the grid and applies only the horizontal condition, storing the result in `hori`.
- Then, iterates through `hori` and applies the vertical condition, resulting in the final output. 
- This separation of conditions can potentially be more efficient than checking both simultaneously. 

These five program versions provide a diverse set of approaches to achieve the desired transformation while adhering to the DSL constraints.
