## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces specific occurrences of the digit '3' with the digit '8'. 

* **Input_0:**  The top two rows of '3's are replaced with '8's. 
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the top two rows of '3's are replaced, but only up to the last occurrence of '3' in each row.
* **Input_2:** The transformation forms a square of '8's in the top-left corner and bottom-right corner of the grid, replacing the original '3's. 
* **Input_3:** The top two rows follow the pattern of Input_1, while two squares of '8's are formed in the bottom left and bottom right, replacing the original '3's.

Essentially, the transformation targets '3's based on their position and potential to form specific shapes, primarily focusing on the top two rows and square formations.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          8 if (i < 2 and v == 3) or 
             ((i == len(I) - 1 or i == len(I) - 2) and 
              (j == len(r) - 1 or j == len(r) - 2) and v == 3) 
          else v 
          for j, v in enumerate(r)
      ) 
      for i, r in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through rows and cells:** The program iterates through each row (`i`, `r`) and cell (`j`, `v`) in the input grid `I`.
2. **Identify Target '3's:** It checks for '3's in the top two rows (`i < 2`) and '3's in the bottom two rows that would form a square. 
3. **Replace with '8's:**  If a '3' meets the conditions, it's replaced with '8'. Otherwise, the original value is retained.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  top_rows = tuple(tuple(8 if v == 3 else v for v in r) for r in I[:2])
  bottom_squares = objects(fill(I, 8, ofcolor(I, 3)), True, False, False)
  bottom_squares = mfilter(bottom_squares, lambda obj: square(obj) and lowermost(obj) >= len(I) - 2)
  return paint(paint(I, bottom_squares), top_rows) 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Handle Top Rows:** Replaces all '3's in the top two rows with '8's.
2. **Identify Bottom Squares:** Replaces all '3's with '8', finds objects, filters for squares in the bottom two rows.
3. **Combine Transformations:**  Paints the bottom squares, then paints the modified top rows onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  return tuple(
      tuple(
        8 if (i < 2 and v == 3) or 
           ((i >= h-2 and j >= w-2) and v == 3)
        else v 
        for j, v in enumerate(r)
      ) 
      for i, r in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Get Grid Dimensions:** Obtains height (`h`) and width (`w`) of the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Replace:** Iterates through cells, replacing '3's in the top two rows or the bottom-right 2x2 area with '8's.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  I = tuple(tuple(8 if (i < 2 and v == 3) else v for v in r) for i, r in enumerate(I))
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  for obj in objs:
    if square(obj) and color(obj) == 8 and lowermost(obj) >= len(I) - 2:
      I = paint(I, obj)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Handle Top Rows:** Replaces '3's in the top two rows with '8's.
2. **Find Bottom Squares:** Identifies square objects of color '8' in the bottom two rows.
3. **Paint Squares:** Paints the identified squares onto the grid. 

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if (i < 2 and I[i][j] == 3) or ((i >= len(I)-2 and j >= len(I[0])-2) and I[i][j] == 3):
        I = fill(I, 8, {(i, j)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through Cells:** Iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check Conditions:** Checks if the cell is in the top two rows and contains a '3', or if it's in the bottom-right 2x2 area and contains a '3'.
3. **Replace with '8':** If the conditions are met, replaces the '3' with an '8' by filling the cell with the value '8'.
