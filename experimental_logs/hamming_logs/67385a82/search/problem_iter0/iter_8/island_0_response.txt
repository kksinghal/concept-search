## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be replacing the largest object (considering objects with the same value as connected) in the grid with the value 8, except for the rightmost object.

**Input 0:** The largest object (3s) is replaced by 8s, except for the rightmost 3.

**Input 1:** The largest object (3s) is replaced by 8s, except for the rightmost object, which remains as 3.

**Input 2:** Same logic as before. The largest object is the one formed by the 3s.

**Input 3:** Similar logic applied, keeping the rightmost object unchanged.

## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) 
  largest_obj = argmax(objs, size)
  rightmost_obj = argmax(objs, lambda obj: rightmost(obj))
  for obj in objs:
    if obj == largest_obj and obj != rightmost_obj:
      I = paint(I, recolor(EIGHT, toindices(obj)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Find Largest and Rightmost:** Determine the largest object (`largest_obj`) and the rightmost object (`rightmost_obj`).
3. **Iterate and Replace:**  Iterate through each object. If an object is the largest and not the rightmost, replace it with the value 8.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  modified_grid = paint(I, recolor(EIGHT, toindices(argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), size))))
  return hconcat(modified_grid, hsplit(I, width(I))[-1:])[:shape(I)[0]]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Replace Largest:** Replace the largest object with the value 8.
2. **Split and Concatenate:** Split the modified grid and the original grid into columns. Concatenate all columns of the modified grid except the last one with the last column of the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  if len(objs) > 1:
    largest_obj = argmax(objs, size)
    I = paint(cover(I, largest_obj), recolor(EIGHT, toindices(largest_obj)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects in the grid.
2. **Conditional Replacement:** If there's more than one object, find the largest and replace it with the value 8. If there's only one object, no changes are made.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  largest_obj = argmax(objs, size)
  if rightmost(largest_obj) != width(I)-1:
    I = paint(I, recolor(EIGHT, toindices(largest_obj)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects in the grid.
2. **Check Rightmost Position:** Find the largest object. If its rightmost point is not on the last column of the grid, replace the object with the value 8.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  rightmost_obj = argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: rightmost(obj))
  modified_grid = paint(I, recolor(EIGHT, toindices(difference(asindices(I), toindices(rightmost_obj)))))
  return modified_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Rightmost Object:** Identify the rightmost object in the grid.
2. **Replace Everything Else:** Replace all cells that are not part of the rightmost object with the value 8.
