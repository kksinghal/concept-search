## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces the digit '3' with the digit '8' in specific locations within the grid. Here's a breakdown:

**General Rule:** Replace '3' with '8' except for the last element of each row and the last row of the grid.

**Examples:**

* **Input_0:** The '3's in the first two rows are replaced with '8's, except for the last '3' in each row. The last row remains unchanged.
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, '3's are replaced in all rows except the last one, and the last '3' of each row remains unchanged.
* **Input_2:**  The pattern holds, with the last element of each row and the last row remaining unchanged. 
* **Input_3:** The transformation applies consistently across all inputs.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return vconcat(apply(lambda row: tuple(8 if (j != len(row)-1 and v == 3) else v for j, v in enumerate(row)), grid[:-1]), grid[-1:])
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`grid[:-1]`:** Selects all rows except the last one.
2. **`apply(lambda row... )`:**  Applies a function to each row in the selected rows.
3. **`lambda row: tuple(...)`:** Defines an anonymous function that takes a row as input and returns a modified row as a tuple.
4. **`(j != len(row)-1 and v == 3)`:** Checks if the current element is not the last element in the row and if its value is '3'.
5. **`8 if ... else v`:**  If the condition is true, replace the element with '8'; otherwise, keep the original value.
6. **`vconcat(..., grid[-1:])`:**  Concatenates the modified rows with the last row of the original grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(tuple(8 if (j != len(row)-1 and v == 3) else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) if i != len(grid)-1 else row for i, row in enumerate(grid))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`enumerate(grid)`:**  Iterates over the rows of the grid with their indices.
2. **`... if i != len(grid)-1 else row`:**  Applies the transformation to all rows except the last one.
3. **`tuple(8 if (j != len(row)-1 and v == 3) else v for j, v in enumerate(row))`:** Similar logic to Version 1, replacing '3' with '8' except for the last element.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return vconcat(tuple(hconcat(replace(row[:-1], 3, 8), row[-1:]) for row in grid[:-1]), grid[-1:])
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`grid[:-1]`:** Selects all rows except the last one.
2. **`hconcat(replace(row[:-1], 3, 8), row[-1:])`:** For each row, replaces '3' with '8' in all elements except the last one and then horizontally concatenates the modified part with the last element.
3. **`vconcat(..., grid[-1:])`:** Vertically concatenates the modified rows with the last row.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(tuple(branch(j != len(grid[0])-1 and i != len(grid)-1 and v == 3, 8, v) for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(grid))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`enumerate(grid)`:** Iterates over the grid with row and column indices.
2. **`branch(j != len(grid[0])-1 and i != len(grid)-1 and v == 3, 8, v)`:** Checks if the current element is not in the last row or column and if its value is '3'. If true, replace with '8'; otherwise, keep the original value. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(hconcat(tuple(8 if j != len(row) - 1 and v == 3 else v for j, v in enumerate(row)), (row[-1],)) if i != len(grid)-1 else row for i, row in enumerate(grid))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`enumerate(grid)`:** Iterates over rows with indices.
2. **`... if i != len(grid)-1 else row`:** Applies the transformation to all rows except the last.
3. **`hconcat(..., (row[-1],))`:**  Horizontally concatenates the modified row (excluding the last element) with the last element.
4. **`tuple(8 if j != len(row) - 1 and v == 3 else v for j, v in enumerate(row))`:**  Replaces '3' with '8' except for the last element of the row.
