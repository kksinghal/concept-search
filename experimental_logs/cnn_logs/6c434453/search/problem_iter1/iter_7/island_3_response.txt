## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific cells within each object in the input grid and painting them with the color '2' on a blank canvas of the same size as the input, while maintaining their relative positions.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* For each object, the cells that are **not** on the leftmost column of the object are selected. 
* These selected cells are then shifted one cell down and one cell right.
* The color of these shifted cells is changed to '2'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The same logic applies to Input_1. Notice how the transformation consistently targets cells not on the leftmost edge of each object across both examples.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def transform_obj(obj):
    min_j = leftmost(obj)
    return frozenset((2, (i + 1, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j != min_j)
  
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
      merge(apply(transform_obj, objects(I, True, False, True)))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`transform_obj(obj)`:** This function takes an object as input. 
   - It determines the column index (`min_j`) of the leftmost cell in the object.
   - It iterates through each cell (`v`, `(i, j)`) of the object.
   - If the cell's column index (`j`) is not the leftmost (`min_j`), it includes a modified cell in the output:
     - The color is set to '2'.
     - The position is shifted down and right by adding 1 to both `i` and `j`.
2. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** This extracts objects from the input grid (`I`) with the following parameters:
   - `True`: Each object contains cells of a single color.
   - `False`: Objects are not connected diagonally.
   - `True`: The background color is excluded from object detection.
3. **`apply(transform_obj, ...)`:**  The `transform_obj` function is applied to each object extracted from the grid.
4. **`merge(...)`:** The results of transforming individual objects are combined into a single set of cells.
5. **`paint(canvas(...), ...)`:**  
   - `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`: Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
   - The transformed cells are then 'painted' onto this canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(
        canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
        frozenset(
            (2, (i + 1, j + 1))
            for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)
            for v, (i, j) in obj
            if j != leftmost(obj)
        )
    )
```

**Explanation:**

This version streamlines the code by using a single list comprehension within the `paint` function:

1. **`(2, (i + 1, j + 1)) ...`**: This part defines the output cell, setting the color to '2' and shifting the position.
2. **`for obj in objects(...)`**: It iterates through the objects extracted from the input grid.
3. **`for v, (i, j) in obj`**: It then iterates through each cell within the current object.
4. **`if j != leftmost(obj)`**: The condition ensures that only cells not on the leftmost column are included in the output.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(
        canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
        mapply(
            lambda obj: frozenset(
                (2, add((i, j), (1, 1))) for v, (i, j) in obj if j != leftmost(obj)
            ),
            objects(I, True, False, True),
        ),
    )
```

**Explanation:**

This version introduces the `mapply` function for a more functional approach:

1. **`lambda obj: ...`**: A lambda function is defined to process each object.
2. **`frozenset(...)`**: The lambda function returns a frozenset of transformed cells for the given object.
3. **`mapply(..., objects(...))`**: `mapply` applies the lambda function to each object extracted by `objects` and merges the results.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_objects = frozenset(
    shift(
      recolor(
        2,
        frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j != leftmost(obj))
      ),
      (1, 1)
    )
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)
  )
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(shifted_objects))
```

**Explanation:**

This version breaks down the transformation into distinct steps for clarity:

1. **`shifted_objects`**:  A frozenset is created to store the transformed objects.
2. **Inside the list comprehension:**
    -  **`frozenset((v, (i, j)) ...)`**: Selects cells not on the leftmost column.
    -  **`recolor(2, ...)`**:  Colors the selected cells with '2'.
    -  **`shift(..., (1, 1))`**: Shifts the recolored cells.
3. **`merge(shifted_objects)`**: Combines the transformed objects.
4. **`paint(...)`**:  Paints the combined objects onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def transform_cell(v, i, j, min_j):
    return (2, (i + 1, j + 1)) if j != min_j else (mostcolor(I), (i, j))
  
  return paint(
    canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
    frozenset(
      transform_cell(v, i, j, leftmost(obj))
      for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)
      for v, (i, j) in obj 
    )
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a dedicated `transform_cell` function for a more modular structure:

1. **`transform_cell(v, i, j, min_j)`**: 
    - Takes the color and position of a cell, along with the leftmost column index of its object.
    - Returns the transformed cell:
       - If the cell is not in the leftmost column, it sets the color to '2' and shifts the position.
       - Otherwise, it returns the cell with the background color and its original position.
2. The rest of the structure follows a similar logic to previous versions, applying the `transform_cell` function to each cell of each object and painting the results on the canvas. 

These five versions demonstrate diverse ways to achieve the same transformation in the DSL, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the language. Each version leverages different functions and structuring techniques, showcasing various approaches to problem-solving within the DSL's constraints.
