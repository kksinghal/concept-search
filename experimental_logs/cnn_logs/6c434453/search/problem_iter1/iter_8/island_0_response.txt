## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation shifts all objects diagonally down and to the right by one unit.  Objects that would be shifted out of bounds have their corresponding cells removed in the output. The color of the shifted objects is changed to 2.

**Example:**

* Input grid cell (0,0) contains value 1. 
* This cell is shifted to (1,1) in the output and its value changed to 2. 
* However, the input cell (2, 9) which contains value 1, when shifted to (3,10) falls outside the grid boundaries and is therefore removed in the output.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct programs that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), 
               sfilter(
                 apply(lambda c: (2, (c[0] + 1, c[1] + 1)), asindices(I)), 
                 lambda x: 0 <= x[1][0] < len(I) and 0 <= x[1][1] < len(I[0]))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asindices(I)`:**  Gets all indices of the input grid `I`.
2. **`apply(...)`:**  Applies a lambda function to each index, shifting it diagonally by adding 1 to both row and column values. It also sets the color of the shifted cell to 2.
3. **`sfilter(...)`:**  Filters the shifted cells, keeping only those within the bounds of the original grid's dimensions.
4. **`canvas(0, shape(I))`:** Creates a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the value 0.
5. **`paint(...)`:** Paints the filtered shifted cells (now with color 2) onto the blank canvas, resulting in the final output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  shifted = shift(asobject(I), (1, 1))
  recolored = recolor(2, shifted)
  filtered = sfilter(recolored, lambda cell: 0 <= cell[1][0] < len(I) and 0 <= cell[1][1] < len(I[0]))
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), filtered)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asobject(I)`:** Converts the input grid to an object representation.
2. **`shift(..., (1,1))`:** Shifts all cells in the object representation diagonally down and right by one unit.
3. **`recolor(2, ...)`:** Recolors all cells in the shifted object to have the value 2.
4. **`sfilter(...)`:** Filters the recolored cells, keeping only those that fall within the boundaries of the original grid.
5. **`canvas(0, shape(I))`:** Creates a new canvas of the same size as the input grid, filled with 0s.
6. **`paint(...)`:**  Paints the filtered and recolored object onto the new canvas to generate the final output.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
  def shift_cell(cell):
    i, j = cell
    new_i, new_j = i + 1, j + 1
    return (2, (new_i, new_j)) if 0 <= new_i < len(I) and 0 <= new_j < len(I[0]) else (I[i][j], (-1, -1))

  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), sfilter(apply(shift_cell, asobject(I)), lambda x: x[1] != (-1, -1)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shift_cell(cell)`:** Defines a function to shift a cell diagonally. If the shifted cell is within bounds, it assigns the color 2. If out of bounds, it marks the cell with (-1, -1) for later removal.
2. **`asobject(I)`:**  Converts the input grid to an object.
3. **`apply(..., ...)`:**  Applies `shift_cell` to each cell in the object.
4. **`sfilter(...)`:** Filters out cells marked as out-of-bounds by `shift_cell` (those with indices (-1, -1)).
5. **`canvas(0, shape(I))`:** Creates a new canvas of the same size as the input grid, filled with 0s.
6. **`paint(...)`:** Paints the filtered and shifted cells onto the new canvas to generate the final output.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
  def valid_shift(i, j):
    return 0 <= i + 1 < len(I) and 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0])
  
  new_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if valid_shift(i, j):
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, 2, {(i + 1, j + 1)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`valid_shift(i, j)`:** This helper function checks if a shift from position (i, j) would result in a valid position within the grid.
2. **`new_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))`:** A new grid is created with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with zeros.
3. The nested loops iterate over each cell in the input grid. 
4. **`if valid_shift(i, j):`**:  If a diagonal shift from the current cell's position is valid, the corresponding cell in the new grid is filled with the value 2.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if 0 <= i - 1 < len(I) and 0 <= j - 1 < len(I[0]) and I[i - 1][j - 1] != 0 else 0 
      for j in range(len(I[0]))
    )
    for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. This program uses nested list comprehensions to directly construct the output grid. 
2. For each cell in the output grid at position (i, j), it checks if there exists a valid cell diagonally up and to the left in the input grid (i-1, j-1). 
3. If such a valid cell exists and its value is not 0, the output cell is assigned the value 2. 
4. Otherwise, the output cell is set to 0.
