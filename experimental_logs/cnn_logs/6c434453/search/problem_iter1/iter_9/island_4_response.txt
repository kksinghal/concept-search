## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:** The transformation involves identifying the outline of objects (groups of connected, non-background digits) and replacing the outermost layer of these objects with the digit '2'. Background digits ('0' in this case) are left unchanged.

**Input 1 to Output 1:** Similar to the previous transformation, this one also focuses on object outlines.  However, only the topmost and rightmost layers of the object outlines are replaced with '2'. Background digits remain untouched.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg_color = mostcolor(I)
  outline = set()
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != bg_color:
        if (i == 0 or I[i-1][j] == bg_color or 
            j == len(I[0])-1 or I[i][j+1] == bg_color):
          outline.add((i,j))
  return fill(I, 2, frozenset(outline))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background:** `bg_color = mostcolor(I)` determines the most frequent digit, representing the background.
2. **Find Outline:** The nested loops iterate through each cell. If a cell is not background AND it's at the top/right edge of the grid OR has a background neighbor above or to its right, it's added to the `outline` set.
3. **Fill Outline:** `fill(I, 2, frozenset(outline))` creates a new grid with '2' replacing the original values at the indices stored in `outline`.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  outline = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if (i == 0 or (i-1, j) not in toindices(obj) or 
          j == len(I[0])-1 or (i, j+1) not in toindices(obj)):
        outline.add((i,j))
  return fill(I, 2, frozenset(outline))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies distinct objects within the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Find Outline:**  For each object, the code iterates through its cells. A cell is considered part of the outline if it's at the grid edge OR if its upper or right neighbor doesn't belong to the same object.
3. **Fill Outline:** Similar to Version 1, the identified outline indices are filled with '2'.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
           fill(I, 2, frozenset((i,j) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0])) if i==0 or j==len(I[0])-1)),
           asobject(I)
         )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Outline Grid:** A new grid is created where all cells on the top and right edges are filled with '2', effectively creating an outline frame.
2. **Overlay Original Objects:** The original objects from the input grid are "painted" onto this outline grid. This retains the original object shapes while incorporating the outline.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    cover(I, mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((i,j) for i,j in toindices(obj) if i!=0 and j!=len(I[0])-1), objects(I, False, False, True))),
    mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((2, (i,j)) for i,j in toindices(obj) if i==0 or j==len(I[0])-1), objects(I, False, False, True))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, False, False, True)` extracts non-background objects.
2. **Remove Inner Cells:** For each object, its inner cells (not on the top or right edge) are identified and used to "cover" (replace with background color) the original grid.
3. **Paint Outline:**  For each object, its cells on the top or right edge are painted onto the modified grid with the color '2'.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if (j == len(row)-1 or i == 0) and v != bg else v 
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    ) 
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background:** `bg = mostcolor(I)` determines the background color.
2. **Iterate and Modify:** Nested loops iterate through each cell. If a cell is not background AND it's located on the top row or rightmost column, its value is replaced with '2'. Otherwise, the original value is kept.
