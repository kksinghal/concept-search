## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** The transformation involves identifying all objects (connected regions of the same digit excluding the background) and then shifting them diagonally. Objects in the top half of the grid are shifted up-left (-1, -1), while objects in the bottom half are shifted down-right (1, 1). Finally, all shifted objects are recolored to '2'.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:** The transformation follows the same logic as Input_0 -> Output_0. All objects are identified, shifted diagonally based on their position relative to the grid's horizontal midline, and recolored to '2'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_version_1(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Extract objects
  shifted_objs = frozenset({
      recolor(2, shift(obj, (-1,-1))) if center(obj)[0] < len(I) // 2 else recolor(2, shift(obj, (1,1))) 
      for obj in objs
  })  # Shift and recolor objects based on their center's y-coordinate
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), shifted_objs)  # Paint on canvas 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies all objects in the input grid 'I'.
2. **Shift and Recolor:**  We iterate through each object 'obj' and determine its center's y-coordinate using `center(obj)[0]`. If it's less than half the grid's height (`len(I) // 2`), the object is shifted up-left using `shift(obj, (-1,-1))`. Otherwise, it's shifted down-right using `shift(obj, (1, 1))`.  The shifted object is then recolored to '2' using `recolor(2, shifted_obj)`.
3. **Paint on Canvas:** A new canvas is created with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid using `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`.  The shifted and recolored objects are then painted onto this canvas using `paint`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_version_2(I):
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
               frozenset({recolor(2, shift(obj, (1, 1) if uppermost(obj) >= len(I) // 2 else (-1, -1)))
                          for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Similar to Version 1, this version starts by extracting objects from the input grid.
2. **Conditional Shifting and Recoloring:** It directly applies shifting and recoloring within a single set comprehension.  For each object, it checks if its uppermost row (`uppermost(obj)`) is in the bottom half of the grid (`>= len(I) // 2`). If true, it shifts down-right (1, 1); otherwise, it shifts up-left (-1, -1). The shifted object is then recolored to '2'.
3. **Paint on Canvas:**  Analogous to Version 1, it creates a blank canvas and paints the transformed objects onto it.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_version_3(I):
  def transform_object(obj):
    return recolor(2, shift(obj, (1, 1) if uppermost(obj) >= len(I) // 2 else (-1, -1)))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), apply(transform_object, objects(I, True, False, True)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`transform_object` Function:** This version defines a separate function `transform_object` to encapsulate the shifting and recoloring logic for each object. The function checks the object's position and applies the appropriate diagonal shift before recoloring it to '2'.
2. **Apply Transformation:**  It extracts objects from the input grid and uses `apply` to apply the `transform_object` function to each object.
3. **Paint Transformed Objects:** Finally, it creates a blank canvas and paints the transformed objects onto it.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_version_4(I):
  def get_shift(obj):
    return (1, 1) if uppermost(obj) >= len(I) // 2 else (-1, -1)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
               frozenset({recolor(2, shift(obj, get_shift(obj))) for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`get_shift` Function:** This version defines a function `get_shift` that determines the appropriate diagonal shift for an object based on its position. 
2. **Apply Shift and Recolor:** It extracts objects and uses a set comprehension to apply the shift returned by `get_shift` and recolor each object to '2'.
3. **Paint on Canvas:** It creates a new canvas and paints the transformed objects.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_version_5(I):
  def transform_object(obj, grid_height):
    shift_direction = (1, 1) if uppermost(obj) >= grid_height // 2 else (-1, -1)
    return recolor(2, shift(obj, shift_direction))

  grid_height = len(I)
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
      apply(rbind(transform_object, grid_height), objects(I, True, False, True))
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`transform_object` Function:** Similar to previous versions, it defines a function to handle the transformation logic for each object. This version takes an additional argument, `grid_height`, to determine the shift direction.
2. **Partial Application:** It uses `rbind` to create a partially applied version of `transform_object` with `grid_height` pre-filled. 
3. **Apply Transformation and Paint:** It extracts objects, applies the partially applied `transform_object` function to each object, and then paints the transformed objects onto a new canvas.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformation using the DSL. They highlight the use of functions, set comprehensions, partial application, and different ways to structure the code while achieving the same result.
