## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying the leftmost column of each object (excluding the background) and shifting the remaining cells of that object one row down and one column to the right. The color of the shifted cells is changed to '2'.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- The leftmost column of the '1' object at the top left remains unchanged. 
- The remaining '1's are shifted down by one row and right by one column and recolored to '2'.
- The isolated '1's remain unchanged.
- The '1' object at the bottom left is shifted similarly.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- The same logic applies to Input_1. The leftmost columns of each '1' object remain, while the rest are shifted and recolored.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using different approaches and DSL function combinations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(
        canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
        frozenset(
            recolor(
                2, 
                shift(
                    frozenset(
                        (v, (i + 1, j + 1)) 
                        for v, (i, j) in obj 
                        if j != leftmost(obj) 
                    ), 
                    (0, 0)
                )
            ) 
            for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)
        )
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Identifies all objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **`for obj in objects(...)`:**  Iterates through each object.
3. **`leftmost(obj)`:** Finds the column index of the leftmost cell in the object.
4. **`frozenset((v, (i + 1, j + 1)) ... if j != leftmost(obj))`:**  Creates a new object containing all cells except those in the leftmost column, shifted down by one row and right by one column.
5. **`recolor(2, ...)`:** Recolors the shifted object to '2'.
6. **`paint(canvas(...), ...)`:**  Paints the transformed objects onto a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def transform_obj(obj):
    min_j = leftmost(obj)
    return frozenset((2, (i + 1, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j != min_j)
  
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
      frozenset(transform_obj(obj) for obj in objects(I, True, False, True))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

- Similar to version 1, but uses a separate function `transform_obj` to encapsulate the logic for shifting and recoloring each object.
- Improves readability by pre-calculating the `min_j` (leftmost column) for each object.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    transformed_objs = set()
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
        leftmost_col = leftmost(obj)
        shifted_obj = frozenset((2, (i + 1, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j != leftmost_col)
        transformed_objs.add(shifted_obj)
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), frozenset(transformed_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

- Uses a loop to iterate over objects and a separate set (`transformed_objs`) to store the transformed objects before painting them onto the canvas.
- Employs more descriptive variable names for clarity.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
      mpapply(
          lambda obj, offset: recolor(2, shift(remove(extract(obj, lambda x: x[1][1] == leftmost(obj)), obj), offset)),
          objects(I, True, False, True),
          repeat((1, 1), size(objects(I, True, False, True)))
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

- Utilizes `mpapply` to apply a lambda function to each object and a corresponding offset.
- `extract(obj, lambda x: x[1][1] == leftmost(obj))` retrieves a cell from the leftmost column of the object.
- `remove` then removes this cell from the object before shifting and recoloring.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def shift_right_down(obj):
        lm = leftmost(obj)
        return frozenset((2, (i+1, j+1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j != lm)
    
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
                frozenset(map(shift_right_down, objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

- Defines a helper function `shift_right_down` to handle the transformation logic for each object.
- Employs `map` to apply `shift_right_down` to each object in the input grid.

These five versions demonstrate distinct ways of achieving the desired transformation using the DSL's functions. They utilize different loops, function applications, and data structures, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL.
