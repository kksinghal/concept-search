## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:** The smallest object of the least common color (a single cell with value '1') is selected. This object is then shifted diagonally up and to the right by one unit and recolored to '2'. 

**Input 1 -> Output 1:** Similar to the previous transformation, the smallest object of the least common color (again a single cell with value '1') is selected. This object is also shifted diagonally up and to the right by one unit and recolored to '2'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  target_value = leastcommon(I)
  target_objs = colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), target_value)
  smallest_obj = argmin(target_objs, size)
  new_obj = recolor(2, shift(smallest_obj, (-1, 1)))
  return paint(cover(I, smallest_obj), new_obj) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the least common color:** `target_value = leastcommon(I)` finds the least frequent color in the grid.
2. **Extract objects of the target color:** `target_objs = colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), target_value)` isolates objects made of the least common color.
3. **Find the smallest object:** `smallest_obj = argmin(target_objs, size)` determines the smallest object among those with the target color.
4. **Shift and recolor the object:** `new_obj = recolor(2, shift(smallest_obj, (-1, 1)))` creates a new object, shifted diagonally up and to the right by one unit and recolored to '2'.
5. **Update the grid:** `return paint(cover(I, smallest_obj), new_obj)` paints the new object onto the grid after erasing the original.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  def is_target(obj):
    return color(obj) == leastcolor(I) and size(obj) == 1
  target_obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), is_target)
  return paint(I, recolor(2, shift(target_obj, (-1, 1)))) if target_obj else I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define target object criteria:** `is_target(obj)` checks if an object has the least common color and is a single cell.
2. **Find the target object:** `target_obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), is_target)` finds the first object matching the criteria.
3. **Conditional modification:** If a target object is found, `paint(I, recolor(2, shift(target_obj, (-1, 1))))` shifts and recolors it, then paints it on the grid. Otherwise, the original grid is returned.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == leastcolor(I) and sum(row.count(I[i][j]) for row in I) == 1:
        I = paint(cover(I, {(I[i][j], (i, j))}), {(2, (i - 1, j + 1))})
        return I
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through the grid:** The program iterates over each cell in the grid.
2. **Check for target cell:** It identifies a cell with the least common color that appears only once in the grid.
3. **Modify and return:** If found, the cell is covered, a new '2' cell is painted diagonally, and the modified grid is returned. Otherwise, the original grid is returned.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  min_color = leastcolor(I)
  locs = [(i,j) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0])) if I[i][j] == min_color]
  if len(locs) == 1:
    i, j = locs[0]
    new_i, new_j = i - 1, j + 1
    if 0 <= new_i < len(I) and 0 <= new_j < len(I[0]):
      I = paint(cover(I, {(min_color, (i, j))}), {(2, (new_i, new_j))})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the least common color and its locations:** `min_color = leastcolor(I)` and `locs` store the color and its coordinates.
2. **Check for single occurrence:** If the least common color appears only once, its location is extracted.
3. **Modify and return:**  The cell is covered, a new '2' is painted diagonally, and the modified grid is returned. If the color appears multiple times, the original grid is returned.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  def condition(obj):
    return color(obj) == leastcolor(I) and all(n == 1 for n in rapply(lambda obj: colorcount(I, color(obj)), objects(I, True, False, False)))
  smallest_obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), condition)
  return paint(cover(I, smallest_obj), recolor(2, shift(smallest_obj, (-1, 1)))) if smallest_obj else I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define a condition to find the target object:** The `condition(obj)` function checks if an object has the least common color and if all objects in the grid have a color count of 1 (meaning each color appears only once).
2. **Extract the target object:** `smallest_obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), condition)` retrieves the object matching the criteria.
3. **Conditional modification:** If a target object is found, it is shifted, recolored to '2', and painted onto the grid after erasing the original. Otherwise, the original grid is returned.

These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation while utilizing various DSL functions. Each version offers a different way to identify the target object and modify the grid accordingly, demonstrating diverse solutions within the DSL.
