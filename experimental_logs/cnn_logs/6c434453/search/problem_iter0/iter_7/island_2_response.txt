## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

The transformation identifies the smallest and largest objects in the input grid (excluding the background). It then recolors both of these objects to the value '2'. Finally, the smallest object is moved to the right of the largest object, with a single empty column separating them.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

This transformation follows the same logic as the previous one. The smallest and largest objects are found, re-colored to '2', and then the smallest object is repositioned to the right of the largest object with a single column gap.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the largest and smallest objects
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  largest_obj = argmax(objs, size)
  smallest_obj = argmin(objs, size)

  # Calculate the target position for the smallest object
  target_j = rightmost(largest_obj) + 1

  # Create a blank canvas
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))

  # Recolor and paint the objects
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, largest_obj))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(smallest_obj, (0, target_j - leftmost(smallest_obj)))))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects in the input grid using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Find Largest & Smallest:** Find the largest and smallest objects using `argmax(objs, size)` and `argmin(objs, size)`, respectively.
3. **Calculate Target:** Determine the target column for the smallest object by finding the column immediately to the right of the largest object's rightmost column (`rightmost(largest_obj) + 1`).
4. **Create Canvas:** Generate a blank canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the input's background color (`canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))`).
5. **Recolor & Paint:**
   - Recolor the largest object to '2' and paint it onto the canvas.
   - Recolor the smallest object to '2', shift it to the target column, and then paint it onto the canvas.
6. **Return Output:** Return the transformed grid.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find largest and smallest objects, excluding background
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  largest_obj = argmax(objs, size)
  smallest_obj = argmin(objs, size)

  # Shift smallest object next to the largest object
  shift_amount = (0, rightmost(largest_obj) - leftmost(smallest_obj) + 1)
  shifted_smallest = shift(smallest_obj, shift_amount)

  # Recolor both objects
  recolored_largest = recolor(2, largest_obj)
  recolored_smallest = recolor(2, shifted_smallest)

  # Paint on a blank canvas
  canvas_color = mostcommon(I)
  O = paint(canvas(canvas_color, shape(I)), recolored_largest)
  O = paint(O, recolored_smallest)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects excluding the background.
2. **Find Largest & Smallest:** Locate the largest and smallest objects.
3. **Calculate Shift:** Calculate the horizontal shift needed to place the smallest object to the right of the largest.
4. **Shift Smallest:** Shift the smallest object to the calculated position.
5. **Recolor Objects:** Recolor both the largest and shifted smallest object to '2'.
6. **Paint on Canvas:** Create a blank canvas with the background color and paint both recolored objects onto it.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Identify objects and sort by size
  objs = sorted(objects(I, T, F, T), key=size)

  # Extract the smallest and largest objects
  smallest_obj = objs[0]
  largest_obj = objs[-1]

  # Calculate the target position for the smallest object
  target_pos = (uppermost(smallest_obj), rightmost(largest_obj) + 1)

  # Shift the smallest object to the target position
  shifted_obj = shift(smallest_obj, subtract(target_pos, ulcorner(smallest_obj)))

  # Paint both objects onto a blank canvas with color '2'
  O = paint(paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), recolor(2, largest_obj)), recolor(2, shifted_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify & Sort:** Identify all objects excluding the background and sort them by size.
2. **Extract Smallest & Largest:** Retrieve the smallest and largest objects from the sorted list.
3. **Calculate Target Position:** Determine the target position for the smallest object's upper-left corner.
4. **Shift Smallest:** Shift the smallest object to the calculated position.
5. **Paint on Canvas:** Create a blank canvas, paint the recolored largest object, then paint the recolored and shifted smallest object.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Identify the largest and smallest objects
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  largest_obj = argmax(objs, size)
  smallest_obj = argmin(objs, size)

  # Calculate the shift distance
  shift_dist = (0, rightmost(largest_obj) - leftmost(smallest_obj) + 1)

  # Create a blank canvas
  bg_color = mostcommon(I)
  O = canvas(bg_color, shape(I))

  # Recolor and paint objects onto the canvas
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, largest_obj))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(smallest_obj, shift_dist)))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects excluding the background.
2. **Find Largest & Smallest:** Locate the largest and smallest objects.
3. **Calculate Shift Distance:** Calculate the horizontal distance to move the smallest object.
4. **Create Canvas:** Create a blank canvas with the background color.
5. **Recolor & Paint:**
   - Recolor the largest object to '2' and paint it onto the canvas.
   - Recolor the smallest object to '2', shift it by the calculated distance, and then paint it onto the canvas.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Identify objects, their sizes, and indices
  objs = list(objects(I, T, F, T))
  obj_sizes = apply(size, objs)
  largest_idx = argmax(range(len(objs)), lambda i: obj_sizes[i])
  smallest_idx = argmin(range(len(objs)), lambda i: obj_sizes[i])

  # Extract the largest and smallest objects
  largest_obj = objs[largest_idx]
  smallest_obj = objs[smallest_idx]

  # Calculate target position for the smallest object
  target_j = rightmost(largest_obj) + 1

  # Create a blank canvas
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))

  # Recolor and paint objects onto the canvas
  for idx, obj in enumerate(objs):
    if idx == largest_idx:
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, obj))
    elif idx == smallest_idx:
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(obj, (0, target_j - leftmost(obj)))))
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects & Sizes:** Identify all objects and their corresponding sizes.
2. **Find Indices:** Find the indices of the largest and smallest objects within the `objs` list.
3. **Extract Objects:**  Extract the largest and smallest objects using their calculated indices.
4. **Calculate Target:** Determine the target column for the smallest object.
5. **Create Canvas:** Generate a blank canvas with the background color.
6. **Recolor & Paint:** Iterate through all objects:
   - If it's the largest, recolor it to '2' and paint it.
   - If it's the smallest, recolor it to '2', shift it to the target column, and paint it.
   - Otherwise, paint the object without any changes.

These five versions each offer a distinct approach to solving the problem using different combinations of DSL functions. They demonstrate the flexibility and diversity possible when approaching a task with a given set of programming tools.
