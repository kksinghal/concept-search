## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves shifting objects within the grid by a specific offset, but only if the object's color is not the background color. The offset appears to be (1, 1), meaning objects are shifted one row down and one column right. If a shifted cell falls outside the grid's boundaries, it wraps around to the opposite side.

**Example:**

* **Input_0:** The object with color '1' is shifted down and right. Notice how the bottom-most '1's wrap around to the top and the right-most '1's wrap around to the left.
* **Input_1:**  The same logic applies. The object with color '1' is shifted.  Since the background color is '0', it remains unaffected.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  shifted_objects = frozenset(
      frozenset(
          (v, ((i + 1) % len(I), (j + 1) % len(I[0])))
          for v, (i, j) in obj
          if v != bg
      )
      for obj in objects(I, True, False, False)
  )
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), shifted_objects)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:**  Identifies the background color in the input grid `I`.
2. **`shifted_objects = ...`:** Generates a new set of objects where each object from the input is shifted by (1, 1) using modulo operation ( `%`) for wrap-around. The background color is excluded from shifting.
3. **`return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), shifted_objects)`:** Creates a new canvas filled with the background color and paints the shifted objects onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted = rot270(tuple(tuple(v for j, v in enumerate(r) if (i + 1, j + 1) in asindices(I)) for i, r in enumerate(I)))
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          shifted[i][j] if shifted[i][j] != mostcolor(I) else I[i][j]
          for j in range(len(I[0]))
      )
      for i in range(len(I))
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted = ...`:** Shifts all elements of the grid down and right by 1, wrapping around using `asindices(I)` to check for valid indices and rotating the grid for easier handling of edge cases.
2. **`return ...`:**  Iterates through the shifted grid and the original grid simultaneously. If the value in the shifted grid is not the background color, it's kept; otherwise, the value from the original grid is used.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          I[(i + 1) % h][(j + 1) % w] if I[(i + 1) % h][(j + 1) % w] != mostcolor(I) else I[i][j]
          for j in range(w)
      )
      for i in range(h)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h, w = len(I), len(I[0])`:**  Gets the height and width of the input grid.
2. **`return ...`:**  Iterates over each cell in the grid. If the value in the cell shifted down and right is not the background color, it is used; otherwise, the original value is kept. Modulo operation handles wrap-around. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  new_grid = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != bg:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, val, {(i + 1) % len(I), (j + 1) % len(I[0])})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:** Determines the background color.
2. **`new_grid = canvas(bg, shape(I))`:** Creates a new canvas with the background color.
3. **`for ... in ...`:**  Iterates through each cell, and if the cell's value is not the background color, it fills the corresponding shifted location in the `new_grid` with the cell's value.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      cover(I, asindices(I)),
      shift(asobject(I), (1, 1))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`cover(I, asindices(I))`:** Creates a blank canvas with the background color by "covering" the entire input grid.
2.  **`shift(asobject(I), (1, 1))`:** Shifts all cells in the grid down and right by 1, handling wrap-around automatically.
3.  **`paint(...)`:** Paints the shifted objects onto the blank canvas.
