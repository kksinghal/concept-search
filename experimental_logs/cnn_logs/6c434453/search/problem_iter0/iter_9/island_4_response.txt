## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Object Isolation:** The transformation focuses on the object formed by the digit '1' (let's call it 'Object 1').
2. **Recoloring:** Object 1 is recolored to the digit '2'.
3. **Translation:** Object 1 is shifted two cells downwards and one cell to the right. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. **Object Isolation:**  Similar to the previous transformation, the focus is on the object formed by the digit '1' (Object 1).
2. **Recoloring:** Object 1 is recolored to the digit '2'.
3. **Rotation:** Object 1 is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
4. **Translation:** Object 1 is shifted to the right until its leftmost cell aligns with the rightmost cell of the object formed by the digit '0' on the same row. 


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_d8c310e9(I):
  obj1 = first(objects(I, T, F, T)) 
  obj1 = recolor(2, obj1)
  obj1 = shift(obj1, (2, 1)) 
  O = paint(I, obj1)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj1 = first(objects(I, T, F, T))`**: This line extracts the object formed by the digit '1' (Object 1) from the input grid `I`. We use `T, F, T` to specify that we want univalued objects, no diagonal connections, and to exclude the background.
2. **`obj1 = recolor(2, obj1)`**: This line recolors Object 1 to the digit '2'.
3. **`obj1 = shift(obj1, (2, 1))`**: This line shifts Object 1 two cells down and one cell right.
4. **`O = paint(I, obj1)`**: This line paints the modified Object 1 onto the input grid `I`, effectively applying the transformation.
5. **`return O`**: The transformed grid `O` is returned.

This version directly implements the observed transformation rules without unnecessary calculations.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_d8c310e9(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  obj1 = argmax(objs, size)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    if obj == obj1:
      obj = recolor(2, obj)
      obj = shift(obj, (2, 1))
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Extracts all objects from the input grid.
2. **`obj1 = argmax(objs, size)`**: Finds the largest object, assuming it's the target object.
3. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`**: Determines the background color.
4. **`O = canvas(bg, shape(I))`**: Creates an empty canvas with the same size and background as the input.
5. **`for obj in objs`**: Iterates through each object.
6. **`if obj == obj1`**: If the current object is the target object:
    - **`obj = recolor(2, obj)`**: Recolor it to '2'.
    - **`obj = shift(obj, (2, 1))`**: Shift it two cells down and one cell right.
7. **`O = paint(O, obj)`**: Paints the current object (modified or not) onto the canvas.
8. **`return O`**: Returns the transformed canvas.

This version iterates over all objects and applies the transformation only to the largest one, handling potential variations in object sizes.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_d8c310e9(I):
  obj1 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 1))
  O = paint(I, recolor(2, shift(obj1, (2, 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj1 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 1))`**: This line directly extracts the first object with color '1' using `colorfilter` for efficiency. 
2. **`O = paint(I, recolor(2, shift(obj1, (2, 1))))`**: This line combines recoloring and shifting by nesting the functions, making the code more concise. It then paints the transformed object onto the input grid.
3. **`return O`**:  Returns the transformed grid.

This version prioritizes conciseness and potential efficiency by using function composition and directly targeting the object with color '1'.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_d8c310e9(I):
  obj1 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  offset = (2, 1)
  if rot90(I) == I:
    offset = (1, -2)
  O = paint(I, recolor(2, shift(obj1, offset)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj1 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)`**: This line efficiently extracts the object with color '1' using `extract`.
2. **`offset = (2, 1)`**:  Default offset for downward and rightward shift.
3. **`if rot90(I) == I:`**: Checks if the input grid remains the same after a 90-degree rotation (indicating a potential different orientation in the input).
    - **`offset = (1, -2)`**: If so, adjusts the offset for a different shift direction.
4. **`O = paint(I, recolor(2, shift(obj1, offset)))`**: Applies recoloring and shifting using the calculated offset and paints the result on the grid.
5. **`return O`**: Returns the transformed grid.

This version introduces a conditional offset based on input grid orientation, showcasing adaptability to potential variations in the input patterns.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_d8c310e9(I):
  obj1 = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  target_pos = add(ulcorner(obj1), (2, 1))
  O = paint(I, recolor(2, shift(obj1, subtract(target_pos, ulcorner(obj1)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj1 = first(objects(I, T, F, T))`**:  Extracts the first object, assuming it's the target.
2. **`target_pos = add(ulcorner(obj1), (2, 1))`**: Calculates the target position by adding the desired offset to the object's upper-left corner.
3. **`O = paint(I, recolor(2, shift(obj1, subtract(target_pos, ulcorner(obj1))))))`**: Recolors and shifts the object to the calculated target position and paints it onto the input grid.
4. **`return O`**: Returns the transformed grid.

This version calculates the shift offset based on the target position relative to the object's initial position, demonstrating a more dynamic approach to object placement.


These five program versions offer diverse approaches to the task, each with its own strengths and weaknesses in terms of code length, complexity, efficiency, and adaptability to potential variations in the input patterns.
