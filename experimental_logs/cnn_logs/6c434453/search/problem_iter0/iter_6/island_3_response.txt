## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 

1. **Identify objects:** The transformation focuses on objects formed by connected '1' cells (excluding the background of '0's).
2. **Shift and Recolor:** Each object is shifted one cell diagonally down and to the right (i.e., +1 row, +1 column). The shifted objects are then recolored to '2'. 
3. **Retain Original:** The original '1' cells that were not part of a shifted object are kept unchanged in their original positions.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

The same transformation logic applies to Input_1. Objects of '1's are identified, shifted diagonally down and right, recolored to '2', while the original unshifted '1's remain.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) 
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (1, 1)), objs)  
  recolored_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(2, obj), shifted_objs)  
  O = paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Shift:**  Identifies objects of '1's using `objects`.  `mapply` applies `shift` to each object, moving them diagonally by (1, 1).
2. **Recolor and Paint:** `mapply` applies `recolor` to change the color of shifted objects to '2'. Finally, `paint` draws these recolored objects onto the original input grid `I`, leaving unshifted '1's intact.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1) 
  shifted_indices = frozenset({add(idx, (1, 1)) for idx in one_indices})
  O = fill(I, 2, shifted_indices)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate and Shift:** Finds indices of all '1' cells using `ofcolor`. It then shifts these indices by (1, 1) using `add` within a set comprehension.
2. **Fill:**  Uses `fill` to directly color the shifted indices with '2' on the input grid, leaving the original '1's in place.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def process_cell(i, j):
        if I[i][j] == 1:
            new_i, new_j = i + 1, j + 1
            if 0 <= new_i < len(I) and 0 <= new_j < len(I[0]):
                return 2 
        return I[i][j] 

    O = tuple(tuple(process_cell(i, j) for j in range(len(I[0]))) for i in range(len(I)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** Iterates through each cell of the grid. If a cell is '1', it calculates its shifted position.
2. **Conditional Recoloring:** If the shifted position is within the grid boundaries, the cell is recolored to '2'. Otherwise, the original cell value is kept.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    shifted_grid = canvas(0, shape(I)) 
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val == 1:
                new_i, new_j = i + 1, j + 1
                if 0 <= new_i < len(I) and 0 <= new_j < len(I[0]):
                    shifted_grid = fill(shifted_grid, 2, {(new_i, new_j)}) 
    O = cellwise(shifted_grid, I, 1) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Shifted Grid:** Creates a blank canvas (`shifted_grid`) of the same size as the input.
2. **Populate Shifted Grid:**  Iterates through the input, and for every '1', colors the corresponding shifted position on the `shifted_grid` with '2'.
3. **Combine:** Uses `cellwise` to combine the `shifted_grid` and the original input. This function prioritizes the color from `shifted_grid` unless it's the background (0), ensuring original '1's remain.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def shift_and_recolor(obj):
        shifted_obj = shift(obj, (1, 1))
        return recolor(2, shifted_obj)

    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  
    shifted_and_recolored = frozenset({shift_and_recolor(obj) for obj in objs})
    O = paint(I, merge(shifted_and_recolored))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift and Recolor Function:** Defines a helper function `shift_and_recolor` to encapsulate the shift and recolor logic for each object.
2. **Apply to Objects:**  Identifies objects, applies `shift_and_recolor` to each, and merges the resulting objects.
3. **Paint:**  Paints the shifted and recolored objects onto the original grid, preserving unshifted '1's. 

These five versions offer diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation, demonstrating the flexibility of the provided DSL. Each version tackles the problem with distinct logic and function combinations, ensuring a wide range of solutions.
