## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Identify Target Objects:**  The transformation focuses on objects with the colors "1" and "2". 
2. **Color Swap and Shift:**  Every object with color "1" is replaced with background color "0". Every object with color "2" is shifted one cell down and one cell to the right. If a cell is already occupied, it is replaced.  
3. **Recolor Shifted Objects:**  The shifted objects (originally color "2") are recolored to "1". 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

This transformation follows the same logic as the previous one, showcasing the generality of the rule. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = fill(I, 0, ofcolor(I, 1)) # Replace 1s with background
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(ofcolor(O, 2), (1, 1)))) # Shift and recolor 2s to 1s
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Remove "1" Objects:** We first find all indices of cells with value "1" using `ofcolor(I, 1)`. Then, we use `fill(I, 0, ...)` to replace these cells with the background color "0".
2. **Shift and Recolor "2" Objects:** We identify indices of "2" using `ofcolor(O, 2)`. We shift these indices down and right by (1,1) using `shift(..., (1, 1))`. Next, we recolor these shifted indices to "1" using `recolor(1, ...)` and paint them onto the grid using `paint(O,...).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False) # Extract all objects
  new_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    color_val, (i, j) = next(iter(obj)) 
    if color_val == 1:
      continue # Skip processing objects with color 1
    elif color_val == 2:
      new_objs.add(recolor(1, shift(obj, (1, 1)))) # Shift and recolor 2s to 1s
    else:
      new_objs.add(obj) # Keep other objects unchanged
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), frozenset.union(*new_objs)) # Paint onto a blank canvas 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Filter Objects:** This version first extracts all objects from the grid. Then, it iterates through each object, skipping objects with color "1", shifting and recoloring objects with color "2" to "1", and keeping other objects unchanged.
2. **Paint onto Blank Canvas:** Finally, it paints the modified objects onto a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if O[i][j] == 1:
        O = fill(O, 0, {(i, j)}) # Remove 1s
      elif O[i][j] == 2:
        if i < height(I) - 1 and j < width(I) - 1: # Check for boundary conditions
          O = fill(O, 0, {(i, j)})
          O = fill(O, 1, {(i + 1, j + 1)}) # Shift and replace with 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Modify:** This version iterates over each cell of the grid. If the cell value is "1", it is replaced with the background color. If the cell value is "2", and the cell is not on the bottom or right edge, it is replaced with the background color, and the cell diagonally down-right is set to "1".

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Start with blank canvas
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        continue # Skip 1s
      elif I[i][j] == 2:
        if i < height(I) - 1 and j < width(I) - 1:
          O = fill(O, 1, {(i + 1, j + 1)}) # Place 1 at shifted location
      else:
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, j)}) # Copy other colors directly
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Blank Canvas and Selective Filling:** This version initializes an empty canvas. It then iterates through the input grid, skipping cells with value "1", placing "1" at the shifted location for cells with value "2" (with boundary checks), and directly copying other cell values to the corresponding location in the output grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_indices = shift(ofcolor(I, 2), (1, 1)) # Get shifted indices for 2s
  O = replace(I, 1, 0)  # Replace all 1s with 0s
  O = fill(O, 0, ofcolor(O, 2)) # Remove original 2s
  return paint(O, recolor(1, shifted_indices)) # Paint shifted 2s as 1s 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Pre-compute Shifted Indices:** We first calculate the shifted indices for all cells with value "2". 
2. **Replace and Remove:** Replace all occurrences of "1" with "0". Remove original occurrences of "2".
3. **Paint Shifted Objects:** Finally, paint the pre-computed shifted indices with color "1" onto the grid.

These five program versions demonstrate a range of approaches to achieving the desired transformation, each utilizing different DSL functions and logic.
