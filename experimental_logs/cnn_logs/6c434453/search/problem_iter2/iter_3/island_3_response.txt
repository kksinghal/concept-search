## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

1. **Target Object:** The object with color '2' is targeted for transformation.
2. **Rotation:** The target object is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise.
3. **Translation:** The rotated object is translated one cell down and one cell to the right.
4. **New Object:** A new object of color '1' is created, shaped as a vertical line of length 3.
5. **New Object Placement:** The new object is placed two cells down and one cell right of the original top-left corner of the '2' object.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

1. **Target Object:** The object with color '2' is targeted.
2. **Rotation:** The target object is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
3. **Translation:** The rotated object is translated one cell down and one cell to the right.
4. **New Object:** A new object of color '1' is created, shaped as a horizontal line of length 3.
5. **New Object Placement:** The new object is placed two cells down and one cell right of the original top-left corner of the '2' object.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Find the object with color '2'
  obj2 = extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)

  # 2. Determine the rotation and offset based on object shape
  if portrait(obj2):
    rotation = rot270
    offset = (1, 1)
    new_obj_shape = (1, 3)
  else:
    rotation = rot90
    offset = (1, 1)
    new_obj_shape = (3, 1)

  # 3. Rotate, translate, and paint the '2' object
  rotated_obj = asobject(rotation(toobject(toindices(obj2), I)))
  moved_obj = shift(rotated_obj, offset)
  O = paint(cover(I, obj2), moved_obj)

  # 4. Create and paint the '1' object
  new_obj = recolor(1, asobject(canvas(1, new_obj_shape)))
  new_obj_pos = add(ulcorner(obj2), (2, 1))
  O = paint(O, shift(new_obj, new_obj_pos))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on determining rotation direction and new object shape based on the '2' object's portrait orientation. It efficiently combines rotation and translation into a single paint operation for the '2' object.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Extract the '2' object's indices
  indices2 = toindices(extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == 2))

  # 2. Define rotation and translation functions based on object size
  if size(indices2) == 3:
    rotate = lambda x: rot270(toobject(x, I))
    translate = lambda x: shift(x, (1, 1))
    one_shape = (1, 3)
  else:
    rotate = lambda x: rot90(toobject(x, I))
    translate = lambda x: shift(x, (1, 1))
    one_shape = (3, 1)

  # 3. Apply transformations and paint
  O = paint(cover(I, indices2), translate(asobject(rotate(indices2))))
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(1, asobject(canvas(1, one_shape))), (ulcorner(indices2)[0] + 2, ulcorner(indices2)[1] + 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version emphasizes code clarity by defining separate functions for rotation and translation. It uses lambda expressions for concise function definitions and directly manipulates the '2' object's indices.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Find '2' object and its dimensions
  obj2 = extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == 2)
  h, w = shape(obj2)

  # 2. Determine transformation parameters based on dimensions
  if h > w:
    rotation = rot270
    new_obj_dims = (1, 3)
  else:
    rotation = rot90
    new_obj_dims = (3, 1)

  # 3. Apply transformations and paint
  O = paint(cover(I, obj2), shift(asobject(rotation(toobject(obj2, I))), (1, 1)))
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(1, asobject(canvas(1, new_obj_dims))), add(ulcorner(obj2), (2, 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

Version 3 prioritizes conciseness by directly calculating transformation parameters based on the '2' object's height and width. It avoids redundant code by using a single translation offset for both object types.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Get '2' object and define new object positions
  obj2 = extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == 2)
  new_obj_pos = add(ulcorner(obj2), (2, 1))

  # 2. Conditional transformations based on object size
  if size(obj2) == 3:
    O = paint(cover(I, obj2), shift(asobject(rot270(toobject(obj2, I))), (1, 1)))
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(1, asobject(canvas(1, (1, 3)))), new_obj_pos)) 
  else:
    O = paint(cover(I, obj2), shift(asobject(rot90(toobject(obj2, I))), (1, 1)))
    O = paint(O, shift(recolor(1, asobject(canvas(1, (3, 1)))), new_obj_pos))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

Version 4 prioritizes readability by separating the conditional transformations into distinct blocks. It minimizes function nesting for improved clarity.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Find the object with color '2'
  two_obj = extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)

  # 2. Define rotation, shape, and offset based on object size
  rotation, new_shape, offset = (rot270, (1, 3), (1, 1)) if len(two_obj) == 3 else (rot90, (3, 1), (1, 1))

  # 3. Transform and paint the objects
  O = paint(cover(I, two_obj), shift(asobject(rotation(toobject(two_obj, I))), offset))
  O = paint(O, shift(recolor(1, asobject(canvas(1, new_shape))), add(ulcorner(two_obj), (2, 1))))
  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

Version 5 utilizes tuple unpacking to efficiently define multiple variables based on the object size. It consolidates the transformation logic into fewer lines for brevity.
