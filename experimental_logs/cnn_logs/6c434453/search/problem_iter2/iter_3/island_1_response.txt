## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

1. **Shift:** All objects are shifted one cell diagonally down and to the right.
2. **Recolor:** The value of all objects is changed to the value that was diagonally down and to the right of their original position in the input grid.  If the diagonal position is out of bounds, the object takes on the value of 0. 

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

This transformation follows the same logic as the first example:

1. **Shift:** All objects are shifted one cell diagonally down and to the right.
2. **Recolor:** The value of all objects is changed to the value that was diagonally down and to the right of their original position in the input grid.  If the diagonal position is out of bounds, the object takes on the value of 0. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def shift_and_recolor(obj):
    return {(index(I, add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1))), add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1)))}
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(apply(shift_and_recolor, objects(I, True, False, False))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shift_and_recolor(obj)`:** This helper function takes an object as input. It calculates the index of the cell diagonally down and to the right of the object's upper-left corner. The object is then shifted to this position and assigned the color found at that index in the input grid.
2. **`objects(I, True, False, False)`:** This identifies all objects in the input grid.
3. **`apply(shift_and_recolor, ...)`:** The `shift_and_recolor` function is applied to each object in the grid.
4. **`merge(...)`:**  The shifted and recolored objects are combined.
5. **`paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), ...)`:** The combined objects are painted onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), 
               frozenset({(index(I, add((i, j), (1, 1))), add((i, j), (1, 1))) 
               for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0])) if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcommon(I)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`index(I, (i, j)) != mostcommon(I)`:** This condition ensures that only non-background cells are processed.
2. **`(index(I, add((i, j), (1, 1))), add((i, j), (1, 1)))`:**  For each non-background cell, this creates a new cell with the color from the diagonal position and the shifted coordinates.
3. **`frozenset({... for i in ... for j in ...})`:** This iterates over all cell indices and builds a set of the transformed cells. 
4. **`paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), ...)`:**  Finally, the transformed cells are painted onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def transform_cell(i, j):
    new_i, new_j = i + 1, j + 1
    return (index(I, (i, j)), (new_i, new_j)) if 0 <= new_i < len(I) and 0 <= new_j < len(I[0]) else None
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), frozenset(filter(None, [transform_cell(i, j) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0]))])))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`transform_cell(i, j)`:**  This helper function takes a cell's coordinates and returns the transformed cell data (color, new coordinates) if the new coordinates are within the grid bounds, otherwise returns None.
2. **`filter(None, ...)`:** This removes any None values from the list of transformed cells.
3. **`frozenset(...)`:** Converts the list to a frozenset for use with the `paint` function.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if 0 <= i + 1 < len(I) and 0 <= j + 1 < len(row):
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(I[i + 1][j + 1], (i + 1, j + 1))})
  return new_grid 
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates directly over the input grid and paints the shifted, recolored cells onto a new canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def shifted_object(obj):
    return shift(recolor(index(I, add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1))), obj), (1, 1))
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(apply(shifted_object, objects(I, True, False, False)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_object(obj)`:** This function recolors an object to the value found diagonally down and to the right in the input grid and then shifts it.
2. **`objects(I, True, False, False)`:** This identifies all objects in the input.
3. **`apply(shifted_object, ...)`:** The `shifted_object` function is applied to each object.
4. **`merge(...)`:** The transformed objects are merged.
5. **`paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), ...)`:**  The merged objects are painted onto a new canvas.
