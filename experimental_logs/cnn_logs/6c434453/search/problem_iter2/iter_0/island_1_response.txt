## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:** This transformation involves two key steps:

1. **Shifting Objects:** Each object comprised of digits other than the background (0) is shifted one cell diagonally downwards and to the right.
2. **Recoloring:** The shifted objects are recolored to '1', while the original locations of these objects are filled with '2'.

**Input 1 to Output 1:** This transformation follows the same logic as the previous one, applying the diagonal shift and recoloring to all objects formed by non-zero digits.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Initialize output with a canvas of 0s
  for i, j in asindices(I):
    if index(I, (i, j)) != 0:  # For each non-zero cell
      new_i, new_j = i + 1, j + 1 # Calculate new indices
      if 0 <= new_i < len(I) and 0 <= new_j < len(I[0]):  # Check bounds
        O = paint(O, {(1, (new_i, new_j))}) # Paint '1' at the new location
        O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j))}) # Paint '2' at the original location
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version iterates through each cell of the input grid. If a cell is not '0', it calculates the new location diagonally downwards and right. If the new location is within the grid bounds, it paints '1' at the new location and '2' at the original location in the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True) # Get all objects
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))  # Initialize output grid
  for obj in objs:
      shifted_obj = shift(obj, (1, 1))  # Shift object diagonally
      O = underpaint(O, recolor(1, shifted_obj))  # Paint '1' at the shifted location
      O = underpaint(O, recolor(2, obj))  # Paint '2' at the original location
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version extracts all objects from the input grid, shifts each object diagonally, recolors the shifted object to '1' and the original object to '2', and then paints them onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = replace(I, 0, -1)  # Replace background with a temporary value
  for i in range(len(I) - 1):
    for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1):
      if O[i][j] != -1:
        O = paint(O, {(1, (i + 1, j + 1))})  # Paint '1' diagonally
  O = replace(O, -1, 0)  # Restore background
  return replace(O, I[0][0], 2) # Replace original object color with '2'
```

**Explanation:** This version first replaces the background with a temporary value to differentiate it. Then, it iterates through the grid and paints '1' diagonally to the right and bottom of every non-background cell. Finally, it restores the background and replaces the original object color with '2'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  shifted_grid = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Initialize a shifted grid with 0s
  for i in range(len(I) - 1):
    for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] != 0:
        shifted_grid = paint(shifted_grid, {(1, (i + 1, j + 1))}) # Fill shifted grid
  return cellwise(shifted_grid, I, 2) # Combine shifted and original grids with '2' as fallback
```

**Explanation:** This version creates a shifted grid where '1's are placed diagonally to the original object locations. Then, it uses the 'cellwise' function to combine the shifted grid and original grid, using '2' as the fallback value for mismatches. This effectively achieves the desired transformation.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = I  # Initialize output with input
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True):
    O = cover(O, obj) # Remove the object
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, obj)) # Recolor the original object area to '2'
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(obj, (1, 1)))) # Paint the shifted object with '1'
  return O 
```

**Explanation:** This version iterates through each object in the input. It first removes the object from the grid, then recolors the original object area to '2', and finally paints the object again at the shifted location with color '1'.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL, showcasing diverse logic and function combinations.
