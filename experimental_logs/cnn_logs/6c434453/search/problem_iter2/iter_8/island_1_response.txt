## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Object Selection & Rotation:** The transformation focuses on the object composed of '2's. This object is rotated 270 degrees counter-clockwise.
2. **Shifting:** The rotated object is then shifted one cell down and one cell right.
3. **Background Replacement:** The remaining cells in the grid are filled with the most common color in the input grid, which is '0'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

This transformation follows the same logic as the previous one:

1. **Object Selection & Rotation:** The object composed of '2's is selected and rotated 270 degrees counter-clockwise.
2. **Shifting:** The rotated object is then shifted one cell down and one cell right.
3. **Background Replacement:** The remaining cells are filled with the most common color in the input grid, which is '0'.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the `Program_to_be_generated` function:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = 2
  shifted_obj = shift(rot270(toobject(ofcolor(I, target_color), I)), (1, 1))
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), shifted_obj)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`target_color = 2`**:  This line defines the color of the object we want to manipulate.
2. **`ofcolor(I, target_color)`**: This function identifies the indices of all cells in the input grid (`I`) that have the `target_color` (which is 2).
3. **`toobject(..., I)`**:  This function takes the indices from the previous step and the input grid (`I`) to construct the object composed of '2's.
4. **`rot270(...)`**: This rotates the object 270 degrees counter-clockwise.
5. **`shift(..., (1, 1))`**: This shifts the rotated object one cell down and one cell to the right.
6. **`canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))`**: This creates a new grid of the same size as the input grid (`I`), filled with the most common color in `I`.
7. **`paint(..., ...)`**: This paints the shifted and rotated object onto the new canvas, resulting in the final output grid.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(
        canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)),
        shift(
            rot270(
                extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
            ),
            (1, 1),
        ),
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, False)`**:  This extracts all univalued objects from the input grid, ignoring the background.
2. **`extract(..., lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)`**: This finds the object with the color '2'.
3. **`rot270(...)`**: Rotates the extracted object 270 degrees counter-clockwise.
4. **`shift(..., (1, 1))`**:  Shifts the rotated object.
5. **`canvas(...)`**: Creates a blank canvas filled with the most common color.
6. **`paint(...)`**:  Paints the transformed object onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    obj = next(
        (obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, False) if color(obj) == 2), frozenset()
    )
    return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), shift(rot270(obj), (1, 1)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`next((...), frozenset())`**: This efficiently finds the first object with color '2' or returns an empty set if none is found.
2. **`rot270(obj)`**: Rotates the found object.
3. **`shift(..., (1, 1))`**: Shifts the rotated object.
4. **`canvas(...)`**:  Creates a blank canvas with the background color.
5. **`paint(...)`**: Paints the transformed object onto the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  target_obj = next((obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == 2), None)
  if target_obj:
    transformed_obj = shift(rot270(target_obj), (1, 1))
    return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), transformed_obj)
  else:
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(...)`**: Extracts all objects from the input grid.
2. **`next((...), None)`**:  Finds the object with color '2' or returns None if not found.
3. **`if target_obj:`**: Checks if the target object is found.
    * If found, rotates, shifts, and paints it onto a new canvas.
    * If not found, returns the original input grid.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), 
      shift(
          rot270(
              toobject(
                  ofcolor(I, 2),
                  I
              )
          ),
          add(DOWN, RIGHT)
          )
      )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 2)`**:  Finds the indices of cells with color '2'.
2. **`toobject(...)`**:  Constructs the object from the indices.
3. **`rot270(...)`**:  Rotates the object.
4. **`add(DOWN, RIGHT)`**:  Calculates the shift offset using predefined directions.
5. **`shift(...)`**:  Shifts the object.
6. **`canvas(...)`**:  Creates a blank canvas.
7. **`paint(...)`**:  Paints the object onto the canvas.

These five versions offer distinct logic and function combinations while achieving the same transformation. They illustrate the flexibility of the DSL and provide various approaches to solve the given task.
