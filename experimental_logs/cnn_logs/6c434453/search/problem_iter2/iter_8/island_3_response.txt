## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:**

1. **Rotate:** The '2' object is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise.
2. **Shift:** The rotated '2' object is shifted down by one row and right by one column. 
3. **New Object:** A new horizontal '1' object (3 cells wide) is created below the shifted '2' object.

**Input 1 -> Output 1:**

1. **Rotate:** The '2' object is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
2. **Shift:** The rotated '2' object is shifted right by two columns.
3. **New Object:** A new vertical '1' object (3 cells tall) is created to the right of the shifted '2' object.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" that achieve the described transformations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the '2' object
  obj2 = extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == 2)

  # Determine rotation based on object width and height
  rotation = rot270 if width(obj2) > height(obj2) else rot90

  # Apply transformations to the '2' object
  O = paint(
      cover(I, obj2),
      shift(rotation(toobject(toindices(obj2), I)), (1, 1))
  )

  # Create and position the new '1' object
  new_obj_shape = (1, 3) if width(obj2) > height(obj2) else (3, 1)
  O = paint(
      O,
      shift(
          recolor(1, asobject(canvas(1, new_obj_shape))),
          add(ulcorner(obj2), (2, 1))
      )
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find and Rotate:** This version identifies the '2' object, determines its rotation based on width and height, and rotates it accordingly.
2. **Shift and Paint:** It shifts the rotated object, covers the original object on the grid, and paints the rotated object at the new location.
3. **Create New Object:** It creates a new '1' object with the correct shape based on the initial '2' object's orientation and paints it at the appropriate location relative to the original '2' object.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the '2' object and its center
  obj2 = extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == 2)
  center_j = centerofmass(obj2)[1]

  # Determine rotation based on object center's x-coordinate
  rotation = rot270 if center_j < len(I[0]) // 2 else rot90

  # Apply transformations to the '2' object
  O = paint(
      cover(I, obj2),
      shift(rotation(toobject(toindices(obj2), I)), (1, 1))
  )

  # Create and paint the '1' line
  line_len = 3
  start_i, start_j = add(ulcorner(obj2), (2, 1))
  line_indices = frozenset((start_i + i, start_j) if rotation == rot90 else (start_i, start_j + i) for i in range(line_len))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, line_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find, Center, Rotate:** This version finds the '2' object and its center of mass. It determines the rotation based on whether the center's x-coordinate is on the left or right half of the grid and rotates accordingly.
2. **Shift and Paint:** Similar to version 1, it shifts and paints the rotated object.
3. **Create Line:** It directly calculates the indices for the new '1' line based on the rotation and paints them on the grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the '2' object 
  obj2 = extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == 2)

  # Calculate rotation and offset based on object dimensions
  rotation = rot270 if width(obj2) > height(obj2) else rot90
  offset = (1, 2) if width(obj2) > height(obj2) else (2, 1)

  # Shift and cover the original object
  O = cover(I, obj2)

  # Rotate, shift, and paint the '2' object
  O = paint(O, shift(rotation(toobject(toindices(obj2), I)), offset))

  # Create and paint the new '1' object
  new_obj = recolor(1,  
                    asobject(canvas(1, (1, 3) if width(obj2) > height(obj2) else (3, 1))))
  O = paint(O, shift(new_obj, add(ulcorner(obj2), offset)))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find and Determine Transformation:**  This version identifies the '2' object and calculates both the rotation and offset based on its dimensions.
2. **Separate Transformations:** It performs the shifting and covering of the original object separately.
3. **Create and Paint:** It creates the new '1' object with the appropriate shape and paints it at the calculated offset from the original object's corner.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the '2' object and its bounding box
  obj2 = extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == 2)
  bbox = backdrop(obj2)

  # Determine rotation based on bounding box dimensions
  rotation = rot270 if width(bbox) > height(bbox) else rot90

  # Apply transformations to the '2' object
  O = paint(
      cover(I, obj2),
      shift(rotation(toobject(toindices(obj2), I)), (1, 1))
  )

  # Create a new '1' object based on the bounding box
  new_obj = recolor(1, shift(
      asobject(canvas(1, (1, 3) if width(bbox) > height(bbox) else (3, 1))),
      (bbox.uppermost() + 2, bbox.leftmost() + 1)
  ))

  # Paint the new object onto the grid
  O = paint(O, new_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Bounding Box:** This version utilizes the bounding box of the '2' object to determine the rotation. 
2. **Rotate and Paint '2':**  Similar to previous versions, it rotates and paints the '2' object.
3. **New Object from Bounding Box:** It creates the '1' object with the correct shape and uses the bounding box information to directly position it on the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the '2' object
  obj2 = extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == 2)

  # Determine rotation based on object's uppermost and leftmost coordinates
  rotation = rot270 if uppermost(obj2) < leftmost(obj2) else rot90

  # Calculate new object's position based on rotation
  new_obj_pos = add(ulcorner(obj2), (2, 1)) if rotation == rot90 else add(ulcorner(obj2), (1, 2))

  # Apply transformations to the grid
  O = paint(
      cover(I, obj2),
      shift(rotation(toobject(toindices(obj2), I)), (1, 1))
  )

  # Create and paint the new '1' object
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, 
                        asobject(canvas(1, (3, 1) if rotation == rot90 else (1, 3)))),
                        new_obj_pos)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find and Rotate:** This version determines the rotation based on a comparison between the uppermost and leftmost coordinates of the '2' object.
2. **Calculate Position:** It calculates the new '1' object's position based on the chosen rotation.
3. **Transform and Paint:** Similar to previous versions, it covers, rotates, shifts, and paints the objects.

These five programs provide diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation. Each version utilizes different DSL functions and logic, demonstrating a range of possible solutions.
