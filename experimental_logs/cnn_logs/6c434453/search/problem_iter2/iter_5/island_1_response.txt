## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by connected cells of the same value (excluding the background color, which is the most frequent color) and then rotating these objects by 90 degrees counterclockwise.  The rotated objects are then repainted onto a blank canvas at a shifted position one cell down and one cell to the right from their original position. 

**Let's illustrate with Input_0:**

1. **Object Identification:** The input grid has several objects (2, 3, 4, 5).
2. **Rotation:** Each of these objects is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise. For example, the object formed by '1's changes from a horizontal line to a vertical line.
3. **Shifting and Repainting:**  The rotated objects are then shifted one cell down and one cell to the right. For instance, the '1' object's top-left corner moves from (6,3) to (7,4). 
4. **Background:** The output grid's background is filled with the value '0'.

## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve this transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Find all objects, excluding background
  new_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    shifted_obj = shift(rot270(obj), (1, 1))  # Rotate and shift each object
    new_objs = combine(new_objs, shifted_obj) # Combine the objects
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), new_objs)  # Paint onto a blank canvas
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, True, False, True)`: Identifies all the objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Loop:** Iterates through each object.
3. `rot270(obj)`: Rotates the current object counterclockwise by 90 degrees.
4. `shift(..., (1, 1))`: Shifts the rotated object one cell down and one cell right.
5. `combine(..., ...)`: Adds the shifted object to the set of new objects.
6. `paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), ...)`: Paints all the new objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input.


**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), 
               merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(rot270(obj), (1, 1)), 
                           objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a more functional approach by using `apply` and `merge` to achieve the same result as the loop in version 1. 

1. `objects(I, True, False, True)`:  Same as version 1.
2. `apply(lambda obj: shift(rot270(obj), (1, 1)), ...)`: Applies the rotation and shifting to each object in the `objs` set.
3. `merge(...)`: Merges the resulting set of transformed objects.
4. `paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), ...)`:  Same as version 1.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_grid = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Create blank canvas
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I): # If not background color
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(I[i][j], (i+1, j+1))}) # Paint with shift
  return rot270(new_grid) # Rotate the entire grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version constructs the output grid by directly shifting and painting each non-background cell of the input grid and then rotating the entire grid at the end.

1. `canvas(0, shape(I))`: Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input.
2. **Nested Loop:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
3. `if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I)`: Checks if the current cell is not the background color.
4. `paint(..., {(I[i][j], (i+1, j+1))})`:  Paints the cell's color onto the new grid, shifting it one down and one right.
5. `rot270(new_grid)`: Rotates the entire constructed grid counterclockwise by 90 degrees. 

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(recolor(index(I, first(toindices(obj))), obj), (1, 1)), 
                     objects(I, True, False, True))
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), rot270(new_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes `mapply` to efficiently apply the transformation to each object while also ensuring the correct color is maintained after shifting.

1. `objects(I, True, False, True)`: Same as version 1.
2. `mapply(lambda obj: ..., ...)`: Applies the transformation function to each object and merges the result.
3. `shift(recolor(index(I, first(toindices(obj))), obj), (1, 1))`: This lambda function first recolors the object based on its original color in the input grid, then shifts it.
4. `paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), rot270(...))`: Paints the rotated transformed objects onto a blank canvas.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return rot270(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)),
                mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (1, 1)), 
                       objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version further simplifies the code by first shifting all objects and then rotating the entire canvas, reducing the number of rotations required. 

1. `objects(I, True, False, True)`: Same as version 1.
2. `mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (1, 1)), ...)`: Shifts each object one cell down and one cell right.
3. `paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), ...)`: Paints the shifted objects onto a blank canvas.
4. `rot270(...)`: Rotates the entire canvas with the shifted objects counterclockwise by 90 degrees.

These five versions demonstrate various approaches to accomplish the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. Each version provides a different perspective on how to solve the problem, highlighting the importance of understanding the DSL functions and applying them creatively.
