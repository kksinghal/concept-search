## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves rotating specific objects in the input grid by 270 degrees clockwise and repositioning them based on the locations of '1's in the input. Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The '2' objects are rotated 270 degrees clockwise.
* Each rotated '2' object is placed with its upper-left corner at the corresponding '1' location from the input.
* Finally, the colors '1' and '2' are switched in the output.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The '2' objects are rotated 270 degrees clockwise.
* Each rotated '2' object is placed with its upper-left corner at the corresponding '1' location from the input.
* Like in the previous transformation, the colors '1' and '2' are switched in the output.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Identify all objects
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, 2)  # Filter for objects with color '2'
  one_indices =  totuple(ofcolor(I, 1)) # Find all indices of '1's 
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas
  for i, obj in enumerate(target_objs):
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, subtract(one_indices[i], ulcorner(obj))) # Align each object's top-left with the corresponding '1' 
    rotated_obj =  toobject(toindices(rot270(toobject(toindices(shifted_obj), I))), I) # Rotate the object by 270 degrees
    O = paint(O, rotated_obj)  # Paint the rotated object onto the canvas
  return switch(O, 1, 2)  # Switch colors '1' and '2' 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Filter:**  Identify all objects in the input and filter for those with color '2'.
2. **Locate '1's:** Find the indices of all '1's in the input.
3. **Blank Canvas:** Create a blank canvas of the same size as the input.
4. **Iterate and Transform:** For each '2' object:
   * Shift the object to align its upper-left corner with the corresponding '1' index.
   * Rotate the shifted object by 270 degrees clockwise.
   * Paint the rotated object onto the canvas.
5. **Switch Colors:** Switch the colors '1' and '2' in the final output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  two_indices = totuple(ofcolor(I, 2)) # Get indices of all '2's
  one_indices = totuple(ofcolor(I, 1)) # Get indices of all '1's
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas
  for i in range(len(two_indices)): # Iterate through corresponding indices 
    O = fill(O, 2, {astuple(one_indices[i][0] + two_indices[i][1] - one_indices[i][1],
                          one_indices[i][1] - two_indices[i][0] + one_indices[i][0])}) # Calculate rotated position for '2' based on '1' index
  return switch(O, 1, 2) # Switch colors '1' and '2'
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1's and '2's:** Extract the indices of all occurrences of '1' and '2' in the input.
2. **Blank Canvas:** Create a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input.
3. **Iterate and Calculate:**  Iterate through the indices of '2's. For each index:
    * Calculate the new position for the '2' after a 270-degree clockwise rotation around the corresponding '1' index. 
    * Fill the calculated position on the canvas with the value '2'.
4. **Switch Colors:** Swap colors '1' and '2' on the canvas to obtain the final output.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      idx = first(toindices(obj))  #  Take any index within the object
      one_idx = first(ofcolor(I, 1), (idx[0], idx[1] - 1)) # Find the '1' directly to the left of the object
      O = paint(O, shift(rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), subtract(one_idx, ulcorner(obj))))  # Rotate and place based on '1' 
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj) # Keep other objects as they are
  return switch(O, 1, 2) # Switch colors '1' and '2'
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **Blank Canvas:**  Initialize a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.
2. **Iterate Through Objects:**  Loop through each object detected in the input grid.
3. **Conditional Rotation & Placement:** 
    * If the object's color is '2':
      * Locate a '1' in the input grid that is directly to the left of the current '2' object. If no such '1' exists, default to a predefined position.
      * Rotate the '2' object by 270 degrees clockwise.
      * Shift the rotated '2' object to align its upper-left corner with the identified '1' location.
      * Paint the transformed object onto the canvas.
    * Otherwise, paint the object onto the canvas without any modifications.
4. **Switch Colors:**  Swap colors '1' and '2' in the output grid to arrive at the final output.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = 2
  other_color = 1
  target_objects = colorfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), target_color)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, obj in enumerate(target_objects):
    ref_loc = totuple(ofcolor(I, other_color))[i]  #  Get the i-th location of '1'
    new_obj = shift(rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), subtract(ref_loc, ulcorner(obj))) 
    O = paint(O, new_obj)  # Paint the transformed object onto the canvas
  return switch(O, other_color, target_color) # Switch colors
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Initialization:**  Set `target_color` to 2 (the color to be rotated) and `other_color` to 1 (the reference color). Identify all objects of the `target_color`.
2.  **Canvas Creation:** Create a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input.
3.  **Object Transformation:**
    * Iterate through each `target_object`:
      *  Find the location (`ref_loc`) of the corresponding `other_color` in the input grid.
      *  Rotate the current `target_object` by 270 degrees clockwise.
      *  Shift the rotated object so that its upper-left corner aligns with the identified `ref_loc`.
4.  **Painting:**  Paint the transformed object onto the canvas.
5.  **Color Switching:** Swap the `target_color` and `other_color` on the canvas to obtain the final output.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = replace(I, 2, 8)  # Temporarily replace '2' with '8'
  O = replace(O, 1, 2)  # Replace '1' with '2' 
  O = replace(O, 8, 1)  # Replace '8' with '1'
  transformed_objects = apply(lambda obj: shift(rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), O)),
                                                subtract(first(toindices(obj)), (0, 0))),
                              colorfilter(objects(O, T, T, T), 1)) # Rotate and shift the '1' objects (originally '2')
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(transformed_objects))  # Paint transformed objects onto a blank canvas
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Color Swapping:**  Swap colors '1' and '2' in the input grid while temporarily using '8' to prevent conflicts.
2. **Object Identification and Transformation:**  
   *  Identify all objects in the color-swapped grid that now have the value '1' (originally '2').
   *  For each of these objects:
      *  Rotate the object by 270 degrees clockwise.
      * Shift the rotated object to align its upper-left corner with the top-left corner of its bounding box.
3. **Painting:** Paint the transformed objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input to get the final output.
