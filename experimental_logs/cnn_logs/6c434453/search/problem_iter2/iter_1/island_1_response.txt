## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 

1. **Shift Down and Right:** Each object (group of connected digits with the same value) is shifted one cell down and one cell to the right.
2. **Color Change:**  The '2' objects change to '1' objects and the '3' objects change to '1' objects after the shift.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. **Shift Down and Right:** Similar to Input_0, each object is shifted one cell down and one cell to the right.
2. **Color Change:** Here, the '3' objects become '2' objects and the '4' objects become '1' objects after the shift.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))  # Create an empty canvas
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):  # Iterate through objects
    if color(obj) == 2: 
      O = paint(O, shift(recolor(1, obj), (1, 1)))  # Shift and recolor '2' to '1'
    elif color(obj) == 3:
      O = paint(O, shift(recolor(1, obj), (1, 1)))  # Shift and recolor '3' to '1'
    elif color(obj) == 4:
      O = paint(O, shift(recolor(1, obj), (1, 1)))  # Shift and recolor '4' to '1'
    else:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (1, 1)))  # Shift other objects without recoloring
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Empty Canvas:** `canvas(0, shape(I))` creates an output grid filled with '0's of the same size as the input.
2. **Object Iteration:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` extracts each object from the input grid.
3. **Shift and Recolor:** Based on the object's color ('2', '3', or '4'), the code shifts the object one cell down and one cell right using `shift(obj, (1, 1))` and changes its color to '1' using `recolor(1, obj)`.
4. **Paint to Output:**  The shifted and recolored object is painted onto the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  shifted = canvas(0, shape(I))  # Empty canvas
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value != 0: # If not background
        new_i, new_j = i + 1, j + 1  # New indices
        if 0 <= new_i < len(I) and 0 <= new_j < len(row):
          shifted[new_i][new_j] = 1 if value > 1 else value  # Recolor based on value
  return shifted 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and Iteration:** Similar to version 1, the code creates an empty canvas and iterates through each cell of the input.
2. **Shift and Conditional Recoloring:**  It directly shifts the cell content to `new_i, new_j` and applies a conditional recoloring: if the original value is greater than 1, it's recolored to 1; otherwise, it retains its original color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = I  # Initialize output as input
  for i, j in product(interval(0, len(I), 1), interval(0, len(I[0]), 1)):
    if index(I, (i, j)) in {2, 3, 4}: # Check for values 2, 3, or 4
      O = cover(O, {(index(I, (i, j)), (i, j))})  # Remove the value from output
      if 0 <= i+1 < len(I) and 0 <= j+1 < len(I[0]):
        O = paint(O, {(1, (i+1, j+1))}) # Paint '1' diagonally if in bounds
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterative Replacement:** This version iterates through each cell and checks if its value is 2, 3, or 4. 
2. **Cover and Paint:** If the condition is met, it covers the original value and paints a '1' at the shifted position.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = canvas(0, (len(I), len(I[0])))  # Create empty canvas
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):  # Iterate through connected components
    new_obj = shift(recolor(1, obj) if color(obj) > 1 else obj, (1, 1)) # Shift and recolor
    O = paint(O, new_obj)  # Paint shifted object to output
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object-Based Approach:**  This version iterates through connected components (objects) using `objects`.
2. **Unified Shift and Recolor:** It shifts each object and recolors it to '1' if its original color is greater than 1, otherwise keeping the original color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = I
  for x in range(10):
   if colorcount(I, x) > 0:
      O = cover(O, {(x, (i, j)) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, val in enumerate(row) if val == x})
      if 0 <= i+1 < len(I) and 0 <= j+1 < len(I[0]):
        O = paint(O, {(1, (i+1, j+1)) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, val in enumerate(row) if val == x})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Color-Based Iteration:** This version iterates through potential color values from 0 to 9.
2. **Color-Specific Shift and Recolor:** For each color found in the grid, it covers all occurrences and paints '1' at their shifted positions.
