## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

1. **Rotation:** The main object (color 2) is rotated 270 degrees counterclockwise.
2. **Shifting:** The rotated object is shifted so that its top-left corner aligns with the location of the top-left corner of the original '1' object.
3. **Color Swapping:** The colors '1' and '2' are swapped in the final output.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

The same transformation logic applies to Input_1: rotation, shifting based on the '1' object's location, and finally, swapping colors '1' and '2'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL, inspired by the given examples and aiming to achieve the required transformations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = 2
  other_color = 1
  target_object = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), target_color))
  rotated_object = rot270(toobject(toindices(target_object), I))
  ref_location = ulcorner(toindices(ofcolor(I, other_color))) 
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  O = paint(O, shift(rotated_object, subtract(ref_location, ulcorner(rotated_object))))
  return switch(O, other_color, target_color)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The code identifies the target object (color 2) and the location of the first '1'.
2.  **Rotate and Shift:** The target object is rotated 270 degrees and then shifted to align with the '1' location.
3.  **Paint and Swap:** The rotated and shifted object is painted onto a blank canvas, and finally, colors '1' and '2' are swapped.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def transform_object(obj):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      rotated = rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), I))
      ref_loc = ulcorner(toindices(ofcolor(I, 1)))
      return shift(rotated, subtract(ref_loc, ulcorner(rotated)))
    else:
      return obj
  return switch(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(apply(transform_object, objects(I, T, T, T)))), 1, 2)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Transform Function:**  A `transform_object` function handles individual object transformations based on color.
2.  **Rotation and Alignment:** If the object's color is '2', it's rotated and shifted to align with the first '1's location.
3.  **Painting and Swapping:**  The transformed objects are painted onto a blank canvas, and colors '1' and '2' are swapped.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = 2
  other_color = 1
  one_location = first(toindices(ofcolor(I, other_color)))
  def transform_cell(i, j):
    if I[i][j] == target_color:
      obj = first(sfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda obj: (i, j) in toindices(obj)))
      rotated = rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), I))
      return index(shift(rotated, subtract(one_location, ulcorner(rotated))), (i, j))
    else:
      return I[i][j]
  return switch(tuple(tuple(transform_cell(i, j) for j in range(width(I))) for i in range(height(I))), other_color, target_color)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Cell-wise Transformation:**  This version uses a `transform_cell` function to process each grid cell individually.
2.  **Rotation and Shifting within Function:** If a cell belongs to the target object, the object is rotated, shifted, and the cell's new color is determined based on its position within the transformed object. 
3.  **Color Swapping after Grid Reconstruction:**  The grid is reconstructed with transformed colors, and finally, colors '1' and '2' are swapped. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), 2))
  ref_loc = first(toindices(ofcolor(I, 1)))
  shift_amount = subtract(ref_loc, ulcorner(target_obj))
  
  def transform_cell(value, loc):
    if value == 2:
      rotated_loc = subtract(add(rot270(((0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2))), (1, 1)), subtract((2, 2), loc))
      return index(toobject(toindices(target_obj), I), add(rotated_loc, shift_amount))
    else:
      return value
  
  return switch(tuple(tuple(transform_cell(v, (i, j)) for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(I)), 1, 2)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Pre-calculate Shift:**  Calculate the required shift amount only once to improve efficiency.
2.  **Transform Based on Original Location:** The `transform_cell` function directly determines the new color of a cell based on its original location within the target object after rotation and shifting.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  two_indices = toindices(ofcolor(I, 2))
  one_loc = first(toindices(ofcolor(I, 1)))
  
  def new_color(i, j):
    if (i, j) in two_indices:
      obj_loc = subtract((i, j), one_loc)
      return 2 if (obj_loc[1], -obj_loc[0]) in two_indices else 0
    else:
      return 1 if (i, j) == one_loc else I[i][j]
  
  return tuple(tuple(new_color(i, j) for j in range(width(I))) for i in range(height(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Directly Calculate New Colors:**  This version directly calculates the new color of each cell based on its relationship to the '1' location and the original locations of the '2' cells.
2.  **No Explicit Rotation:**  Instead of rotating the object, this approach implicitly handles rotation through coordinate transformations within the `new_color` function. 

These are five distinct program versions that utilize different approaches and function combinations from the DSL to achieve the desired transformations. Each version represents a unique way of solving the problem, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
