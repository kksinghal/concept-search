## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve the following steps:

1. **Identify Non-Background Objects:** The program identifies objects composed of digits different from the background color (most frequent color).
2. **Rotate and Shift Objects:** Each identified object undergoes a 270-degree counterclockwise rotation followed by a shift down and to the right by one unit.
3. **Paint Transformed Objects:** The transformed objects are then painted onto a new canvas of the same dimensions as the original grid, initially filled with the background color.

**Input 0:**

- The '2' objects are rotated and shifted, resulting in their new positions in the output.
- The '3' objects and '4' objects are treated similarly. 
- The '1' objects, after rotation and shifting, end up partially outside the grid and are thus clipped.

**Input 1:**

-  The transformation logic is applied consistently to all objects in Input 1, resulting in the corresponding rotated and shifted objects in the output.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), 
               mapply(lambda obj: shift(rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (1, 1)), 
                      objects(I, True, False, True)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:**  `canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))` creates a new grid filled with the background color (`mostcommon(I)`) and the same dimensions as the input grid (`shape(I)`).
2. **Object Transformation:**
    - `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies non-background objects in the input grid (`I`).
    - `lambda obj: shift(rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (1, 1))` defines a lambda function that:
        - Extracts the object's indices (`toindices(obj)`).
        - Converts the indices into an object with their corresponding values from the input grid (`toobject(..., I)`).
        - Rotates the object 270 degrees counterclockwise (`rot270(...)`).
        - Shifts the object down and right by one unit (`shift(..., (1, 1))`).
3. **Painting Transformed Objects:** `mapply` applies the transformation function to each object and merges the results onto the newly created canvas using `paint`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    transformed_obj = shift(rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (1, 1))
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, transformed_obj)
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates through each object individually within a loop, applying the same transformation as in Version 1 and painting the result on the new grid in each iteration.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)),
               merge([shift(rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (1, 1))
                      for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)])) 
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses list comprehension to apply the transformation to each object before merging them onto the canvas. This avoids repeated calls to `paint` within the loop.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  transformed_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    transformed_obj = shift(rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (1, 1))
    transformed_objs = transformed_objs.union({transformed_obj})
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), transformed_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

- This version pre-computes all the transformed objects and stores them in a `frozenset` before finally painting them onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), 
               {shift(rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (1, 1))
                for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)})
```

**Explanation:**

- This version further simplifies the code by using a set comprehension to directly generate the set of transformed objects within the `paint` function call.


Each of these versions uses distinct logic or DSL function combinations to achieve the desired transformation, ensuring diversity in the solutions.
