## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

1. **Object Selection:** The program identifies the object formed by the digit '1'.
2. **Rotation:** The selected object is rotated 270 degrees counter-clockwise.
3. **Translation:** The rotated object is shifted one cell down and one cell to the right.
4. **Painting:** The transformed object is then painted onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid, using the most common color from the input grid as the background.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

The same transformation logic applies to Input_1, targeting the object formed by the digit '1', rotating it 270 degrees counter-clockwise, shifting it one cell down and one cell to the right, and finally painting it onto a blank canvas.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  transformed_obj = shift(rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (1, 1))
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), transformed_obj) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:**  `extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)` identifies and extracts the object composed of '1's from the input grid.
2. **Transformation:** 
    - `toobject(toindices(obj), I)` converts the extracted object's indices back to an object with color values.
    - `rot270(...)` rotates the object 270 degrees counter-clockwise.
    - `shift(..., (1, 1))` moves the rotated object one cell down and one cell right.
3. **Painting:** 
    - `canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))` creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the most common color.
    - `paint(..., transformed_obj)` paints the transformed object onto the canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)),
      shift(
          rot270(
              toobject(
                  ofcolor(I, 1),
                  I
              )
          ),
          add(DOWN, RIGHT)
          )
      )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:**  `canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))` creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the most common color.
2. **Object Transformation:**
    - `ofcolor(I, 1)` retrieves indices of all cells with color '1'.
    - `toobject(..., I)` converts these indices into an object with color values.
    - `rot270(...)` rotates the object 270 degrees counter-clockwise.
    - `shift(..., add(DOWN, RIGHT))` moves the object one cell down and one cell right using the predefined directions `DOWN` and `RIGHT`.
3. **Painting:** `paint(..., ...)` paints the transformed object onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = 1
  shifted_obj = shift(rot270(toobject(ofcolor(I, target_color), I)), (1, 1))
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), shifted_obj)
```

**Explanation:**

This version is very similar to Version 2, but instead of using `add(DOWN, RIGHT)`, it directly provides the offset `(1, 1)`. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = next((obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, False) if color(obj) == 1), None)
  if obj:
      return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), shift(rot270(toobject(toindices(obj), I)), (1, 1)))
  else:
      return I 
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through all objects (`objects(I, True, False, False)`), finds the one with color '1', and applies the same transformation as in Version 1. If no object with color '1' is found, it returns the input grid unchanged.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    if color(obj) == 1:
      return paint(
        canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), 
        shift(rot270(obj), (1, 1))
      )
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

Similar to Version 4, this version iterates through all objects and finds the one with color '1'. However, it directly applies `rot270` and `shift` to the extracted object without converting it to indices and back.
