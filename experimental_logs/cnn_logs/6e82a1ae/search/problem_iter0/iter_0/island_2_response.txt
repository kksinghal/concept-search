## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** This transformation identifies objects made of the digit '5' in the input grid. Objects with an even number of cells are recolored to '1', while objects with an odd number of cells are recolored to '3'. Additionally, a new object consisting of two vertically adjacent '2' digits is placed in the rightmost column, with its top aligned two rows below the lowermost row of the bottom '3'-colored object.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the first transformation, objects made of the digit '5' are identified. This time, objects with three or more cells are recolored to '2', objects with two cells are recolored to '1', and single-cell objects are recolored to '3'.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**  Again, objects of the digit '5' are the focus. Objects with more than two cells are recolored to '3', two-cell objects are recolored to '2', and single-cell objects become '1'.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  even_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: even(size(obj)))
  odd_objs = difference(objs, even_objs)
  
  even_indices = merge(apply(toindices, even_objs))
  odd_indices = merge(apply(toindices, odd_objs))
  
  O = fill(I, 1, even_indices)
  O = fill(O, 3, odd_indices)
  
  bottom_row = lowermost(odd_indices) if odd_indices else 0
  two_obj = {(2, (bottom_row + 2, 9)), (2, (bottom_row + 3, 9))}
  O = paint(O, frozenset(two_obj))
  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, True, False, False)` finds all connected objects in the grid.
2. **Separate Even and Odd:** `even_objs` and `odd_objs` are created by filtering based on object size using `sfilter` and `difference`.
3. **Get Object Indices:**  `even_indices` and `odd_indices` store all indices belonging to their respective object types.
4. **Recolor:** The grid is filled with '1' at even object indices and '3' at odd object indices using `fill`.
5. **Place '2' Object:** The lowermost row of the '3' objects is found and used to calculate the position of the '2' object, which is then painted onto the grid.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  
  def recolor_obj(obj):
    obj_size = size(obj)
    if obj_size >= 3:
      return recolor(2, obj)
    elif obj_size == 2:
      return recolor(1, obj)
    else:
      return recolor(3, obj)
  
  recolored_objs = apply(recolor_obj, objs)
  O = I
  for obj in recolored_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Recolor Function:** `recolor_obj` determines the new color of an object based on its size.
3. **Apply Recoloring:** The `recolor_obj` function is applied to each object using `apply`.
4. **Paint Objects:** The recolored objects are iteratively painted onto the grid.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
    
    size_map = {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}
    def recolor_by_size(obj):
        size_key = min(size(obj), 3)  # Cap size key at 3
        new_color = size_map[size_key]
        return recolor(new_color, obj)
    
    recolored_objs = apply(recolor_by_size, objs)
    O = I
    for obj in recolored_objs:
        O = paint(O, obj)
    
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Size Mapping:**  A dictionary `size_map` defines the mapping from object size to new color.
3. **Recolor Function:**  `recolor_by_size` uses the `size_map` to determine the color for an object based on its size, capping the size key at 3.
4. **Apply and Paint:** Similar to Version 2, the function is applied and objects are painted onto the grid.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  def process_object(obj, grid):
    obj_size = size(obj)
    new_color = 1 if even(obj_size) else 3
    if obj_size > 2:
      new_color = 3
    elif obj_size == 2:
      new_color = 2 if mostcommon(grid) == 1 else 1 
    grid = paint(grid, recolor(new_color, obj))
    return grid

  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = process_object(obj, O)
  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Processing:** The `process_object` function handles both recoloring and conditional recoloring based on object size and grid context.
2. **Iterative Processing:** Objects are iteratively processed and painted onto the grid.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    def recolor_rule(obj):
        if size(obj) > 2:
            return 3
        return 2 if even(sum(i for i, j in toindices(obj))) else 1

    objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
    recolored = apply(lambda obj: recolor(recolor_rule(obj), obj), objs)
    O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(recolored))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Recoloring Rule:** The `recolor_rule` function encapsulates the logic for determining the new color based on object size and the sum of row indices of its cells.
2. **Apply Recoloring:** The `recolor_rule` is applied to each object during the recoloring step.
3. **Paint on Blank Canvas:**  A blank canvas is created and the recolored objects are painted onto it.

These programs demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformations, utilizing various DSL functions and logic. They are designed to be diverse and illustrate the flexibility of the provided DSL for solving the given tasks. Note that further adjustments might be needed within the `process_object` functions to perfectly match the output requirements, especially regarding the placement of the '2' object in the first transformation.
