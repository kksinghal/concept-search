## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation recolors objects on the grid based on their size and shape. Let's break down the pattern for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The 2x2 square object is recolored to 1.
- The 1x2 horizontal line object is recolored to 2.
- The 2x1 vertical line object is recolored to 3.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The 3x1 horizontal line object is recolored to 2.
- The 1x3 vertical line object is recolored to 3.
- The other 1x1 objects remain unchanged and are implicitly recolored to 1.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- The 3x1 vertical line object is recolored to 1.
- The 1x2 horizontal line object is recolored to 2.
- The 2x1 vertical line object is recolored to 3.

**Overall Logic:** The transformation identifies objects based on connected pixels of the same color. It then analyzes the shape and size of each object. Finally, it recolors the objects based on a set of rules likely mapping specific shapes and sizes to specific colors. 

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_version1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Identify all objects
  output = I # Initialize output grid
  for obj in objs:
    if square(obj):
      output = fill(output, 1, obj)  # Recolor squares to 1
    elif hline(obj) and width(obj) == 2:
      output = fill(output, 2, obj)  # Recolor 1x2 horizontal lines to 2
    elif vline(obj) and height(obj) == 2:
      output = fill(output, 3, obj)  # Recolor 2x1 vertical lines to 3
    elif hline(obj) and width(obj) == 3:
      output = fill(output, 2, obj)  # Recolor 1x3 horizontal lines to 2
    elif vline(obj) and height(obj) == 3:
      output = fill(output, 1, obj)  # Recolor 3x1 vertical lines to 1
    else:
      output = fill(output, 1, obj)  # Recolor all other objects to 1 
  O = output
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Identifies all objects in the grid.
- Iterates through each object.
- Uses conditional statements to check the shape and size of each object.
- Recolors the objects based on the identified shape and size.
- This version explicitly checks for each shape and size encountered in the input-output examples.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_version2(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  squares = sfilter(objs, square)
  hlines = sfilter(objs, hline)
  vlines = sfilter(objs, vline)
  O = fill(fill(fill(I, 1, merge(squares)), 2, merge(sfilter(hlines, lambda x: width(x) == 2))), 3, merge(sfilter(vlines, lambda x: height(x) == 2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Identifies all objects and categorizes them into squares, horizontal lines, and vertical lines.
- Uses nested `fill` functions to recolor the grid.
- Recolors squares to 1, 1x2 horizontal lines to 2, and 2x1 vertical lines to 3.
- This version utilizes filtering and merging for a more compact solution.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_version3(I):
  def recolor_logic(obj):
    if square(obj): return 1
    if hline(obj): return 2 if width(obj) == 2 else 1 
    if vline(obj): return 3 if height(obj) == 2 else 1
    return 1 # Default recolor for other shapes
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    O = fill(O, recolor_logic(obj), obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Defines a helper function `recolor_logic` to determine the new color based on the object's shape and size.
- Iterates through all objects and applies the `recolor_logic` to each object for recoloring.
- This version improves readability by abstracting the recoloring logic into a separate function.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_version4(I):
  def recolor_rule(obj, c):
    return (1 if square(obj) else c,
            2 if hline(obj) and width(obj) == 2 else c,
            3 if vline(obj) and height(obj) == 2 else c)
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    O = fill(O, mostcommon(recolor_rule(obj, mostcolor(obj))), obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Defines a function `recolor_rule` that returns a tuple of potential colors based on the object's properties.
- Uses `mostcommon` to select the most frequent color from the tuple, defaulting to the object's original color if no rule applies.
- This version provides a more flexible framework for applying multiple recoloring rules.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_version5(I):
  shape_map = {(1, 1): 1, (2, 1): 3, (1, 2): 2, (3, 1): 1, (1, 3): 2} # Define shape-color mapping
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    shape_key = (width(obj), height(obj))
    new_color = shape_map.get(shape_key, mostcolor(obj)) # Get new color based on shape, defaulting to the original color
    O = fill(O, new_color, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Uses a dictionary `shape_map` to store the mapping between object shapes and target colors.
- Iterates through each object, determines its shape, and fetches the corresponding color from the dictionary.
- Defaults to the object's original color if the shape is not found in the dictionary.
- This version offers a concise and efficient way to implement the recoloring logic based on a predefined mapping.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches and logic for achieving the desired transformation while adhering to the provided DSL. Remember to test each version with the provided input grids to ensure they produce the expected output grids.
