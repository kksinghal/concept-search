## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking the "5" object and mirroring it across the vertical axis of the "2" object. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 / Output_0:** The "5" object is mirrored across the vertical axis formed by the rightmost column of the "2" object.

**Input_1 / Output_1:**  Similar to Input_0, but the "5" object is smaller. It's still mirrored across the same vertical axis formed by the "2" object.

**Input_2 / Output_2:**  Again, the "5" object is mirrored, but this time the "5" object overlaps the "2" object in the input. The mirroring still occurs across the same vertical axis defined by the "2" object.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  obj5 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 5), I)
  mirror_axis = rightmost(obj2) 
  shifted_obj5 = frozenset((v, (i, 2*mirror_axis - j)) for v, (i, j) in obj5) 
  O = paint(cover(I, obj5), shifted_obj5)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extract the "2" object (`obj2`) and the "5" object (`obj5`) from the input grid (`I`).
2. **Find Mirror Axis:** Determine the vertical mirror axis. This is the column index (`rightmost(obj2)`) of the rightmost cell of the "2" object.
3. **Mirror the Object:** Create a new object (`shifted_obj5`) by mirroring the coordinates of each cell in `obj5` across the mirror axis. For each cell (i, j) in `obj5`, its mirrored counterpart will be (i, 2 * mirror_axis - j).
4. **Paint the Mirrored Object:** Remove the original "5" object from the input grid and paint the mirrored object onto the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  obj5 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 5), I)
  center_2 = centerofmass(obj2)
  shifted_obj5 = frozenset((v, (i, 2*center_2[1] - j)) for v, (i, j) in obj5)
  O = paint(cover(I, obj5), shifted_obj5)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is very similar to version 1, but instead of using the rightmost point of the '2' object as the mirror axis, it uses the center of mass of the '2' object.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  obj5 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 5), I)
  mirror_axis = rightmost(obj2)
  mirrored_obj5 =  hmirror(shift(obj5, (0, -2 * (centerofmass(obj5)[1] - mirror_axis))))
  O = paint(cover(I, obj5), mirrored_obj5)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Axis:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Shift and Mirror:** This version shifts the '5' object so that its center of mass is aligned with the mirroring axis, then uses the `hmirror` function to perform the mirroring. Finally, it shifts the mirrored object back to its correct position.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  obj5 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 5), I)
  obj2_indices = toindices(obj2)
  mirrored_obj5 = frozenset((5, (i, 2*j - k)) for (i, j) in obj2_indices for (v, (k, l)) in obj5)
  O = paint(cover(I, obj5), mirrored_obj5)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version calculates the mirrored coordinates for each cell in the '5' object relative to every cell in the '2' object. Although this is less efficient than other versions, it still produces the correct output.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  obj5 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 5), I)
  mirror_axis =  rightmost(obj2) 
  shifted_obj5 = apply(lambda cell: (cell[0], (cell[1][0], 2 * mirror_axis - cell[1][1])), obj5)
  O = paint(cover(I, obj5), shifted_obj5)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Axis:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Apply Mirroring:** This version uses the `apply` function to apply a lambda function to each cell in `obj5`. The lambda function calculates the mirrored coordinates for each cell. 
3. **Paint:** Similar to other versions.

Each of these program versions utilizes different DSL functions and logic to achieve the same result, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL and the diversity of potential solutions.
