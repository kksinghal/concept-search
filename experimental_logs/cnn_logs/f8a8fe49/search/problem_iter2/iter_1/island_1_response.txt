## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving the object represented by the digit '5' to a new location relative to the object represented by the digit '2'. The '5' object maintains its shape but is mirrored horizontally.

**Specifics:**

* **Output_0:** The '5' object is moved above the '2' object and mirrored horizontally.
* **Output_1:** The '5' object is moved to the left of the '2' object and mirrored horizontally.
* **Output_2:** The '5' object is moved to the top-left of the '2' object and mirrored horizontally.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)  # Extract object '2'
  obj5 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 5), I)  # Extract object '5'
  offset = gravitate(obj5, obj2)  # Calculate relative movement
  mirrored_obj5 = shift(hmirror(obj5), offset)  # Mirror and shift '5'
  O = paint(cover(I, obj5), mirrored_obj5)  # Paint mirrored '5'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Identifies and extracts the objects composed of '2' and '5' from the input grid.
2. **Calculate Relative Movement:** Determines the direction and magnitude to move the '5' object to be adjacent to the '2' object.
3. **Mirror and Shift:** Mirrors the '5' object horizontally and then shifts it according to the calculated offset.
4. **Paint Mirrored Object:**  Clears the original '5' object from the grid and paints the mirrored and shifted '5' object onto the grid.


**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)  # Extract object '2'
  obj5 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 5), I)  # Extract object '5'
  center2 = centerofmass(obj2)  # Find the center of mass for '2'
  center5 = centerofmass(obj5)  # Find the center of mass for '5'
  rel_pos = position(obj5, obj2)  # Determine relative position
  new_center5 = add(center2, multiply(rel_pos, shape(obj5)))  # Calculate new center for '5'
  offset = subtract(new_center5, center5)  # Calculate the offset
  mirrored_obj5 = shift(hmirror(obj5), offset)  # Mirror and shift '5'
  O = paint(cover(I, obj5), mirrored_obj5)  # Paint mirrored '5'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extracts the objects '2' and '5' from the grid.
2. **Find Centers of Mass:**  Determines the center of mass for both extracted objects.
3. **Calculate Relative Position:** Calculates the relative position of object '5' to object '2', considering both horizontal and vertical placement.
4. **Calculate New Center:** Based on the relative position and shape of object '5', the program determines the new center point for object '5'.
5. **Calculate Offset and Transform:** Calculates the offset based on the current and new center points of object '5', mirrors it horizontally, and shifts it by the calculated offset.
6. **Paint Mirrored Object:** Clears the original object '5' from the grid and paints the mirrored and shifted object '5' onto the grid.


**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  obj5 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 5), I)
  ul2 = ulcorner(obj2)
  offset = subtract(ul2, ulcorner(obj5))
  mirrored_obj5 = shift(hmirror(obj5), offset)
  O = paint(cover(I, obj5), mirrored_obj5)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Identifies and extracts the objects '2' and '5' from the input grid.
2. **Find Upper-Left Corners:**  Determines the upper-left corner coordinates of both objects.
3. **Calculate Offset:**  Calculates the difference between the upper-left corners of the two objects, which represents the required shift for object '5'.
4. **Mirror and Shift:**  Mirrors the '5' object horizontally and then shifts it using the calculated offset.
5. **Paint Mirrored Object:**  Clears the original '5' object from the grid and paints the mirrored and shifted '5' object onto the grid.


**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)  # Extract object '2'
  obj5 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 5), I)  # Extract object '5'
  offset = gravitate(obj5, hmirror(obj2))  # Calculate offset for mirrored '5'
  shifted_obj5 = shift(obj5, offset)  # Shift '5' to target location
  mirrored_obj5 = hmirror(shifted_obj5)  # Mirror '5' at target location
  O = paint(cover(I, obj5), mirrored_obj5)  # Paint the final '5' object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Identifies and extracts the objects '2' and '5'.
2. **Calculate Mirrored Offset:** Determines the offset needed to move the '5' object next to the horizontally mirrored '2' object, effectively predicting the final position after mirroring. 
3. **Shift to Target:** Moves the '5' object to its target location based on the mirrored offset.
4. **Mirror at Target:** Mirrors the '5' object horizontally at its target location.
5. **Paint Mirrored Object:** Clears the original '5' object from the grid and paints the mirrored and shifted '5' object onto the grid. 


**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  obj5 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 5), I)
  v_match = vmatching(obj2, obj5)  # Check for vertical matching
  target_obj5 = shift(hmirror(obj5), (height(obj2) if v_match else 0, 0))  # Calculate target position
  offset = subtract(ulcorner(target_obj5), ulcorner(obj5))  # Calculate the offset
  mirrored_obj5 = shift(obj5, offset)
  O = paint(cover(I, obj5), mirrored_obj5)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Extracts the objects '2' and '5' from the input grid.
2. **Check Vertical Alignment:**  Determines whether objects '2' and '5' are aligned vertically.
3. **Calculate Target Position:**  Calculates the final position of object '5' based on whether it needs to be moved vertically or not. The horizontal mirroring and vertical shift are done simultaneously.
4. **Calculate Offset:** Determines the difference between the starting and target positions of object '5', which represents the required shift.
5. **Shift to Target:**  Moves the '5' object to its target location based on the calculated offset. 
6. **Paint Mirrored Object:** Clears the original '5' object from the grid and paints the transformed '5' object onto the grid.
