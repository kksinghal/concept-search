## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects made of the digit '5' and moving them upwards by 4 units. If an object's center of mass lies to the right of the vertical center line of the grid, it is horizontally mirrored before being moved.

**Let's break it down:**

1. **Identify '5' Objects:** Locate all connected groups of the digit '5' in the input grid.
2. **Calculate Center of Mass:** Determine the center of mass for each '5' object.
3. **Conditional Mirroring:** 
    * If the center of mass lies on or to the left of the grid's vertical center line (column index 6), keep the object's orientation.
    * If the center of mass lies to the right of the grid's vertical center line, mirror the object horizontally.
4. **Vertical Shift:** Move all (potentially mirrored) objects upwards by 4 units. 

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  five_objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  shifted_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in five_objs:
    if centerofmass(obj)[1] <= 6:
      shifted_objs = shifted_objs | shift(obj, (-4, 0))
    else:
      shifted_objs = shifted_objs | shift(hmirror(obj), (-4, 0))
  O = paint(cover(I, five_objs), shifted_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Group:** `objects(I, True, False, False)` identifies connected regions of '5's as individual objects.
2. **Iterate and Shift:**  The code iterates through each '5' object (`obj`).
3. **Conditional Mirroring and Shifting:** Based on the horizontal position of the object's center of mass (`centerofmass(obj)[1]`), the object is either directly shifted upwards (`shift(obj, (-4, 0))`) or mirrored and then shifted (`shift(hmirror(obj), (-4, 0))`).
4. **Combine and Paint:**  Shifted objects are combined (`|`) and painted onto a blank canvas (`paint(cover(I, five_objs), shifted_objs)`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
    h, w = shape(I)
    five_indices = ofcolor(I, FIVE)
    O = fill(I, ZERO, five_indices)
    for i, j in five_indices:
        new_i = i - 4 
        new_j = j if j <= 6 else w - j + 6 
        if 0 <= new_i < h and 0 <= new_j < w:
          O = fill(O, FIVE, {(new_i, new_j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '5' Indices:** `ofcolor(I, FIVE)` retrieves the indices of all cells containing '5'.
2. **Clear '5's and Prepare Output:** `fill(I, ZERO, five_indices)` creates a copy of the input grid with '5's replaced by '0's.
3. **Iterate and Calculate New Positions:**  The code iterates through the indices of '5's, calculates their new positions (`new_i`, `new_j`) based on mirroring and shifting logic.
4. **Conditional Filling:** If the new position is within the grid boundaries, a '5' is filled at the new location in the output grid (`O`).

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  fives = objects(I, True, False, False)
  shifted = frozenset(shift(obj, (-4, 0)) if centerofmass(obj)[1] <= 6 else shift(hmirror(obj), (-4, 0)) for obj in fives)
  O = paint(cover(I, fives), merge(shifted))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Shift (Concise):** This version uses a more compact expression within `frozenset` to achieve both the conditional mirroring and shifting in a single line.
2. **Merge and Paint:**  Similar to version 1, shifted objects are merged and painted onto a cleared canvas. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  def transform(i, j):
    if I[i][j] != FIVE: return I[i][j]
    new_i = i - 4
    new_j = j if j <= 6 else w - j + 6
    return FIVE if 0 <= new_i < h and 0 <= new_j < w else ZERO
  O = tuple(tuple(transform(i, j) for j in range(w)) for i in range(h))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `transform` Function:**  A helper function `transform` encapsulates the logic for determining the new value at each grid position.
2. **Apply `transform` Cell-wise:**  The code iterates through each cell in the grid and applies the `transform` function to determine its new value.

**Program Version 5:** 

```python
def program_v5(I):
    h, w = shape(I)
    O = canvas(ZERO, (h, w))
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
      for j, val in enumerate(row):
        if val == FIVE:
          new_i = i - 4
          new_j = j if j <= 6 else w - j + 6
          if 0 <= new_i < h and 0 <= new_j < w:
            O = fill(O, FIVE, {(new_i, new_j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:**  An empty canvas (`O`) of the same size as the input grid is created, filled with zeros.
2. **Iterate and Conditionally Paint:**  The program iterates through the input grid, calculates the new position for '5's, and fills them onto the canvas only if the new position is valid.


These are just five examples, and there are likely many other valid and distinct solutions within the DSL.  Each version highlights different aspects of the DSL and presents a unique approach to problem-solving.
