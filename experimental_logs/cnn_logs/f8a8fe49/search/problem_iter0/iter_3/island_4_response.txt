## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '5', and then moving them based on their position. 

* **Objects on the left half of the grid (rightmost column <= 6):** These objects are moved three cells upwards.
* **Objects on the right half of the grid (rightmost column > 6):** These objects are moved seven cells upwards.

Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
- The '5' object on the right is moved three cells up.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- The '5' objects on the left are moved three cells up.
- The '5' objects on the right are moved seven cells up.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
-  The '5' objects on the left are moved three cells up.
-  The '5' objects on the right are moved seven cells up.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_objs = colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), FIVE)
  left_objs = sfilter(five_objs, lambda obj: rightmost(obj) <= 6)
  right_objs = difference(five_objs, left_objs)
  moved_left_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (-3, 0)), left_objs)
  moved_right_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (-7, 0)), right_objs)
  O = paint(
      cover(cover(I, left_objs), right_objs), 
      combine(moved_left_objs, moved_right_objs)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '5' Objects:**  We use `colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), FIVE)` to find all objects made of the digit '5'.
2. **Split by Position:** We separate the objects into `left_objs` and `right_objs` based on their `rightmost` column position relative to column 6.
3. **Move Objects:** We use `apply` and `shift` to move the `left_objs` three cells up (`(-3, 0)`) and the `right_objs` seven cells up (`(-7, 0)`).
4. **Paint to Grid:** We first use `cover` twice to remove the original '5' objects from the input grid `I`. Then, we use `paint` to add the `moved_left_objs` and `moved_right_objs` to the grid, creating the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def move_five(obj):
    return shift(obj, (-3, 0)) if rightmost(obj) <= 6 else shift(obj, (-7, 0))
  five_objs = colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), FIVE)
  moved_objs = apply(move_five, five_objs)
  O = paint(cover(I, five_objs), moved_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `move_five` Function:**  This function takes an object and moves it three cells up if its `rightmost` column is less than or equal to 6, otherwise seven cells up.
2. **Identify and Move:**  We identify '5' objects and directly apply the `move_five` function using `apply`.
3. **Paint to Grid:**  Similar to Version 1, we `cover` the original objects and then `paint` the moved objects to the grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_indices = ofcolor(I, FIVE)
  moved_indices = frozenset(
    (i - 3 if j <= 6 else i - 7, j) for i, j in five_indices
  )
  O = fill(fill(I, ZERO, five_indices), FIVE, moved_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '5' Indices:** We use `ofcolor(I, FIVE)` to find the indices of all cells with the value '5'.
2. **Calculate Moved Indices:** We directly calculate the new indices based on the condition `j <= 6` (left or right half) and apply the appropriate vertical shift.
3. **Fill Grid:** We use `fill` twice â€“ first to replace the original '5's with '0's and then to fill the `moved_indices` with '5's.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == FIVE:
        new_i = i - 3 if j <= 6 else i - 7
        if 0 <= new_i < len(I):
          O = paint(cover(O, {(FIVE, (i, j))}), {(FIVE, (new_i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** This version iterates through each cell of the grid.
2. **Conditional Move:** If a cell contains '5', it calculates the new row index (`new_i`) based on the column position and ensures it's within the grid boundaries. 
3. **Paint and Cover:** It then covers the original '5' and paints a new '5' at the calculated position.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def move_row(row, row_index):
    new_row = list(row)
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == FIVE:
        new_i = row_index - 3 if j <= 6 else row_index - 7
        if 0 <= new_i < len(I):
          new_row[j] = ZERO
          if 0 <= new_i < len(I):
            new_row[j] = FIVE
    return tuple(new_row)

  O = tuple(move_row(row, i) for i, row in enumerate(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `move_row` Function:**  This function takes a row and its index, identifies '5's, calculates their new positions, and modifies the row accordingly.
2. **Apply to Rows:**  The program applies `move_row` to each row of the grid using a list comprehension. 
3. **Construct Output:** The modified rows are then combined to form the output grid.

These five program versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation. They highlight the flexibility of DSL in solving spatial reasoning tasks.
