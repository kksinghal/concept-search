## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects made of the digit '5', then moving them to a new location based on their original position in the grid. 

* **Horizontal Split:** The grid is conceptually divided vertically into two halves: a left half (columns 0-6) and a right half (columns 7-14).

* **Object Movement:**
    * Objects originating in the left half are moved three units upwards.
    * Objects originating in the right half are moved seven units upwards.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1: Using `ofcolor`, `sfilter`, and `apply`**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_indices = ofcolor(I, FIVE)
  left_indices = sfilter(five_indices, lambda loc: loc[1] <= 6)
  right_indices = difference(five_indices, left_indices)
  moved_left = apply(lambda loc: (loc[0] - 3, loc[1]), left_indices)
  moved_right = apply(lambda loc: (loc[0] - 7, loc[1]), right_indices)
  O = fill(fill(I, ZERO, five_indices), FIVE, moved_left | moved_right)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '5' cells:** `five_indices = ofcolor(I, FIVE)` gets the indices of all cells containing '5'.
2. **Split indices:**  `left_indices` and `right_indices` are created by filtering `five_indices` based on column position.
3. **Calculate new positions:** `moved_left` and `moved_right` apply the upward shift to their respective index sets.
4. **Update grid:** The original '5's are replaced with '0's using `fill`. Then, '5's are painted at the new positions using another `fill` and set union (`|`).

**Version 2: Using `objects`, `sfilter`, and `paint`**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_objs = colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), FIVE)
  left_objs = sfilter(five_objs, lambda obj: rightmost(obj) <= 6)
  right_objs = difference(five_objs, left_objs)
  moved_left_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (-3, 0)), left_objs)
  moved_right_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (-7, 0)), right_objs)
  O = paint(
      cover(I, combine(left_objs, right_objs)),
      combine(moved_left_objs, moved_right_objs)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  `five_objs` stores all objects made of '5' using `colorfilter(objects(...), FIVE)`.
2. **Split objects:** `left_objs` and `right_objs` divide the objects based on their rightmost column.
3. **Move objects:**  The objects in `left_objs` and `right_objs` are shifted upwards by -3 and -7 respectively.
4. **Update grid:** The original positions of all '5' objects are cleared using `cover`. The moved objects are then painted onto the grid using `paint`.

**Version 3: Using a helper function and `mapply`**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  def move_five(obj):
    return shift(obj, (-3, 0)) if rightmost(obj) <= 6 else shift(obj, (-7, 0))
  five_objs = colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), FIVE)
  moved_objs = mapply(move_five, five_objs)
  O = paint(cover(I, five_objs), moved_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Helper function:** `move_five(obj)` determines the shift amount based on the object's position and returns the shifted object.
2. **Identify and move:** `five_objs` is found as before.  `mapply` applies `move_five` to each object in `five_objs`.
3. **Update grid:**  Similar to version 2, the original objects are covered and the moved objects are painted.

**Version 4: Using list comprehension and `paint`**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_objs = colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), FIVE)
  moved_objs = frozenset({(v, (i - 3, j)) if j <= 6 else (v, (i - 7, j)) for obj in five_objs for v, (i, j) in obj})
  O = paint(cover(I, five_objs), moved_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  `five_objs` stores all objects made of '5' as before.
2. **Move cells directly:** A set comprehension iterates through each cell of each '5' object and calculates the new position based on its column. 
3. **Update grid:**  Similar to previous versions, the original objects are covered and the moved objects are painted.

**Version 5: Using `index`, `asindices`, and conditional `fill`**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i, j in asindices(I):
        if index(I, (i, j)) == FIVE:
            new_i = i - 3 if j <= 6 else i - 7
            O = fill(O, ZERO, ((i, j),))
            O = fill(O, FIVE, ((new_i, j),))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** This version iterates through every cell in the grid using `asindices`.
2. **Check for '5':** If a cell contains a '5', its new row index (`new_i`) is calculated.
3. **Update grid:** The original cell is filled with '0' and the corresponding cell at the new position is filled with '5'.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, leveraging various functions and programming constructs available in the DSL. Each version provides a unique perspective on solving the problem, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
