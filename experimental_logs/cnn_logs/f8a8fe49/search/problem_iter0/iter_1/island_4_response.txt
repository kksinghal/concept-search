## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extracting the objects made of digit '5', and moving them to a new location based on their initial position in the grid. 

* **If the object is located on the left half of the grid (column index <= 6), it is shifted three units upwards and three units to the left.**
* **If the object is located on the right half of the grid (column index > 6), it is shifted seven units upwards and seven units to the left.**

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_objs = colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), FIVE)
  moved_objs = frozenset(
      shift(obj, (-3, -3)) if leftmost(obj) <= 6 else shift(obj, (7, -7))
      for obj in five_objs
  )
  O = paint(cover(I, five_objs), moved_objs)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`five_objs = colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), FIVE)`:** Extracts all objects consisting only of the color '5'.
2. **`moved_objs = ...`:**  Iterates through each '5' object and calculates its new position based on its leftmost cell's column index. It applies the corresponding shift to the object.
3. **`O = paint(cover(I, five_objs), moved_objs)`:**  Removes the original '5' objects from the input grid and paints the shifted objects onto the cleared grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == FIVE:
        new_i = i - 3 if j <= 6 else i + 7
        new_j = j - 3 if j <= 6 else j - 7
        if 0 <= new_i < len(I) and 0 <= new_j < len(row):
          O = paint(cover(O, {(FIVE, (i, j))}), {(FIVE, (new_i, new_j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. **Iterates through each cell:** For every cell containing '5', it calculates the new position based on the column index.
3. **`O = paint(cover(O, {(FIVE, (i, j))}), {(FIVE, (new_i, new_j))})`:**  Replaces the current '5' cell with the background color and paints a '5' at the calculated new location if it's within the grid boundaries.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_indices = ofcolor(I, FIVE)
  left_indices = sfilter(five_indices, lambda loc: loc[1] <= 6)
  right_indices = sfilter(five_indices, lambda loc: loc[1] > 6)
  left_shifted = shift(left_indices, (-3, -3))
  right_shifted = shift(right_indices, (7, -7))
  O = fill(fill(I, ZERO, five_indices), FIVE, left_shifted | right_shifted)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Finds indices of '5':**  Identifies and separates indices of '5' cells into left and right halves based on column index.
2. **Shifts indices:** Applies the specific shifts to left and right indices.
3. **Fills the grid:** Clears the original '5' positions and fills in the new positions with '5'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  left_half = crop(I, (0, 0), (len(I), len(I[0]) // 2 + len(I[0]) % 2))
  right_half = crop(I, (0, len(I[0]) // 2), (len(I), len(I[0]) // 2 + len(I[0]) % 2))
  left_shifted = shift(recolor(ZERO, ofcolor(left_half, FIVE)), (-3, -3))
  right_shifted = shift(recolor(ZERO, ofcolor(right_half, FIVE)), (7, -7))
  O = paint(paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), left_shifted), right_shifted)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Splits and processes halves:**  Splits the grid into left and right halves. Extracts and shifts indices of '5' within each half.
2. **Paints on a blank canvas:** Creates a blank canvas and paints the shifted indices from both halves onto it.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  left_objs = sfilter(five_objs, lambda obj: leftmost(obj) <= 6)
  right_objs = sfilter(five_objs, lambda obj: leftmost(obj) > 6)
  O = I
  for obj in left_objs:
    O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (-3,-3)))
  for obj in right_objs:
    O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (7,-7)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identifies and separates objects:** Extracts all objects of '5' and categorizes them into left and right sets based on their leftmost cell's column index.
2. **Iterative shifting and painting:**  Iterates through each set and performs the corresponding shift on each object. It then paints the shifted object onto a copy of the input grid after removing the original object.


Each of these programs provides a distinct approach to achieving the desired transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and diverse solutions possible within the given DSL.
