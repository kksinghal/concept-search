## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves moving objects composed of the digit '5'.  Let's break down the movement pattern for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The '5'-object on the left side of the grid moves 3 units upwards.
* The '5'-object on the right side of the grid moves 3 units downwards.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The '5'-object is split into three individual cells.
* The top '5' cell moves 3 units upwards and 9 units to the right.
* The middle '5' cell moves 4 units upwards and 9 units to the right.
* The bottom '5' cell moves 5 units upwards and 9 units to the right.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The '5'-object is split into four individual cells.
* The top '5' cell moves 4 units upwards and 9 units to the right.
* The second '5' cell moves 5 units upwards and 9 units to the right.
* The third '5' cell moves 6 units upwards and 9 units to the right.
* The bottom '5' cell moves 7 units upwards and 9 units to the right.

**Overall Pattern:**

The transformation consistently moves '5'-objects (or individual '5' cells) upwards. The horizontal movement is always 9 units to the right. The vertical movement depends on the initial vertical position of the '5' cell: higher cells move less upwards.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each with an explanation of its logic:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_objs = colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), FIVE)
  moved_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in five_objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      new_i = i - (3 if j <= 6 else 7) 
      new_j = j + 9
      moved_objs = moved_objs | {(v, (new_i, new_j))}
  O = paint(cover(I, five_objs), moved_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '5'-objects:**  Uses `colorfilter` and `objects` to isolate objects formed by the digit '5'.
2. **Calculate new positions:** Iterates through each cell of each '5'-object. For each cell, calculates the new row index (`new_i`) based on its column position (`j`) and a fixed vertical offset. The column index (`new_j`) is shifted 9 units to the right.
3. **Construct moved objects:**  Builds a new set (`moved_objs`) representing the '5'-objects in their new positions.
4. **Paint to the grid:**  Uses `cover` to remove the original '5'-objects from the input grid (`I`) and then `paint` to draw the `moved_objs` onto the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_indices = ofcolor(I, FIVE)
  moved_indices = frozenset((i - (3 if j <= 6 else 7), j + 9) for i, j in five_indices)
  O = fill(fill(I, ZERO, five_indices), FIVE, moved_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '5' cell indices:**  Uses `ofcolor` to find the indices of all cells containing the digit '5'.
2. **Calculate new indices:** Creates a new set (`moved_indices`) by applying the movement logic directly to the indices.
3. **Fill the grid:** Empties the original '5' cell positions using `fill` with value `ZERO`. Then, fills the `moved_indices` with the digit '5' using another `fill` operation.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == FIVE:
        new_i = i - (3 if j <= 6 else 7)
        new_j = j + 9
        O = paint(cover(O, {(FIVE, (i, j))}), {(FIVE, (new_i, new_j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through the grid:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid (`I`).
2. **Identify '5' cells:**  Checks if the cell value is '5'.
3. **Calculate and apply movement:** If a '5' cell is found, calculates its new position and uses `cover` and `paint` to move it.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fives =  {(FIVE, (i, j)) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, value in enumerate(row) if value == FIVE}
  moved_fives = {(v, (i - (3 if j <= 6 else 7), j + 9)) for v, (i, j) in fives}
  O = paint(cover(I, mfilter(fives, lambda x: x[0] == FIVE)), moved_fives)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '5' cell objects:** Uses a set comprehension to create a set (`fives`) of all '5' cells as objects.
2. **Calculate moved objects:**  Applies the movement logic directly within a set comprehension to generate the `moved_fives` set.
3. **Paint the moved objects:** Uses `cover` to remove original '5' cells and then `paint` to draw the `moved_fives`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  five_objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  O = I
  for obj in five_objs:
    if color(obj) == FIVE:
      O = paint(
        cover(O, obj), 
        shift(
          obj, 
          (-3 if leftmost(obj) <= 6 else -7, 9)
        )
      ) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '5'-objects:** Uses `colorfilter` and `objects` to locate objects made of the digit '5'.
2. **Move and paint:** Iterates through each '5'-object, covers the original object using `cover`, and then paints the object in its new position using `shift` and `paint`. The vertical offset is determined based on the object's leftmost position.

## Conclusion:

These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformation within the constraints of the DSL. Each version leverages different function combinations and logic flows, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
