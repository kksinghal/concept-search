## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects made of the digit '5' and moving them downwards while simultaneously shifting them horizontally. The horizontal shift depends on the object's initial horizontal position:

* **Objects with their rightmost cell at or before column 6:** Shifted 3 units to the right.
* **Objects with their rightmost cell after column 6:** Shifted 7 units to the right. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input 0:** The '5' object is shifted 3 units down and 3 units right, as its rightmost cell is at column 6. 
* **Input 1:** The two individual '5' cells are treated as separate objects. The left one shifts 3 units down and 7 units right (rightmost cell after column 6), while the right one shifts 3 units down and 3 units right (rightmost cell at column 6).
* **Input 2:**  Similar to Input 1, the left '5' object shifts down 3 and right 7, while the right one shifts down 3 and right 3.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  five_objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  shifted_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in five_objs:
    if rightmost(obj) > 6:
      shifted_objs = shifted_objs | shift(obj, (3, 7))
    else:
      shifted_objs = shifted_objs | shift(obj, (3, 3))
  O = paint(cover(I, five_objs), shifted_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '5' objects:** `objects(I, True, False, False)` finds all connected objects in the grid `I`.
2. **Shift each object:**  Iterate through each '5' object and apply the appropriate horizontal shift based on its `rightmost` cell position.
3. **Paint shifted objects:**  `cover(I, five_objs)` removes the original '5' objects. `paint()` then draws the `shifted_objs` onto the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  fives =  {(FIVE, (i, j)) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, value in enumerate(row) if value == FIVE}
  moved_fives = {(v, (i + 3, j + (3 if j <= 6 else 7))) for v, (i, j) in fives}
  O = paint(cover(I, fives), moved_fives)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '5' cells:**  Iterate through the grid and collect the coordinates of all cells containing '5'.
2. **Calculate new positions:** Determine the new coordinates for each '5' cell based on its column position.
3. **Paint onto the grid:** Similar to version 1, remove the original '5's and paint the shifted ones.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  five_indices = ofcolor(I, FIVE)
  shifted_indices = frozenset()
  for i, j in five_indices:
    new_j = j + (3 if j <= 6 else 7)
    shifted_indices = shifted_indices | {(i + 3, new_j)}
  O = fill(fill(I, ZERO, five_indices), FIVE, shifted_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get indices of '5's:** `ofcolor(I, FIVE)` returns the coordinates of all cells containing '5'.
2. **Calculate shifted indices:**  Similar to version 2, determine new coordinates.
3. **Fill grid with shifted values:**  Use nested `fill()` to first erase '5's and then paint them at their new positions.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(len(I[0])):
    for i in range(len(I)):
      if I[i][j] == FIVE:
        new_i = i + 3
        new_j = j + (3 if j <= 6 else 7)
        if 0 <= new_i < len(I) and 0 <= new_j < len(I[0]):
          O = paint(cover(O, {(FIVE, (i, j))}), {(FIVE, (new_i, new_j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through grid:**  Traverse the grid column by column.
2. **Shift and paint:** If a cell contains '5', calculate its new position and paint it there, erasing the original.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  five_objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  O = I
  for obj in five_objs:
    shift_amount = (3, 3) if rightmost(obj) <= 6 else (3, 7)
    O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, shift_amount))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '5' objects:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Shift and paint iteratively:**  Iterate through objects, determine the shift amount, and apply it while painting directly onto the output grid `O`.

These five programs demonstrate diverse ways to achieve the same transformation using the DSL. Each version utilizes different function combinations and logic flow, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided language.
