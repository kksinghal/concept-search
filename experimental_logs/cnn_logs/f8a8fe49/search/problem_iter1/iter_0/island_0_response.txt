## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving the object made of the digit '5' to a new location relative to the object made of the digit '2'. The '5' object retains its original shape but is mirrored horizontally before being moved. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input 0:** The '5' object is moved below the '2' object, aligning its right edge with the right edge of the '2' object.

**Input 1:** The '5' object is moved to the right of the '2' object, aligning its top edge with the top edge of the '2' object.

**Input 2:**  The '5' object is moved to the right of the '2' object, aligning its center horizontally with the top edge of the '2' object.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj_2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  obj_5 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 5), I)
  mirrored_obj_5 = hmirror(obj_5)
  new_obj_5 = shift(mirrored_obj_5, (lowermost(obj_2) - uppermost(mirrored_obj_5) + 1, rightmost(obj_2) - rightmost(mirrored_obj_5)))
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_5), new_obj_5)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  We identify the objects formed by digits '2' and '5' in the input grid `I`.
2. **Mirror '5' object:** The '5' object is mirrored horizontally.
3. **Calculate new position:** The new upper-left corner of the mirrored '5' object is calculated to align its right edge with the right edge of the '2' object and place it just below the '2' object.
4. **Shift and paint:** The mirrored '5' object is shifted to the calculated position and painted onto a copy of the input grid where the original '5' object has been erased.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj_2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  obj_5 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 5), I)
  target_loc = (lowermost(obj_2) + 1, rightmost(obj_2) - width(obj_5) + 1) 
  new_obj_5 = shift(hmirror(obj_5), subtract(target_loc, ulcorner(obj_5)))
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_5), new_obj_5)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Same as version 1.
2. **Calculate target location:**  We calculate the desired upper-left corner location (`target_loc`) for the moved '5' object. 
3. **Calculate shift:** The required shift vector is calculated by subtracting the original upper-left corner of the '5' object from the `target_loc`.
4. **Shift, mirror, and paint:** The '5' object is mirrored horizontally, shifted using the calculated vector, and painted onto the grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj_2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  obj_5 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 5), I)
  h_offset = width(obj_2) - width(obj_5)
  new_obj_5 = shift(hmirror(obj_5), (lowermost(obj_2) - uppermost(obj_5) + 1, h_offset))
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_5), new_obj_5)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Same as version 1.
2. **Calculate horizontal offset:** The horizontal offset required to align the right edges of the '2' and '5' objects is calculated.
3. **Shift, mirror, and paint:** The '5' object is mirrored horizontally, shifted vertically to be below the '2' object and horizontally by the calculated offset, and then painted onto the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj_2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  obj_5 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 5), I)
  v_shift =  lowermost(obj_2) - uppermost(obj_5) + 1
  h_shift = rightmost(obj_2) - rightmost(obj_5) 
  new_obj_5 = shift(hmirror(obj_5), (v_shift, h_shift))
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_5), new_obj_5)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Same as version 1.
2. **Calculate vertical and horizontal shift:** Calculate separate vertical and horizontal shift values based on the positions of the '2' and '5' objects.
3. **Shift, mirror, and paint:** The '5' object is mirrored horizontally, shifted  using the calculated vertical and horizontal shifts, and then painted onto the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj_2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  obj_5 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 5), I)
  new_obj_5  =  shift(hmirror(obj_5), (lowermost(obj_2) - uppermost(hmirror(obj_5)) + 1, rightmost(obj_2) - rightmost(hmirror(obj_5))))
  O = paint(cover(I, obj_5), new_obj_5)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Same as version 1.
2. **Calculate new position (with mirroring considered):**  Instead of calculating the shift separately, the new position of the mirrored '5' object is calculated directly by considering the dimensions of the mirrored object.
3. **Shift and paint:** The '5' object is mirrored horizontally, shifted to the calculated position, and painted onto the grid.


These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation while utilizing the provided DSL functions. Each version demonstrates a different way of calculating the new position or shift required for the '5' object after being mirrored horizontally.
