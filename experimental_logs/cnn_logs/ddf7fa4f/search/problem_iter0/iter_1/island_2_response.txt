## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all input-output examples follows a consistent pattern:

* **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains distinct objects defined by connected cells of the same value (excluding the background color, which is the most frequent).
* **Relocate Objects:** The transformation involves relocating these objects to different positions within the grid.
* **Reference Point:** The relocation seems based on a reference point within each object, potentially a corner (upper-left or lower-left). 
* **Offset Calculation:** The difference between the reference points of different objects determines the offset used to relocate them.

Let's break down each example:

**Example 0:**

* The '2' object moves to the position of the '5' object.
* The '8' object moves to the position relative to the new position of the '2' object where it was originally relative to the '5' object. 

**Example 1 & 2:**

*  These examples follow the same pattern as example 0, showcasing the consistency of the transformation rule.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True) # Extract objects (without background)
  colors = sorted(palette(objs))  # Get sorted list of object colors
  obj1 = next((obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == colors[0]), None)  # Object with the smallest color
  obj2 = next((obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == colors[1]), None)  # Object with the second smallest color
  obj3 = next((obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == colors[2]), None)  # Object with the largest color

  if obj1 is None or obj2 is None or obj3 is None:
    return I

  offset2 = subtract(llcorner(obj2), ulcorner(obj1))  # Calculate offset from obj1 to obj2
  offset3 = subtract(llcorner(obj3), ulcorner(obj1))  # Calculate offset from obj1 to obj3

  new_obj2 = shift(obj1, offset2)  # Move obj1 to obj2's position
  new_obj3 = shift(obj1, offset3)  # Move obj1 to obj3's position

  O = paint(paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), obj1), new_obj2), new_obj3) # Paint on canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify all distinct objects within the grid.
2. **Sort Colors:** Obtain a sorted list of unique colors present in the objects.
3. **Identify Key Objects:**  Select three objects based on their color ranking (smallest, second smallest, largest).
4. **Calculate Offsets:** Determine the positional difference (offset) between the reference points (lower-left corner) of the key objects.
5. **Relocate Objects:**  Shift the first object to the positions determined by the calculated offsets.
6. **Paint Canvas:** Create a blank canvas and paint the relocated objects onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  obj1 = first(sorted(objs, key=lambda obj: llcorner(obj)[0])) # Find the topmost object
  ref_point = llcorner(obj1) # Reference point is the lower-left corner of the topmost object

  new_objs = []
  for obj in objs:
    offset = subtract(llcorner(obj), ref_point) # Calculate offset from the reference point
    new_objs.append(shift(obj1, offset)) # Shift object based on offset

  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(new_objs)) # Paint shifted objects on canvas
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects & Find Topmost:** Identify objects and find the one with the smallest row index (topmost).
2. **Define Reference:** Set the lower-left corner of the topmost object as the reference point.
3. **Calculate Offsets & Shift:**  For each object, calculate the offset from the reference point and shift it accordingly.
4. **Paint on Canvas:**  Create a blank canvas and paint all the shifted objects.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  sorted_objs = sorted(objs, key=lambda obj: (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)))  # Sort objects by top-left corner
  ref_obj = sorted_objs[0] # The reference object is the top-left most object
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) 

  for i in range(len(sorted_objs)):
    offset = subtract(llcorner(sorted_objs[i]), llcorner(ref_obj)) # Calculate offset from the reference object
    O = paint(O, shift(ref_obj, offset)) # Shift and paint the reference object

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects & Sort:** Extract objects and sort them based on their upper-left corner position.
2. **Set Reference:**  The top-left most object is considered the reference object.
3. **Iterate & Relocate:** For each object, calculate the offset from the reference object's lower-left corner and shift the **reference object** by this offset before painting it on the canvas.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  min_i = min(uppermost(obj) for obj in objs) # Find minimum row index among objects
  min_j = min(leftmost(obj) for obj in objs if uppermost(obj) == min_i) # Find min column index among topmost objects
  ref_point = (min_i, min_j) # Define reference point 

  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    offset = subtract(llcorner(obj), ref_point) # Calculate offset from reference point
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, offset)) # Shift object based on offset

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects & Find Reference:** Extract objects and determine the top-left most point among all objects as the reference point.
2. **Iterate & Relocate:** Calculate the offset of each object's lower-left corner from the reference point and shift the object accordingly before painting.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    ref_obj = min(objs, key=lambda obj: (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)))  # Find the top-leftmost object
    ref_corner = llcorner(ref_obj)  # Use the bottom-left corner of the reference object

    new_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))
    for obj in objs:
        offset = subtract(llcorner(obj), ref_corner)  # Calculate the offset from the reference corner
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(obj, offset))  # Shift and paint the object

    return new_grid

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects & Find Reference:** Similar to version 4, it finds the top-leftmost object.
2. **Set Reference Corner:**  It uses the **bottom-left** corner of the reference object instead of the top-left.
3. **Iterate, Calculate Offset, and Paint:** Iterates through objects, calculates the offset based on the reference corner, shifts the object, and paints it on the canvas.

These five versions provide diverse solutions by:

* **Different Reference Points:** Utilizing different corners of objects or the grid itself.
* **Sorting & Selection:** Employing various sorting criteria and object selection methods.
* **Iteration Strategies:** Implementing distinct looping and object processing approaches.
