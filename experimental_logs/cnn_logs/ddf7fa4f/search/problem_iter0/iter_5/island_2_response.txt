## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects based on their unique digit values and then relocating these objects to specific positions on the grid. The destination positions and object sizes remain consistent across all examples.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The object with digit '5' moves down by one row. 
* The object with digit '6' moves up to replace the initial position of the '5' object.
* The object with digit '8' moves up to the second-to-last row.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The object with digit '4' moves down to the second-to-last row.
* The object with digit '7' moves up to replace the initial position of the '4' object.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The object with digit '6' moves down by three rows.
* The object with digit '7' moves up to replace the initial position of the '6' object.

## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_90f3ed37(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
    obj5 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 5)
    obj6 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 6)
    obj8 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
    I = move(I, obj5, DOWN)
    I = move(I, obj6, (-1, 0))
    I = move(I, obj8, (-6, 0))
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identify objects in the grid (`objects`)
2. Extract specific objects based on their color values (e.g., `obj5` for digit '5')
3. Move each extracted object to its new location using the `move` function and predefined directions (`DOWN`, `(-1, 0)`, `(-6, 0)`)

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_90f3ed37(I):
    for value in [5, 6, 8]:
        obj = extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == value)
        if value == 5:
            I = move(I, obj, DOWN)
        elif value == 6:
            I = move(I, obj, (-1, 0))
        elif value == 8:
            I = move(I, obj, (-6, 0))
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterate through digit values [5, 6, 8]
2. Extract the corresponding object from the grid using `objects` and `extract`
3. Move the object based on its value using conditional statements and the `move` function with predefined directions. 


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_90f3ed37(I):
  movements = {5: DOWN, 6: (-1, 0), 8: (-6, 0)}
  for value, direction in movements.items():
    obj = extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == value)
    I = move(I, obj, direction)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. Define a dictionary `movements` mapping digit values to their corresponding movement directions.
2. Iterate through the `movements` dictionary.
3. For each digit value, extract the object from the grid and move it using the `move` function and the direction from the `movements` dictionary.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_90f3ed37(I):
    def relocate(obj):
        return move(I, obj, {5: DOWN, 6: (-1, 0), 8: (-6, 0)}[color(obj)])
    return paint(cover(I, merge(objects(I, T, T, T))), merge(apply(relocate, objects(I, T, T, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. Define a nested function `relocate` that takes an object as input and returns the grid with the object moved to its new location based on its color.
2. Apply the `relocate` function to all objects in the grid using `apply`.
3. Cover the original objects in the grid with the background color using `cover`.
4. Paint the relocated objects onto the covered grid using `paint`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_90f3ed37(I):
  def move_object(value, direction):
      obj = extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == value)
      return move(I, obj, direction)

  I = move_object(5, DOWN)
  I = move_object(6, (-1, 0))
  I = move_object(8, (-6, 0))
  
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. Define a nested function `move_object` that takes a value and direction as input and moves the object with that value in the given direction.
2. Call `move_object` for each object to be moved with its corresponding direction.
