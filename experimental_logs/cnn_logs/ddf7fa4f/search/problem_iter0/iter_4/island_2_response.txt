## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all examples involves identifying objects of unique colors, swapping their positions, and then replacing their original colors with different ones. 

**Input 0:**
- The object composed of '2's swaps positions with the object composed of '5's.
- The '2's are then recolored to '2's.
- The '5's are recolored to '6's.
- The '8's remain in the same position but are recolored to '8's.

**Input 1:**
- The object composed of '1's swaps positions with the object composed of '5's.
- The '1's are then recolored to '1's.
- The '5's are recolored to '7's.
- The '4's and '7's remain in the same position but are recolored to '4's and '7's respectively. 

**Input 2:**
- The object composed of '1's swaps positions with the object composed of '5's.
- The '1's are then recolored to '1's.
- The '5's are recolored to '7's.
- The '6's and '7's remain in the same position but are recolored to '6's and '7's respectively. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True) # Extract objects, excluding background
  colors = sorted(list(palette(I))) # Get sorted list of colors
  
  obj1 = next((obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == colors[0]), None)
  obj2 = next((obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == colors[1]), None)
  obj3 = next((obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == colors[2]), None)
  
  # Handle potential missing objects gracefully
  if not all([obj1, obj2, obj3]):
    return I  # Return the input unchanged if any object is missing
  
  canvas_ = canvas(0, shape(I))
  canvas_ = paint(canvas_, recolor(colors[0], obj2))
  canvas_ = paint(canvas_, recolor(colors[1], obj1))
  O = paint(canvas_, recolor(colors[1], obj3))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify all distinct objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Get Sorted Colors:**  Obtain a sorted list of unique colors present in the grid.
3. **Find Objects by Color:** Locate the objects corresponding to the first three colors in the sorted list.
4. **Handle Missing Objects:** If any of the three objects are not found (i.e., `None`), return the original input grid to prevent errors.
5. **Create Canvas:** Generate an empty canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid.
6. **Swap and Recolor:** Paint the objects onto the canvas in the swapped order and with the new colors.
7. **Return Output:** The function returns the modified canvas `O` as the output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  colors = sorted(list(palette(I)))
  
  obj_mapping = {color(obj): obj for obj in objs} 
  
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for c in colors:
    if c == colors[0]:
      O = paint(O, recolor(colors[1], obj_mapping.get(c, frozenset())))
    elif c == colors[1]:
      O = paint(O, recolor(colors[0], obj_mapping.get(c, frozenset())))
    else:
      O = paint(O, recolor(colors[1], obj_mapping.get(c, frozenset())))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects & Colors:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Create Object Mapping:**  Create a dictionary mapping colors to their corresponding objects.
3. **Iterate and Recolor:** Loop through each color in the sorted list and paint the corresponding object onto a blank canvas using the designated color mapping. 
4. **Return Output:** The function returns the modified canvas `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  colors = sorted(list(palette(I)))
  
  obj1_indices = toindices(next((obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == colors[0]), frozenset()))
  obj2_indices = toindices(next((obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == colors[1]), frozenset()))
  obj3_indices = toindices(next((obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == colors[2]), frozenset()))
  
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  O = fill(O, colors[1], obj1_indices)
  O = fill(O, colors[0], obj2_indices)
  O = fill(O, colors[1], obj3_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects & Colors:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Get Object Indices:**  Extract the indices of each object based on their color.
3. **Fill Canvas with Indices:** Fill a blank canvas with the desired colors using the extracted object indices.
4. **Return Output:** The function returns the modified canvas `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    colors = sorted(list(palette(I)))
    O = I
    for i, c in enumerate(colors):
      if i == 0:
        O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(colors[1], next((obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == c), frozenset())))
      elif i == 1:
        O = paint(O, recolor(colors[0], next((obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == c), frozenset())))
      else:
        O = paint(O, recolor(colors[1], next((obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == c), frozenset()))) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects & Colors:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Iterate and Paint:** Iterate through the colors and paint each object onto a copy of the input grid with the new color mapping.
3. **Return Output:** The function returns the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  colors = sorted(list(palette(I)))
  
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    c = color(obj)
    new_color = colors[1] if c in (colors[0], colors[2]) else colors[0] 
    O = paint(O, recolor(new_color, obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects & Colors:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:**  Iterate through each object, determine its new color based on its original color, and paint it onto a blank canvas.
3. **Return Output:** The function returns the modified canvas `O`.

These five program versions offer distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation, utilizing different function combinations and logic within the DSL. Each version is designed to handle potential edge cases like missing objects and ensure the correct color mapping for all objects in the input grid.
