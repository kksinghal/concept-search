## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to identify objects in the grid and then "flood fill" them with the color of another object. The choice of which object gets filled and what color it is filled with seems to be based on relative positions and sizes of the objects.

**Input 0:** The objects with colors 5 and 8 are filled with the color of the object with value 2 and 6, respectively. 

**Input 1:**  The objects with colors 5 and 4 are filled with the color of the object with value 1 and 7, respectively.

**Input 2:**  The objects with colors 5 and 6 are filled with the color of the object with value 1 and 7, respectively.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:


**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj1 in objs:
    for obj2 in objs:
      if color(obj1) != color(obj2) and size(obj1) > size(obj2) and manhattan(obj1, obj2) == 2:
        I = fill(I, color(obj2), toindices(obj1))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` finds all distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Compare:**  We iterate through each pair of objects (`obj1`, `obj2`).
3. **Conditions for Filling:**  We check if:
    - The objects have different colors (`color(obj1) != color(obj2)`).
    - `obj1` is larger than `obj2` (`size(obj1) > size(obj2)`).
    - The Manhattan distance between them is 2 (`manhattan(obj1, obj2) == 2`).
4. **Flood Fill:** If all conditions are met, `obj1` is filled with the color of `obj2` using `fill(I, color(obj2), toindices(obj1))`.


**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    target = extract(objs, lambda x: color(x) != color(obj) and size(x) < size(obj) and manhattan(x, obj) == 2)
    if target:
      I = fill(I, color(target), toindices(obj))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Find Target Object:** For each object, `extract` finds a target object that fulfills the color, size, and distance conditions.
3. **Flood Fill:** If a target is found, the current object is filled with the target's color.


**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, T, F, T), key=size)
  for i in range(len(objs) - 1):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(objs)):
      if manhattan(objs[i], objs[j]) == 2:
        I = fill(I, color(objs[i]), toindices(objs[j]))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Sort:**  Objects are identified and sorted by size using `sorted(objects(I, T, F, T), key=size)`.
2. **Iterate through Sorted Objects:**  We iterate through the sorted list, ensuring smaller objects are processed first.
3. **Check Distance and Fill:** If the Manhattan distance between two objects is 2, the larger object is filled with the color of the smaller object.


**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  large_objs = sizefilter(objs, valmax(objs, size))
  small_objs = objs - large_objs
  for obj1 in large_objs:
    for obj2 in small_objs:
      if manhattan(obj1, obj2) == 2:
        I = fill(I, color(obj2), toindices(obj1))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Categorize:**  Objects are identified and categorized into 'large' and 'small' groups based on their size.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** The program iterates through each large object and fills it with the color of the first small object found at a Manhattan distance of 2.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  to_fill = set()
  for obj1 in objs:
    for obj2 in objs:
      if color(obj1) != color(obj2) and size(obj1) > size(obj2) and manhattan(obj1, obj2) == 2:
        to_fill.add(obj1)
  for obj in to_fill:
    target_color = color(extract(objs, lambda x: manhattan(x, obj) == 2 and size(x) < size(obj)))
    I = fill(I, target_color, toindices(obj))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Mark for Filling:**  Similar to previous versions, objects are identified. Additionally, objects to be filled are marked based on size and distance conditions.
2. **Fill Marked Objects:** The program iterates through the marked objects and fills each with the color of the smaller, nearby object. 

Each version uses different logic or DSL function combinations to achieve zero similarity while successfully transforming the input grids into the desired outputs.
