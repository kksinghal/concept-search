## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves swapping the colors of the second and third largest objects in the input grid while maintaining their positions and shapes. The remaining objects and the background color stay unchanged. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The second largest object is the group of '8's, and the third largest is the group of '2's. The output grid has these colors swapped. 
* **Input_1 & Input_2:**  The logic remains consistent – the second and third largest objects have their colors swapped in the output. 

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Sort objects by size
  objs = order(objects(I, T, F, F), size)
  
  # Extract the second and third largest objects
  second_largest = objs[-2]
  third_largest = objs[-3]
  
  # Get their colors
  second_color = color(second_largest)
  third_color = color(third_largest)

  # Create a canvas with the background color
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  
  # Paint the objects onto the canvas, swapping the target colors
  for obj in objs:
    if obj == second_largest:
      O = paint(O, recolor(third_color, obj))
    elif obj == third_largest:
      O = paint(O, recolor(second_color, obj))
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify and Sort Objects:** Identify all objects in the grid using `objects(I, T, F, F)` and sort them by size using `order(objects(...), size)`.
2.  **Target Objects and Colors:** Extract the second and third largest objects from the sorted list and store their colors.
3.  **Create Canvas:** Generate a blank canvas with the background color using `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`.
4.  **Iterate and Paint:**  Iterate through all objects. If the current object matches the second or third largest, paint it with the swapped color using `recolor`. Otherwise, paint it with its original color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Identify objects and their colors
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  colors = apply(color, objs)

  # Create a list to store object sizes
  sizes = list(map(size, objs))

  # Find the indices of the second and third largest objects
  second_idx = sizes.index(sorted(sizes)[-2])
  third_idx = sizes.index(sorted(sizes)[-3])

  # Swap the colors
  colors = list(colors) # Convert to list for modification
  colors[second_idx], colors[third_idx] = colors[third_idx], colors[second_idx] 

  # Paint the objects with the swapped colors
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj, col in zip(objs, colors):
    O = paint(O, recolor(col, obj))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects and Colors:** Obtain objects and their corresponding colors from the input grid.
2. **Calculate Sizes:** Determine the size of each object and store them in a list.
3. **Find Target Indices:** Identify the indices of the second and third largest objects based on their sizes.
4. **Swap Colors:** Swap the colors at the determined indices.
5. **Paint Objects:**  Paint the objects onto a blank canvas with the swapped colors applied.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Obtain all objects in the grid
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)

  # Define a function to get the size of an object
  def get_size(obj): return size(obj)

  # Sort objects by size in descending order
  sorted_objs = order(objs, get_size)[::-1]
  
  # Extract the second and third largest objects
  second_largest = sorted_objs[1]
  third_largest = sorted_objs[2]

  # Get the colors of the target objects
  second_color = color(second_largest)
  third_color = color(third_largest)

  # Create a new grid by swapping the colors of the target objects
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(third_color, second_largest))
  O = paint(O, recolor(second_color, third_largest))

  # Paint the remaining objects with their original colors
  for obj in objs:
    if obj != second_largest and obj != third_largest:
      O = paint(O, obj)

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Objects:**  Extract all objects from the input grid.
2. **Sort by Size:** Sort the objects based on their size in descending order.
3. **Target Objects:**  Retrieve the second and third largest objects from the sorted list.
4. **Swap and Paint:** Swap the colors of the two target objects while painting them onto a new canvas.
5. **Paint Remaining:** Paint the remaining objects onto the canvas with their original colors.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Sort objects by size in descending order
  objs = order(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: -size(obj))
  
  # Get the second and third largest objects
  second_largest = objs[1]
  third_largest = objs[2]

  # Swap colors directly within the objects
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(color(third_largest), second_largest))
  O = paint(O, recolor(color(second_largest), third_largest))
  
  # Paint the remaining objects
  for i in range(3, len(objs)):
      O = paint(O, objs[i])
  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sort Objects:** Directly sort the objects in descending order of their sizes using a lambda function within the `order` function.
2. **Extract Target Objects:** Get the second and third largest objects from the sorted list.
3. **Swap and Paint:** Swap the colors while painting the second and third largest objects onto a new canvas.
4. **Paint Remaining:** Iterate through the remaining objects (starting from the fourth largest) and paint them onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Extract objects and sort them by size in descending order
  objs = order(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: -size(obj))

  # Get the colors of the second and third largest objects
  second_color = color(objs[1])
  third_color = color(objs[2])

  # Define a function to recolor objects based on their size ranking
  def recolor_func(obj):
    if obj == objs[1]:
      return recolor(third_color, obj)
    elif obj == objs[2]:
      return recolor(second_color, obj)
    else:
      return obj
  
  # Apply the recolor_func to all objects and paint them onto the canvas
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), mpapply(recolor_func, objs))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Sort:** Obtain all objects and sort them by size in descending order.
2. **Get Target Colors:**  Retrieve the colors of the second and third largest objects.
3. **Recolor Function:** Define a function `recolor_func` to handle the color swapping logic based on an object's position in the sorted list.
4. **Apply and Paint:** Apply the `recolor_func` to all objects using `mpapply` and paint the resulting objects onto a new canvas.

These five program versions offer diverse solutions by utilizing different function combinations and logic flow while achieving the same outcome – swapping the colors of the second and third largest objects in the input grid.
