## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying distinct objects in the grid (each object consisting of connected cells of the same color), then moving these objects to specific locations while changing their color. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

1. **Object Identification:** Three objects are identified: 
    * Object 1: Color 2 (top left corner)
    * Object 2: Color 5 
    * Object 3: Color 8 (top right corner)

2. **Movement and Color Change:**
    * Object 1 (originally color 2) is moved one row below its original bottom edge and its left edge is aligned with the left edge of the object originally with color 6.  The object's color changes to 2.
    * Object 2 (originally color 5) is moved one row below its original bottom edge and its left edge is aligned with the left edge of the object originally with color 6.  The object's color changes to 6.
    * Object 3 (originally color 8) is moved such that its top edge aligns with the bottom edge of the grid and its left edge is aligned with the left edge of the object originally with color 6. The object's color changes to 8.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

This follows the same pattern as Input_0 -> Output_0, with the following object and color mappings:

* Object 1: Color 1 -> Color 1
* Object 2: Color 5 -> Color 4
* Object 3: Color 7 -> Color 7

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

This also follows the same pattern as Input_0 -> Output_0, with the following object and color mappings:

* Object 1: Color 5 -> Color 1
* Object 2: Color 6 -> Color 6
* Object 3: Color 7 -> Color 7


## Program_to_be_generated:

Since the actual transformation logic and the two existing programs are not provided, I can only provide a general framework based on the observed pattern and available DSL functions. You will need to adapt and complete this framework with the specific logic from the existing programs.


### Program Version 1: (Using `extract` and nested logic)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  
  obj1 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == ...) # Fill in the condition to extract the first object
  obj2 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == ...) # Fill in the condition to extract the second object
  obj3 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == ...) # Fill in the condition to extract the third object
  
  target_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == ...) # Fill in the condition to extract the target object for alignment

  # Calculate offsets based on object dimensions and target object position
  offset1 = (..., ...) # Replace ... with appropriate calculations using DSL functions
  offset2 = (..., ...) # Replace ... with appropriate calculations using DSL functions
  offset3 = (..., ...) # Replace ... with appropriate calculations using DSL functions

  # Move and recolor objects
  I = move(I, obj1, offset1)
  I = recolor(I, ..., obj1) # Replace ... with the new color for obj1
  I = move(I, obj2, offset2)
  I = recolor(I, ..., obj2) # Replace ... with the new color for obj2
  I = move(I, obj3, offset3)
  I = recolor(I, ..., obj3) # Replace ... with the new color for obj3

  return I 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** The code first extracts all objects from the input grid using `objects(I, T, T, T)`. Then, it uses `extract` with a lambda function to find specific objects based on their color.
2. **Calculate Offsets:**  The offsets for moving each object are calculated. This involves determining the desired vertical position (based on object dimensions) and horizontal alignment (based on the target object's leftmost position).
3. **Move and Recolor:**  The objects are moved using `move` with the calculated offsets. The `recolor` function changes the color of each object. 


This is a basic framework, and you'll need to analyze the existing programs and the transformation details to:

* **Complete the conditions** inside the `extract` functions to target the correct objects based on their color.
* **Replace the "..." placeholders** in the offset calculations and `recolor` calls with the appropriate logic and values derived from the existing programs.

You can create four more distinct versions of the program by exploring different DSL function combinations, such as using `apply` to process objects in a loop, implementing a custom sorting mechanism instead of relying on `extract`, or utilizing a different strategy for calculating object positions and movements. Remember to provide a detailed explanation for each version.
