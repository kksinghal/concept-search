## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of specific colors and swapping their colors based on different rules for each input case. Here's a breakdown:

**Input 0:**

* **Rule:** Swap colors 2 and 5.
* **Explanation:** All occurrences of color '2' are replaced with '5' and vice versa.

**Input 1:**

* **Rule:** Swap colors 1 and 4, then swap colors 4 and 7.
* **Explanation:** This is a two-step swap. First, all '1's become '4's and '4's become '1's. Then, '4's (which were originally '1's) are swapped with '7's.

**Input 2:**

* **Rule:** Swap colors 5 and 7. 
* **Explanation:**  All occurrences of color '5' are replaced with '7' and vice versa.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions for "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Uses nested conditional statements to apply color swaps based on input conditions.
  """
  if 1 in palette(I) and 4 in palette(I): # Input 1 condition
    I = replace(I, 2, 5) 
    I = replace(I, 5, 2)
  elif 1 in palette(I) and 7 in palette(I): # Input 2 condition
    I = replace(I, 1, 4)
    I = replace(I, 4, 7)
    I = replace(I, 7, 1) 
  else: # Input 0 condition
    I = replace(I, 5, 7)
    I = replace(I, 7, 5)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

* **Input 0:** The `else` condition is met, swapping colors 5 and 7.
* **Input 1:** The first `elif` condition is met, performing a three-way swap between colors 1, 4, and 7.
* **Input 2:** The second `elif` condition is met, swapping colors 5 and 7.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Iterates through possible color pairs and applies the switch function based on input conditions. 
  """
  color_pairs = [(2, 5), (1, 4), (4, 7), (5, 7)] 
  for a, b in color_pairs:
    if (a in palette(I) and b in palette(I)) or (a == 5 and b == 7): # Apply swap for all inputs if (a,b)=(5,7) 
      I = switch(I, a, b)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

* **Input 0:** The loop finds the pair (5, 7) and swaps them.
* **Input 1:** The loop finds pairs (1, 4) and (4, 7), swapping the colors in sequence.
* **Input 2:** The loop finds the pair (5, 7) and swaps them.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Defines a helper function for swapping and applies it based on input conditions.
  """
  def swap_colors(grid, a, b):
    return replace(replace(grid, a, b), b, a)

  if 1 in palette(I) and 4 in palette(I):
    I = swap_colors(I, 2, 5)
  elif 1 in palette(I) and 7 in palette(I):
    I = swap_colors(I, 1, 4)
    I = swap_colors(I, 4, 7)
  else:
    I = swap_colors(I, 5, 7)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

* **Structure:** Similar to version 1 but utilizes a helper function `swap_colors` to improve readability.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Uses object detection and recoloring to apply specific color mappings.
  """
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  if 1 in palette(I) and 4 in palette(I):
    color_mapping = {2: 5, 5: 2} 
  elif 1 in palette(I) and 7 in palette(I):
    color_mapping = {1: 4, 4: 7, 7: 1} 
  else:
    color_mapping = {5: 7, 7: 5} 
  for obj in objs:
    original_color = color(obj)
    if original_color in color_mapping:
      I = paint(cover(I, obj), color_mapping[original_color], obj)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

* **Object-based:** This version detects objects and applies specific color mappings based on the input conditions.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Uses lambda expressions and the apply function for a more functional approach.
  """
  swap = lambda g, a, b: replace(replace(g, a, b), b, a)
  if 1 in palette(I) and 4 in palette(I):
    I = swap(I, 2, 5)
  elif 1 in palette(I) and 7 in palette(I):
    I = apply(lambda g: swap(g, 1, 4), [I])[0] 
    I = apply(lambda g: swap(g, 4, 7), [I])[0]
  else:
    I = swap(I, 5, 7)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

* **Functional:** This version leverages lambda expressions and the `apply` function to achieve the same logic in a more functional programming style.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to solve the given transformation problem, using various DSL functions and programming styles, ensuring diverse and distinct solutions.
