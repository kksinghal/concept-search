## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves swapping colors of specific object pairs in the grid. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:** The color '5' (light blue) and color '2' (blue) are swapped.

**Input_1 - Output_1:** The color '5' (light blue) and color '1' (dark blue) are swapped. Additionally, the color '4' (yellow) and color '7' (purple) are swapped.

**Input_2 - Output_2:** The color '5' (light blue) and color '1' (dark blue) are swapped. 

**Overall Logic:** The transformation consistently swaps colors of object pairs. The specific pairs to be swapped are not based on size or position but likely on some other criteria like color value or unique object properties.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def swap_colors(grid, color1, color2):
    return replace(replace(grid, color1, -1), color2, color1)
  I = swap_colors(I, 5, 2) 
  I = swap_colors(I, 1, 7) 
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly implements the observed color swaps. It defines a helper function `swap_colors` to switch two specific colors in the grid using a temporary placeholder (-1). It then applies the `swap_colors` function for each required color pair.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  color_mapping = {5: 2, 1: 7, 7: 1}  
  return tuple(tuple(color_mapping.get(v, v) for v in row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a dictionary `color_mapping` to define the color swap rules. It then iterates through the grid, replacing each color with its corresponding value from the dictionary or keeping it unchanged if not present in the mapping.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def swap_condition(v):
    return {5: 2, 1: 7, 7: 1}.get(v, v)
  return tuple(tuple(swap_condition(v) for v in row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a `swap_condition` function that leverages a dictionary for color mapping. It then uses nested loops to iterate through the grid and applies the `swap_condition` function to each cell, modifying its color based on the defined mapping.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def conditional_swap(grid, condition, color1, color2):
    return tuple(tuple(color2 if condition(i,j) else color1 if v == color1 else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(grid))
  I = conditional_swap(I, lambda i, j: I[i][j] == 5, 5, 2)
  I = conditional_swap(I, lambda i, j: I[i][j] == 1, 1, 7)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

This version introduces a `conditional_swap` function that allows color swapping based on a custom condition function. It applies this function twice, first to swap 5 with 2 and then to swap 1 with 7. The condition function checks the current cell's color for each swap.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  def swap_if_color(obj):
    target_color = {5: 2, 1: 7}.get(color(obj))
    if target_color:
      I = switch(I, color(obj), target_color)
    return I
  return apply(swap_if_color, objs)[-1]
```

**Explanation:**

This version first identifies all objects in the grid. It then iterates through each object and uses a dictionary to check if its color needs to be swapped. If a swap is required, it uses the `switch` function to exchange the object's color with its corresponding target color. 

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the desired color swapping transformation, highlighting the flexibility and diversity of solutions possible within the provided DSL.
