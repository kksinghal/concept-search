## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently recolors the distinct object in the bottom row with the color of the distinct object in the grid while removing the object from the bottom row. 

**Example:**

* **Input_0:**  A '2' shaped object exists in the grid, and a single cell with value '4' is present in the bottom row.
* **Output_0:** The '2' shaped object is recolored to '4', and the '4' in the bottom row is removed.

* **Input_1:** A '3' shaped object exists in the grid, and a single cell with value '6' is present in the bottom row.
* **Output_1:** The '3' shaped object is recolored to '6', and the '6' in the bottom row is removed.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bottom_object = objects(I[-1:], False, False, False)
  grid_object = objects(I[:-1], False, False, True)
  new_grid = paint(cover(I, first(bottom_object)), recolor(color(first(bottom_object)), first(grid_object)))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bottom_object = objects(I[-1:], False, False, False)`**:  Identifies the object (single cell in this case) present in the bottom row of the input grid (`I`).
2. **`grid_object = objects(I[:-1], False, False, True)`**: Identifies the distinct object within the grid excluding the bottom row.
3. **`recolor(color(first(bottom_object)), first(grid_object))`**: This step recolors the object in the grid (`first(grid_object)`) with the color extracted from the object in the bottom row (`color(first(bottom_object))`).
4. **`cover(I, first(bottom_object))`**: Removes the object from the bottom row by replacing its color with the background color.
5. **`paint(..., ...)`**: Finally, this step paints the recolored object onto the grid where the bottom row object has been removed.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  target_color = index(I, (height(I)-1, 0))
  object_to_recolor = objects(I[:-1], False, False, True)
  new_grid = paint(replace(I, target_color, 0), recolor(target_color, first(object_to_recolor)))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`target_color = index(I, (height(I)-1, 0))`**:  Extracts the color of the leftmost cell in the bottom row, which is the target color for recoloring.
2. **`object_to_recolor = objects(I[:-1], False, False, True)`**:  Identifies the distinct object within the grid, excluding the bottom row.
3. **`replace(I, target_color, 0)`**: Removes the target color from the grid by replacing it with '0'. 
4. **`recolor(target_color, first(object_to_recolor))`**: Recolors the identified object with the `target_color`.
5. **`paint(..., ...)`**: Paints the recolored object onto the modified grid.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bottom_row_color = I[-1][0]
  main_object = next(obj for obj in objects(I, False, False, True) if color(obj) != bottom_row_color)
  modified_grid = cover(I, recolor(bottom_row_color, main_object))
  return replace(modified_grid, bottom_row_color, 0)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bottom_row_color = I[-1][0]`**:  Gets the color of the leftmost cell in the bottom row.
2. **`main_object = next(...)`**: Finds the object in the grid (excluding the bottom row) that does *not* have the same color as the `bottom_row_color`.
3. **`recolor(bottom_row_color, main_object)`**: Recolors the `main_object` with the `bottom_row_color`.
4. **`cover(I, ...)`**:  Removes the recolored object from the original grid.
5. **`replace(..., bottom_row_color, 0)`**: Replaces all instances of the `bottom_row_color` in the modified grid with '0', effectively removing the original object from the bottom row.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  color_to_replace = I[-1][0]
  new_grid = I[:-1]
  for obj in objects(new_grid, False, False, False):
    if color(obj) != color_to_replace:
      new_grid = paint(cover(new_grid, obj), recolor(color_to_replace, obj))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`color_to_replace = I[-1][0]`**: Extracts the color from the bottom-left corner of the input grid.
2. **`new_grid = I[:-1]`**:  Creates a new grid without the bottom row. 
3. **`for obj in objects(new_grid, False, False, False):`**: Iterates through each object found in the `new_grid`.
4. **`if color(obj) != color_to_replace:`**: If the color of the current object is different from the `color_to_replace`:
   - **`new_grid = paint(cover(new_grid, obj), recolor(color_to_replace, obj))`**: Recolors the object with `color_to_replace` and paints it back onto a version of the grid where the object has been removed. 
5. **`return new_grid`**: Returns the modified grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    replace_color = index(I, (len(I)-1, 0)) # get the color to be replaced
    filtered_objects = sfilter(objects(I, False, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) != replace_color) # filter out objects with the same color as the one to be replaced
    obj_to_replace = first(filtered_objects) if filtered_objects else None # get the object to be replaced
    if obj_to_replace:
      recolored_obj = recolor(replace_color, obj_to_replace) # recolor the object
      output_grid = paint(cover(I, obj_to_replace), recolored_obj) # cover the original object and paint the recolored one
      return output_grid
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`replace_color = index(I, (len(I)-1, 0))`**:  Identifies the color in the bottom left corner of the grid, indicating the color to be replaced.
2. **`filtered_objects = sfilter(...)`**: Filters the objects in the grid, keeping only those whose color is *different* from the `replace_color`.
3. **`obj_to_replace = first(filtered_objects) if filtered_objects else None`**: Selects the first object from the filtered set; if no objects are found, it assigns `None`.
4. **`if obj_to_replace:`**:  Proceeds only if a valid object to replace is found:
   - **`recolored_obj = recolor(replace_color, obj_to_replace)`**:  Recolors the `obj_to_replace` with the `replace_color`.
   - **`output_grid = paint(cover(I, obj_to_replace), recolored_obj)`**:  Covers (removes) the original `obj_to_replace` from the input grid (`I`) and then paints the `recolored_obj` onto the grid.
   - **`return output_grid`**:  Returns the modified grid.
5. **`return I`**: If no `obj_to_replace` is found (meaning all objects have the same color as the bottom left corner), the original input grid is returned without modifications.
