## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

**For each cell in the input grid:**

1. **Identify the most common color (digit) in the grid.**
2. **If the cell's color matches the most common color, replace it with 0.**
3. **If the cell's color does not match the most common color, keep it unchanged.**

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the DSL from `dsl.py`:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the most common color
  mc = mostcolor(I)
  # Replace cells with the most common color by 0, keep others unchanged
  O = cellwise(I, canvas(mc, shape(I)), I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mc = mostcolor(I)`:** Finds the most common color (digit) in the input grid `I`.
2. **`canvas(mc, shape(I))`:** Creates a new grid with the same shape as `I` filled entirely with the most common color `mc`.
3. **`cellwise(I, canvas(mc, shape(I)), I)`:** Compares the input grid `I` with the newly created canvas. If the colors match, it keeps the color from the input grid (effectively replacing `mc` with 0). Otherwise, it keeps the original color from `I`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the most common color
  mc = mostcolor(I)
  # Create a function to check for the most common color
  is_mc = matcher(identity, mc)
  # Apply a lambda function to each cell
  O = apply(lambda cell: 0 if is_mc(cell) else cell, I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mc = mostcolor(I)`:** Identifies the most common color.
2. **`is_mc = matcher(identity, mc)`:** Creates a function `is_mc` that checks if a given value is equal to the most common color.
3. **`apply(lambda cell: 0 if is_mc(cell) else cell, I)`:**  Applies a lambda function to each cell of the input grid. The lambda function checks if the cell's color is the most common color using `is_mc`. If true, it replaces the cell with 0; otherwise, it keeps the original color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the most common color
  mc = mostcolor(I)
  # Get indices of cells with the most common color
  indices = ofcolor(I, mc)
  # Create a grid of zeros
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  # Fill the original colors back into the grid, except for the most common color
  O = paint(O, asobject(I) - recolor(0, indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mc = mostcolor(I)`:** Finds the most common color.
2. **`indices = ofcolor(I, mc)`:**  Finds the indices of all cells with the most common color.
3. **`canvas(0, shape(I))`:** Creates a grid filled with 0s, having the same shape as the input.
4. **`recolor(0, indices)`:** Creates an object containing the indices from `indices` but with the color 0.
5. **`asobject(I) - recolor(0, indices)`:**  Subtracts the object containing the most common color indices from the object representation of the input grid. This effectively removes the cells with the most common color.
6. **`paint(O, ...)`:** Paints the remaining object (without the most common color cells) onto the canvas of 0s.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the most common color
  mc = mostcolor(I)
  # Create a new grid by iterating through the input grid
  O = tuple(tuple(0 if I[i][j] == mc else I[i][j] for j in range(len(I[0]))) for i in range(len(I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly constructs the output grid using nested loops and a conditional statement:

1. **`mc = mostcolor(I)`:** Determines the most common color.
2. **Nested loops:** Iterates through each cell (i, j) of the input grid `I`.
3. **`0 if I[i][j] == mc else I[i][j]`:** For each cell, checks if its color matches the most common color (`mc`). If true, it assigns 0 to the corresponding cell in the output grid; otherwise, it keeps the original color.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the most common color
  mc = mostcolor(I)
  # Split the grid into rows
  rows = tuple(row for row in I)
  # Apply a lambda function to each row
  new_rows = apply(lambda row: tuple(0 if cell == mc else cell for cell in row), rows)
  return new_rows
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mc = mostcolor(I)`:** Identifies the most common color.
2. **`rows = tuple(row for row in I)`:**  Splits the input grid into individual rows.
3. **`apply(lambda row: tuple(0 if cell == mc else cell for cell in row), rows)`:** Applies a lambda function to each row. The lambda function iterates through the cells in the row and replaces cells containing the most common color with 0 while keeping other cells unchanged. Finally, it assembles the modified rows back into a new grid.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches and DSL function combinations to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
