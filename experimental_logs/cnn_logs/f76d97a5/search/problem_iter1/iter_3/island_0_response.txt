## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces the dominant color in the input grid with 0 while retaining other colors. 

**Example:**

- **Input_0:** Dominant color is 5. All 5s are replaced with 0, while 4s remain unchanged.
- **Input_1:** Dominant color is 6. All 6s are replaced with 0, while 5s remain unchanged.
- **Input_2:** Dominant color is 9. All 9s are replaced with 0, while 5s remain unchanged.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions in the provided DSL that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(grid):
  return tuple(tuple(0 if v == mostcommon(v for r in grid for v in r) else v for v in row) for row in grid) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mostcommon(v for r in grid for v in r)`:** Identifies the most frequent color in the entire grid.
2. **`(0 if v == ... else v for v in row)`:** Iterates through each cell (v) in a row, replacing it with 0 if it matches the most common color, otherwise retaining its original value.
3. **`tuple(tuple(...) for row in grid)`:** Applies this logic to each row, reconstructing the modified grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(grid):
  return tuple(tuple(branch(v == mostcolor(grid), 0, v) for v in row) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mostcolor(grid)`:** Determines the most frequent color in the grid.
2. **`branch(v == mostcolor(grid), 0, v)`:** Uses the `branch` function to conditionally replace a cell's value (v): if it matches the most common color, it becomes 0; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
3. **`tuple(tuple(...) for row in grid)`:** Applies this conditional replacement to every cell in the grid, preserving its structure.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(grid):
  replace_color = mostcolor(grid)
  return apply(lambda row: apply(lambda v: 0 if v == replace_color else v, row), grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`replace_color = mostcolor(grid)`:** Stores the most frequent color for efficient access.
2. **`lambda v: 0 if v == replace_color else v`:** Defines an anonymous function to replace a single cell value if it matches `replace_color`.
3. **`apply(lambda v: ..., row)`:** Applies the replacement function to each cell within a row.
4. **`apply(lambda row: ..., grid)`:** Applies the row-wise replacement to every row in the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(grid):
  target_color = mostcolor(grid)
  return tuple(tuple(branch(contained(v, {target_color}), 0, v) for v in row) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`target_color = mostcolor(grid)`:** Identifies the most frequent color.
2. **`contained(v, {target_color})`:** Checks if a cell's value (v) exists within a set containing only the `target_color`.
3. **`branch(..., 0, v)`:** Conditionally replaces the cell value with 0 if it's the `target_color`; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
4. **`tuple(tuple(...) for row in grid)`:** Applies this color-based replacement to every cell in the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(grid):
  common_color = mostcolor(grid)
  return tuple(tuple(v * (v != common_color) for v in row) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`common_color = mostcolor(grid)`:** Determines the most frequent color.
2. **`v * (v != common_color)`:** Exploits boolean logic for replacement: if a cell's value (v) is different from `common_color`, the expression `(v != common_color)` evaluates to `True` (1), effectively keeping the value unchanged after multiplication. If `v` is the `common_color`, the expression evaluates to `False` (0), resulting in 0 after the multiplication.
3. **`tuple(tuple(...) for row in grid)`:** Applies this logic to every cell in the grid, reconstructing it with the desired replacements.
