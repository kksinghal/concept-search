## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids to achieve the desired output grids can be described as follows:

**Goal:**  Keep the object with the least common color while replacing all instances of the most common color with 0.

Let's break down how this applies to each example:

* **Input_0:** The least common color is '4', while '5' is the most common. The output keeps the '4's intact and replaces all '5's with '0's.
* **Input_1:** The least common color is '5', and '6' is the most common. The output preserves the '5's and replaces all '6's with '0's.
* **Input_2:**  The least common color is '5', and '9' is the most common. The output retains the '5's and changes all '9's to '0's.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the most common color
  mc = mostcolor(I)
  
  # Find the least common color
  lc = leastcolor(I)
  
  # Replace the most common color with 0
  O = replace(I, mc, 0)
  
  # Replace the least common color with its original value 
  O = replace(O, lc, lc)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mc = mostcolor(I)`:**  Identifies the most frequent color in the input grid.
2. **`lc = leastcolor(I)`:** Determines the least frequent color in the input grid.
3. **`O = replace(I, mc, 0)`:** Creates a new grid `O` where every instance of the most common color (`mc`) is replaced with '0'.
4. **`O = replace(O, lc, lc)`:** This line ensures that the least common color, which might have been modified in the previous step, is restored to its original value in the output grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Create a new grid with the most common color replaced by 0
  O = replace(I, mostcolor(I), 0)  
  
  # Switch the least common color and 0 
  O = switch(O, leastcolor(I), 0) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = replace(I, mostcolor(I), 0)`:**  Similar to Version 1, this line generates a new grid `O` where the most common color from the input grid is replaced with '0'.
2. **`O = switch(O, leastcolor(I), 0)`:** This line effectively swaps the least common color in the grid with '0', achieving the desired outcome.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find indices of the least common color
  indices = ofcolor(I, leastcolor(I))
  
  # Create a new grid filled with 0s
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  
  # Paint the object with the least common color onto the new grid
  O = paint(O, toobject(indices, I)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`indices = ofcolor(I, leastcolor(I))`:** Identifies the locations (indices) of all cells containing the least common color within the input grid.
2. **`O = canvas(0, shape(I))`:** Creates an empty grid `O` of the same size as the input grid, filled entirely with '0's.
3. **`O = paint(O, toobject(indices, I))`:** This paints the object represented by the `indices` (which have the least common color) from the input grid onto the new grid `O`, effectively isolating and preserving the object with the least common color.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Partition the grid into objects based on color
  objs = partition(I) 
  
  # Find the object with the least common color 
  target_obj = argmin(objs, lambda obj: colorcount(I, color(obj))) 
  
  # Create a new grid filled with 0s 
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) 
  
  # Paint the target object onto the new grid
  O = paint(O, target_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = partition(I)`:** This function divides the input grid into distinct objects based on their colors. Each object is a set of cells with the same color.
2. **`target_obj = argmin(objs, lambda obj: colorcount(I, color(obj)))`:** This line finds the object with the least number of occurrences in the grid. This object will contain the least common color.
3. **`O = canvas(0, shape(I))`:**  Creates a blank canvas (`O`) of the same dimensions as the input, filled with '0's.
4. **`O = paint(O, target_obj)`:** This takes the `target_obj` (the object with the least common color) and paints it onto the canvas `O`.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the least and most common colors
  lc = leastcolor(I)
  mc = mostcolor(I)

  # Generate a lambda function to check if a color is not the most common one
  not_mc = lambda x: x != mc 

  # Filter the input grid, keeping only cells that don't have the most common color
  O = mfilter(asobject(I), lambda cell: not_mc(cell[0]))
  
  # Create a new grid filled with 0s
  new_grid = canvas(0, shape(I)) 

  # Paint the filtered object onto the new grid
  O = paint(new_grid, O) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`lc = leastcolor(I)` and `mc = mostcolor(I)`:**  Identifies the least common and most common colors in the input grid.
2. **`not_mc = lambda x: x != mc`:** Defines an anonymous function (lambda) that checks if a given color is not the most common color.
3. **`O = mfilter(asobject(I), lambda cell: not_mc(cell[0]))`:**  Converts the grid into an object representation and then filters it. It keeps only the cells that do not have the most common color, essentially removing the most common color from the grid representation.
4. **`new_grid = canvas(0, shape(I)) `:** Creates a new empty grid with the same size as the input, filled with '0's.
5. **`O = paint(new_grid, O)`:** This paints the filtered object (which now essentially represents the object with the least common color) onto the `new_grid`. 

These five versions provide different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
