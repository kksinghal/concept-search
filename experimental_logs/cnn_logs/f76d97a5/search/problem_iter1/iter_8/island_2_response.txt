## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to highlight the border of objects formed by the least common color in the grid while replacing the most common color with 0.

**Input 0:**

* The least common color is 4, forming a single object.
* The border of this object is highlighted by replacing the surrounding 5s (most common color) with 0s. 

**Input 1 & 2:**

*  The same logic applies, with the least common color (6 and 9 respectively) forming objects.
*  The borders of these objects are highlighted, and the most common color (5 in both cases) is replaced with 0.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the most and least common colors
  mc = mostcolor(I)
  lc = leastcolor(I)

  # Create an object from the least common color
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, lc), I)

  # Get the outline of the object
  outline = box(obj) 

  # Replace most common color with 0 
  O = replace(I, mc, 0)

  # Fill the outline with the least common color
  O = fill(O, lc, outline)

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify key colors:** Determine the most common (`mc`) and least common (`lc`) colors in the grid.
2. **Create object:**  Form an object (`obj`) using all cells containing the least common color.
3. **Define outline:** Calculate the outline (`outline`) of the identified object.
4. **Replace most common:** Replace all instances of the most common color with 0.
5. **Fill the outline:**  Fill the calculated outline with the least common color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Invert the grid colors
  inverted = replace(replace(I, mostcolor(I), -1), leastcolor(I), mostcolor(I))

  # Find objects in the inverted grid
  objs = objects(inverted, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)

  # Filter for objects with only one cell
  single_cell_objs = sizefilter(objs, 1)

  # Get indices of single cell objects
  indices_to_replace = mapply(lambda obj: first(toindices(obj)), single_cell_objs)

  # Replace most common color with 0
  O = replace(I, mostcolor(I), 0)

  # Fill the single cell object locations with the least common color
  O = fill(O, leastcolor(I), indices_to_replace)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Invert colors:** Invert the grid colors, effectively making the least common color the most common and vice versa.
2. **Find single-cell objects:** Identify objects in the inverted grid, then isolate those consisting of only a single cell.
3. **Target indices:** Extract the indices of these single-cell objects.
4. **Replace most common:** Replace all instances of the most common color in the original grid with 0.
5. **Fill single-cell locations:** Fill the locations corresponding to the single-cell objects with the least common color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find least common color
  lc = leastcolor(I)

  # Create a grid where non-least common colors are replaced with 0
  masked_grid = cellwise(I, apply(lambda x: 1 if x == lc else 0, I), 0)

  # Dilate the masked grid
  dilated_grid = cellwise(I, upsample(asobject(masked_grid), 3), 0) 

  # Replace non-zero values in the dilated grid with least common color
  dilated_grid = replace(dilated_grid, mostcolor(dilated_grid), lc)

  # Combine the dilated grid with the original, keeping original least common colors
  O = cellwise(dilated_grid, I, 0)

  # Replace most common color with 0
  O = replace(O, mostcolor(I), 0)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Isolate least common:** Create a masked grid where only the least common color is preserved.
2. **Dilate:**  Expand the masked grid, effectively highlighting the border around the least common color objects.
3. **Fill dilated areas:**  Replace the expanded areas in the dilated grid with the least common color.
4. **Combine and replace:** Combine the dilated grid with the original, preserving the original least common color, and replace the most common color with 0.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the most and least common colors
  mc = mostcolor(I)
  lc = leastcolor(I)

  # Replace all occurrences of the least common color with a temporary value
  temp_grid = replace(I, lc, -1)

  # Find objects in the temporary grid (excluding the temporary value)
  objs = objects(temp_grid, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)

  # Find the object with the smallest size (this will be the border object)
  border_obj = argmin(objs, size)

  # Replace the most common color with 0
  O = replace(I, mc, 0)

  # Fill the border object with the least common color
  O = fill(O, lc, toindices(border_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Temporarily replace:** Replace the least common color with a temporary, unique value.
2. **Identify border object:** Find objects in this modified grid, isolating the object representing the border around the original least common color.
3. **Replace most common:** Replace all instances of the most common color in the original grid with 0.
4. **Fill border object:**  Fill the identified border object with the original least common color. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the least common color
  lc = leastcolor(I)

  # Create a grid where only the least common color is present
  masked_grid = apply(lambda x: lc if x == lc else 0, I)

  # Calculate the difference between the original and masked grids
  diff_grid = tuple(
      tuple(b - a for a, b in zip(row_a, row_b))
      for row_a, row_b in zip(masked_grid, I)
  )

  # Replace the most common color with 0 in the original grid
  O = replace(I, mostcolor(I), 0)

  # Combine the difference grid with the modified original grid 
  O = tuple(
      tuple(b if b != 0 else a for a, b in zip(row_a, row_b))
      for row_a, row_b in zip(O, diff_grid)
  ) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Isolate least common:** Create a grid where only the least common color is present.
2. **Calculate difference:**  Determine the difference between the original grid and the masked grid, essentially highlighting the border.
3. **Replace most common:** Replace the most common color in the original grid with 0.
4. **Combine and restore:** Combine the difference grid with the modified original grid, restoring the border around the least common color. 

These are just a few examples. Many other valid and distinct solutions could be generated using the DSL functions provided.
