## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces the most common color in the grid with 0 while keeping other colors unchanged. 

**Example:**

* **Input_0:** The most common color is 5. The transformation replaces all 5s with 0s while keeping the 4s unchanged.

* **Input_1 & Input_2:**  The same logic applies, replacing the most common color (6 and 9 respectively) with 0.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve this transformation:

**Version 1:** (Inspired by Program_A's color inversion logic)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  dom_color = mostcolor(grid) # Identify the dominant color
  return tuple(tuple(0 if v == dom_color else v for v in row) for row in grid) # Replace dominant color with 0
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`dom_color = mostcolor(grid)`:** Identifies the most frequent color in the grid.
2. **`return tuple(tuple(0 if v == dom_color else v for v in row) for row in grid)`:** Iterates through each cell in the grid. If the cell color matches the `dom_color`, it's replaced with 0; otherwise, it remains unchanged.


**Version 2:** (Using `replace` function for direct substitution)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return replace(grid, mostcolor(grid), 0)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mostcolor(grid)`:** Determines the most frequent color in the grid.
2. **`replace(grid, mostcolor(grid), 0)`:** Directly replaces all occurrences of the most common color with 0.


**Version 3:** (Leveraging `asobject` and `paint` for manipulation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)),  mfilter(asobject(grid), lambda cell: cell[0] != mostcolor(grid)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(0, shape(grid))`:** Creates a blank canvas filled with 0s, having the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. **`asobject(grid)`:** Converts the grid into an object representation, where each cell is a (value, (i, j)) tuple.
3. **`lambda cell: cell[0] != mostcolor(grid)`:** Defines a lambda function to filter cells. It keeps cells whose color is NOT the most common color.
4. **`mfilter(asobject(grid), lambda cell: ...)`:** Applies the filter to the object representation, keeping only cells with non-dominant colors.
5. **`paint(...)`:** Paints the filtered cells (non-dominant colors) onto the initially blank canvas.


**Version 4:** (Emphasizing object-based manipulation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = partition(grid)  # Partition the grid into objects
  target_color = mostcolor(grid)
  filtered_objs = frozenset(obj for obj in objs if color(obj) != target_color) # Keep objects that don't have the target color
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), merge(filtered_objs)) # Paint the remaining objects onto a blank canvas
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = partition(grid)`:** Divides the grid into objects based on color.
2. **`target_color = mostcolor(grid)`:** Determines the most frequent color.
3. **`filtered_objs = frozenset(obj for obj in objs if color(obj) != target_color)`:** Filters out objects that have the `target_color`.
4. **`paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), merge(filtered_objs))`:** Creates a blank canvas and paints the remaining objects onto it, effectively removing the objects with the most common color.


**Version 5:** (Utilizing set difference for object removal)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objs = partition(grid)
  dom_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == mostcolor(grid)) # Find the object with the most common color
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), merge(objs - {dom_obj})) # Paint all objects except the dominant one 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = partition(grid)`:**  Creates objects from the grid based on color.
2. **`dom_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == mostcolor(grid))`:** Identifies the object representing the most common color.
3. **`objs - {dom_obj}`:** Removes the `dom_obj` from the set of objects.
4. **`paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), merge(objs - {dom_obj}))`:** Creates a blank canvas and paints the remaining objects, effectively removing the most common color from the grid. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
