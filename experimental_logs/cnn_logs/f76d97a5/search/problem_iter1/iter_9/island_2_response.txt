## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently applies the following logic:

1. **Identify Dominant and Secondary Colors:** The most frequent color in the input grid is identified as the dominant color, and the least frequent color is identified as the secondary color.
2. **Swap Colors:** The dominant and secondary colors are swapped in the output grid.

**Example:**

In Input_0:

* Dominant color: 5
* Secondary color: 4

Output_0 reflects this swap, with 5's replaced by 4's and vice versa.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions that implement this transformation using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the most common color
  mc = mostcolor(I)
  
  # Find the least common color
  lc = leastcolor(I)
  
  # Swap the most and least common colors
  O = replace(replace(I, mc, -1), lc, mc)
  O = replace(O, -1, lc)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Colors:** `mostcolor(I)` and `leastcolor(I)` identify the most and least common colors, respectively.
2. **Swap:**  We use a temporary placeholder (-1) to avoid overwriting during the swap. 
    * `replace(I, mc, -1)` replaces the most common color with -1.
    * `replace(..., lc, mc)` replaces the least common color with the (original) most common color.
    * `replace(..., -1, lc)` replaces the placeholder -1 with the (original) least common color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return switch(I, mostcolor(I), leastcolor(I))
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly leverages the `switch` function, which is designed for swapping two specified values within a grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Build a mapping from old color to new color
  color_map = {mostcolor(I): leastcolor(I), leastcolor(I): mostcolor(I)}
  
  # Apply the mapping to each cell in the grid
  O = tuple(tuple(color_map.get(v, v) for v in row) for row in I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Color Mapping:** A dictionary `color_map` is created to map the dominant color to the secondary color and vice versa.
2. **Cell-wise Application:** The code iterates through each cell of the grid. If the cell's value is in the `color_map`, it's replaced with the corresponding new color; otherwise, it remains unchanged.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Create a grid with the least common color
  O = canvas(leastcolor(I), shape(I))
  
  # Paint the most common color objects onto the new grid
  O = paint(O, colorfilter(asobject(I), mostcolor(I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **New Canvas:** A new grid (`O`) is created, filled entirely with the secondary color using `canvas`.
2. **Selective Painting:** The objects with the dominant color are extracted from the input grid (`I`) and painted onto the new canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Invert the grid, making least common the most common
  inverted = replace(replace(I, mostcolor(I), -1), leastcolor(I), mostcolor(I))
  inverted = replace(inverted, -1, leastcolor(I))
  
  # Find the most common color in the inverted grid (originally least common)
  new_mc = mostcolor(inverted)
  
  # Replace most common color in the inverted grid with 0
  O = replace(inverted, new_mc, 0)
  
  # Replace remaining colors (originally most common) with the new most common
  O = replace(O, leastcolor(O), new_mc)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Inversion:** The grid is inverted, making the secondary color the most common.
2. **Color Swap (Similar to Version 1):**  The process from Version 1 is applied, essentially swapping the colors again to achieve the desired output.
