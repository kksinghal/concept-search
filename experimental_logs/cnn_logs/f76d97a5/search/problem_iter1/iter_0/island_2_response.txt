## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the least common digit in the input grid and using its positions to create a frame around the remaining digits. Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**

* **Input:** The least common digit is '4'.
* **Transformation:** A frame is created using the positions of '4' in the input grid, replacing them with '0'. Other digits remain unchanged.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**

* **Input:** The least common digit is '5'.
* **Transformation:** Similar to Input_0, a frame is created using the positions of '5', replacing them with '0'. Other digits remain unchanged.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**

* **Input:** The least common digit is '5'.
* **Transformation:**  The same frame-creation logic applies, using the positions of '5' and replacing them with '0'. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  frame_color = leastcolor(I)
  frame_indices = ofcolor(I, frame_color)
  O = fill(I, 0, frame_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`frame_color = leastcolor(I)`:** Identifies the least common color in the input grid `I`.
2. **`frame_indices = ofcolor(I, frame_color)`:** Finds the indices of all cells with the `frame_color`.
3. **`O = fill(I, 0, frame_indices)`:** Creates the output grid `O` by filling the `frame_indices` in the input grid `I` with '0'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  least_common = leastcolor(I)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value != least_common:
        O = paint(O, {(value, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`least_common = leastcolor(I)`:** Identifies the least common color.
2. **`O = canvas(0, shape(I))`:** Creates a blank canvas `O` of the same size as the input grid `I`.
3. **Iterate through each cell:** For each cell in the input grid:
    * If the cell value is not the `least_common` color, paint the cell with its original value onto the canvas `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  frame_color = leastcolor(I)
  O = tuple(tuple(0 if value == frame_color else value for value in row) for row in I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`frame_color = leastcolor(I)`:** Identifies the least common color.
2. **List comprehension:** Creates the output grid `O` using list comprehension:
    * For each row in the input grid `I`:
      * For each `value` in the row:
        * If the `value` equals the `frame_color`, replace it with '0'.
        * Otherwise, keep the original `value`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  least_common = leastcolor(I)
  frame_indices = ofcolor(I, least_common)
  remaining_obj = difference(asobject(I), recolor(0, frame_indices))
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), remaining_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`least_common = leastcolor(I)`:** Identifies the least common color.
2. **`frame_indices = ofcolor(I, least_common)`:**  Finds the indices of the `least_common` color.
3. **`remaining_obj = difference(asobject(I), recolor(0, frame_indices))`:** 
    * Converts the grid to an object.
    * Creates a temporary object by recoloring the `frame_indices` to '0'.
    * Subtracts the temporary object from the original object, effectively removing the frame.
4. **`O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), remaining_obj)`:**  Paints the remaining object onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_not_least_common(cell):
    value, _ = cell
    return value != leastcolor(I)
  
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), sfilter(asobject(I), is_not_least_common))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_not_least_common(cell)`:** Defines a helper function to check if a cell's value is not the least common color.
2. **`O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), sfilter(asobject(I), is_not_least_common))`:**
    * Converts the input grid to an object.
    * Filters the object, keeping only cells that are not the `least_common` color.
    * Paints the filtered object onto a blank canvas. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL. Each version uses distinct logic and function combinations, offering a diverse set of solutions.
