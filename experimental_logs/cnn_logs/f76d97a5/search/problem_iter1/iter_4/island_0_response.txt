## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the most common color in the grid and replacing it with 0 while keeping all other colors unchanged.

**Input_0:**

- Most common color: 5
- Transformation: Replace all 5s with 0s, keep 4s unchanged.

**Input_1:**

- Most common color: 6
- Transformation: Replace all 6s with 0s, keep 5s unchanged.

**Input_2:**

- Most common color: 9
- Transformation: Replace all 9s with 0s, keep 5s unchanged.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(tuple(0 if v == mostcommon(grid) else v for v in row) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mostcommon(grid)`:**  Finds the most common color in the grid.
2. **`0 if v == mostcommon(grid) else v`:**  For each cell, if the value equals the most common color, replace it with 0; otherwise, keep the original value.
3. **`tuple(tuple(...) for row in grid)`:**  Constructs the output grid by applying the transformation to each cell.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  mc = mostcommon(grid)
  return tuple(tuple(branch(v == mc, 0, v) for v in row) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mc = mostcommon(grid)`:** Stores the most common color for efficiency.
2. **`branch(v == mc, 0, v)`:** Uses the `branch` function to conditionally replace the cell value based on its comparison with the most common color.
3. **`tuple(tuple(...) for row in grid)`:**  Constructs the output grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return apply(lambda row: tuple(0 if v == mostcommon(grid) else v for v in row), grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mostcommon(grid)`:**  Finds the most common color in the grid.
2. **`lambda row: tuple(0 if v == mostcommon(grid) else v for v in row)`:** Defines an anonymous function that takes a row and applies the color replacement logic to each cell in the row.
3. **`apply(..., grid)`:** Applies the anonymous function to each row of the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(tuple(rapply((lambda x: 0, identity), v)[v == mostcommon(grid)](v) for v in row) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mostcommon(grid)`:** Identifies the most common color.
2. **`(lambda x: 0, identity)`:**  Creates a tuple of functions: one replacing any value with 0, the other returning the input unchanged.
3. **`[v == mostcommon(grid)]`:**  Selects the function to apply based on whether the cell value matches the most common color. 
4. **`(v)`:** Applies the selected function to the cell value.
5. **`tuple(tuple(...) for row in grid)`:**  Constructs the output grid. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(tuple(branch(contained(v, {mostcommon(grid)}), 0, v) for v in row) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mostcommon(grid)`:**  Finds the most common color.
2. **`{mostcommon(grid)}`:** Creates a set containing only the most common color.
3. **`contained(v, ...)`:**  Checks if the cell value is present in the set (i.e., if it's the most common color).
4. **`branch(...)`:**  Conditionally replaces the cell value based on the containment check.
5. **`tuple(tuple(...) for row in grid)`:**  Constructs the output grid.

Each of these versions achieves the same transformation but utilizes different DSL functions and approaches, demonstrating a variety of possible solutions.
