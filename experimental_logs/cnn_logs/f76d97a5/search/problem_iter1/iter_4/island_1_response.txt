## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place involves identifying the most common color in the grid and then changing all occurrences of this color to '0'. The remaining cells retain their original color. 

Let's illustrate with Input_0:

* **Input_0:**
```
4 5 4
5 5 5
4 5 4
```
* **Most common color:** 5
* **Output_0:** (Replace all 5's with 0's)
```
0 4 0
4 4 4
0 4 0
```

This pattern holds true for all the input-output pairs provided.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return replace(grid, mostcommon(grid), 0)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mostcommon(grid)`:** Identifies the most frequent color in the grid.
2. **`replace(grid, mostcommon(grid), 0)`:** Replaces all occurrences of the most common color in the grid with the value '0'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def condition(cell): return cell == mostcommon(grid)
  return apply(lambda row: apply(lambda cell: 0 if condition(cell) else cell, row), grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`condition(cell)`:** Defines a function to check if a cell's value matches the most common color in the grid.
2. **`apply(lambda cell: 0 if condition(cell) else cell, row)`:** Applies a lambda function to each cell in a row. If the cell matches the most common color, it is replaced with '0'; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
3. **`apply(..., grid)`:** Applies the inner `apply` function to each row of the grid, effectively iterating through all cells and performing the replacement.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(tuple(0 if cell == mostcommon(grid) else cell for cell in row) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes nested list comprehensions to achieve the transformation:

1. **`0 if cell == mostcommon(grid) else cell`:** This conditional expression checks if a cell's value is equal to the most common color. If true, it replaces the cell with '0'; otherwise, it retains the original cell value.
2. **`for cell in row`:** Iterates through each cell in a row of the grid.
3. **`for row in grid`:** Iterates through each row in the grid.
4. **`tuple(tuple(...) for ...)`:** Constructs a new grid (tuple of tuples) with the transformed values. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def process_cell(i, j):
    return 0 if grid[i][j] == mostcommon(grid) else grid[i][j]
  return tuple(tuple(process_cell(i, j) for j in range(len(grid[0]))) for i in range(len(grid)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`process_cell(i, j)`:** Defines a function to process individual cells based on their row (i) and column (j) indices.
2. **`grid[i][j] == mostcommon(grid)`:** Checks if the cell's value matches the grid's most common color.
3. **`tuple(tuple(...) for ...)`:** Constructs a new grid by iterating through all cell indices and applying the `process_cell` function.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return fill(grid, 0, ofcolor(grid, mostcommon(grid)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(grid, mostcommon(grid))`:** Identifies the indices of all cells in the grid that have the most common color.
2. **`fill(grid, 0, ...)`:** Fills the grid at the identified indices with the value '0'.
