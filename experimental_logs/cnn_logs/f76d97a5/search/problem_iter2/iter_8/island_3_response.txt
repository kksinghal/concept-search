## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves the following steps:

1. **Identify objects:** The input grids consist of objects formed by contiguous cells of the same digit. The background is the most frequent digit.
2. **Rotate objects:** Each object is rotated 180 degrees.
3. **Recolor objects:**  Each rotated object is recolored to the digit that was originally in its upper-left corner before rotation.
4. **Place objects:** The rotated and recolored objects are placed on a canvas of the background color, maintaining their original positions.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    new_color = index(I, ulcorner(toindices(obj)))
    rotated_obj = recolor(new_color, rot180(toindices(obj)))
    O = underpaint(O, rotated_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `bg = mostcolor(I)`: Determines the background color of the input grid.
2.  `objs = fgpartition(I)`: Identifies all objects (excluding the background) in the input grid.
3.  `O = canvas(bg, shape(I))`: Creates an empty canvas with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color.
4.  **Loop:** Iterates through each object (`obj`) found in the input grid.
    *   `new_color = index(I, ulcorner(toindices(obj)))`: Extracts the digit at the upper-left corner of the current object. This will be the new color after rotation.
    *   `rotated_obj = recolor(new_color, rot180(toindices(obj)))`: Rotates the object 180 degrees and recolors it with the extracted `new_color`.
    *   `O = underpaint(O, rotated_obj)`: Paints the rotated and recolored object onto the canvas (`O`) only where the canvas still has the background color, ensuring objects don't overlap.
5.  `return O`: Returns the final transformed grid.


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), 
               merge(apply(lambda obj: 
                          recolor(index(I, ulcorner(toindices(obj))),
                                  rot180(toindices(obj))), 
                          fgpartition(I)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. `bg = mostcolor(I)`: Finds the background color of the input.
2. `canvas(bg, shape(I))`: Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
3. `fgpartition(I)`:  Breaks down the input into individual objects, excluding the background.
4. `apply(lambda obj: ..., fgpartition(I))`: Applies a transformation to each identified object:
   * `index(I, ulcorner(toindices(obj)))`: Fetches the color of the upper-left corner of the current object.
   * `rot180(toindices(obj))`: Rotates the object 180 degrees.
   * `recolor(... , ...)`: Applies the fetched color to the rotated object.
5. `merge(...)`: Combines all the transformed objects back together.
6. `paint(... , ...)`: Draws the combined, transformed objects onto the prepared canvas.
7. `return ...`: Returns the final transformed grid.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    O = underpaint(O,
                 recolor(index(I, ulcorner(toindices(obj))),
                        rot180(toindices(obj))))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `bg = mostcolor(I)`: Identifies the background color in the input.
2.  `O = canvas(bg, shape(I))`: Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
3.  `for obj in fgpartition(I):`: Loops through each object (except the background) found in the input.
    *   `O = underpaint(O, ...)`:  Paints onto the canvas (`O`) only if the current location is the background color. This prevents overlapping of objects. The object to paint is determined by the rest of the code within the loop.
        *   `index(I, ulcorner(toindices(obj)))`:  Gets the digit value from the top-left corner of the object in the original input.
        *   `rot180(toindices(obj))`: Rotates the object's indices 180 degrees.
        *   `recolor(... , ...)`: Recolors the rotated object using the digit value fetched earlier.
4.  `return O`: Returns the fully transformed grid.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
                 merge([recolor(index(I, ulcorner(toindices(obj))),
                               rot180(toindices(obj))) 
                       for obj in fgpartition(I)]))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`: Creates a canvas with the background color and the same shape as the input.
2. `fgpartition(I)`: Divides the input into distinct objects based on color, excluding the background.
3. `[... for obj in fgpartition(I)]`: Iterates over each identified object and applies a transformation:
   * `index(I, ulcorner(toindices(obj)))`: Retrieves the color of the upper-left cell of the current object.
   * `rot180(toindices(obj))`:  Rotates the object by 180 degrees.
   * `recolor(... , ...)`: Applies the retrieved color to the rotated object.
4. `merge(...)`: Combines all the transformed objects.
5. `paint(... , ...)`: Overlays the merged transformed objects onto the initial canvas.
6. `return ...`:  Returns the final output grid.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return fill(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 0, 
               difference(asindices(I), 
                          merge([toindices(recolor(index(I, ulcorner(toindices(obj))), 
                                                       rot180(toindices(obj)))) 
                                 for obj in fgpartition(I)])))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses an inverse logic, focusing on the areas to keep empty (filled with "0") instead of directly painting objects.

1. `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`: Generates a blank canvas the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
2. `fgpartition(I)`: Isolates each object in the input grid.
3. `[... for obj in fgpartition(I)]`:  Applies the following transformation to each object:
    *  `index(I, ulcorner(toindices(obj)))`: Retrieves the color of the top-left cell of the object.
    *  `rot180(toindices(obj))`: Rotates the object 180 degrees.
    *  `recolor(... , ...)`: Colors the rotated object with the extracted color.
    *  `toindices(...)`:  Extracts the indices of the transformed object.
4. `merge(...)`: Combines all the indices of the transformed objects.
5. `difference(asindices(I), ...)`:  Subtracts the combined indices from all indices of the input grid. This leaves the indices of areas that should remain empty.
6. `fill(... , 0, ...)`: Fills the identified empty areas on the canvas with "0".
7. `return ...`: Returns the final grid with the transformed objects.

Each program version utilizes a different combination of DSL functions to achieve the same outcome, showcasing the flexibility of the language.
