## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in each example involves identifying the most common color (background) and the objects formed by different colors in the input grid. The output grid then retains the shape of the input, but only the background color and the outline of the objects (using a different color) are preserved.

**Here's a breakdown:**

1. **Background Identification:** The most frequent color in the input grid is identified as the background color.
2. **Object Outlining:** For each non-background object in the input:
    - Its outline (the border cells) is determined.
    - The outline cells are assigned a specific color (different from the background).
3. **Grid Reconstruction:**  A new grid is created with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color.
4. **Outline Painting:** The identified outlines of the objects are painted onto the new grid. 


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg_color = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  outlines = mapply(box, objs)
  O = paint(canvas(bg_color, shape(I)), recolor(0, outlines))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg_color = mostcolor(I)`:**  Identifies the background color.
2. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts objects (excluding background) from the input grid. `T, F, T` indicate univalued objects, no diagonal connections, and exclusion of background. 
3. **`outlines = mapply(box, objs)`:**  Computes the outline (bounding box) for each object.
4. **`O = paint(canvas(bg_color, shape(I)), recolor(0, outlines))`:** Creates a canvas filled with the background color and paints the outlines (recolored to 0) onto it. 

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg_color = mostcolor(I)
  objs = partition(I)
  outlines = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) != bg_color and box)
  O = fill(canvas(bg_color, shape(I)), 0, outlines)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`bg_color = mostcolor(I)`:** Identifies the background color.
2. **`objs = partition(I)`:**  Partitions the grid into objects based on color.
3. **`outlines = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) != bg_color and box)`:** Filters for object outlines that are not the background color and applies the `box` function to get the outlines.
4. **`O = fill(canvas(bg_color, shape(I)), 0, outlines)`:**  Fills a canvas (with background color) with 0 at the outline indices.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  filled = apply(lambda row: apply(lambda v: 0 if v != bg else bg, row), I)
  objs = objects(filled, T, F, T)
  O = mapply(lambda obj: paint(filled, recolor(bg, box(obj))), objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:** Identifies the background color.
2. **`filled = apply(lambda row: apply(lambda v: 0 if v != bg else bg, row), I)`:**  Creates a new grid where non-background cells are filled with 0.
3. **`objs = objects(filled, T, F, T)`:**  Extracts objects (excluding background) from the modified grid.
4. **`O = mapply(lambda obj: paint(filled, recolor(bg, box(obj))), objs)`:**  For each object, it paints its outline (recolored to background color) onto the modified grid.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = paint(O, recolor(0, box(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:** Identifies the background color.
2. **`O = canvas(bg, shape(I))`:** Creates a new grid filled with the background color.
3. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):`:** Iterates through each non-background object.
4. **`O = paint(O, recolor(0, box(obj)))`:**  Paints the outline of each object (recolored to 0) onto the new grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  inv = apply(lambda row: apply(lambda v: 0 if v == mostcolor(I) else 1, row), I)
  objs = objects(inv, T, F, F)
  outlines = mapply(box, objs)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(0, outlines))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`inv = apply(lambda row: apply(lambda v: 0 if v == mostcolor(I) else 1, row), I)`:** Creates an "inverted" grid where the background color becomes 0 and other cells become 1. 
2. **`objs = objects(inv, T, F, F)`:** Extracts objects (including background) from the inverted grid.
3. **`outlines = mapply(box, objs)`:**  Gets the outlines of all objects. 
4. **`O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(0, outlines))`:** Creates a canvas with the original background color and paints the outlines (recolored to 0) onto it.
