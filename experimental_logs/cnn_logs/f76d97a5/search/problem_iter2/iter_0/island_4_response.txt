## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking the unique shapes formed by non-background digits in the input grid and rotating them clockwise by 90 degrees. The background color (most frequent color) remains unchanged. 

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:**
* **Input:** A cross shape formed by digit '5' on a background of '0'.
* **Output:** The cross is rotated clockwise by 90 degrees.

**Pair 1:**
* **Input:**  A more complex pattern with digit '6' on a background of '0'. The '5' digit is considered background as it appears only once.
* **Output:**  Each distinct '6' shape is rotated clockwise by 90 degrees.

**Pair 2:**
* **Input:**  Similar to pair 1, but with digit '9' forming the shapes and '0' as background. 
* **Output:**  Again, each distinct '9' shape is rotated clockwise.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each with an explanation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    # Identify the background color
    bg = mostcolor(I)  
    
    # Get all objects (shapes) excluding the background
    objs = objects(I, F, F, T)  
    
    # Rotate each object and paint it onto a blank canvas
    rotated_objs = frozenset({recolor(color(obj), rot90(toindices(obj))) for obj in objs})
    
    # Fill the canvas with the background color and then paint the rotated objects 
    O = paint(fill(canvas(bg, shape(I)), bg, asindices(I)), rotated_objs) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background:** `bg = mostcolor(I)` finds the most frequent color, representing the background.
2. **Extract Objects:** `objs = objects(I, F, F, T)` identifies all distinct shapes formed by non-background colors.
3. **Rotate Objects:** For each object:
   - `color(obj)` gets the object's color.
   - `toindices(obj)` converts the object into a set of its cell indices.
   - `rot90(...)` rotates the indices clockwise.
   - `recolor(...)` creates a new object with rotated indices and the original color.
4. **Create Canvas:** `canvas(bg, shape(I))` generates a grid filled with the background color, having the same dimensions as the input.
5. **Paint Rotated Objects:** The rotated objects are then painted onto the canvas using `paint`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        O = paint(cover(O, obj), recolor(color(obj), rot90(toindices(obj))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1, background color and objects are identified.
2. **Iterative Rotation:** This version iterates through each object:
   - `cover(O, obj)` removes the object from the grid, replacing it with the background color.
   - The object is then rotated and painted back onto the grid using `paint`, effectively replacing the original object with its rotated version.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    return paint(fill(canvas(bg, shape(I)), bg, asindices(I)), 
                 mapply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), rot90(toindices(obj))), objects(I, F, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version combines several operations into a single line for conciseness:

1. **Canvas and Background:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Rotate and Paint (using `mapply`):**
   - `objects(I, F, F, T)` extracts the objects.
   - `mapply(...)` applies the rotation and recoloring logic to each object and merges the results. 
   - Finally, `paint(...)` paints the rotated objects onto the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    rotated_grid = rot90(I)
    O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
    for i, row in enumerate(rotated_grid):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val != bg:
                O = paint(O, {(val, (j, len(rotated_grid) - i - 1))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Rotate the Entire Grid:** This version first rotates the entire input grid using `rot90(I)`.
2. **Iterate and Paint:** It then iterates through the rotated grid and for every non-background color:
   - It calculates the correct position after rotation (`(j, len(rotated_grid) - i - 1)`).
   - It paints a single-cell object with the correct color and position onto the initially blank canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
    return paint(I, 
                 merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), frozenset({(j, width(obj)-i-1) for (i, j) in toindices(obj)})), objs))) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on modifying object indices directly:

1. **Extract Objects:**  Extract all non-background objects from the input grid.
2. **Rotate Indices:**  For each object, rotate its indices by 90 degrees directly using the formula `(j, width(obj)-i-1)`.
3. **Recolor:**  Create new objects with the rotated indices and original colors.
4. **Merge and Paint:**  Merge all rotated objects and paint them onto the input grid, effectively replacing the original objects with their rotated versions.

## Conclusion:

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation. Each version leverages various DSL functions and strategies, showcasing the flexibility and power of the provided DSL.
