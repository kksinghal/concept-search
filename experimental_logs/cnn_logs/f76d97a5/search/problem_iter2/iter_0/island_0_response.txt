## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently identifies the dominant color in the input grid and replaces it with 0 while changing all other colors to the dominant color. 

**Example:**

In Input_0:

* Dominant color: 5
* All 5s are replaced with 0s.
* All other digits (0s) are replaced with the dominant color (5).

This logic applies to all the provided input-output examples.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code using the provided DSL:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  dom_color = mostcolor(grid)  
  return replace(replace(grid, dom_color, 0), 0, dom_color) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`dom_color = mostcolor(grid)`**:  Identifies the dominant color in the grid.
2. **`replace(grid, dom_color, 0)`**: Replaces all instances of the dominant color with 0.
3. **`replace(..., 0, dom_color)`**: Replaces all remaining 0s (which were originally different colors) with the dominant color.

This version uses nested `replace` functions for a clear and efficient implementation.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  dom_color = mostcolor(grid)
  return tuple(tuple(0 if v == dom_color else dom_color for v in row) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`dom_color = mostcolor(grid)`**:  Identifies the dominant color in the grid.
2. **`tuple(tuple(... for v in row) for row in grid)`**: Uses nested list comprehensions to iterate over each cell in the grid.
3. **`0 if v == dom_color else dom_color`**:  For each cell, if the value (`v`) is the dominant color, it's replaced with 0; otherwise, it's replaced with the dominant color.

This version leverages the power of list comprehensions for a concise and efficient solution.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  inverted = tuple(tuple(0 if v == mostcolor(grid) else mostcolor(grid) for v in row) for row in grid)
  return inverted
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mostcolor(grid)`**: Identifies the dominant color in the grid.
2. **`tuple(tuple(... for v in row) for row in grid)`**: Uses nested list comprehensions to iterate over each cell in the grid.
3. **`0 if v == mostcolor(grid) else mostcolor(grid)`**: For each cell, if the value (`v`) is the dominant color, it's replaced with 0; otherwise, it's replaced with the dominant color. 
4. **`inverted = ...`**: Stores the inverted grid.
5. **`return inverted`**: Returns the modified grid.

This version is similar to Version 2 but emphasizes code readability by first creating and then returning the `inverted` grid.


### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  new_grid = tuple()
  for row in grid:
    new_row = tuple()
    for v in row:
      if v == mostcolor(grid):
        new_row += (0,)
      else:
        new_row += (mostcolor(grid),)
    new_grid += (new_row,)
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`new_grid = tuple()`**: Initializes an empty tuple to store the modified grid.
2. **`for row in grid ...`**: Iterates over each row in the input grid.
3. **`new_row = tuple()`**: Initializes an empty tuple for each new row.
4. **`for v in row ...`**: Iterates over each value in the current row.
5. **`if v == mostcolor(grid): ... else: ...`**: If the current value is the dominant color, append 0 to `new_row`; otherwise, append the dominant color.
6. **`new_grid += (new_row,)`**: Append the modified `new_row` to the `new_grid`.
7. **`return new_grid`**: Return the fully constructed `new_grid`.

This version utilizes explicit loops and tuple concatenation for a more procedural approach.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return apply(lambda row: tuple(0 if v == mostcolor(grid) else mostcolor(grid) for v in row), grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mostcolor(grid)`**: Identifies the dominant color.
2. **`lambda row: tuple(...)`**: Defines an anonymous function that operates on each row of the grid.
3. **`tuple(0 if v == mostcolor(grid) else mostcolor(grid) for v in row)`**: Within each row, this list comprehension replaces the dominant color with 0 and all other colors with the dominant color.
4. **`apply(..., grid)`**: Applies the anonymous function to each row of the input grid.

This version demonstrates functional programming concepts by using `apply` and a lambda function for a compact and expressive solution.
