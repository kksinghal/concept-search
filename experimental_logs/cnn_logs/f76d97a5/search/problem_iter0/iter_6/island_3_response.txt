## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all three examples follows the same pattern:

1. **Identify the central object:** This is the object formed by the most common color (digit) in the grid.
2. **Replace non-central object cells with 0:** All cells belonging to objects other than the central object are replaced with 0. 
3. **Shift object color:** The color (digit) of the central object is switched with the color 0.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  central_color = mostcolor(I)
  objs = partition(I)
  central_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == central_color)
  O = paint(canvas(central_color, shape(I)), recolor(0, central_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`central_color = mostcolor(I)`:** Finds the most common color in the input grid.
2. **`objs = partition(I)`:** Partitions the grid into separate objects based on color.
3. **`central_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == central_color)`:** Extracts the central object from the set of objects.
4. **`O = paint(canvas(central_color, shape(I)), recolor(0, central_obj))`:** 
    - Creates a new canvas filled with the `central_color` and the same size as the input.
    - Recolors the `central_obj` to 0.
    - Paints the recolored object onto the canvas.
5. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = underfill(I, 0, asindices(I))
  O = switch(O, mostcolor(I), 0)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = underfill(I, 0, asindices(I))`:**  Fills all cells that are not the background color with 0. This effectively removes all non-central objects.
2. **`O = switch(O, mostcolor(I), 0)`:** Switches the most common color (initially the central object's color) with 0.
3. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  common_color = mostcolor(I)
  O = replace(I, common_color, 0)
  O = replace(O, 0, common_color)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`common_color = mostcolor(I)`:** Stores the most common color (central object's color).
2. **`O = replace(I, common_color, 0)`:** Replaces all instances of the `common_color` with 0.
3. **`O = replace(O, 0, common_color)`:** Replaces all instances of 0 (which were previously the central object's color) with the `common_color`.
4. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  central_color = mostcolor(I)
  objs = partition(I)
  non_central_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) != central_color)
  O = I
  for obj in non_central_objs:
    O = cover(O, obj)
  O = switch(O, central_color, 0)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`central_color = mostcolor(I)`:**  Gets the central object's color.
2. **`objs = partition(I)`:** Splits the grid into objects based on color.
3. **`non_central_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) != central_color)`:** Filters out the central object, leaving only non-central ones.
4. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid as a copy of the input.
5. **`for obj in non_central_objs: O = cover(O, obj)`:** Iterates through non-central objects and removes them (replaces with background color) from the output grid.
6. **`O = switch(O, central_color, 0)`:**  Switches the central object's color with 0.
7. **`return O`:** Returns the final transformed grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  bg_color = mostcolor(I)
  filled_grid = underfill(I, bg_color + 1, asindices(I))
  O = switch(filled_grid, bg_color, 0)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg_color = mostcolor(I)`:** Stores the most common color, which represents the background.
2. **`filled_grid = underfill(I, bg_color + 1, asindices(I))`:** Replaces all non-background colors with a new, temporary color (`bg_color + 1`) to distinguish the central object.
3. **`O = switch(filled_grid, bg_color, 0)`:** Switches the original background color with 0, achieving the desired transformation.
4. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.
