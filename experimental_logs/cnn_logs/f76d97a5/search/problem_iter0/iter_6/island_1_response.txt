## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all examples can be described as **inverting the figure-ground relationship** while preserving the shape of the original figures. This means the background color becomes the figure color and vice-versa.

**Let's break it down for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 - Output_0:** The original figure (a cross shape) made of '5's on a background of '4's is inverted. The output shows a cross of '4's on a background of '0's. 
* **Input_1 - Output_1:** The pattern of '6's (forming the figure) on a background of '5's is inverted. The output displays '6's forming the background pattern, while the figure is now represented by '0's.
* **Input_2 - Output_2:**  Similar to the previous examples, the '5's forming the figure on a '9' background are inverted, resulting in a figure of '9's on a background of '0's in the output.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  mc = mostcolor(I)  # Identify the most frequent color (background)
  O = replace(I, mc, 0)  # Replace background color with '0'
  O = replace(O, 0, mc)  # Replace all '0's (originally figures) with the background color
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background:** We find the most common color in the input grid (`mc`), assuming this represents the background.
2. **Replace Background:** We replace all instances of the background color (`mc`) with '0'.
3. **Invert Figure-Ground:**  Finally, we replace all occurrences of '0' (which were originally the figures) with the identified background color (`mc`), effectively inverting the figure-ground relationship.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Extract objects, excluding background
  indices_to_fill = mapply(toindices, objs) # Get indices of all objects
  O = fill(I, 0, indices_to_fill) # Fill object indices with '0'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** The `objects` function identifies and extracts all objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Get Object Indices:**  We obtain the indices of all cells belonging to the extracted objects using `mapply` and `toindices`.
3. **Fill with '0':** Finally, we use the `fill` function to replace the values at the object indices with '0', effectively inverting the figure-ground. 

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  mc = mostcolor(I) # Identify the background color
  O = canvas(mc, shape(I)) # Create a canvas filled with the background color
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Extract objects, excluding background
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, recolor(0, obj)) # Paint each object onto the canvas with '0'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background:** We determine the most frequent color (`mc`) to represent the background.
2. **Create Canvas:** A new grid (`O`) is created, filled with the background color (`mc`) and having the same dimensions as the input.
3. **Extract and Paint Objects:** We extract objects from the input, excluding the background. Then, each object is 'painted' onto the new canvas (`O`) using the color '0', effectively inverting the figure-ground.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  inverted = replace(I, mostcolor(I), 0) # Replace background with '0'
  return replace(inverted, 0, leastcolor(inverted)) # Replace '0's with the new background color
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initial Inversion:**  We replace the background color with '0', resulting in an intermediate grid where the figures are represented by '0's.
2. **Finalize Inversion:** We identify the least frequent color in the intermediate grid (which represents the new background) and replace all '0's with it, completing the figure-ground inversion.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  fg = leastcolor(I) # Identify the foreground color
  bg = mostcolor(I) # Identify the background color
  O = I # Copy the input grid
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == fg: # If cell belongs to the figure
        O = fill(O, bg, {(i, j)}) # Fill with background color
      else: 
        O = fill(O, fg, {(i, j)}) # Otherwise, fill with foreground color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Foreground and Background:**  We identify the least frequent color (`fg`, representing the figure) and the most frequent color (`bg`, representing the background).
2. **Iterate and Invert:**  We iterate through each cell of the input grid. If a cell belongs to the figure (color `fg`), we replace it with the background color (`bg`). Otherwise, we replace it with the foreground color (`fg`), effectively swapping the figure and background colors for each cell. 


These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the desired figure-ground inversion in the input grids using the provided DSL.
