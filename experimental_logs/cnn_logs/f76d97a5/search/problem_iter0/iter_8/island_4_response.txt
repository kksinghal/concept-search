## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to extract the objects formed by the least frequent color in the input grid and paint them onto a blank canvas of the same size.

**Input_0:** The least frequent color is '4'. The program extracts the '4' objects and paints them on a 3x3 canvas of '0's.

**Input_1:** The least frequent color is '6'. The program extracts the '6' objects and paints them on a 5x5 canvas of '0's.

**Input_2:** The least frequent color is '9'. The program extracts the '9' objects and paints them on a 5x5 canvas of '0's.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  least_color = leastcolor(grid)  # Find the least frequent color
  objs = partition(grid)  # Partition the grid into objects based on color
  extracted_objs = frozenset(obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == least_color)  # Extract objects of the least frequent color
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), extracted_objs)  # Paint the extracted objects on a blank canvas
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **leastcolor(grid):** Identifies the least frequent color in the input grid.
2.  **partition(grid):** Divides the grid into separate objects based on color.
3.  **frozenset(obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == least_color):** Iterates through the partitioned objects and selects those with the least frequent color, storing them in `extracted_objs`.
4.  **paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), extracted_objs):** Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid, filled with '0's, and then paints the `extracted_objs` onto this canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  target_color = leastcolor(grid)  # Find the least frequent color
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), mfilter(partition(grid), lambda obj: color(obj) == target_color))  # Extract and paint objects in one step
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **leastcolor(grid):** Determines the least frequent color in the input grid.
2.  **paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), mfilter(partition(grid), lambda obj: color(obj) == target_color)):**
    *   **canvas(0, shape(grid)):** Creates a blank canvas of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with '0's.
    *   **mfilter(partition(grid), lambda obj: color(obj) == target_color):** Partitions the grid into objects based on color and then filters these objects, keeping only those where the color matches the `target_color`. This filtered set of objects is then merged.
    *   Finally, the merged set of objects is painted onto the blank canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), colorfilter(partition(grid), leastcolor(grid)))  # Directly use colorfilter for object extraction
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **canvas(0, shape(grid)):** Generates a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid, populated with '0's.
2.  **colorfilter(partition(grid), leastcolor(grid)):**  
    *   **partition(grid):** Splits the input grid into individual objects based on their color.
    *   **leastcolor(grid):** Identifies the least frequent color within the input grid.
    *   **colorfilter**: Filters the partitioned objects, retaining only those objects whose color matches the `leastcolor`.
3.  **paint**: Finally, the filtered objects are painted onto the blank canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  least_color = leastcolor(grid)
  return replace(canvas(least_color, shape(grid)), least_color, 0) # Invert the logic by filling with least_color and replacing
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **leastcolor(grid):** This function identifies the least frequent color in the provided grid.
2.  **canvas(least_color, shape(grid)):** This function generates a new grid (canvas) that has the same dimensions as the input grid, but instead of being filled with '0's, it's filled with the `least_color`.
3.  **replace(canvas(...), least_color, 0):**  This function takes the canvas created in the previous step and replaces all occurrences of the `least_color` with '0'.  This effectively "inverts" the process, resulting in a grid where the objects originally of the least frequent color are now represented by '0's, while the rest of the canvas is filled with the `least_color`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    min_color = leastcolor(grid)
    objects_list = objects(grid, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=False)  # Extract all objects from the grid
    filtered_objects = frozenset(obj for obj in objects_list if color(obj) == min_color) # Filter for objects with the minimum color
    new_grid = canvas(0, shape(grid)) # Create a new grid filled with zeros
    for obj in filtered_objects:
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, obj) # Paint each filtered object onto the new grid
    return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **leastcolor(grid):** Finds the least frequent color in the grid.
2.  **objects(grid, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=False):** Extracts all objects from the grid, considering diagonally connected cells and including the background.
3.  **frozenset(obj for obj in objects\_list if color(obj) == min\_color):** Filters the extracted objects to keep only those with the least frequent color.
4.  **canvas(0, shape(grid)):** Creates a new grid filled with zeros, having the same shape as the input grid.
5.  **Iterative Painting:** The code iterates through each filtered object and paints it onto the new grid using the `paint` function.

These different program versions demonstrate a variety of approaches to achieve the same transformation, using distinct logic and combinations of DSL functions. Each version offers a unique perspective on solving the problem while adhering to the constraints of the provided DSL.
