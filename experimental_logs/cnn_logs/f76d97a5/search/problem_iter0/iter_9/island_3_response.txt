## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to isolate the central object in the grid and replace all other cells with the value '0'. An object is defined as a group of connected cells with the same value. Here's a breakdown for each example:

**Input_0:**
- The central object consists of the value '5'. 
- The transformation keeps the '5's and replaces the surrounding '4's with '0's.

**Input_1:**
- The central object is formed by the '6's. 
- The transformation retains the connected '6's and replaces all '5's with '0's.

**Input_2:**
-  The '9's form the central object.
- The transformation preserves the connected '9's and replaces the '5's with '0's.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code along with explanations:

**Version 1:** (Inspired by Program_A's object identification and canvas usage)

```python
def program_version_1(I):
  central_color = mostcolor(I)  # Find the most common color
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == central_color and any(central_color == I[k][l] for k, l in neighbors((i, j)) if 0 <= k < len(I) and 0 <= l < len(row)):
        O = paint(O, {(value, (i, j))})  # Paint only connected cells of the central color
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Central Color:** `mostcolor(I)` determines the most frequent color in the grid, representing the central object.
2. **Blank Canvas:** `canvas(0, shape(I))` generates a grid of '0's with the same dimensions as the input.
3. **Iterate and Paint:** The code iterates through each cell. If a cell matches the central color **and** has at least one neighbor with the same color (ensuring connectivity), it's painted onto the canvas.

**Version 2:** (Utilizing Program_A's object separation and filtering)

```python
def program_version_2(I):
  objs = partition(I) # Partition grid into objects
  central_color = mostcolor(I)
  central_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == central_color) # Extract the central object
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), central_obj) # Paint the central object on a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Partitioning:** `partition(I)` divides the grid into distinct objects based on color connectivity.
2. **Central Object Extraction:**  `extract` finds the object whose color matches the `central_color`.
3. **Canvas Painting:**  Similar to Version 1, the extracted central object is painted onto a blank canvas.

**Version 3:** (Leveraging object manipulation from Program_A)

```python
def program_version_3(I):
  objs = partition(I)  # Partition into objects
  central_color = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Create a canvas
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == central_color:
      O = paint(O, obj)  # Paint the object if its color matches the central color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Partitioning:** Like Version 2, the grid is split into objects.
2. **Iterative Painting:** The code iterates through each object. If an object's color matches the `central_color`, it's painted onto the canvas. 

**Version 4:** (Emphasizing background replacement)

```python
def program_version_4(I):
  central_color = mostcolor(I)
  O = apply(lambda row: tuple(0 if value != central_color else value for value in row), I)  # Replace non-central colors
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Replacement:**  This version simplifies the process by directly iterating through the grid and replacing any cell that doesn't match the `central_color` with '0'.

**Version 5:** (Combining object detection and background replacement)

```python
def program_version_5(I):
  central_color = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, univalued = False, diagonal=True, without_bg = False) # Find all objects
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) != central_color:
      I = cover(I, obj) # Cover non-central objects with background color
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:**  `objects` function identifies all distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Selective Covering:** The code iterates through the objects. If an object's color isn't the `central_color`, it's removed from the grid by replacing it with the background color using `cover`.
