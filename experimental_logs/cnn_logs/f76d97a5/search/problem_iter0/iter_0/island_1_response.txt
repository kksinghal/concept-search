## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on isolating the central "cross" shape formed by the most frequent color in the input grid. This involves changing all non-cross cells to a less frequent color, effectively creating a negative space effect.

**Input_0:**

- Identify the most frequent color (4).
- Change all other colors (5) to a less frequent color (0).

**Input_1:**

- Identify the most frequent color (6).
- Change all other colors (5) to a less frequent color (0).

**Input_2:**

- Identify the most frequent color (9).
- Change all other colors (5) to a less frequent color (0).


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL functions, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  mc = mostcommon(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) != mc)
  indices_to_fill = mapply(toindices, filtered_objs)
  O = fill(I, 0, indices_to_fill)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mc = mostcommon(I)`:** Identify the most frequent color in the input grid `I`.
2. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extract all objects (connected components) from the input grid.
3. **`filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) != mc)`:** Filter objects, keeping only those whose color is NOT the most frequent color.
4. **`indices_to_fill = mapply(toindices, filtered_objs)`:** Extract the indices of all cells belonging to the filtered objects.
5. **`O = fill(I, 0, indices_to_fill)`:** Fill the cells at the extracted indices with the color '0', creating the desired negative space effect.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  mc = mostcolor(I)
  O = apply(lambda row: tuple(mc if v == mc else 0 for v in row), I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mc = mostcolor(I)`:** Identify the most frequent color in the grid.
2. **`O = apply(lambda row: tuple(mc if v == mc else 0 for v in row), I)`:**  Iterate through each row of the input grid. For each cell, if its value equals the most frequent color, keep it; otherwise, replace it with 0.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  indices = asindices(I)
  cross_indices = mfilter(indices, lambda loc: any(index(I, add(loc, d)) != bg for d in (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)))
  O = fill(I, 0, indices - cross_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:** Identify the background color (most frequent).
2. **`indices = asindices(I)`:** Get all indices in the grid.
3. **`cross_indices = mfilter(...)`:** Filter indices to keep only those that are part of the cross shape. This is achieved by checking if any directly adjacent cell (up, down, left, right) has a different color than the background.
4. **`O = fill(I, 0, indices - cross_indices)`:** Fill all cells not identified as part of the cross shape with 0.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = tuple(
    tuple(0 if any(v != bg for v in (row[max(0, j-1):j+2] + I[max(0, i-1)][j] + I[min(len(I)-1, i+1)][j])) else bg for j, v in enumerate(row))
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly manipulates the grid without using explicit object extraction. It iterates through each cell and its immediate neighbors to determine if it belongs to the cross shape based on color comparison with the background.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
    bg_color = mostcolor(I)
    cross = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == bg_color)
    O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), cross)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Extract objects (connected components) from the grid, considering only direct neighbors.
2. **`bg_color = mostcolor(I)`:** Get the background color.
3. **`cross = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == bg_color)`:** Find the object representing the cross shape (having the background color).
4. **`O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), cross)`:** Create a canvas filled with 0s and paint the extracted cross object onto it. 

These five versions showcase different approaches and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version leverages distinct logic and function calls, ensuring diversity in the solutions.
