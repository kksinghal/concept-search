## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extracting the object with the least common color from the input grid and placing it on a canvas of the same size as the input grid, filled with the most common color.

**Input 0:**
- Most common color: 4
- Least common color: 5
- Transformation: The object formed by digit '5' is extracted and placed on a canvas of 3x3 filled with '4'.

**Input 1:**
- Most common color: 6
- Least common color: 5
- Transformation: The object formed by digit '5' is extracted and placed on a canvas of 5x5 filled with '6'.

**Input 2:**
- Most common color: 9
- Least common color: 5
- Transformation: The object formed by digit '5' is extracted and placed on a canvas of 5x5 filled with '9'.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  obj = argmin(objs, size)
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`**: Determine the most common color in the input grid.
2. **`objs = objects(I, T, T, T)`**: Identify all distinct objects in the grid.
3. **`obj = argmin(objs, size)`**: Select the object with the smallest size (least common color).
4. **`O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), obj)`**: Create a canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the most common color, and paint the extracted object onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  obj = argmin(objs, lambda o: colorcount(I, color(o)))
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`objs = objects(I, T, T, T)`**: Identify all distinct objects in the grid.
2. **`obj = argmin(objs, lambda o: colorcount(I, color(o)))`**: Select the object with the minimum count of its color in the input grid (least common).
3. **`O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), obj)`**: Create a canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the most common color, and paint the extracted object onto it.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, T, T, T), key=size)
  obj = first(objs)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`objs = sorted(objects(I, T, T, T), key=size)`**:  Identify and sort objects by their size (ascending).
2. **`obj = first(objs)`**: Select the first object, which represents the smallest object (least common color).
3. **`O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), obj)`**: Create a canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the most common color, and paint the extracted object onto it.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  colors = palette(I)
  least_color = argmin(colors, lambda c: colorcount(I, c))
  obj = extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == least_color)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`colors = palette(I)`**:  Get the set of unique colors in the grid.
2. **`least_color = argmin(colors, lambda c: colorcount(I, c))`**:  Find the color with the minimum count (least common) in the grid.
3. **`obj = extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == least_color)`**: Extract the object with the least common color.
4. **`O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), obj)`**: Create a canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the most common color, and paint the extracted object onto it.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  obj =  argmin(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: len(sfilter(o, lambda cell: cell[0] != bg)))
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`**:  Determine the most common color in the input grid.
2. **`obj =  argmin(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: len(sfilter(o, lambda cell: cell[0] != bg)))`**:  Select the object with the minimum number of cells that are not the background color.
3. **`O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), obj)`**: Create a canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the most common color, and paint the extracted object onto it.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to identifying and extracting the desired object using the DSL functions while achieving the same transformation.
