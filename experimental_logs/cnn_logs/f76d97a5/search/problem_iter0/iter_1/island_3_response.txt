## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all three examples follows a consistent pattern:

1. **Identify Central Object:**  The transformation focuses on the object formed by the most frequent digit in the input grid (digit '4' in Input_0, '6' in Input_1, and '9' in Input_2). 

2. **Isolate and Retain Central Object:** This central object is extracted and remains unchanged in the output grid.

3. **Replace Non-Central Digits with '0':** All other digits in the input grid, except those forming the central object, are replaced with the digit '0' in the output grid. 


## Program Version 1: 

**Code:**

```python
def solve_puzzle(I):
  # Find the most common color (representing the central object)
  common_color = mostcolor(I) 
  
  # Partition the grid based on color, effectively separating objects
  objs = partition(I)
  
  # Find the central object (the object with the most common color)
  central_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == common_color)
  
  # Paint the central object on a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), central_obj) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`common_color = mostcolor(I)`**:  Identifies the most frequent digit in the input grid (`I`), representing the color of the central object.

2. **`objs = partition(I)`**: Divides the input grid into separate objects based on their digit values. Each object is a set of cells with the same digit.

3. **`central_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == common_color)`**:  Finds and extracts the object from the `objs` set that has the color matching `common_color`. This is the central object.

4. **`O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), central_obj)`**:
   - `canvas(0, shape(I))` creates a new grid of the same size as the input grid (`I`), filled with '0'.
   -  `paint(..., central_obj)` then paints the extracted `central_obj` onto this blank canvas, resulting in the final output grid (`O`).

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_puzzle(I):
  # Directly fill non-central object cells with '0'
  O = underfill(I, 0, asindices(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = underfill(I, 0, asindices(I))`**: 
    -  `asindices(I)` generates a set of all cell indices in the input grid (`I`).
    -  `underfill(I, 0, ...)` fills the input grid `I` with the value '0' at the provided indices  (`asindices(I)`) but only if the original cell value at that index matches the background color (which is the most common color). Since we want to keep the central object and replace everything else, this effectively achieves the transformation.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python 
def solve_puzzle(I):
  # Find the most common color 
  target_color = mostcolor(I)

  # Create a new grid by iterating through the input grid
  O = tuple(
      tuple(
          cell if cell == target_color else 0 # Keep target color, replace others with 0
          for cell in row 
      )
      for row in I
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested list comprehensions to achieve the transformation directly, without explicitly using object or patch functions:

1. **`target_color = mostcolor(I)`**:  Determines the most common color in the input grid.
2. **Nested List Comprehensions**: These create a new grid (`O`) by iterating through each cell of the input grid (`I`). 
   -  `cell if cell == target_color else 0`: If a cell's value matches the `target_color`, it is retained in the output grid; otherwise, it is replaced with a '0'. 

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_puzzle(I):
  # Get indices of the most common color
  target_indices = ofcolor(I, mostcolor(I))  
  
  # Create a blank canvas
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) 
  
  # Fill in the target indices with their original values from the input grid
  O = tuple(
      tuple(
          I[i][j] if (i, j) in target_indices else O[i][j] 
          for j in range(len(O[0]))
      )
      for i in range(len(O))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`target_indices = ofcolor(I, mostcolor(I))`**:  Finds the indices of all cells in the input grid (`I`) that have the most common color.
2. **`O = canvas(0, shape(I))`**: Creates a blank canvas filled with '0's, having the same dimensions as the input grid.
3. **Nested loops and conditional replacement**:  The code iterates over the newly created grid (`O`) and for each cell:
   - It checks if the cell's index `(i, j)` is present in `target_indices`.
   - If yes, it takes the value from the corresponding position in the input grid (`I[i][j]`); otherwise, it keeps the existing value from the canvas (`O[i][j]`, which is '0').

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_puzzle(I):
  # Find all objects in the input grid
  all_objects = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=False)

  # Find the largest object, which represents the central object
  largest_object = argmax(all_objects, size)  

  # Create a blank canvas
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  
  # Paint the largest object onto the canvas
  O = paint(O, largest_object)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`all_objects = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=False)`**: Finds all distinct objects within the input grid (`I`).
    - `univalued=False` considers objects even if they have multiple colors.
    - `diagonal=True` allows diagonally connected cells to be part of the same object.
    - `without_bg=False` includes the background color in object detection. 
2. **`largest_object = argmax(all_objects, size)`**:  Identifies the largest object from `all_objects` based on their size (number of cells). 
3. **`O = canvas(0, shape(I))`**: Creates a blank canvas filled with '0's.
4. **`O = paint(O, largest_object)`**: Paints the `largest_object` onto the blank canvas, resulting in the final output.
