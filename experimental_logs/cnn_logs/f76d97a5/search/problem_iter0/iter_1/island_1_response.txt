## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be summarized as follows:

* **Identify the most common color (digit) in the grid.** This color represents the background.
* **Isolate the objects formed by colors different from the background.** 
* **For each object, create a bounding box.**
* **Fill the area within each bounding box with the object's color, effectively erasing the original object and leaving only its outline.**

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  result = I
  for obj in objs:
    indices = box(toindices(obj))
    result = fill(result, color(obj), indices)
  return result
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background color:** `bg = mostcolor(I)` retrieves the most frequent color in the grid.
2. **Isolate objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies objects composed of colors different from the background, considering only directly connected cells (not diagonally).
3. **Iterate through objects:** The code iterates through each identified object `obj`.
4. **Create bounding box and fill:** `indices = box(toindices(obj))` calculates the bounding box indices for the current object. `result = fill(result, color(obj), indices)` fills the bounding box with the object's color, effectively drawing its outline.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    filled_grid = canvas(bg, shape(I))
    for obj in objs:
        filled_grid = paint(filled_grid, recolor(color(obj), box(toindices(obj))))
    return filled_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background and objects:**  Similar to Version 1, we identify the background color and objects using `mostcolor` and `fgpartition`.
2. **Create blank canvas:** `filled_grid = canvas(bg, shape(I))` generates a grid filled with the background color and the same dimensions as the input.
3. **Iterate and paint outlines:**  The code iterates through each object `obj`, calculates its bounding box using `box(toindices(obj))`, recolors it with the object's color using `recolor`, and then paints this outline onto the blank canvas. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  outlines = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), box(toindices(obj))), objs)
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(outlines))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background and objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Generate outlines:** `outlines = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), box(toindices(obj))), objs)` applies a lambda function to each object that calculates its bounding box and recolors it with the object's color. `mapply` then merges all resulting outlines.
3. **Paint outlines to canvas:** Similar to Version 2, the outlines are painted onto a blank canvas filled with the background color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    filled = I
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] != bg:
                obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda x: (i, j) in toindices(x))
                filled = paint(filled, recolor(color(obj), box(toindices(obj))))
    return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Iterate through cells:** The code iterates through each cell of the grid.
3. **Identify object at cell:** If a cell is not the background color, it identifies the object it belongs to using `extract` and `objects`.
4. **Paint outline:**  Similar to previous versions, the code calculates the object's bounding box, recolors it, and paints it onto the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      color(extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: (i,j) in toindices(obj))) if any(v != bg for v in (I[i][max(0, j-1):j+2] + [I[max(0, i-1)][j]] + [I[min(len(I)-1, i+1)][j]])) else bg
      for j in range(len(I[0]))
    )
    for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Nested loop for cell processing:** The code utilizes nested loops to iterate through each cell in the grid.
3. **Identify object and determine color:**  For each cell, it determines if it's part of an object's outline. If it is, it extracts the object and uses its color for the cell in the output; otherwise, the background color is used.
