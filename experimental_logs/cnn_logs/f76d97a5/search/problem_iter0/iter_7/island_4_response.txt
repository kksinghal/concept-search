## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied in all input-output pairs follows a consistent logic:

1. **Identify the dominant object:** The object with the highest frequency of a particular digit in the input grid.
2. **Create a blank canvas:** Generate a new grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background value (0 in this case).
3. **Paint the dominant object:** Place the dominant object identified in step 1 onto the blank canvas, preserving its shape and position.

**Example (Input_0 to Output_0):**

1. The dominant object in Input_0 is the '5's, forming a plus-shaped object.
2. A 3x3 canvas filled with '0's is created.
3. The plus-shaped object formed by '5's in the input is painted onto the canvas, resulting in Output_0.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the DSL:

**Version 1 (Inspired by Program_B):**

```python
def solve_8eb1be9a(grid):
    objs = objects(grid, T, T, F) # Get all objects in the grid
    dominant_obj = argmax(objs, lambda obj: colorcount(obj, mostcolor(obj))) # Find the object with the most frequent color
    return paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), dominant_obj) # Paint the dominant object on a blank canvas
```

**Explanation:** This version directly leverages the logic from Program_B but improves object selection. Instead of simply choosing the largest object, it uses `argmax` with a custom function to identify the object with the most frequent color within itself. This ensures the dominant object is selected even if it's not the largest in terms of cell count.

**Version 2 (Combining approaches):**

```python
def solve_8eb1be9a(grid):
    dominant_color = mostcolor(grid)  # Find the most frequent color in the grid
    dominant_obj = extract(objects(grid, T, T, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == dominant_color) # Extract the object with the dominant color
    return paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), dominant_obj) # Paint the extracted object on a blank canvas 
```

**Explanation:** Version 2 first determines the dominant color in the grid using `mostcolor`. It then efficiently extracts the corresponding object from all objects identified using `objects`. Finally, it paints this object onto a blank canvas.

**Version 3 (Prioritizing color over size):**

```python
def solve_8eb1be9a(grid):
    color_counts = {v: colorcount(grid, v) for v in palette(grid)} # Count occurrences of each color
    dominant_color = argmax(color_counts, lambda k: color_counts[k]) # Find the most frequent color
    dominant_obj = extract(objects(grid, T, T, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == dominant_color) # Extract the object with that color
    return paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), dominant_obj) # Paint it on a blank canvas
```

**Explanation:** This version prioritizes color frequency explicitly. It counts the occurrences of each color in the grid and then finds the most frequent one. The object with this dominant color is then extracted and painted onto a blank canvas.

**Version 4 (Using partition for efficiency):**

```python
def solve_8eb1be9a(grid):
    dominant_color = mostcolor(grid)  # Find the most frequent color
    dominant_obj = extract(partition(grid), lambda obj: color(obj) == dominant_color)  # Directly extract the object using partition
    return paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), dominant_obj) # Paint the extracted object on a blank canvas
```

**Explanation:** Version 4 leverages the `partition` function for efficient object extraction. Since `partition` directly groups cells based on their color, it directly extracts the object corresponding to the dominant color, eliminating the need for filtering through all objects.

**Version 5 (Compact one-liner):**

```python
def solve_8eb1be9a(grid):
    return paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), extract(partition(grid), lambda obj: color(obj) == mostcolor(grid))) # One-liner combining all steps
```

**Explanation:** This version demonstrates the power of DSL composition by condensing the entire logic into a single line. It combines `partition`, `extract`, `mostcolor`, `canvas`, and `paint` to achieve the desired transformation efficiently.


Each version showcases a different approach to solving the problem while remaining faithful to the identified transformation logic and utilizing the provided DSL functions effectively.
