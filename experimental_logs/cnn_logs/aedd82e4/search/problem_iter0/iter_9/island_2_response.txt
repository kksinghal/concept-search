## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify the bottom-most cell of the rightmost object in the input grid and change its value to '1'. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

* **Input_0:** The rightmost object consists of '2's. The bottom-most cell of this object is at the bottom right corner. This cell's value changes from '2' to '1'.
* **Input_1:** The rightmost object is the single '1' at the bottom right corner. Since it's already a single cell, only its value changes from '2' to '1'.
* **Input_2:** Similar to Input_0, the bottom-most cell of the rightmost '2' object changes to '1'.
* **Input_3:** The bottom-most cell of the rightmost object (again, formed by '2's) changes to '1'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each using different logic and DSL function combinations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_60b61512(I):
  # Find the rightmost object
  obj = max(objects(I, T, T, T), key=lambda obj: rightmost(obj))
  # Find the bottom-most cell within the object
  target_cell = max(obj, key=lambda cell: cell[1][0])
  # Change the value of the target cell to 1
  O = fill(I, 1, {target_cell[1]})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the rightmost object:** We use `objects` to get all objects and then use `max` with `rightmost` as the key to find the rightmost one.
2. **Find the bottom-most cell:** We iterate through the object's cells using `max` with the row index (`cell[1][0]`) as the key to find the bottom-most cell.
3. **Change the cell value:**  Finally, we use `fill` to change the value of the target cell to '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_60b61512(I):
  # Find indices of all non-background cells
  indices = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, mostcommon(I)))
  # Find the rightmost, bottom-most index
  target_index = max(indices, key=lambda idx: (idx[1], idx[0]))
  # Change the value at the target index to 1
  O = fill(I, 1, {target_index})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find non-background indices:** We use `asindices` to get all indices and `ofcolor` with `mostcommon` to get background indices. Then, we use `difference` to get indices of non-background cells.
2. **Find the target index:**  We use `max` with a custom key that prioritizes column index (`idx[1]`) and then row index (`idx[0]`) to find the rightmost, bottom-most index.
3. **Change the cell value:**  Finally, we use `fill` to change the value at the target index to '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_60b61512(I):
  for i in range(height(I)-1,-1,-1):
    for j in range(width(I)-1,-1,-1):
      if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I):
        return fill(I, 1, {(i,j)})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate from bottom-right:** This version directly iterates through the grid from the bottom-right corner.
2. **Find the first non-background cell:** The loop stops when it encounters the first non-background cell.
3. **Change the cell value:**  We use `fill` to change the value of this cell to '1' and return the modified grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_60b61512(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  # Iterate through rows from bottom to top
  for i in range(h-1, -1, -1):
    # Iterate through columns from right to left
    for j in range(w-1, -1, -1):
      # Check if the cell is not the background color
      if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I):
        # Create a new grid with the target cell's value changed to 1
        return tuple(tuple(1 if (row_index == i and col_index == j) else I[row_index][col_index] for col_index in range(w)) for row_index in range(h))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate from bottom-right:** This version iterates through the grid from the bottom-right corner similar to Version 3.
2. **Find the first non-background cell:** The loop stops when it encounters the first non-background cell.
3. **Construct the output grid:** Instead of using `fill`, this version directly constructs a new grid with the target cell's value changed to 1.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_60b61512(I):
    # Rotate the grid by 180 degrees
    rotated_grid = rot180(I)
    # Find the top-leftmost non-background cell in the rotated grid
    target_cell = next(((i,j) for i in range(height(rotated_grid)) for j in range(width(rotated_grid)) if rotated_grid[i][j] != mostcommon(rotated_grid)), None)
    # If a target cell is found
    if target_cell:
        # Calculate the target cell's position in the original grid
        target_row = height(I) - target_cell[0] - 1
        target_col = width(I) - target_cell[1] - 1
        # Fill the target cell in the original grid with 1
        return fill(I, 1, {(target_row, target_col)})
    # If no target cell is found, return the original grid
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Rotate the grid:** This version rotates the grid by 180 degrees using `rot180`.
2. **Find the top-leftmost non-background cell:** In the rotated grid, we search for the top-leftmost non-background cell, which corresponds to the bottom-rightmost non-background cell in the original grid.
3. **Calculate the target cell's position:** We calculate the corresponding cell position in the original grid.
4. **Change the cell value:** Finally, we use `fill` to change the value of the target cell in the original grid to '1'.


These five program versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation. Each version utilizes different functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility and versatility of the provided DSL.
