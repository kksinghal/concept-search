## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific objects in the grid and changing the color of a single cell within them. The target cell seems to be related to the position of other objects of the same color within the grid.

**Input 0:** 
- The bottom-right '2' of the largest object is changed to '1'.

**Input 1:** 
- The bottom-right '2' of both smaller objects are changed to '1'.

**Input 2:**
- The bottom-right '2' of the object in the middle is changed to '1'.

**Input 3:**
- The bottom '2' of both objects are changed to '1'.

##  Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # Extract all objects
  for obj in objs:
    if size(obj) > 1: # Only consider objects with more than one cell
      corner_index = lrcorner(obj) # Find the bottom-right corner
      O = fill(I, ONE, {corner_index}) # Fill the corner with '1'
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Identifies all connected objects in the grid.
2. **Filter Objects:** Considers only objects with more than one cell.
3. **Find Corner:** Determines the bottom-right corner of each object.
4. **Fill Corner:**  Changes the color of the corner cell to '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  target_indices = {lrcorner(obj) for obj in objs if size(obj)>1}
  O = fill(I, ONE, target_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Identifies all connected objects in the grid.
2. **Find Corners:** Uses a set comprehension to collect bottom-right corners of all objects larger than one cell.
3. **Fill Corners:** Fills all collected corner indices with '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if i+1 < len(I) and j+1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j] == I[i+1][j] == I[i][j+1] == I[i+1][j+1]:
        O = fill(O, ONE, {(i+1, j+1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over Cells:** Iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check for 2x2 Square:** For each cell, checks if it forms the top-left corner of a 2x2 square with the same color.
3. **Fill Corner:** If a 2x2 square is found, fills the bottom-right corner with '1'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_corner(i, j):
    return  i+1 < len(I) and j+1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j] == I[i+1][j] == I[i][j+1] == I[i+1][j+1]
  O = fill(I, ONE, {(i+1,j+1) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0])) if is_corner(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Helper Function:** Defines a function `is_corner` to check if a cell is the top-left corner of a 2x2 square.
2. **Find and Fill Corners:** Uses a set comprehension to find all bottom-right corners of 2x2 squares and fills them with '1'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)-1, 0, -1):
    for j in range(len(I[0])-1, 0, -1):
      if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I) and I[i][j] == I[i-1][j] and I[i][j] == I[i][j-1]:
        O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})
        break
    else:
      continue
    break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate from Bottom-Right:** Iterates through the grid from the bottom-right corner.
2. **Check for Corner:**  Checks if the current cell is not the background color and has the same color as its top and left neighbors.
3. **Fill and Break:** If a corner is found, it fills the cell with '1' and exits both loops.
