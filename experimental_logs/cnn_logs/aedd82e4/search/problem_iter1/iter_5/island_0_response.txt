## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific objects in the bottom half of the grid and changing the color of their rightmost cell to 1. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

- The bottom half contains only one object (value 0). 
- The rightmost cell of this object is changed to 1.

**Input_1:**

- The bottom half contains two objects (value 2 and 0).
- The rightmost cell of both these objects is changed to 1.

**Input_2:**

- The bottom half contains three objects (value 2, 0, and 2).
- The rightmost cell of these objects is changed to 1.

**Input_3:**

- The bottom half contains two objects (value 2 and 0).
- The rightmost cell of both these objects is changed to 1.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated":

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  target_indices = set()
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if lowermost(obj) >= h // 2:  # Consider objects in the bottom half
      target_indices.add((lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj)))
  return paint(I, recolor(1, frozenset(target_indices)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Use `objects(I, T, F, F)` to find all connected objects in the grid.
2. **Filter bottom half objects:** Iterate through each object and check if its lowermost row (`lowermost(obj)`) is in the bottom half of the grid (`>= h // 2`).
3. **Get rightmost cells:**  For each object in the bottom half, find its rightmost cell (`(lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj))`) and add it to `target_indices`.
4. **Recolor and paint:** Recolor the `target_indices` to 1 using `recolor(1, frozenset(target_indices))` and paint them onto the original grid using `paint`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  target_indices = set()
  for i in range(h // 2, h):
    row = I[i]
    for j in range(len(row) - 1, -1, -1):
      if row[j] != mostcolor(I):
        target_indices.add((i, j))
        break
  return paint(I, recolor(1, frozenset(target_indices)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through bottom half rows:**  Loop through each row in the bottom half of the grid.
2. **Find rightmost non-background cell:** For each row, iterate through its cells from right to left, stopping at the first cell that doesn't match the background color (`mostcolor(I)`). 
3. **Add to target indices:** Add the coordinates of this cell to `target_indices`.
4. **Recolor and paint:**  Similar to version 1, recolor the `target_indices` to 1 and paint them onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(1, mpapply(
      lambda i, r: (i + height(I) // 2, rightmost(asindices(r))), 
      interval(0, height(I) // 2, 1), 
      bottomhalf(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Split into bottom half:**  Extract the bottom half of the grid using `bottomhalf(I)`.
2. **Get rightmost indices:** Use `mpapply` with `rightmost(asindices(r))` to get the rightmost index of each row in the bottom half.
3. **Adjust row indices:** Add `height(I) // 2` to each row index to account for the offset caused by extracting the bottom half.
4. **Recolor and paint:**  Recolor the resulting indices to 1 and paint them onto the original grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  return paint(I, recolor(1, frozenset(
      (i, rightmost(asindices(I[i]))) for i in range(h // 2, h))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through bottom half rows:**  Loop through each row index in the bottom half of the grid.
2. **Get rightmost index:** Find the rightmost index of each row using `rightmost(asindices(I[i]))`.
3. **Create target indices:**  Combine the row index and rightmost column index to create a set of target indices.
4. **Recolor and paint:**  Recolor the `target_indices` to 1 and paint them onto the original grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  return paint(I, recolor(1, frozenset(
      (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj)) 
      for obj in objects(I, T, F, F) if uppermost(obj) >= h // 2)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  Find all connected objects in the grid using `objects(I, T, F, F)`.
2. **Filter bottom half objects:** Iterate through each object and check if its uppermost row (`uppermost(obj)`) is in the bottom half of the grid (`>= h // 2`).
3. **Get bottom-right corners:** For each object in the bottom half, find its bottom-right corner (`(lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj))`) and add it to a set.
4. **Recolor and paint:** Recolor the set of bottom-right corners to 1 and paint them onto the original grid.
