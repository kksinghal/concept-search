## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the '2' digit objects and aims to replace a specific '2' within each object with a '1'. The target '2' for replacement exhibits the following characteristics:

* **Rightmost '2':** The target '2' is always located within the rightmost column of the '2' object.
* **Bottom-most (if multiple):** If multiple '2's exist in the rightmost column of an object, the target for replacement is the bottom-most one.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)  # Extract all objects from the grid
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == TWO:  # Focus on objects made of '2'
      rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)  # Find the rightmost column index
      target_cell = argmax(obj, lambda x: x[1][0] if x[1][1] == rightmost_j else -1)  # Get bottom-most cell in the rightmost column
      I = paint(I, recolor(ONE, initset(target_cell[1])))  # Recolor and paint back
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, False)` isolates all distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate & Filter:**  The program iterates through each object, focusing on those with `color(obj) == TWO`.
3. **Find Target Cell:**  `rightmost(obj)` determines the rightmost column. `argmax` with a custom key finds the bottom-most cell in that column.
4. **Recolor & Paint:** The target cell is recolored to '1' using `recolor`, and `paint` applies the change to the grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  for j in range(len(I[0])-1,-1,-1): # Iterate through columns from right to left
    for i in range(len(I)-1,-1,-1): # Iterate through rows from bottom to top
      if I[i][j] == TWO:
        I = paint(I, recolor(ONE, initset((i,j)))) # Recolor to 1 and paint
        return I # Exit after the first replacement
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate from Right-Bottom:** The program iterates through columns from right to left and rows from bottom to top, prioritizing the bottom-right corner.
2. **Find & Replace:** Upon encountering a '2', it immediately replaces it with a '1' using `recolor` and `paint`.
3. **Early Exit:** The function returns the modified grid after the first replacement, ensuring only one '2' is changed per object.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(ONE, initset(extract(asobject(I), lambda x: x[0] == TWO and x[1][1] == valmax(sfilter(asobject(I), lambda x: x[0] == TWO), lambda x: x[1][1]))[1])))
```

**Explanation:**

This version compresses the logic into a single line:

1. **Object Conversion & Filtering:** `asobject(I)` converts the grid into an object representation. `sfilter` isolates cells containing '2'.
2. **Finding Rightmost '2':** `valmax` with a custom key extracts the cell with the maximum column index (rightmost) among the '2' cells.
3. **Recoloring & Painting:**  Similar to previous versions, `recolor` changes the target cell's value to '1', and `paint` applies it to the grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  for j in range(w-1, -1, -1): # Iterate columns from right to left
    for i in range(h): # Iterate through rows
      if I[i][j] == TWO: 
        I = paint(I, recolor(ONE, initset((i, j)))) # Replace the '2'
        break # Move to the next column after replacement
    else: # This block executes if the loop completes without finding a '2' in the current column
      continue # Continue to the next column
    break # Exit the outer loop after a replacement
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes nested loops with breaks for efficiency:

1. **Iterate Columns & Rows:**  It iterates through columns from right to left and then rows within each column.
2. **Find and Replace:** Upon finding a '2', it replaces it with '1' and breaks the inner loop to move to the next column.
3. **Early Exit:**  The `else` block ensures that the outer loop breaks after a replacement, preventing unnecessary iterations.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  def condition(x):
   return x[0] == TWO and x[1][1] == max(j for v, (i, j) in asobject(I) if v == TWO)
  return paint(I, recolor(ONE, initset(extract(asobject(I), condition)[1])))
```

**Explanation:**

This version emphasizes code readability by extracting the complex condition into a separate function:

1. **Condition Function:**  The `condition` function checks if a cell contains a '2' and if it's in the rightmost column of the '2' object.
2. **Object Processing:** The main function converts the grid to an object, extracts the target cell using the `condition`, recolors it to '1', and paints it back to the grid.


## Code Extraction:

You can copy any of the `program_v1` to `program_v5` code blocks directly into your environment. Each version represents a distinct solution to the problem using the provided DSL.
