## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently targets the rightmost occurrence of the digit '2' in the input grid and replaces it with the digit '1'. 

**Let's break down each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0:** The rightmost '2' at position (1,2) is changed to '1'.
* **Input_1:** The rightmost '2' at position (2,3) is changed to '1'.
* **Input_2:** The rightmost '2' at position (3,3) is changed to '1'.
* **Input_3:** The rightmost '2' at position (1,2) is changed to '1'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  def rightmost_2_index(obj):
    return argmax(toindices(obj), lambda x: x[1]) # Find rightmost index in object
  
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False) # Get connected objects
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2: # Check if object is made of '2'
      rightmost_index = rightmost_2_index(obj) 
      I = paint(I, recolor(1, frozenset({rightmost_index}))) # Change rightmost '2' to '1'
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **rightmost_2_index(obj):**  This helper function takes an object and returns the index of the rightmost cell (maximum column index).
2. **objects(I, True, False, False):**  Identifies all connected components ('2's forming a contiguous shape) in the grid.
3. **Iterate through objects:** For each object, it checks if its color (value) is '2'.
4. **If color is '2':** It finds the rightmost index within the object, creates a new object with '1' at that index, and paints it onto the grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  for j in range(len(I[0])-1, -1, -1): # Iterate columns right to left
    for i in range(len(I)): # Iterate rows
      if I[i][j] == 2: 
        I = paint(I, recolor(1, frozenset({(i, j)}))) # Change '2' to '1'
        return I # Exit after first replacement
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns (right to left):** This ensures we find the rightmost '2' first.
2. **Iterate through rows:** For each cell in the column, it checks if the value is '2'.
3. **If value is '2':** It changes that '2' to '1' and immediately exits the function (ensuring only one replacement).

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  rightmost_index =  extract(asobject(I), lambda x: x[0] == 2 and x[1][1] == max(j for v, (i, j) in asobject(I) if v == 2))[1]
  return paint(I, recolor(1, frozenset({rightmost_index})))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **asobject(I):**  Converts the grid into an object representation.
2. **extract(...):** Finds the rightmost '2' by selecting the cell with value '2' and the maximum column index (j).
3. **recolor(1, frozenset({rightmost_index})):** Creates a new object with '1' at the rightmost '2' index.
4. **paint(...):** Paints this new object onto the original grid. 

**Program Version 4**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  def rightmost_index(obj):
    return argmax(obj, lambda x: x[1][1])[1]  # Directly find the rightmost index

  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  rightmost_2s = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2 and size(obj) > 0)  # Filter for objects with '2'
  rightmost_indices = apply(rightmost_index, rightmost_2s) # Extract the rightmost indices from the objects
  return paint(I, recolor(1, frozenset(rightmost_indices)))  # Recolor and paint
```

**Explanation:**

1. **rightmost_index(obj):** Helper function to find the rightmost cell's index within an object.
2. **objects(..., True, False, False):**  Gets connected components of '2's.
3. **mfilter(...):**  Filters for objects that contain the digit '2'.
4. **apply(rightmost_index, rightmost_2s):** Applies the `rightmost_index` function to each object, extracting the rightmost cell index from each.
5. **recolor(1, ...):** Creates a new object with '1' at each extracted index.
6. **paint(...):**  Overlays the new object onto the original grid, effectively changing the rightmost '2's to '1's.

**Program Version 5**
```python
def program_v5(I):
  def rightmost_cell(obj):
    return max(obj, key=lambda x: x[1][1])  # Find the rightmost cell

  objs = objects(I, True, False, False) 
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      rightmost = rightmost_cell(obj) 
      I = paint(I, recolor(1, frozenset({rightmost[1]}))) # Change rightmost '2' to '1'
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **rightmost_cell(obj):** Helper function to directly find the rightmost cell (value and index) within an object.
2. **objects(I, True, False, False):** Identifies connected components of '2's.
3. **Iterate through objects:** For each object, checks if its color (value) is '2'.
4. **If color is '2':** Finds the rightmost cell in the object, extracts its index, and uses `recolor` and `paint` to change the rightmost '2' to '1'.


These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformation. They showcase the flexibility of the DSL and provide a range of options for solving the problem.
