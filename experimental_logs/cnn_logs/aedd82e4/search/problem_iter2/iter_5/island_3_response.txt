## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects composed of the digit '2' and aims to change the rightmost '2' in each object to a '1'. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**
- The rightmost '2' in the object is replaced with a '1'.

**Input_1:**
- The rightmost '2' in both objects is replaced with a '1'.

**Input_2:**
-  The rightmost '2' in each of the three objects is replaced with a '1'. 

**Input_3:**
- The rightmost '2' in both objects is replaced with a '1'.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL to achieve the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  def rightmost_cell(obj):
    return argmax(obj, lambda x: x[1][1])  # Find the rightmost cell

  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)  # Extract objects
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2 and size(obj) > 0:  # If the object is made of '2'
      target_cell = rightmost_cell(obj)  # Get the rightmost cell
      I = paint(I, recolor(1, initset(target_cell[1])))  # Recolor and paint
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **rightmost_cell Function:** Finds the rightmost cell within an object by maximizing the column index (x[1][1]).
2. **Object Extraction:** Extracts all objects from the input grid.
3. **Iterate and Recolor:** Iterates through each object. If the object is composed of '2', it identifies the rightmost cell using the `rightmost_cell` function, recolors it to '1', and paints it back onto the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  def rightmost_indices(objs):
    return mapply(lambda obj: argmax(obj, lambda x: x[1][1])[1], 
                  sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2 and size(obj) > 0))

  return paint(I, recolor(1, rightmost_indices(objects(I, True, False, False))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **rightmost_indices Function:** This function takes a set of objects and returns a set of indices corresponding to the rightmost cell of each object that is composed of '2'. 
2. **One-liner Transformation:** It extracts objects, filters for those made of '2', finds rightmost indices, recolors those indices to '1', and paints them back onto the grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  for j in range(len(I[0])-1, -1, -1):  # Iterate columns right to left
    for i in range(len(I)):
      if I[i][j] == 2:
        I = paint(I, recolor(1, initset((i, j))))
        break  # Move to the next column
    else:
      continue  # Continue to the next column
    break  # Exit the outer loop 
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Columns:** Iterates through columns from right to left.
2. **Find and Replace:** Within each column, it searches for the first occurrence of '2'. If found, it recolors that cell to '1' and moves to the next column. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  def process_row(row, j_offset):
    try:
      j = row.index(2)  # Find the first '2' in the row
      return (j + j_offset,)  # Return the index if found
    except ValueError:
      return ()  # Return empty if no '2' is found

  indices_to_recolor = ()
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    indices_to_recolor += process_row(row, 0)

  return paint(I, recolor(1, frozenset(indices_to_recolor)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **process_row Function:** Takes a row and an offset, finds the index of the first '2' in the row, and returns the adjusted index based on the offset.
2. **Row-wise Processing:** Iterates through each row, finds the rightmost '2', and stores its index.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** Finally, it recolors the collected indices to '1' and paints them onto the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  def rightmost_2_in_obj(obj):
    return extract(obj, lambda cell: cell[0] == 2 and cell[1][1] == rightmost(obj)[1])

  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  rightmost_2s = apply(rightmost_2_in_obj, sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2 and size(obj) > 0))
  return paint(I, recolor(1, frozenset(index[1] for index in rightmost_2s)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **rightmost_2_in_obj Function:** This function finds the rightmost cell containing '2' within a given object. 
2. **Filtering and Applying:** The code extracts all objects, filters for those containing '2', applies the `rightmost_2_in_obj` function to each, and finally recolors and paints the identified cells. 

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressive power of the provided DSL.
