## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the smallest object made of the digit '2' and changes the color of its bottom-rightmost cell to '1'. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

* **Input_0:** The smallest '2' object is at the top-right corner. Its bottom-rightmost cell is changed to '1'.
* **Input_1:**  The smallest '2' object is at the bottom-right corner. Its bottom-rightmost cell is changed to '1'.
* **Input_2:** The smallest '2' object is on the right edge, second from the bottom. Its bottom-rightmost cell (originally a '1') is changed to '2'.
* **Input_3:** The smallest '2' object is at the top-right corner. Its bottom-rightmost cell is changed to '1'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Extract all objects
  twos = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == TWO)  # Filter for objects with color '2'
  if len(twos) > 0:  # Proceed if there are '2' objects
    smallest = argmin(twos, size)  # Find the smallest '2' object
    corner = lrcorner(smallest)  # Find the bottom-right corner
    return fill(I, ONE, {corner})  # Change the corner to '1'
  return I  # Return the original grid if no '2' objects exist
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify all distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Filter by Color:** Isolate objects made solely of the digit '2'.
3. **Find Smallest:** Determine the smallest object within the filtered set.
4. **Locate Corner:** Find the bottom-right corner cell of the smallest object.
5. **Change Color:**  Fill the corner cell with the value '1'.
6. **Handle Missing Objects:** If no '2' objects exist, return the original grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def obj_corner(obj):
    return lrcorner(obj), size(obj) # Return corner and size for sorting

  objs = sorted(objects(I, T, F, F), key=obj_corner) # Sort objects by corner, then size
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == TWO:
      return fill(I, ONE, {lrcorner(obj)})
  return I 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sort Objects:**  Sort all objects first by their bottom-right corner index, then by size. This ensures the smallest object with the largest corner index is processed first.
2. **Iterate and Modify:** Loop through the sorted objects. Upon finding a '2' object, immediately change its bottom-right corner to '1' and return the modified grid.
3. **Handle Missing Objects:** If no '2' object is encountered during iteration, return the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if color(obj) == TWO and size(obj) == minimum(sfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda x: color(x) == TWO), size):
      return fill(I, ONE, {lrcorner(obj)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Objects:** Loop through each object in the grid.
2. **Check Color and Size:** For each object, verify if its color is '2' and if its size matches the size of the smallest '2' object in the grid.
3. **Modify and Return:** If both conditions are met, change the bottom-right corner of the current object to '1' and return the modified grid.
4. **Handle Missing Objects:** If no matching object is found, return the original grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def corner_priority(obj):
    i, j = lrcorner(obj)
    return i * 100 + j # Prioritize corners by row then column

  objs = sorted(objects(I, T, F, F), key=corner_priority) # Sort by corner priority
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == TWO:
      return fill(I, ONE, {lrcorner(obj)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Prioritize Corners:** Define a function to prioritize corners by giving higher weight to lower rows and then to rightmost columns.
2. **Sort by Priority:** Sort all objects based on their bottom-right corner priority.
3. **Iterate and Modify:** Loop through the sorted objects. On encountering a '2' object, modify its bottom-right corner to '1' and return the grid.
4. **Handle Missing Objects:** If no '2' object is found, return the original grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_smallest_two(obj, objs):
    return color(obj) == TWO and all(size(obj) <= size(o) for o in objs if color(o) == TWO)

  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  for obj in objs:
    if is_smallest_two(obj, objs):
      return fill(I, ONE, {lrcorner(obj)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Helper Function:** Create a function `is_smallest_two` to check if an object is the smallest among those with color '2'.
2. **Iterate and Check:** Iterate through each object in the grid. For each object, determine if it's the smallest '2' object using the helper function.
3. **Modify and Return:** If the current object is the smallest '2' object, change its bottom-right corner to '1' and return the modified grid.
4. **Handle Missing Objects:** If no smallest '2' object is found, return the original grid.
