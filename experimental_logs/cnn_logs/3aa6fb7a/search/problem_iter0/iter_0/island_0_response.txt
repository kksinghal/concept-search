## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify the cells directly adjacent to the main object (excluding diagonal adjacency and background cells) and change their value to 1.

**Example Breakdown:**

- **Input_0:** The main object consists of the digit '8'. The cells directly above, below, left, and right of the '8's are changed to '1' in the output. 
- **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the cells directly adjacent to the '8' object are transformed into '1's.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_XXXXXXXXX(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify objects, excluding background
  deltas = mapply(delta, objs)  # Get cells surrounding each object
  filtered_deltas = mfilter(deltas, lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0) # Filter cells with value 0
  O = fill(I, 1, filtered_deltas)  # Fill the filtered cells with 1
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **`mapply(delta, x1)`:** Calculates the delta (surrounding cells) for each identified object.
3. **`mfilter(x2, lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0)`:**  Filters the delta cells to include only those with the value '0' in the original grid.
4. **`fill(I, 1, x3)`:** Fills the filtered cells with the value '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_XXXXXXXXX(I):
  obj = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify objects, excluding background
  surrounding_cells =  frozenset.union(*[dneighbors(cell) for obj in obj for _, cell in obj])
  filtered_cells = sfilter(surrounding_cells, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 0)
  O = fill(I, 1, filtered_cells)  # Fill the filtered cells with 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **`frozenset.union(*[dneighbors(cell) for obj in obj for _, cell in obj])`:** Extracts the neighboring cells of each cell in each object.
3. **`sfilter(surrounding_cells, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 0)`:** Filters the surrounding cells to ensure they are within the grid boundaries and have a value of '0'.
4. **`fill(I, 1, filtered_cells)`:** Fills the filtered cells with the value '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_XXXXXXXXX(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        for _, (i, j) in obj:
            for di, dj in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
                ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] == 0:
                    O = fill(O, 1, {(ni, nj)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initialize the output grid `O` with the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):`:** Iterate through each object in the input grid, excluding the background.
3. **`for _, (i, j) in obj:`:** For each cell `(i, j)` in the current object.
4. **`for di, dj in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:`:** Check the four neighboring cells (up, down, left, right).
5. **`ni, nj = i + di, j + dj`:** Calculate the coordinates `(ni, nj)` of the neighboring cell.
6. **`if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] == 0:`:**  If the neighboring cell is within the grid boundaries and its value is '0'.
7. **`O = fill(O, 1, {(ni, nj)})`:** Fill the neighboring cell with the value '1' in the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_XXXXXXXXX(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify objects, excluding background
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        for x in range(1, width(obj) - 1):
            O = fill(O, 1, {(uppermost(obj) - 1, leftmost(obj) + x)})
            O = fill(O, 1, {(lowermost(obj) + 1, leftmost(obj) + x)})
        for y in range(1, height(obj) - 1):
            O = fill(O, 1, {(uppermost(obj) + y, leftmost(obj) - 1)})
            O = fill(O, 1, {(uppermost(obj) + y, rightmost(obj) + 1)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **`O = I`:** Initialize the output grid `O` with the input grid `I`.
3. **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterate through each identified object.
4. **`for x in range(1, width(obj) - 1):`:** Iterate through the columns of the object, excluding the first and last columns.
5. **`O = fill(O, 1, {(uppermost(obj) - 1, leftmost(obj) + x)})`:** Fill the cell above the current column with '1'.
6. **`O = fill(O, 1, {(lowermost(obj) + 1, leftmost(obj) + x)})`:** Fill the cell below the current column with '1'.
7. **`for y in range(1, height(obj) - 1):`:** Iterate through the rows of the object, excluding the first and last rows.
8. **`O = fill(O, 1, {(uppermost(obj) + y, leftmost(obj) - 1)})`:** Fill the cell left of the current row with '1'.
9. **`O = fill(O, 1, {(uppermost(obj) + y, rightmost(obj) + 1)})`:** Fill the cell right of the current row with '1'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_XXXXXXXXX(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] != 0:
                for di, dj in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] == 0:
                        O = fill(O, 1, {(ni, nj)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initialize the output grid `O` with the input grid `I`.
2. **`for i in range(len(I)):`:** Iterate through each row `i` in the grid.
3. **`for j in range(len(I[0])):`:**  Iterate through each column `j` in the current row.
4. **`if I[i][j] != 0:`:** If the current cell is not a background cell (value is not '0').
5. **`for di, dj in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:`:**  Check the four neighboring cells (up, down, left, right).
6. **`ni, nj = i + di, j + dj`:** Calculate the coordinates `(ni, nj)` of the neighboring cell.
7. **`if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] == 0:`:** If the neighboring cell is within the grid boundaries and its value is '0'.
8. **`O = fill(O, 1, {(ni, nj)})`:** Fill the neighboring cell with the value '1' in the output grid `O`.
