## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the corner cells of objects formed by the digit '8' and changing their value to '1'. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
* The object formed by '8's has four corner cells. 
* These corner cells at (1,1), (2,2), (3,5) and (4,4) are changed to '1'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
* This input has two separate objects formed by the digit '8'.
* The top-right object has corners at (0,5), (0,6), (1,6) and (2,5) which are changed to '1'.
* The bottom-left object has corners at (5,3), (6,3), (6,4) and (5,4), all changed to '1'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation.

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    # Identify all '8' cells.
    x1 = ofcolor(I, EIGHT) 
    # Generate objects from the '8' cells.
    x2 = objects(fill(I, EIGHT, x1), T, F, F)  
    # Find the corner indices of each object.
    x3 = mapply(corners, x2)
    # Change the corner cell values to '1'.
    O = fill(I, ONE, x3)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **x1:** Identifies the indices of all cells containing the value '8'.
2. **x2:** Creates a grid by filling all cells in the input grid (I) with '8' at the indices in 'x1'. Then, it identifies objects in this new grid, considering diagonally connected cells as part of the same object. This ensures all '8's forming a single object are grouped.
3. **x3:** Applies the `corners` function to each object in 'x2', obtaining the corner indices for each object.
4. **O:** Fills the original input grid (I) with the value '1' at the corner indices stored in 'x3'.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    # Find indices of all '8' cells.
    x1 = ofcolor(I, EIGHT)
    # Create objects from '8' cells.
    x2 = objects(fill(I, EIGHT, x1), T, F, F)
    # Get the bounding box for each object.
    x3 = mapply(box, x2)
    # Find the intersection of object cells and their bounding boxes, which are the corner cells.
    x4 = mapply(intersection, pair(x2, x3))
    # Change the value of corner cells to '1'.
    O = fill(I, ONE, mapply(toindices, x4))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **x1 & x2:** Similar to version 1, this identifies '8' cell indices and groups them into objects.
2. **x3:** Computes the bounding box for each object using the `box` function, which returns the indices outlining each object.
3. **x4:**  Finds the intersection between each object's cells and its bounding box. The intersection points will always be the corner cells of the object.
4. **O:** Extracts indices from the intersection sets and fills the corresponding cells in the original input grid with '1'.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    # Identify '8' cells and create objects.
    x1 = objects(I, T, F, F)
    # Filter for objects containing '8'.
    x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda o: color(o) == EIGHT)
    # Extract corner indices of each object.
    x3 = mapply(corners, x2)
    # Modify the corner cells to '1'.
    O = fill(I, ONE, x3)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **x1:**  Directly identifies all objects in the input grid, including diagonally connected cells.
2. **x2:** Filters the objects, keeping only those where the object's color (value) is '8'.
3. **x3 & O:** Similar to previous versions, it extracts corner indices and modifies the grid accordingly.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    # Create a grid where only '8' cells are kept, others replaced by '0'.
    x1 = replace(I, ZERO, EIGHT) 
    # Identify objects in this modified grid.
    x2 = objects(x1, T, F, F)
    # Get corner indices for each object.
    x3 = mapply(corners, x2)
    # Change values at corner indices to '1' in the original grid.
    O = fill(I, ONE, x3) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **x1:** Replaces all '0' values in the grid with '8', creating a grid with only '8's and the original values.
2. **x2:** Identifies objects in this modified grid. This implicitly groups '8' cells.
3. **x3 & O:**  Extracts corner indices and modifies the original input grid as before.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    # Find '8' cell indices.
    x1 = ofcolor(I, EIGHT)
    # Generate all possible pairs of '8' cells.
    x2 = prapply(astuple, x1, x1)
    # Filter pairs that represent corners of a rectangle.
    x3 = sfilter(x2, lambda p: abs(p[0][0] - p[1][0]) == abs(p[0][1] - p[1][1]) and p[0][0] != p[1][0]) 
    # Extract the corner indices.
    x4 = mapply(lambda p: frozenset(p), x3)
    # Fill the corner cells with '1'.
    O = fill(I, ONE, x4)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **x1:**  Gets indices of all '8' cells.
2. **x2:** Creates all possible pairs of '8' cell indices.
3. **x3:** Filters these pairs, keeping only those pairs where the difference in row indices equals the difference in column indices, and the row indices are not the same. This identifies pairs representing diagonal corners of a rectangle.
4. **x4 & O:**  Extracts individual corner indices from the filtered pairs and updates the input grid.

These five versions use different approaches and DSL function combinations to achieve the same goal, showcasing diverse solutions to the problem.
