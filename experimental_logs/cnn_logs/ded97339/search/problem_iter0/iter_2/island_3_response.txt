## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids connects all occurrences of the digit '8' that share a row or column, forming a continuous line of '8's. 

**Input_0:** 
- Two horizontal lines of '8's are formed. 
- The top line connects the two '8's in the fourth row.
- The bottom line connects the '8's in the eighth and tenth rows.

**Input_1:** 
- A vertical line of '8's is formed, connecting all occurrences in the seventh column.
- A horizontal line of '8's is formed, connecting the '8's in the seventh row.

**Input_2:** 
- A vertical line of '8's is formed, connecting all occurrences in the second column.
- A horizontal line of '8's is formed, connecting the '8's in the eighth row.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)  
  lines = sfilter(objs, lambda o: hline(o) or vline(o))
  filled = I
  for line in lines:
    filled = fill(filled, EIGHT, toindices(line))
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, False, False, True)` identifies all connected components of non-background digits in the grid.
2. **Filter for lines:** `sfilter(objs, lambda o: hline(o) or vline(o))` selects only the objects that form horizontal or vertical lines.
3. **Fill the lines:** Iterate through each line object and fill the corresponding indices in the grid with the digit '8'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  hconnected = I
  for _ in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[j][j] == EIGHT:
        hconnected = fill(hconnected, EIGHT, {(j, j+1)})
  vconnected = hconnected
  for _ in range(len(I[0])):
    for i in range(len(I) - 1):
      if hconnected[i][i] == EIGHT:
        vconnected = fill(vconnected, EIGHT, {(i+1, i)})
  return vconnected
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Horizontal Connection:** Iterate through the grid row by row. If a cell contains '8', fill the cell to its right with '8'.
2. **Vertical Connection:** Using the horizontally connected grid, iterate column by column. If a cell contains '8', fill the cell below it with '8'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  connected = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    connected = fill(connected, EIGHT, connect(
      extract(ofcolor(I, EIGHT), lambda x: x[0] == i), 
      extract(ofcolor(I, EIGHT), lambda x: x[0] == i, default=(i, len(I[0])))))
  for j in range(len(I[0])):
    connected = fill(connected, EIGHT, connect(
      extract(ofcolor(I, EIGHT), lambda x: x[1] == j), 
      extract(ofcolor(I, EIGHT), lambda x: x[1] == j, default=(len(I), j))))
  return connected
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Horizontal Connection:** For each row, find the leftmost and rightmost occurrences of '8' and connect them using the `connect` function. 
2. **Vertical Connection:** For each column, find the topmost and bottommost occurrences of '8' and connect them using the `connect` function.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h_lines = mfilter(partition(I), lambda obj: hline(obj) and color(obj) == EIGHT)
  v_lines = mfilter(partition(I), lambda obj: vline(obj) and color(obj) == EIGHT)
  connected = I
  for line in h_lines:
    connected = paint(connected, recolor(EIGHT, line))
  for line in v_lines:
    connected = paint(connected, recolor(EIGHT, line))
  return connected
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify '8' lines:** 
   - `partition(I)` divides the grid into objects based on cell value.
   - `mfilter(...)` selects objects that are horizontal or vertical lines containing only '8's.
2. **Paint lines:** 
   - Iterate through the horizontal and vertical lines.
   - `recolor(EIGHT, line)` changes the color of all cells in the line to '8'.
   - `paint(connected, ...)` applies the recolored line to the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  connected = I
  eights = ofcolor(I, EIGHT)
  for loc in eights:
    for d in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]:
      neighbor = add(loc, d)
      if contained(neighbor, eights):
        connected = fill(connected, EIGHT, connect(loc, neighbor))
  return connected
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find all '8's:** `ofcolor(I, EIGHT)` returns the indices of all cells containing '8'.
2. **Connect adjacent '8's:**
   - Iterate through each '8' location.
   - Check its four neighbors (up, down, left, right) for another '8'.
   - If found, connect the two '8's using the `connect` function.
