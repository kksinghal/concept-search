## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation connects all instances of the digit '8' within the grid, creating a continuous line of '8's between them. The connection prioritizes straight lines, either horizontal or vertical. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input 0:** 
- Two horizontal lines of '8's are formed, one connecting the two '8's on the 4th row and another connecting the '8's on the 8th and 10th row.

**Input 1:** 
- A single vertical line of '8's is formed, connecting all the '8's from the 2nd row to the 9th row. Additionally, the two '8's on the 7th row are connected horizontally.

**Input 2:**
-  Similar to Input 1, a vertical line connects all '8's from the 2nd row to the 8th row.  The '8's on the 2nd and 8th row are then further connected horizontally to other '8's on their respective rows. 


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  eights = ofcolor(I, EIGHT)
  connections = frozenset()
  while size(eights) > 1:
    start = first(eights)
    eights = remove(start, eights)
    closest = argmin(eights, lambda loc: manhattan(start, loc))
    connection = connect(start, closest)
    connections = connections | connection
  O = fill(I, EIGHT, connections)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '8' Locations:** `eights = ofcolor(I, EIGHT)` identifies the indices of all cells containing '8'.
2. **Iterative Connection:** The `while` loop iterates as long as there are at least two '8's to connect.
3. **Find Closest '8':**  `closest = argmin(eights, lambda loc: manhattan(start, loc))` finds the '8' closest to the current 'start' '8' using Manhattan distance.
4. **Connect '8's:** `connection = connect(start, closest)` creates a line of indices connecting the 'start' and 'closest' '8'.
5. **Update Connections:**  The `connections` set is updated with the new connection.
6. **Fill Grid:** `O = fill(I, EIGHT, connections)` fills the original grid 'I' with '8's at the connected indices.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objects = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  connections = mpapply(lambda obj: mpapply(connect, toindices(obj), toindices(obj)), objects)
  O = fill(I, EIGHT, connections)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies individual objects in the grid, considering '8' as the only valid object color.
2. **Connect Within Objects:**  The nested `mpapply(connect, toindices(obj), toindices(obj))` connects every pair of indices within each object.
3. **Merge Connections:** `connections = mpapply(...)` merges connections from all objects into a single set.
4. **Fill Grid:** `O = fill(I, EIGHT, connections)` fills the original grid with '8's at the connected indices.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    for _ in range(width(I)):
        I = fill(I, EIGHT, mpapply(connect, ofcolor(I, EIGHT), ofcolor(I, EIGHT)))
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Columns:**  The code iterates through each column of the grid. 
2. **Connect All '8's:** In each iteration, `mpapply(connect, ofcolor(I, EIGHT), ofcolor(I, EIGHT))` connects all pairs of '8's in the grid, effectively creating horizontal lines.
3. **Fill Grid:** `I = fill(I, EIGHT, ...)` updates the grid with the newly connected '8's.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == I[i][j+1] == EIGHT:
        O = fill(O, EIGHT, connect((i,j),(i,j+1)))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for i in range(height(I) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == I[i+1][j] == EIGHT:
        O = fill(O, EIGHT, connect((i,j),(i+1,j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Connect Horizontally:** The first nested loop iterates through each cell and connects horizontally adjacent '8's.
2. **Iterate and Connect Vertically:** The second nested loop iterates through each cell and connects vertically adjacent '8's.
3. **Fill Grid:** In both loops, `O = fill(O, EIGHT, ...)` updates the grid with the connected '8's.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    eights = ofcolor(I, EIGHT)
    while True:
        connections = mpapply(lambda loc1: mpapply(lambda loc2: connect(loc1, loc2) if manhattan(loc1, loc2) == 1 else frozenset(), eights), eights)
        if size(connections) == 0:
            break
        I = fill(I, EIGHT, connections)
        eights = ofcolor(I, EIGHT)
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '8' Locations:** `eights = ofcolor(I, EIGHT)` gets indices of '8' cells.
2. **Iterative Connection:** Loops until no new connections are possible.
3. **Find Adjacent '8's:**  Nested `mpapply` with `manhattan(loc1, loc2) == 1` finds directly adjacent '8's and connects them.
4. **Check for Completion:**  If `size(connections)` is zero (no new connections), the loop breaks.
5. **Update Grid and '8' Locations:** The grid is updated with connections, and 'eights' is recalculated.
