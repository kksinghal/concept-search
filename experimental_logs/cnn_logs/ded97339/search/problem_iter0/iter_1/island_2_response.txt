## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit excluding the background 0) and extending them horizontally or vertically until they hit an existing object or the edge of the grid. 

* **Input_0:** The two single-cell objects (digit 8) are extended horizontally to the right until they hit another object or the grid edge.
* **Input_1:** The single-cell objects are extended vertically downwards until they hit another object or the grid edge. The horizontally aligned object at the bottom remains unchanged.
* **Input_2:** This example combines both horizontal and vertical extensions. The objects are extended in the direction they are already aligned (horizontally or vertically) until they hit another object or the grid edge. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  for obj in objs:
    direction = (1, 0) if hline(obj) else (0, 1)
    for i in range(1, max(h, w)):
      shifted_obj = shift(obj, multiply(i, direction))
      if any(index(I, loc) != bg for loc in toindices(shifted_obj)):
        break
      obj = obj | recolor(color(obj), toindices(shifted_obj))
  return paint(canvas(bg, (h, w)), merge(objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `fgpartition(I)` separates the input grid `I` into objects, excluding the background.
2. **Determine extension direction:** For each object `obj`, `hline(obj)` checks if it's a horizontal line, setting the `direction` to extend rightwards. Otherwise, it extends downwards.
3. **Extend object:**  The loop iterates, shifting the object by `direction` and checking for collisions with other objects using `index(I, loc) != bg`. If a collision occurs, the loop breaks.
4. **Paint objects:** Finally, a blank canvas is created with `canvas(bg, (h, w))`, and all extended objects are painted onto it using `paint`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = difference(partition(I), colorfilter(partition(I), mostcolor(I)))
  new_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    if hline(obj):
      extension = connect(ulcorner(obj), (ulcorner(obj)[0], len(I[0]) - 1))
    else:
      extension = connect(ulcorner(obj), (len(I) - 1, ulcorner(obj)[1]))
    new_objs.add(recolor(color(obj), toindices(obj) | extension))
  return paint(I, merge(new_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify foreground objects:** `objs` is assigned the set of all objects except the background.
2. **Extend objects:** For each object, `hline(obj)` determines if it's horizontal. Based on this, either a horizontal (`extension = connect(...)`) or vertical line is created until the grid edge.
3. **Combine and paint:** The original object and its extension are merged using `|` and recolored. Finally, all objects are painted back onto the input grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  result = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    ul = ulcorner(obj)
    if hline(obj):
      lr = (ul[0], len(I[0]) - 1)
    else:
      lr = (len(I) - 1, ul[1])
    result = paint(result, recolor(color(obj), connect(ul, lr) | toindices(obj)))
  return result
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify foreground objects:** `objs` is assigned the set of all objects except the background.
2. **Create a blank canvas:** `result` is initialized as a blank canvas with the same dimensions and background color as the input.
3. **Extend and paint:**  Iterate through each object, determining its extension direction based on `hline(obj)`. The object and its extension are then painted onto the canvas.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(
    recolor(color(obj), backdrop(obj)) if hline(obj) else 
    recolor(color(obj), backdrop(dmirror(obj)))
    for obj in difference(partition(I), colorfilter(partition(I), mostcolor(I))))
)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify foreground objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Extend objects:** For each object, `hline(obj)` determines its orientation. If horizontal, `backdrop(obj)` is used to get indices within its bounding box. If vertical, the object is mirrored diagonally with `dmirror(obj)` before applying `backdrop`.
3. **Paint objects:**  The objects are recolored and combined, then painted onto the input grid.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  def extend_obj(obj):
    if hline(obj): return recolor(color(obj), {(i, j) for i, j in product(range(height(I)), {ulcorner(obj)[1]})})
    return recolor(color(obj), {(i, j) for i, j in product({ulcorner(obj)[0]}, range(width(I)))})

  return paint(I, merge(apply(extend_obj, difference(partition(I), colorfilter(partition(I), mostcolor(I))))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify foreground objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Define `extend_obj` function:**  This function takes an object as input and returns the object extended either horizontally or vertically based on `hline(obj)`.
3. **Apply and paint:** `extend_obj` is applied to each object using `apply`. The extended objects are then merged and painted onto the input grid. 

Each program version provides a distinct approach to achieving the desired transformation while utilizing the DSL functions effectively.
