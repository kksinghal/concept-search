## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation logic seems to involve identifying objects formed by the digit '8' on a background of '0's and then extending these objects horizontally or vertically to create a solid line of '8's within the object's bounding box. 

**Input_0:**  A single object is extended horizontally.
**Input_1:**  Two objects are extended horizontally.
**Input_2:**  Three objects are extended: one horizontally, two vertically.

## Program Versions & Explanations:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  output = I
  for obj in objs:
    upper = uppermost(obj)
    lower = lowermost(obj)
    left = leftmost(obj)
    right = rightmost(obj)
    for i in range(upper, lower + 1):
      for j in range(left, right + 1):
        output = fill(output, EIGHT, {(i, j)})
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies objects formed by the digit '8' on a background of '0's, excluding diagonal connections and ignoring the background.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** The code iterates through each identified object and its bounding box, replacing each cell within the box with '8'.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  output = I
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == EIGHT:
      upper = uppermost(obj)
      lower = lowermost(obj)
      left = leftmost(obj)
      right = rightmost(obj)
      for i in range(upper, lower + 1):
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
          output = fill(output, EIGHT, {(i, j)})
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition into Objects:** `fgpartition(I)` partitions the grid into objects based on cell value, excluding the background.
2. **Filter and Fill:** The code iterates through each object, checks if it's an '8' object, and fills its bounding box with '8's.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
    obj = objects(I, True, False, True)
    O = I
    for i in range(len(obj)):
        p = first(obj)
        box = backdrop(p)
        filled = fill(I, EIGHT, box)
        obj = difference(obj, {p})
        O = filled
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` finds all '8' objects.
2. **Iterate and Fill:**  Iterates through each object, gets its backdrop (bounding box), fills the backdrop with '8's in a copy of the input, and updates the copy for the next iteration.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
    return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(EIGHT, backdrop(obj)), objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Objects and Backdrops:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` finds '8' objects. `backdrop(obj)` gets each object's bounding box.
2. **Recolor and Paint:** `recolor(EIGHT, backdrop(obj))` creates a new object with '8's in the bounding box. `merge` combines these new objects, and `paint` applies them to the input grid.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  filled_indices = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for cell in obj:
      filled_indices.update(backdrop({cell[1]}))
  return fill(I, EIGHT, frozenset(filled_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Cells:** `objects` finds the '8' objects, then the code iterates through each cell within each object.
2. **Find and Fill Backdrops:** For each cell, it finds its backdrop (bounding box) and adds those indices to a set.
3. **Fill Grid:** Finally, it fills all the identified backdrop indices with '8's on the input grid.

These program versions provide five different approaches to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the DSL's flexibility and allowing for diverse solutions.
