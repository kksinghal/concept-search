## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation connects all occurrences of the digit '8' within the input grid, forming a continuous line using the same digit.  The connection occurs both horizontally and vertically, creating a rectangular shape if possible. 

**Examples:**

* **Input 0:** Two separate vertical lines of '8's are extended to form a single horizontal line connecting them.
* **Input 1:** A vertical line of '8's is extended downwards to connect with a horizontal line, creating a single connected shape.
* **Input 2:** Similar to Input 1, a vertical line is extended upwards to connect with a horizontal line. 


## Code Improvement:

Here are five distinct program versions for achieving the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = ofcolor(I, EIGHT)  # Find indices of all '8's
    x2 = prapply(connect, x1, x1)  # Connect all pairs of '8' indices
    x3 = merge(x2) # Merge all connections into single set of indices
    O = fill(I, EIGHT, x3)  # Fill the grid with '8's at connected indices
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`x1 = ofcolor(I, EIGHT)`:**  Identifies the indices of all cells containing the digit '8'.
2. **`x2 = prapply(connect, x1, x1)`:**  Computes the line connections between all pairs of '8' indices, creating a set of index sets representing potential connections.
3. **`x3 = merge(x2)`:** Merges all individual connection lines into a single set of indices.
4. **`O = fill(I, EIGHT, x3)`:** Fills the input grid `I` with the digit '8' at all indices present in the merged connection set `x3`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = ofcolor(I, EIGHT)  # Find indices of '8's
    x2 = astuple(first(x1), first(remove(first(x1), x1)))  # Get two distinct '8' indices
    x3 = connect(x2[0], x2[1])  # Connect the two indices
    O = fill(I, EIGHT, x3)  # Fill the connected line in the grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`x1 = ofcolor(I, EIGHT)`:**  Identifies the indices of all cells containing the digit '8'.
2. **`x2 = astuple(first(x1), first(remove(first(x1), x1)))`:**  Selects two distinct indices from the set of '8' indices.
3. **`x3 = connect(x2[0], x2[1])`:**  Computes the line connection between the two selected indices. 
4. **`O = fill(I, EIGHT, x3)`:** Fills the input grid `I` with the digit '8' along the connected line.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = objects(I, False, True, False) # Extract all objects from the grid
  filtered_obj = colorfilter(obj, EIGHT) # Keep only objects containing '8'
  indices = toindices(merge(filtered_obj)) # Extract indices from filtered objects
  connections = prapply(connect, indices, indices) # Connect all index pairs
  filled = fill(I, EIGHT, merge(connections)) # Fill connections with '8'
  O = paint(filled, merge(filtered_obj)) # Paint the original '8' objects back
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = objects(I, False, True, False)`:**  Extracts all objects from the grid, allowing for multi-valued objects and diagonal connections.
2. **`filtered_obj = colorfilter(obj, EIGHT)`:**  Filters the extracted objects, keeping only those containing the digit '8'.
3. **`indices = toindices(merge(filtered_obj))`:**  Merges the filtered objects and extracts their cell indices.
4. **`connections = prapply(connect, indices, indices)`:**  Computes line connections between all pairs of indices within the merged object.
5. **`filled = fill(I, EIGHT, merge(connections))`:**  Fills the input grid with '8' at the indices representing the connections.
6. **`O = paint(filled, merge(filtered_obj))`:**  Paints the original '8'-valued objects back onto the grid, ensuring their original shape is preserved.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = objects(I, False, False, True)  # Get objects without background
    x2 = argmax(x1, size)  # Find the largest object
    x3 = toindices(x2)  # Get indices of largest object
    x4 = prapply(connect, x3, x3)  # Connect all pairs of indices
    x5 = merge(x4)  # Merge connections
    O = fill(I, EIGHT, x5)  # Fill connected indices with '8'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`x1 = objects(I, False, False, True)`:**  Extracts objects from the grid, excluding the background.
2. **`x2 = argmax(x1, size)`:**  Identifies the largest object based on its size (number of cells).
3. **`x3 = toindices(x2)`:**  Extracts the indices of the largest object.
4. **`x4 = prapply(connect, x3, x3)`:**  Computes line connections between all pairs of indices in the largest object.
5. **`x5 = merge(x4)`:** Merges the connections into a single set of indices.
6. **`O = fill(I, EIGHT, x5)`:**  Fills the input grid with '8' at the merged connection indices.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  locs = ofcolor(I, EIGHT)  # Find locations of all '8's
  if len(locs) <= 1:  
    return I # Return if less than 2 '8's are present
  else:
    first_loc = first(locs) # Get the first '8' location
    rest_locs = remove(first_loc, locs) # Get the rest
    connections = mpapply(lambda l: connect(first_loc, l), rest_locs) # Connect first to all others
    O = fill(I, EIGHT, connections) # Fill connections with '8'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`locs = ofcolor(I, EIGHT)`:**  Finds the locations (indices) of all '8's in the input grid.
2. **`if len(locs) <= 1:`**:  Checks if there are less than two '8's; if so, returns the original grid as no connections are needed.
3. **`first_loc = first(locs)`:**  Gets the location of the first '8' found.
4. **`rest_locs = remove(first_loc, locs)`:** Gets the locations of all other '8's by removing the first one.
5. **`connections = mpapply(lambda l: connect(first_loc, l), rest_locs)`:**  For each of the remaining '8' locations, it connects the first '8' location to them using the `connect` function and merges all the resulting connections.
6. **`O = fill(I, EIGHT, connections)`:**  Fills the input grid with '8' at the indices corresponding to the calculated connections.
