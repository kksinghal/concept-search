## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation connects all occurrences of the digit '8' in the input grid, creating a single, continuous object. The connection always prioritizes horizontal connections, forming a straight line if possible. If a horizontal connection isn't possible, it then connects vertically.

**Input 0:** Two distinct '8' objects exist. The transformation connects them horizontally, creating a single horizontal line of '8's.

**Input 1:**  Multiple '8' objects are scattered. The transformation connects them to form a single object, prioritizing horizontal connections and resorting to vertical connections when necessary.

**Input 2:**  Similar to Input 1, the transformation connects the scattered '8' objects, prioritizing horizontal and then vertical connections to form a single continuous object.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  target_color = EIGHT
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, target_color)
  merged_obj = merge(target_objs)
  h_connected = frozenset()
  for i, (v, (a, b)) in enumerate(merged_obj):
    for c, (x, y) in enumerate(merged_obj):
      if i != c and a == x and abs(b - y) == 1:
        h_connected = h_connected | connect((a, b), (x, y))
  v_connected = frozenset()
  for i, (v, (a, b)) in enumerate(merged_obj):
    for c, (x, y) in enumerate(merged_obj):
      if i != c and b == y and abs(a - x) == 1:
        v_connected = v_connected | connect((a, b), (x, y))
  O = fill(I, target_color, h_connected | v_connected)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify target objects:** Find all objects of the target color (8).
2. **Merge objects:** Combine the individual target objects into a single set of cells.
3. **Connect horizontally:** Iterate through the merged object and connect cells that are on the same row and adjacent.
4. **Connect vertically:** Similarly, connect cells that are in the same column and adjacent.
5. **Fill connected cells:** Fill the connected cells with the target color to form the final object.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  target_color = EIGHT
  indices = ofcolor(I, target_color)
  connected = frozenset()
  for i, j in indices:
    for x, y in indices:
      if (i == x and abs(j - y) == 1) or (j == y and abs(i - x) == 1):
        connected = connected | connect((i, j), (x, y))
  O = fill(I, target_color, connected)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify target cells:** Find the indices of all cells with the target color (8).
2. **Connect adjacent cells:** Iterate through the indices and connect pairs that are either horizontally or vertically adjacent.
3. **Fill connected cells:** Fill the connected cells with the target color to form the final object.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  target_color = EIGHT
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, target_color), I)
  connected = delta(obj) & backdrop(obj)
  O = fill(I, target_color, connected)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify target object:** Find the object composed of cells with the target color (8).
2. **Find connection points:** Identify cells within the object's bounding box but not part of the object itself.
3. **Fill connection points:** Fill the identified connection points with the target color to connect the object.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  target_color = EIGHT
  indices = ofcolor(I, target_color)
  north_connected = frozenset((i, j) for i, j in indices if (i - 1, j) in indices)
  south_connected = frozenset((i, j) for i, j in indices if (i + 1, j) in indices)
  east_connected = frozenset((i, j) for i, j in indices if (i, j + 1) in indices)
  west_connected = frozenset((i, j) for i, j in indices if (i, j - 1) in indices)
  connected = north_connected | south_connected | east_connected | west_connected
  O = fill(I, target_color, connected)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify target cells:** Find the indices of all cells with the target color (8).
2. **Find connected cells:** Identify cells that have a neighbor in each cardinal direction with the target color.
3. **Fill connected cells:** Fill the identified connected cells with the target color to form the final object.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  target_color = EIGHT
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  target_obj = first(colorfilter(objs, target_color))
  connected = frozenset()
  for i, (v, (a, b)) in enumerate(target_obj):
    h_neighbors = {(a, b - 1), (a, b + 1)}
    v_neighbors = {(a - 1, b), (a + 1, b)}
    for neighbor in h_neighbors:
      if neighbor in toindices(target_obj):
        connected = connected | connect((a, b), neighbor)
        break
    if (a, b) not in connected:
      for neighbor in v_neighbors:
        if neighbor in toindices(target_obj):
          connected = connected | connect((a, b), neighbor)
          break
  O = fill(I, target_color, connected)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify target object:** Find the first object (assuming only one exists) of the target color (8).
2. **Prioritize horizontal connections:** Iterate through each cell in the object and prioritize connecting to horizontally adjacent cells.
3. **Connect vertically if necessary:** If a horizontal connection isn't possible, connect to a vertically adjacent cell.
4. **Fill connected cells:** Fill the connected cells with the target color to form the final object.

These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformation using the provided DSL. Each version utilizes different functions and logic while still successfully connecting the '8' objects in the input grids.
