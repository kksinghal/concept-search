## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects composed of the digit '4' and stretching them horizontally to occupy the full width of the grid, while maintaining their vertical position. 

**Input_0:**
* The single '4' object is stretched to cover the entire bottom row.

**Input_1:**
* The '4' object is stretched horizontally to cover the bottom row.

**Input_2:**
* Two separate '4' objects are independently stretched horizontally to cover the entire bottom row.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  four_objs = colorfilter(objs, FOUR)
  shifted_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (0, -leftmost(obj))) for obj in four_objs)
  stretched_objs = frozenset(frozenset((FOUR, (i, j)) for j in range(width(I))) for i in range(height(I)) if any((i, k) in toindices(obj) for k in range(width(I))) for obj in shifted_objs)
  return paint(I, merge(stretched_objs)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '4' objects:** Find all objects made of '4' using `objects` and filter them using `colorfilter`.
2. **Align left:** Shift each '4' object to the left edge using `shift` and `leftmost`.
3. **Stretch horizontally:**  For each row where a shifted object exists, create a new object spanning the entire row with '4's.
4. **Paint:** Combine all stretched objects and paint them onto the input grid using `paint`.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  h = height(I)
  return tuple(tuple(branch(any(I[i][j] == FOUR for i in range(h)), FOUR, I[i][j]) for j in range(width(I))) for i in range(h))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate cell-wise:** Loop through each cell of the grid.
2. **Check for '4' in column:** For each cell, check if there is a '4' in the same column using `any`.
3. **Conditional replacement:** If a '4' is found in the column, replace the current cell with '4', otherwise keep the original value.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def program_v3(I):
  fours = ofcolor(I, FOUR)
  bottom_row = {(i, j) for i, j in fours if i == lowermost(fours)}
  stretched_fours = frozenset((FOUR, (i, j)) for i, _ in bottom_row for j in range(width(I)))
  return paint(I, stretched_fours)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '4' indices:** Get indices of all '4' cells using `ofcolor`.
2. **Isolate bottom row:** Extract indices of '4's present in the bottom row using `lowermost`.
3. **Create stretched object:** Generate a new object containing '4's at every column position of the bottom row.
4. **Paint:** Paint the stretched object onto the original grid using `paint`.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def program_v4(I):
  return tuple(tuple(4 if 4 in col else cell for cell in row) for row, col in zip(I, dmirror(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transpose:** Transpose the grid using `dmirror` to easily iterate over columns.
2. **Check and replace:** For each row (representing a column in the original grid) and its corresponding transposed column, check if it contains a '4'. If it does, replace all cells in the row with '4', otherwise retain the original values.

## Program Version 5:
```python
def program_v5(I):
  return tuple(tuple(branch(FOUR in r, FOUR, v) for v in r) for r in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over rows:** Loop through each row of the grid.
2. **Check for '4':** For each row, check if it contains the value '4'.
3. **Conditional fill:** If a '4' is found in the row, fill the entire row with '4's. Otherwise, keep the original row values. 

These five program versions showcase distinct approaches to solving the given transformation task using different combinations of DSL functions and logic. Each version leverages the provided DSL's capabilities for object manipulation, grid traversal, and conditional operations to achieve the desired output.
