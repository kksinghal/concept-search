## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects with the color '4' and expanding them horizontally to cover the entire width of the grid while maintaining their original vertical position. 

**Input_0:** The '4' object at the bottom is extended horizontally across the width of the grid.
**Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the bottom row of '4's is extended horizontally.
**Input_2:** The two '4's in the bottom row are extended horizontally to the edges of the grid.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  fours = sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == FOUR) # Find objects of color 4
  expanded_indices = mpapply(lambda obj: {(i, j) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(width(I)) if i == uppermost(obj)}, fours) # Get indices for all rows containing a '4'
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), toobject(expanded_indices, I)) # Paint expanded indices on an empty canvas 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '4' objects:** `fours = sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == FOUR)` extracts all objects with color '4'.
2. **Expand horizontally:** `expanded_indices = mpapply(lambda obj: {(i, j) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(width(I)) if i == uppermost(obj)}, fours)` creates a set of indices spanning the entire row for each row containing a '4'.
3. **Paint on canvas:**  `return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), toobject(expanded_indices, I))` creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input and paints the '4's at the expanded indices.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  return paint(I, toobject(prapply(lambda i, j: (FOUR, (i, j)) if any(index(I, (k, j)) == FOUR for k in range(height(I))) else (ZERO, (i, j)), range(height(I)), range(width(I))), I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** The code uses `prapply` to iterate through each cell (i, j) in the grid.
2. **Check for '4' in column:**  `any(index(I, (k, j)) == FOUR for k in range(height(I)))` checks if a '4' exists in the same column (j) as the current cell.
3. **Paint accordingly:** If a '4' is found in the column, the current cell is painted with '4'; otherwise, it's painted with '0'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  def expand_row(row_index):
    return {(row_index, j) for j in range(width(I))}
  four_rows = {uppermost(obj) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if color(obj) == FOUR} # Get row indices of '4' objects
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), toobject(frozenset.union(*apply(expand_row, four_rows)), I)) # Paint expanded rows on a blank canvas
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `expand_row`:** This helper function takes a row index and returns a set of indices covering that entire row.
2. **Get '4' row indices:** `four_rows = {uppermost(obj) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if color(obj) == FOUR}` extracts the row indices where '4' objects are present.
3. **Expand and paint:** The code applies `expand_row` to each '4' row index, merges the resulting sets of indices, and paints them with '4's on a blank canvas. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  def expand_horizontal(obj):
    i = uppermost(obj)
    return {(i, j) for j in range(width(I))}
  fours = sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == FOUR)
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), toobject(frozenset.union(*apply(expand_horizontal, fours)), I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `expand_horizontal`:** This function takes a '4' object and returns a set of indices covering the entire row where the object is located. 
2. **Find '4' objects:** `fours = sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == FOUR)` identifies all objects with color '4'.
3. **Expand and paint:**  The code applies `expand_horizontal` to each '4' object, merges the resulting index sets, and paints them with '4's on a blank canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
    h, w = shape(I)
    new_grid = canvas(ZERO, (h, w))
    for j in range(w):
        if any(index(I, (i, j)) == FOUR for i in range(h)):
            for i in range(h):
                new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(FOUR, (i, j))})
    return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a blank canvas:** A new grid is created with the same size as the input, filled with zeros.
2. **Iterate through columns:** The program iterates through each column of the input grid.
3. **Check for '4' in column:**  For each column, it checks if there's any cell containing the value '4'.
4. **Fill column with '4's:** If a '4' is found in the column, the entire corresponding column in the new grid is filled with '4's.
5. **Return the new grid:** The modified grid, with horizontally expanded '4's, is returned as the output.


These five programs offer distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
