## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects with the color '4' and stretching them horizontally to cover the entire width of the grid. The stretching occurs while maintaining the object's original vertical position.

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 

- The single '4' object at the bottom is stretched horizontally to cover the entire bottom row.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- The two '4' objects at the bottom are individually stretched horizontally, resulting in a continuous line of '4's at the bottom.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

-  Similar to Input_1, the two '4' objects at the bottom are stretched horizontally. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def stretch_four_horizontal(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Extract objects from the grid.
  four_objs = colorfilter(objs, FOUR)  # Filter objects with color '4'.
  stretched_objs = frozenset( # Stretch each '4' object horizontally.
    frozenset((FOUR, (i, j)) for j in range(width(I))) 
    for obj in four_objs 
    for i in range(height(I)) if any((i, k) in toindices(obj) for k in range(width(I))) 
  )
  return paint(I, merge(stretched_objs))  # Paint the stretched objects back onto the grid.
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Extract and Filter:**  We first extract all objects from the input grid and then filter them to keep only those with the color '4'.
2.  **Stretch:** We iterate through each '4' object and create a new object that spans the entire width of the grid at the same 'i' (row) coordinate as the original object.
3.  **Paint:** Finally, we paint these stretched objects back onto the original grid, effectively stretching the '4' objects horizontally.

**Version 2:**

```python
def stretch_four_horizontal(I):
  stretched_indices = frozenset()  # Initialize an empty set to store stretched indices.
  for j in range(width(I)):  # Iterate through each column.
    for i in range(height(I)):  # Iterate through each row.
      if I[i][j] == FOUR:  # If a '4' is found:
        stretched_indices = stretched_indices | frozenset((FOUR, (i, k)) for k in range(width(I)))  # Add a horizontal line of '4's at that row.
        break  # Move to the next column after finding a '4' in the current column.
  return paint(I, stretched_indices)  # Paint the stretched indices onto the grid.
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Iterate and Stretch:** This version iterates through the grid column by column. When it encounters a '4', it creates a horizontal line of '4's at that row and stores the indices in `stretched_indices`. 
2.  **Paint:**  Finally, it paints all the collected indices onto the original grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def stretch_four_horizontal(I):
  return paint(I, frozenset( # Paint stretched indices directly.
      (FOUR, (i, k)) 
      for j in range(width(I))
      for i in range(height(I)) if I[i][j] == FOUR
      for k in range(width(I))
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Direct Painting:** This version combines iteration and painting into a single step. It iterates through the grid, and for every '4' found, it directly adds a horizontal line of '4's to the painting set.

**Version 4:**

```python
def stretch_four_horizontal(I):
  h, w = height(I), width(I)
  return tuple( # Reconstruct the grid with stretched '4's.
      tuple(FOUR if any(I[i][k] == FOUR for k in range(w)) else I[i][j] for j in range(w)) 
      for i in range(h)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Grid Reconstruction:** This version reconstructs the grid row by row. For each cell, it checks if there is a '4' in the same row. If so, it fills the entire row with '4's, otherwise keeps the original cell value.

**Version 5:**

```python
def stretch_four_horizontal(I):
  return tuple( # Reconstruct the grid using list comprehension.
    tuple(FOUR if FOUR in row else cell for cell in row) 
    for row in I 
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Simplified Reconstruction:**  This version provides a more concise way to reconstruct the grid. It iterates through each row, and if it finds a '4' in the row, it replaces all cells in that row with '4's, otherwise retains the original row values.
