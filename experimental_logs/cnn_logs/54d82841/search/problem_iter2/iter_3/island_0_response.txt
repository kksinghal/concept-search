## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying single-cell objects on the bottom row of the input grid and mirroring them to the opposite side of the bottom row, while preserving the rest of the grid. 

**Example:**

Input:

```
0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0
0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6
0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0
```

Output:

```
0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0
0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6
0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 
```

Here, the single '4' cell on the bottom row is mirrored to the opposite end.


## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bottom_row_indices = frozenset((height(I) - 1, j) for j in range(width(I)))
  single_cells = mfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda o: size(o) == 1 and contained(first(toindices(o)), bottom_row_indices))
  mirrored_cells = mapply(lambda o: shift(o, (0, width(I) - 1 - 2 * leftmost(o))), single_cells)
  return paint(I, mirrored_cells)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bottom_row_indices`**:  Identifies the indices of the bottom row.
2. **`single_cells`**: Filters objects to keep only single-cell objects present on the bottom row. 
3. **`mirrored_cells`**: Calculates the mirrored positions for each single-cell object.
4. **`paint`**: Paints the mirrored cells onto the original grid, effectively mirroring them.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(I[i][j] if i != height(I) - 1 or colorcount(I, I[i][j]) > 1 else I[i][width(I) - 1 - j] for j in range(width(I))) for i in range(height(I))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterates through each cell of the grid.
2. If the cell is on the last row and its color appears only once in the entire grid, it replaces the cell value with the value of the cell mirrored across the vertical axis of the grid.
3. Otherwise, the original cell value is kept.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    if colorcount(I, index(I, (height(I) - 1, j))) == 1:
      O = fill(O, index(I, (height(I) - 1, j)), frozenset({(height(I) - 1, width(I) - 1 - j)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterates through each column `j` of the last row of the grid.
2. If the color of the cell at `(height(I) - 1, j)` appears only once in the entire grid, it fills the cell at the mirrored position `(height(I) - 1, width(I) - 1 - j)` with that color.
3. This effectively mirrors the single-colored cells on the last row.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  single_cells = sfilter(objs, lambda o: size(o) == 1 and uppermost(o) == height(I) - 1)
  return paint(I, mapply(lambda o: shift(o, (0, width(I) - 1 - 2 * leftmost(o))), single_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs`**: Extracts all objects from the input grid.
2. **`single_cells`**: Filters for objects that are single cells and located on the bottom row.
3. **`mapply`**:  For each single-cell object, it calculates the mirrored position and shifts the object to that position.
4. **`paint`**:  Paints the shifted objects onto the original grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          I[i][j] if i != h - 1 or any(I[i][k] == I[i][j] for k in range(w) if k != j) else I[i][w - 1 - j]
          for j in range(w)
      )
      for i in range(h)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes nested loops and a conditional expression within the list comprehension to achieve the mirroring effect:

1. **`h, w = shape(I)`:** Gets the height and width of the grid.
2. **Outer loop:** Iterates over each row `i` of the grid.
3. **Inner loop:** Iterates over each cell `j` in the current row.
4. **Conditional:** For each cell, it checks if it's on the last row (`i != h - 1`) and if its color is unique within the row (`any(I[i][k] == I[i][j] for k in range(w) if k != j)`). 
   - If both conditions are true, it mirrors the cell by accessing the value at the mirrored index (`I[i][w - 1 - j]`).
   - Otherwise, it keeps the original cell value (`I[i][j]`).
5. **Result:** The nested loops and conditional logic rebuild the grid with the mirrored single-colored cells on the last row.
