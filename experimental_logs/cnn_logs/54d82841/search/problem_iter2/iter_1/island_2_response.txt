## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify objects with the color '4' and expand them horizontally to the edges of the grid while preserving the original object shape. 

**Let's break down each input-output example:**

* **Input_0:** The single '4' object expands left and right to reach the grid edges, forming two separate '4' objects.
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the two '4' objects extend horizontally to the grid boundaries.
* **Input_2:**  Again, the '4' objects expand left and right to the grid edges.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL functions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  four_indices = ofcolor(grid, FOUR)  # Get indices of all '4' cells
  left_edge = minimum({j for i, j in four_indices}) # Find leftmost '4' column
  right_edge = maximum({j for i, j in four_indices}) # Find rightmost '4' column
  h = height(grid)
  left_extension = {(i, j) for i in range(h) for j in range(left_edge)} # Indices from left edge to leftmost '4'
  right_extension = {(i, j) for i in range(h) for j in range(right_edge + 1, width(grid))} # Indices from rightmost '4' to right edge
  return paint(paint(grid, recolor(FOUR, left_extension)), recolor(FOUR, right_extension)) # Paint extensions with '4'
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '4' cells:** `ofcolor(grid, FOUR)` finds all indices of cells containing '4'.
2. **Find Horizontal Edges:** `minimum` and `maximum` on the column indices (`j`) of '4' cells determine the leftmost and rightmost columns.
3. **Generate Extension Indices:** `left_extension` and `right_extension` represent indices from the edges to the outermost '4' cells.
4. **Paint Extensions:** The extensions are painted with '4' using `recolor` and `paint`, applied sequentially for left and right.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  four_obj = extract(objects(grid, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == FOUR) # Extract the '4' object
  left_edge = leftmost(four_obj) # Get column of leftmost '4' cell
  right_edge = rightmost(four_obj) # Get column of rightmost '4' cell
  return hconcat(
      canvas(FOUR, (height(grid), left_edge)), # Left '4' canvas
      hconcat(
          crop(grid, (0, left_edge), (height(grid), right_edge - left_edge + 1)), # Original object slice
          canvas(FOUR, (height(grid), width(grid) - right_edge - 1)) # Right '4' canvas
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '4' Object:** `extract` finds the object with color '4'.
2. **Find Edge Columns:** `leftmost` and `rightmost` provide the column indices of the leftmost and rightmost '4' cells.
3. **Construct Canvases:**  Three canvases are created:
    * Left: Filled with '4' from the left edge to the leftmost '4' cell.
    * Original: A slice of the original grid containing the '4' object.
    * Right: Filled with '4' from the rightmost '4' cell to the right edge.
4. **Concatenate:** The three canvases are horizontally concatenated using `hconcat` to form the final output.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for obj in objects(grid, T, F, T): # Iterate through objects
    if color(obj) == FOUR: # Check if object is '4'
      left_edge = leftmost(obj)
      right_edge = rightmost(obj)
      for i in range(height(grid)): # Iterate through rows
        for j in range(width(grid)):
          if j < left_edge or j > right_edge: # If outside object's horizontal bounds
            grid = fill(grid, FOUR, {(i, j)}) # Fill with '4'
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Objects:** Loop through all objects in the grid.
2. **Identify '4' Object:** Check if the current object's color is '4'.
3. **Find Edge Columns:**  Determine the leftmost and rightmost column indices of the '4' object.
4. **Iterate Grid Cells:** Loop through all grid cells.
5. **Fill Outside Bounds:** If a cell is outside the horizontal bounds of the '4' object, fill it with '4'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  four_obj = extract(objects(grid, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == FOUR) # Extract the '4' object
  return paint(
      grid, 
      recolor(
          FOUR, 
          difference(
              asindices(grid), # All grid indices
              toindices(four_obj) # Indices of the '4' object
          )
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '4' Object:** Identify the object composed of '4's.
2. **Find Non-'4' Indices:** `difference` identifies grid indices that are NOT part of the '4' object.
3. **Recolor and Paint:**  `recolor` sets the color of the non-'4' indices to '4', and `paint` applies this change to the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for j in range(width(grid)): # Iterate through columns
    if index(grid, (0, j)) == FOUR: # Check if top row cell is '4'
      grid = paint(grid, recolor(FOUR, hfrontier((0, j)))) # Fill the entire column with '4'
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Columns:** Loop through each column of the grid.
2. **Check Top Row:**  For each column, examine if the cell in the top row contains a '4'.
3. **Fill Column:** If the top row cell contains a '4', use `hfrontier` to target the entire column and `recolor` and `paint` to fill it with '4's. 


These are five distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation. Each leverages different DSL functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
