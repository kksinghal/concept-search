## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects with color '4' and expanding them horizontally, distributing the expansion evenly on both sides. Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The single-cell object '4' at the bottom center expands to a two-cell horizontal line. 
* The expansion is centered, resulting in one '4' on each side of the original '4' position.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The two '4's at the bottom corners remain unchanged as they are already on the edges and cannot expand horizontally.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

*  Similar to Input_0, the '4's at the bottom center expand horizontally by one cell on each side.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), FOUR))
  expansion = width(obj) - 1
  shift_amount = (0, expansion // 2 - expansion)
  expanded_obj = shift(obj, shift_amount)
  O = paint(I, expanded_obj)
  O = paint(O, shift(expanded_obj, (0, 2 * expansion)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Object:**  We identify the object with color '4' using `colorfilter` and `objects`.
2. **Calculate Expansion:** We calculate the expansion length, which is always one less than the object's width.
3. **Calculate Shift:** We calculate the leftward shift needed to center the expansion.
4. **Expand Object:** We shift the original object leftward and then create a copy shifted rightward by double the expansion length.
5. **Paint Objects:** We paint both the left-shifted and right-shifted objects onto the grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), FOUR)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    expansion = width(obj) - 1
    shift_amount = (0, expansion // 2)
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, subtract(shift_amount, (0, expansion))))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, shift_amount))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We identify all objects with color '4'.
2. **Iterate and Expand:**  For each object:
    *  Calculate expansion length.
    *  Calculate the rightward shift needed for centered expansion.
    *  Paint a copy of the object shifted leftward and another copy shifted rightward.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), FOUR))
  left_edge = leftmost(obj)
  right_edge = rightmost(obj)
  O = fill(I, FOUR, {(height(obj)-1, left_edge - 1), (height(obj)-1, right_edge + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Object:** We identify the object with color '4'.
2. **Find Edges:** We find the column indices of the leftmost and rightmost cells of the object.
3. **Fill Cells:** We directly fill the cells to the left and right of the object's edges with '4'.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
    O = I
    for j in range(width(I)):
        if index(I, (height(I) - 1, j)) == FOUR:
            O = fill(O, FOUR, {(height(I) - 1, j - 1)})
            O = fill(O, FOUR, {(height(I) - 1, j + 1)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Bottom Row:**  We iterate through each cell in the bottom row of the grid.
2. **Check for '4':** If a cell contains '4', we fill the cells to its left and right with '4'.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  def expand_obj(obj):
    expansion = width(obj) - 1
    shift_amount = (0, expansion // 2)
    return shift(obj, subtract(shift_amount, (0, expansion)))
  objs = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), FOUR)
  expanded_objs = apply(expand_obj, objs)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)
  for obj in expanded_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Expansion Function:** We define a helper function `expand_obj` to encapsulate the object expansion logic.
2. **Identify and Expand Objects:** We identify objects with color '4', apply the `expand_obj` function to each, and store the expanded objects.
3. **Paint Original and Expanded Objects:** We paint both the original and expanded objects onto the grid.


These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version leverages different combinations of functions and logic, resulting in unique code structures and execution paths.
