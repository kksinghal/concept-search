## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects with color `4` and expands them horizontally into lines. The original object is replaced with background color. Here's a breakdown:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- Two `4`-colored cells exist in the last row.
- Each cell expands horizontally, filling the entire row with `4`.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- Two `4`-colored cells exist in the last row.
- Each cell expands horizontally, filling the entire row with `4`.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- Two `4`-colored cells exist in the last row.
- Each cell expands horizontally, filling the entire row with `4`.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions for the "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fours = sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == FOUR) # Find objects with color 4
  expanded_rows = mapply(lambda obj: {(uppermost(obj), j) for j in range(width(I))}, fours, fours) # Expand each object horizontally into a line
  return paint(cover(I, fours), toobject(expanded_rows, I)) # Paint the expanded lines onto a canvas with the original '4' objects removed 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify `4`-colored objects:** `sfilter` finds all objects colored `4`.
2. **Expand horizontally:** `mapply` applies a lambda function to each object, creating a set of indices representing a horizontal line at the object's row.
3. **Combine lines:** `frozenset.union` merges the lines into a single set of indices.
4. **Remove original objects:** `cover` replaces the original `4` objects with the background color.
5. **Paint lines:** `paint` draws the expanded lines onto the modified grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  four_indices = ofcolor(I, FOUR) # Find indices of all '4' cells
  expanded_indices = mpapply(lambda loc: {(i, loc[1]) for i in range(height(I))}, four_indices, four_indices) # Expand each index vertically into a line
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), toobject(expanded_indices, I)) # Paint the lines on a blank canvas
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Locate `4` cells:** `ofcolor` gets indices of all cells with color `4`.
2. **Expand vertically:** `mpapply` applies a lambda function that generates indices for a vertical line at each `4` cell's column.
3. **Create lines:** `frozenset.union` combines all generated indices.
4. **Draw on canvas:** `paint` draws the lines onto a blank canvas of the input's shape.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fours = sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == FOUR)
  return paint(I, toobject(frozenset.union(*({(uppermost(obj), j) for j in range(width(I))} for obj in fours)), I))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find `4` objects:** `sfilter` identifies objects with color `4`.
2. **Generate line indices:** A set comprehension generates indices for a horizontal line at each object's row.
3. **Combine lines:** `frozenset.union` merges all line indices.
4. **Paint lines:** `paint` draws the lines directly onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def expand_row(row_index):
        return {(row_index, j) for j in range(width(I))}
    four_rows = {uppermost(obj) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if color(obj) == FOUR}
    return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), toobject(set.union({frozenset()} ,*apply(expand_row, tuple(four_rows))), I))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`expand_row` function:** This function takes a row index and returns a set of indices representing a horizontal line spanning the entire width of the grid at that row.
2. **`four_rows` set:** This set stores the unique row indices of objects with color `4`.
3. **Applying `expand_row`:** The code iterates through the `four_rows` set and applies the `expand_row` function to each row index, generating a set of indices for each row containing a `4`.
4. **`set.union`:** This function combines all the generated sets of indices into a single set, representing all the horizontal lines that need to be drawn.
5. **`paint`:** Finally, the `paint` function takes a blank canvas (`canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`) and uses the combined set of indices to paint the horizontal lines onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def horizontal_line(obj):
    row = uppermost(obj)
    return {(row, col) for col in range(width(I))}
  fours = sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == FOUR)
  return paint(I, toobject(frozenset.union(*apply(horizontal_line, fours)), I))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`horizontal_line` Function:** Defines a function that takes an object as input and returns a set of indices representing a horizontal line at the object's row, spanning the entire width of the grid.
2. **Identify '4' Objects:** Filters the objects in the input grid (`I`) to find those with color `4` using `sfilter` and a lambda function.
3. **Apply and Merge Lines:** Applies the `horizontal_line` function to each '4' object using `apply`, generating a set of horizontal line indices for each object. It then merges these sets using `frozenset.union(*)`.
4. **Paint Lines on Grid:** Paints the merged set of horizontal line indices onto the input grid (`I`) using the `paint` function.


## Conclusion:

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation by leveraging various DSL functions. Each version provides a unique combination of logic and function calls, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
