## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects with the color '4' and extending them horizontally across the entire width of the grid. 

* **Input_0:** The single '4' at the bottom center extends to both edges of the grid.
* **Input_1:** The two '4's at the bottom expand horizontally, covering the entire width.
* **Input_2:** Similar to Input_1, the '4's expand horizontally across the grid's bottom.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fours = sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == FOUR) # Extract objects of color 4
  expanded_indices = mpapply(lambda o: {(i, j) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(width(I)) if i == uppermost(o)}, fours) # Get indices for all rows containing a '4'
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), toobject(expanded_indices, I)) # Paint expanded indices on an empty canvas 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify '4' objects:**  The code first identifies all objects with color '4' using `sfilter` and `color`.
2. **Expand horizontally:** For each '4' object, it determines the row index and expands horizontally across the entire grid width using `mpapply`.
3. **Paint on a blank canvas:** Finally, it creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input and paints the expanded '4' indices onto it.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, toobject(mpapply(lambda j: {(i, j) for i in range(height(I)) if index(I, (i, j)) == FOUR}, range(width(I))), I))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through columns:** The code iterates through each column (`j`) of the grid.
2. **Check for '4':** Within each column, it checks each cell for the presence of '4'.
3. **Expand horizontally:** If a '4' is found, the entire column is marked for painting. 
4. **Paint on the input grid:** Finally, it paints the marked cells with '4' on the input grid.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) == FOUR:
        I = fill(I, FOUR, hfrontier((i, 0)))
        break  # Move to the next row once a '4' is found
  return I
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through cells:**  Iterate through each cell of the grid.
2. **Check for '4':**  If a cell contains '4', expand horizontally by filling its entire row with '4'.
3. **Continue to next row:** Once a '4' is found and the row is filled, move to the next row. 

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def expand_row(row_index):
    return {(row_index, j) for j in range(width(I))}
  four_rows = {uppermost(obj) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if color(obj) == FOUR}
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), toobject(merge(apply(expand_row, four_rows)), I))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify rows with '4':**  Find the row indices of all objects containing '4'.
2. **Expand rows:** For each identified row, create a set of indices covering the entire row.
3. **Paint on a blank canvas:**  Merge all expanded row indices and paint them onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input. 

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def expand_horizontal(obj):
    i = uppermost(obj)
    return {(i, j) for j in range(width(I))}
  fours = sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == FOUR)
  return paint(I, toobject(merge(apply(expand_horizontal, fours)), I))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find '4' objects:**  Identify objects with color '4'.
2. **Expand each object:** For each '4' object, get its top row index and create a set of indices spanning the entire row at that index.
3. **Merge and Paint:** Merge the indices of all expanded rows and paint them onto the input grid.
