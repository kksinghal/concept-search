## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the objects with color '4' in the input grid and applies the following logic:

* **Horizontal Expansion:** The '4' object expands horizontally, filling the space between its original endpoints.
* **Center Preservation:**  The expansion occurs symmetrically, preserving the center of the original object.

Let's break down each input-output pair:

* **Input_0:** The single '4' cell expands to fill the bottom row symmetrically.
* **Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0, the '4's expand horizontally, maintaining their relative positions.
* **Input_2:** Again, the two '4' cells expand horizontally, staying within their respective bottom row segments. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the code, each using different DSL function combinations to achieve the desired transformation:


### Program Version 1:

```python
def solve_1f642eb9(I):
    # Identify the objects with color '4'
    obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), FOUR))
    # Calculate horizontal expansion length 
    expansion = width(obj) - 1
    # Calculate the shift needed for centered expansion
    shift_amount = (0, expansion // 2)
    # Expand the object
    expanded_obj = shift(obj, shift_amount)
    # Paint the expanded object back onto the grid
    O = paint(I, expanded_obj)
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the target object:** `colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), FOUR)` isolates the objects of color '4'.  `first()` selects one of them (in cases with multiple '4' objects).
2. **Calculate expansion:**  `width(obj) - 1` determines how many cells the object needs to expand horizontally.
3. **Calculate shift:** `(0, expansion // 2)` calculates the shift needed to ensure the expansion happens symmetrically from the center.
4. **Expand:** `shift(obj, shift_amount)` performs the actual expansion.
5. **Paint:** `paint(I, expanded_obj)` applies the expanded object back onto the original grid, replacing the original '4' object.


### Program Version 2:

```python
def solve_1f642eb9(I):
    # Identify all objects
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    # Filter objects with color '4'
    target_objs = colorfilter(objs, FOUR)
    # Apply transformation to each '4' object
    modified_objs = frozenset(expand_horizontal(obj, I) for obj in target_objs)
    # Replace the original objects with the modified ones
    O = paint(cover(I, merge(target_objs)), merge(modified_objs))
    return O

def expand_horizontal(obj, grid):
    # Get the leftmost and rightmost column indices of the object
    left = leftmost(obj)
    right = rightmost(obj)
    # Create a patch covering the horizontal space between the endpoints
    expansion_patch = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for j in range(left, right + 1))
    # Fill the expansion patch with the object's color
    return recolor(FOUR, expansion_patch) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Filter:** Similar to Version 1, this identifies and isolates objects with color '4'.
2. **`expand_horizontal` Function:** This function takes an object and the grid as input and expands the object horizontally.
    * It determines the leftmost and rightmost points of the object.
    * It creates a patch (`expansion_patch`) covering the horizontal space to be filled.
    * It uses `recolor` to change the patch's color to '4'.
3. **Apply and Replace:** 
    * `modified_objs` stores the expanded versions of all '4' objects.
    * The original '4' objects are removed from the grid using `cover`.
    * The modified objects are painted back onto the grid using `paint`.


### Program Version 3:

```python
def solve_1f642eb9(I):
    # Directly modify the grid rows where '4' is present
    O = tuple(
        tuple(FOUR if FOUR in row else cell for cell in row) 
        if FOUR in row else row 
        for row in I
    )
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Rows:** This version simplifies the process by iterating directly through each row of the input grid.
2. **Conditional Replacement:**
   * `FOUR in row`:  Checks if color '4' exists within the current row.
   * If '4' exists, the entire row is filled with '4's using a list comprehension.
   * If not, the row is left unchanged. 


### Program Version 4:

```python
def solve_1f642eb9(I):
    # Find the indices of all '4' cells
    indices_to_fill = ofcolor(I, FOUR) 
    # Get the row indices of those '4' cells
    target_rows = frozenset(i for i, j in indices_to_fill)
    # Fill the entire row with '4' where a '4' cell was found
    O = tuple(
        tuple(FOUR for _ in range(len(I[0]))) if i in target_rows else row
        for i, row in enumerate(I)
    )
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Target Rows:** `ofcolor(I, FOUR)` efficiently finds all indices of cells with color '4'. `target_rows` extracts the row numbers from those indices.
2. **Conditional Row Filling:** Iterates through each row and fills it with '4's only if the row index (`i`) is present in `target_rows`.


### Program Version 5: 

```python
def solve_1f642eb9(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        if color(obj) == FOUR:
            # Get the row index of the object
            row_index = uppermost(obj)
            # Fill the entire row with '4'
            O = tuple(tuple(FOUR for _ in range(len(O[0]))) if i == row_index else row for i, row in enumerate(O))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** This version iterates through all objects in the grid.
2. **Check for '4':**  If an object's color is '4':
   * It gets the row index of the object. 
   * It replaces the entire row at that index with '4's. 


Each of these versions utilizes different DSL functions and approaches, providing diverse solutions to the horizontal expansion problem while maintaining the desired center preservation.
