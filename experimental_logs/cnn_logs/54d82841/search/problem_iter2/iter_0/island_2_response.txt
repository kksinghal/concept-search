## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects composed of the digit '4' and extending them horizontally outwards from the center. The extension fills the space with the same digit ('4') until it reaches the edges of other objects or the grid boundary.

**Input_0:**
- The single '4' object is extended to both the left and right.

**Input_1:**
-  The single '4' object is extended to the left and right, stopping at the grid boundary.

**Input_2:**
-  Both '4' objects are extended left and right, stopping at the grid boundary. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, T, F, T)
  four_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == FOUR)
  start_j = leftmost(four_obj)
  end_j = rightmost(four_obj)
  center_j = (start_j + end_j) // 2
  extension = frozenset({(FOUR, (i, j)) for i in range(height(grid)) for j in range(start_j, center_j)} | 
                       {(FOUR, (i, j)) for i in range(height(grid)) for j in range(center_j + 1, width(grid))})
  return paint(grid, extension) 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Extract all objects from the grid.
2. **Locate '4' Object:** Find the object composed of the digit '4'.
3. **Determine Extension Range:** Calculate the center column of the '4' object. Extend left and right from this center, covering the entire grid height.
4. **Paint Extension:** Overwrite the grid with the calculated extension, effectively stretching the '4' object.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(grid):
  four_indices = ofcolor(grid, FOUR)
  min_j, max_j = leftmost(four_indices), rightmost(four_indices)
  center_j = (min_j + max_j) // 2
  fill_indices = frozenset((i,j) for i in range(height(grid)) for j in range(width(grid)) if j < min_j or j > max_j)
  return fill(grid, FOUR, fill_indices)
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find '4' Indices:** Directly locate the indices of all cells containing '4'.
2. **Calculate Center & Fill Area:** Determine the leftmost and rightmost columns of the '4' object and calculate the center. Define the fill area as everything outside the original '4' object's column range.
3. **Fill Grid:** Overwrite the grid with '4' at all calculated fill indices.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(grid):
  fours = toindices(extract(objects(grid, T, F, T), lambda o: color(o) == 4))
  left = minimum(apply(lambda c: c[1], fours))
  right = maximum(apply(lambda c: c[1], fours))
  middle = (left + right) // 2
  to_paint = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(height(grid)) for j in range(width(grid)) 
                     if (j < middle and not contained((i, j), fours)) or 
                        (j > middle and not contained((i, j), fours)))
  return paint(grid, recolor(4, to_paint))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Get '4' Object Indices:** Extract the object containing '4' and get its indices.
2. **Find Left, Right, Middle:** Determine the leftmost, rightmost, and middle column indices of the '4' object.
3. **Identify Cells to Paint:** Find all cells to the left and right of the middle column that are not already part of the '4' object.
4. **Paint Cells:** Overwrite the identified cells with the value '4'.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(grid):
  obj = extract(objects(grid, T, F, T), lambda o: color(o) == 4)
  lc = leftmost(obj)
  rc = rightmost(obj)
  mid = (lc + rc) // 2
  left_fill = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(height(grid)) for j in range(lc, mid))
  right_fill = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(height(grid)) for j in range(mid + 1, width(grid)))
  return paint(paint(grid, recolor(4, left_fill)), recolor(4, right_fill))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Extract '4' Object:** Isolate the object containing the digit '4'.
2. **Calculate Boundaries and Middle:** Determine the leftmost and rightmost column indices of the object and calculate the middle column.
3. **Define Fill Areas:** Create two sets of indices representing the areas to fill on the left and right of the '4' object.
4. **Paint Fill Areas:** Paint the identified fill areas with the digit '4' in two separate steps.

**Version 5:**
```python
def program_v5(grid):
  four_obj = extract(objects(grid, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == FOUR)
  left_edge = leftmost(four_obj)
  right_edge = rightmost(four_obj)
  h = height(grid)
  extension = lambda j: frozenset((i, j) for i in range(h))
  left_extension = merge(apply(extension, range(left_edge)))
  right_extension = merge(apply(extension, range(right_edge + 1, width(grid))))
  return paint(paint(grid, recolor(FOUR, left_extension)), recolor(FOUR, right_extension))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find '4' Object and Edges:** Locate the object composed of '4' and identify its leftmost and rightmost column indices.
2. **Create Extension Function:** Define a function `extension` that generates a set of indices representing a vertical line at a given column index.
3. **Generate Left and Right Extensions:** Apply the `extension` function to generate sets of indices representing the left and right extensions of the '4' object.
4. **Paint Extensions:** Paint the left and right extensions onto the grid with the digit '4' in two steps.

Each of these program versions utilizes a different combination of DSL functions and logic to achieve the desired transformation. They demonstrate the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for solving spatial reasoning tasks.
