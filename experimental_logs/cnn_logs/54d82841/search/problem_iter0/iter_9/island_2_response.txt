## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes the distinct objects on the bottom row of the input grid, places a 4 directly beneath the leftmost and rightmost non-zero cell of each object, and leaves the original grid otherwise unchanged.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bottom_row = I[-1]
  fours = frozenset()
  for j, v in enumerate(bottom_row):
    if v != 0:
      fours = insert((FOUR, (height(I), j)), fours)
      break
  for j, v in enumerate(reversed(bottom_row)):
    if v != 0:
      fours = insert((FOUR, (height(I), len(bottom_row) - j - 1)), fours)
      break
  O = paint(I, fours)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Isolate the bottom row:** `bottom_row = I[-1]`
2. **Iterate left to right, finding the first non-zero cell:** The first loop iterates through the bottom row and adds a (FOUR, (height, j)) tuple to the `fours` set when encountering the first non-zero cell.
3. **Iterate right to left, finding the first non-zero cell:** The second loop similarly finds the rightmost non-zero cell and adds the corresponding (FOUR, (height, j)) tuple to `fours`.
4. **Paint the fours onto the input grid:** `O = paint(I, fours)` paints the 4s at the determined locations.
5. **Return the modified grid:** `return O` returns the final grid.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = objects(I[-1:], T, F, F)
  fours = mapply(lambda o: frozenset({(FOUR, (height(I), leftmost(o))), (FOUR, (height(I), rightmost(o))) }), obj)
  O = paint(I, merge(fours))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find objects in the bottom row:** `obj = objects(I[-1:], T, F, F)` identifies the objects in the bottom row.
2. **Map object boundaries to fours:** `fours = mapply(...)` applies a lambda function to each object in `obj`. The lambda function creates a set containing two tuples: (FOUR, (height, leftmost_j)) and (FOUR, (height, rightmost_j)), effectively marking the leftmost and rightmost columns of each object with a 4 in the row below the bottom row.
3. **Paint the fours onto the input grid:** `O = paint(I, merge(fours))` merges the sets of fours for each object and paints them onto the original grid.
4. **Return the modified grid:** `return O` returns the final grid.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices = sfilter(asindices(I[-1:]), lambda ij: index(I, ij) != 0)
  if not indices:
    return I
  left_j = leftmost(backdrop(indices))
  right_j = rightmost(backdrop(indices))
  fours = frozenset({(FOUR, (height(I), left_j)), (FOUR, (height(I), right_j))})
  O = paint(I, fours)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get indices of non-zero elements in the bottom row:** `indices = sfilter(...)` filters the indices of the bottom row, keeping only those with non-zero values.
2. **Handle the case of an empty bottom row:** `if not indices: return I` returns the input grid if the bottom row is empty.
3. **Find the leftmost and rightmost indices:** `left_j = leftmost(backdrop(indices))` and `right_j = rightmost(backdrop(indices))` determine the bounding box of the non-zero indices and extract the leftmost and rightmost column indices.
4. **Create a set of fours:** `fours = frozenset(...)` creates a set containing two tuples representing the locations of the fours to be painted.
5. **Paint the fours onto the input grid:** `O = paint(I, fours)` paints the fours at the determined locations.
6. **Return the modified grid:** `return O` returns the final grid.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bottom_obj = objects(I[-1:], T, F, F)
  fours =  mapply(lambda obj: recolor(FOUR, shift( ((0, leftmost(obj)), (0, rightmost(obj))), (height(I), 0))), bottom_obj)
  O = paint(I, merge(fours))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects in the bottom row:** `bottom_obj = objects(I[-1:], T, F, F)` identifies distinct objects in the bottom row.
2. **Generate fours at object edges:** `fours = mapply(...)` applies a lambda function to each object. The lambda function:
    - extracts the leftmost and rightmost column indices of the object (`leftmost(obj)`, `rightmost(obj)`),
    - creates a simple two-cell object representing these edges (`((0, leftmost(obj)), (0, rightmost(obj)))`),
    - shifts this object down by the grid's height (`shift(..., (height(I), 0))`), and
    - recolors the shifted object to FOUR (`recolor(FOUR, ...)`).
3. **Paint the fours onto the input grid:** `O = paint(I, merge(fours))` merges the sets of fours generated for each object and paints them onto the original grid.
4. **Return the modified grid:** `return O` returns the final grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  fours = frozenset()
  for j, v in enumerate(I[-1]):
    if v != 0:
      fours = fours | {(FOUR, (h, j))}
      break
  for j in range(width(I) - 1, -1, -1):
    if I[-1][j] != 0:
      fours = fours | {(FOUR, (h, j))}
      break
  O = paint(I, fours)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get grid height:** `h = height(I)` stores the grid's height for later use.
2. **Iterate and mark leftmost non-zero:** The first loop iterates through the bottom row and adds a (FOUR, (height, j)) tuple to the `fours` set upon finding the first non-zero cell.
3. **Iterate and mark rightmost non-zero:** The second loop iterates through the bottom row in reverse and adds the corresponding (FOUR, (height, j)) tuple to `fours` when encountering the first non-zero cell.
4. **Paint the fours:** `O = paint(I, fours)` paints the 4s at the determined locations.
5. **Return the modified grid:** `return O` returns the final grid.
