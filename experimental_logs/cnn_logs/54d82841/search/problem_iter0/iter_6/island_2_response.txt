## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation for all input-output pairs can be summarized as follows:

1. **Identify the Horizontal Extremes:** Find the leftmost and rightmost non-zero values in the bottom row of the input grid.
2. **Create Mirrored Points:**  For each of these extreme points, create a mirrored point in the same column, but on the bottom row of the grid.
3. **Fill with a Specific Value:**  Set the value of the mirrored points to '4'.

**Example:**

Let's look at Input_2:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 8 0 0 0
0 8 0 8 6 6 6
0 0 0 0 6 0 6
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
```

- The leftmost and rightmost non-zero values in the bottom row are in columns 2 and 6. 
- Mirroring these points to the bottom row results in coordinates (4, 2) and (4, 6).
-  These points are filled with '4' resulting in the output:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 8 0 0 0
0 8 0 8 6 6 6
0 0 0 0 6 0 6
0 0 4 0 0 4 0 
```

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" in the given DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the indices of the leftmost and rightmost non-zero values in the bottom row
  left_j = next((j for j, v in enumerate(I[-1]) if v != 0), None)
  right_j = len(I[-1]) - next((j for j, v in enumerate(I[-1][::-1]) if v != 0), None) - 1

  # Handle the case where the bottom row is all zeros
  if left_j is None or right_j is None:
    return I 

  # Create the mirrored points as an object
  mirrored_obj = frozenset({(FOUR, (height(I) - 1, left_j)), (FOUR, (height(I) - 1, right_j))})
  
  # Paint the mirrored object onto the grid
  O = paint(I, mirrored_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Extremes:** Iterates through the bottom row (`I[-1]`) to find the column indices (`left_j`, `right_j`) of the leftmost and rightmost non-zero values.
2. **Handle Edge Case:** If the bottom row is all zeros, `left_j` and `right_j` will be None. The program returns the input grid unchanged in this case.
3. **Create Mirrored Object:** Creates a `frozenset` representing the mirrored points directly, setting their values to '4' and using the calculated column indices and the bottom row index.
4. **Paint:** Uses the `paint` function to apply the mirrored points onto the input grid, resulting in the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Get the bottom row as an object
    bottom_row = asobject(I[height(I)-1:])
    # Find objects in the bottom row (excluding background)
    bottom_objs = objects(bottom_row, T, F, T)
    # Find the leftmost and rightmost objects
    leftmost_obj = argmin(bottom_objs, leftmost)
    rightmost_obj = argmax(bottom_objs, rightmost)
    # Extract leftmost and rightmost column indices
    left_j = leftmost(leftmost_obj)
    right_j = rightmost(rightmost_obj)
    # Create mirrored points
    mirrored_obj = frozenset({(FOUR, (height(I) - 1, left_j)), (FOUR, (height(I) - 1, right_j))})
    # Paint mirrored points onto the grid
    O = paint(I, mirrored_obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Isolate Bottom Row:** Extracts the bottom row as an object using `asobject(I[height(I)-1:])`.
2. **Find Extreme Objects:** Uses `objects` to find objects within the bottom row, excluding the background. Then, `argmin` and `argmax` are used with `leftmost` and `rightmost` respectively to find the leftmost and rightmost objects in the bottom row.
3. **Extract Indices:**  The `leftmost` and `rightmost` functions are used again to extract the column indices (`left_j`, `right_j`) from the extreme objects.
4. **Create & Paint:**  Similar to Version 1, a `frozenset` is created for the mirrored points and painted onto the input grid using `paint`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Find non-zero indices in the bottom row
    bottom_indices = sfilter(asindices(I[-1:]), lambda ij: index(I, ij) != 0)
    if bottom_indices:
      # Find the bounding box of non-zero indices
      patch = backdrop(bottom_indices)
      # Get leftmost and rightmost column indices
      left_j = leftmost(patch)
      right_j = rightmost(patch)
      # Create mirrored points
      mirrored_obj = frozenset({(FOUR, (height(I) - 1, left_j)), (FOUR, (height(I) - 1, right_j))})
      # Paint mirrored points onto the grid
      O = paint(I, mirrored_obj)
    else:
      O = I  # Return the input if the bottom row is all zeros
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Non-Zero Indices:** Uses `sfilter` and `asindices` to get the indices of non-zero values in the bottom row.
2. **Handle Empty Row:** If there are no non-zero values, the input grid is returned unchanged.
3. **Bounding Box & Indices:** If non-zero values exist, `backdrop` is used to get the bounding box of those indices, and `leftmost` and `rightmost` are used to extract the relevant column indices.
4. **Create & Paint:** Similar to previous versions, a `frozenset` for the mirrored points is created and painted onto the grid. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Create a set to store mirrored points
  mirrored_points = set()
  # Iterate over the bottom row
  for j, v in enumerate(I[-1]):
    if v != 0:  
      mirrored_points.add((FOUR, (height(I) - 1, j)))
  # Paint the mirrored points onto the grid
  O = paint(I, frozenset(mirrored_points))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Collect:** Directly iterates over the bottom row of the grid, adding the coordinates of any non-zero value to the `mirrored_points` set, along with the value '4'.
2. **Paint:** Converts the `mirrored_points` set to a `frozenset` and paints it onto the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Transpose the grid
  transposed = dmirror(I)
  # Find non-zero indices in the rightmost column
  right_indices = sfilter(asindices(transposed[-1:]), lambda ij: index(transposed, ij) != 0)
  if right_indices:
    # Find the bounding box of non-zero indices
    patch = backdrop(right_indices)
    # Get uppermost and lowermost row indices
    top_i = uppermost(patch)
    bottom_i = lowermost(patch)
    # Create mirrored points on the transposed grid
    mirrored_obj = frozenset({(FOUR, (top_i, width(transposed) - 1)), (FOUR, (bottom_i, width(transposed) - 1))})
    # Paint mirrored points and transpose back
    O = dmirror(paint(transposed, mirrored_obj))
  else:
    O = I # Return the input if the rightmost column is all zeros
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transpose:**  The grid is first transposed using `dmirror` to make the bottom row the rightmost column.
2. **Find Non-Zero Indices & Bounding Box:** Similar to Version 3, non-zero indices in the (now rightmost) column are found, and their bounding box is calculated.
3. **Extract Indices:**  The `uppermost` and `lowermost` functions are used to get the row indices of the extreme points.
4. **Create & Paint (Transposed):** Mirrored points are created on the *transposed* grid.
5. **Transpose Back:**  The grid is transposed back using `dmirror` to its original orientation before being returned.
