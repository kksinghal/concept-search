## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves placing two '4' values symmetrically on the bottom row of the input grid. The positions of these '4's are determined by dividing the grid's width into four equal sections. 

**Example:**

For a grid with width 8:

- Divide the width by 4: 8 / 4 = 2
- Place the first '4' at index 2 (counting from 0).
- Place the second '4' at index 6 (2 + 4).

**Handling Odd Widths:**

When the grid width is odd, the '4' values are placed slightly off-center to maintain symmetry. The exact placement logic ensures that the '4's are as close to the center of their respective sections as possible.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the `Program_to_be_generated` code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  w = width(I)
  offset = (w // 4)
  O = fill(I, 4, {(height(I) - 1, offset), (height(I) - 1,  3 * offset)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Calculate Offset:**  We determine the offset by dividing the grid's width by 4.
2.  **Place the '4's:** We use the `fill` function to place '4's at the calculated offset positions on the bottom row of the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  w = width(I)
  mid = w // 2
  quarter = w // 4
  O = fill(I, 4, {(height(I) - 1, mid - quarter), (height(I) - 1, mid + quarter)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Find Midpoint and Quarter:** We calculate the midpoint and quarter point of the grid's width.
2.  **Place the '4's:**  We place the '4's symmetrically around the midpoint, offset by the calculated quarter point.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  locs = {j for i, j in asindices(I) if i == height(I) - 1}
  offset = len(locs) // 4
  O = I
  c = 0
  for j in locs:
    if j == offset or j == 3 * offset:
      O = fill(O, 4, {(height(O) - 1, j)})
      c += 1
    if c == 2:
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Get Bottom Row Indices:** We obtain the indices of all cells in the bottom row.
2.  **Calculate Offset:** We calculate the offset based on the number of cells in the bottom row.
3.  **Iterate and Fill:** We iterate through the bottom row indices and place '4's at the calculated offset positions.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, 4, {(height(I)-1, width(I)//4), (height(I)-1, 3*width(I)//4)})
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly calculates the target indices within the `fill` function for a concise solution.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    w = width(I)
    h = height(I)
    for j in range(w):
        if j == w // 4 or j == 3 * w // 4:
            O = fill(O, 4, {(h-1, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Iterate through Columns:** The program iterates through each column of the last row.
2.  **Check for Target Columns:** It checks if the current column index (`j`) matches either of the target positions for placing the '4's.
3.  **Fill Target Cells:** If the current column is a target column, it uses the `fill` function to place a '4' at the corresponding position in the last row (`h-1`).
