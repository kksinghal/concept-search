## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the horizontal boundaries of the input grid and placing the digit '4' at specific locations on the bottom row of the grid. The placement of '4's depends on the width of the grid:

* **Even Width:** The '4's are placed symmetrically, leaving a central gap equal to half the width of the grid minus one.
* **Odd Width:** The '4's are placed symmetrically, leaving a central gap equal to half the width of the grid minus half.

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

* The input grid has an even width (8).
* The '4's are placed at positions (7, 2) and (7, 5), leaving a central gap of 3 (8/2 - 1).

**Input_1:**

* The input grid has an odd width (5).
* The '4's are placed at positions (4, 2) and (4, 2), leaving a central gap of 2 (5/2 - 1/2).

**Input_2:**

* The input grid has an even width (7).
* The '4's are placed at positions (4, 2) and (4, 4), leaving a central gap of 2 (7/2 - 1/2).


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  w = width(I)
  offset = 1 if even(w) else 0
  pos = w // 2 - offset
  line = hfrontier((height(I)-1, 0))
  left = shift((ZERO, first(line)), (0, pos))
  right = shift((ZERO, last(line)), (0, -pos))
  O = paint(paint(I, {left}), {right})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Calculates the width (`w`) of the input grid (`I`).
2. Determines the `offset` based on whether the width is even or odd.
3. Calculates the position (`pos`) to place the '4's from the center.
4. Extracts the bottom row (`line`) of the grid using `hfrontier`.
5. Creates two single-cell objects (`left` and `right`) representing the '4's at the calculated positions using the first and last cells of the bottom row.
6. Paints the '4's onto the input grid using the calculated positions.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  w = width(I)
  offset =  ONE - (w % TWO)
  p =  (height(I) - ONE, w // TWO - offset)
  O = fill(I, FOUR, {p, (p[ZERO], w - p[ONE] - ONE)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Calculates the width (`w`) of the input grid (`I`).
2. Determines the `offset` (0 for even width, 1 for odd width).
3. Calculates the position (`p`) of the left '4' on the bottom row.
4. Calculates the position of the right '4' based on the left '4' and grid width.
5. Directly fills the '4's at the calculated positions using `fill`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  w = width(I)
  mid = w // TWO
  O = I
  for j in range(mid):
    if j != mid - ONE - (w % TWO):
      O = fill(O, ZERO, {(height(I) - ONE, j), (height(I) - ONE, w - j - ONE)})
    else:
      O = fill(O, FOUR, {(height(I) - ONE, j), (height(I) - ONE, w - j - ONE)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Calculates the width (`w`) and middle point (`mid`) of the input grid (`I`).
2. Iterates through the columns from the left edge to the middle.
3. For each column, calculates the corresponding mirrored column on the right side.
4. If the column is not the central column (considering odd/even width), fills the bottom row positions with '0'.
5. If it is the central column, fills the bottom row positions with '4'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  w = width(I)
  line = hfrontier((height(I) - ONE, ZERO))
  line = apply(lambda c: (FOUR, c[ONE]), line)
  left = sfilter(line, lambda c: c[ONE][ONE] < w // TWO - ONE + (w % TWO))
  right = sfilter(line, lambda c: c[ONE][ONE] > w // TWO - (w % TWO))
  O = paint(paint(I, left), right)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Calculates the width (`w`) of the input grid (`I`).
2. Extracts the bottom row (`line`) and converts its values to '4' while keeping the indices.
3. Filters the line into two parts (`left` and `right`) based on their position relative to the calculated center.
4. Paints the 'left' and 'right' parts onto the input grid, effectively placing the '4's.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  w = width(I)
  gap = w // TWO - (ONE - (w % TWO))
  indices = {(height(I) - ONE, i) for i in range(w) if abs(i - w // TWO) > gap // TWO}
  O = fill(I, FOUR, indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Calculates the width (`w`) and the size of the central gap (`gap`).
2. Generates a set of indices (`indices`) on the bottom row that fall outside the central gap.
3. Fills the cells at the calculated `indices` with the value '4' using `fill`.

These five program versions showcase distinct logic and DSL function combinations to achieve the desired output. Each version provides a different perspective on solving the problem within the constraints of the provided DSL.
