## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects in the input grid and placing markers on the bottom row of the grid. These markers are placed symmetrically on either side of the object, offset from the object's leftmost and rightmost points by half the object's width. The markers use the color '4'. 

**Here's a breakdown of the transformation for each example:**

* **Input 0:** Two '6' objects are present. Markers are placed symmetrically below each object on the bottom row.
* **Input 1:** One '3' object is present. Markers are placed symmetrically below the object on the bottom row. 
* **Input 2:** Two objects are present: '8' and '6'.  Markers are placed symmetrically below each object on the bottom row.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program `Program_to_be_generated` using the DSL from `dsl.py`. Each version achieves the desired transformation by implementing the logic described above.


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def place_markers(obj):
    offset = width(obj) // 2
    left_marker = (height(I) - 1, leftmost(obj) - offset)
    right_marker = (height(I) - 1, rightmost(obj) + offset)
    return {left_marker, right_marker}

  markers = merge(apply(place_markers, objects(I, T, F, T)))
  return fill(I, 4, markers)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`place_markers(obj)` Function:** This function takes an object as input and calculates the positions for the left and right markers based on the object's width and position.
2. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies all non-background objects in the input grid `I`.
3. **`apply(place_markers, ...)`:** Applies the `place_markers` function to each object, generating a set of marker positions for each object.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Combines the sets of marker positions from all objects into a single set.
5. **`fill(I, 4, markers)`:**  Fills the input grid `I` with the color '4' at the calculated marker positions.


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               merge(frozenset({(4, (height(I) - 1, leftmost(obj) - width(obj) // 2)), 
                                 (4, (height(I) - 1, rightmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2))}) 
                            for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies all non-background objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Generator Expression:** For each object, a frozenset containing two tuples is created. Each tuple represents a marker with the color '4' and its calculated position on the bottom row.
3. **`merge(...)`:** Merges all the frozensets (representing marker positions) into a single frozenset.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the markers onto the input grid `I` at the specified positions.


### Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def marker_indices(obj):
    offset = width(obj) // 2
    return {(height(I) - 1, leftmost(obj) - offset), (height(I) - 1, rightmost(obj) + offset)}
  
  return fill(I, 4, merge(apply(marker_indices, objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`marker_indices(obj)` Function:**  Takes an object and returns a set containing the indices for placing markers.
2. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts all non-background objects from the grid.
3. **`apply(marker_indices, ...)`:**  Applies `marker_indices` to every object, yielding a set of marker positions for each object.
4. **`merge(...)`:**  Combines all the marker position sets into a single set.
5. **`fill(I, 4, ...)`:** Fills the input grid `I` with the color '4' at the determined marker positions.

### Program Version 4: 

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  marker_positions = set()
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    offset = width(obj) // 2
    marker_positions.add((height(I) - 1, leftmost(obj) - offset))
    marker_positions.add((height(I) - 1, rightmost(obj) + offset))
  return fill(I, 4, marker_positions)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`marker_positions = set()`:** Initializes an empty set to store marker positions.
2. **Loop through Objects:** Iterates through each non-background object in the input grid.
3. **Calculate and Add Marker Positions:** For each object, calculate the left and right marker positions and add them to the `marker_positions` set.
4. **`fill(I, 4, marker_positions)`:** Fills the input grid `I` with the color '4' at each position in the `marker_positions` set.


### Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def add_markers(grid, obj):
    offset = width(obj) // 2
    return fill(fill(grid, 4, {(height(I) - 1, leftmost(obj) - offset)}),
                4, {(height(I) - 1, rightmost(obj) + offset)})
  
  return reduce(add_markers, objects(I, T, F, T), I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`add_markers(grid, obj)` Function:** Takes the grid and an object as input. It then places markers on the grid based on the object's position and width, returning the modified grid.
2. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies all non-background objects in the grid.
3. **`reduce(add_markers, ..., I)`:**  Applies the `add_markers` function cumulatively to each object and the grid. It starts with the initial grid `I` and updates it with markers for each object. The final updated grid is returned. 

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation using the DSL, illustrating the flexibility and expressive power of the language.
