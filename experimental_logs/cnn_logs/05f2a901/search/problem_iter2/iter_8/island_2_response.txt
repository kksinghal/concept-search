## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to focus on repositioning the "2" object to the bottom of the grid and centering the "8" object. 

**Input 0:**

* The "2" object is moved from the top-middle to the bottom-middle.
* An "8" object is created at the center of the grid.

**Input 1:**

* The "2" object is moved from the top-left to the middle-right.
* An "8" object is created next to the repositioned "2" object.

**Input 2:**

* The "2" object is moved from the bottom-left to the middle of the grid.
* The existing "8" object remains in its position.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  obj2 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, TWO))
  obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, EIGHT), default=None)

  obj2_shifted = shift(obj2, (h - uppermost(obj2) - height(obj2), w // 2 - leftmost(obj2) - width(obj2) // 2)) 

  if obj8 is None:
    obj8_shifted = recolor(EIGHT, product(interval(h//2 - 1, h//2 + 1, 1), interval(w//2 - 1, w//2 + 1, 1)))
  else:
    obj8_shifted = shift(obj8, (h // 2 - uppermost(obj8) - height(obj8) // 2, w // 2 - leftmost(obj8) - width(obj8) // 2))

  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, (h, w)), obj2_shifted)
  O = paint(O, obj8_shifted)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The code first identifies the "2" and "8" objects (or the lack thereof) in the input grid.
2. **Shift "2" Object:** The "2" object is moved to the bottom center of the grid.
3. **Handle "8" Object:** If an "8" object exists, it's centered. Otherwise, a new 2x2 "8" object is created at the grid's center.
4. **Combine Objects:** The shifted "2" and "8" objects are painted onto a blank canvas to produce the output grid.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  obj2 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == TWO)
  obj8 = next((obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) == EIGHT), None)

  obj2_shifted = shift(obj2, (h - height(obj2), w // 2 - leftmost(obj2) - width(obj2) // 2)) 

  if obj8:
    obj8_shifted = shift(obj8, (h // 2 - uppermost(obj8) - height(obj8) // 2, 0))
  else:
    obj8_shifted = recolor(EIGHT, {(h//2 - 1, w//2 - 1), (h//2, w//2 - 1), (h//2 - 1, w//2), (h//2, w//2)})

  O = paint(paint(canvas(ZERO, (h, w)), obj2_shifted), obj8_shifted)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  The "2" and "8" objects are extracted. This version uses a generator expression for finding the "8" object.
2. **Relocate Objects:** The "2" object is moved to the bottom center, and the "8" object (or a new one) is placed at the horizontal center.
3. **Paint and Return:**  The modified objects are painted onto a blank canvas to create the output grid. 


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  obj2 = next((obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == TWO), None)
  
  bottom_row = h - 1
  obj2_shifted = shift(obj2, (bottom_row - lowermost(obj2), w // 2 - leftmost(obj2) - width(obj2) // 2))

  if any(color(obj) == EIGHT for obj in objs):
    obj8 = next(obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == EIGHT)
    obj8_shifted = shift(obj8, (h // 2 - uppermost(obj8) - height(obj8) // 2, w // 2 - leftmost(obj8) - width(obj8) // 2))
  else:
    obj8_shifted = recolor(EIGHT, product(range(h//2 - 1, h//2 + 1), range(w//2 - 1, w//2 + 1)))

  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, (h, w)), obj2_shifted)
  O = paint(O, obj8_shifted)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** Retrieves all objects, then iterates through them to find the "2" and "8" objects. 
2. **Shifting "2":** Calculates the shift needed to position "2" at the bottom center.
3. **Conditional "8" Handling:**  If an "8" object is present, it's centered. Otherwise, a new 2x2 "8" object is generated at the grid center.
4. **Grid Construction:**  The "2" and "8" objects are painted onto a blank canvas to form the output grid.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0]) 
  obj2 = next((frozenset(((I[i][j], (i, j)) for j in range(w) if I[i][j] == 2)) 
               for i in range(h) if any(I[i][j] == 2 for j in range(w))), frozenset())

  obj2_shifted = shift(obj2, (h - uppermost(obj2) - height(obj2), w//2 - leftmost(obj2) - width(obj2)//2))

  obj8_indices = set((i, j) for i in range(h) for j in range(w) if I[i][j] == 8)
  if obj8_indices:
    obj8_shifted = recolor(8, obj8_indices) 
  else:
    obj8_shifted = recolor(8, {(h//2-1, w//2-1), (h//2, w//2-1), (h//2-1, w//2), (h//2, w//2)})

  O = paint(canvas(0, (h, w)), obj2_shifted)
  O = paint(O, obj8_shifted) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Manual Object Finding:** This version iterates through the grid rows and columns directly to find the "2" object, simplifying the object extraction process. 
2. **"2" Positioning:**  The "2" object is shifted to the bottom center.
3. **"8" Object Logic:** It checks for existing "8" cells and uses their indices to form the "8" object. Otherwise, it creates a new 2x2 "8" object.
4. **Output Generation:**  The final output grid is constructed by painting the objects onto a blank canvas.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  
  obj2 = next((frozenset((I[row][col], (row, col)) for col in range(w) if I[row][col] == 2) 
               for row in range(h) if 2 in I[row]), frozenset()) 

  obj2_shifted = shift(obj2, (h - uppermost(obj2) - height(obj2), (w - width(obj2)) // 2))

  if 8 in merge(I): 
    obj8 = next((frozenset((I[row][col], (row, col)) for col in range(w) if I[row][col] == 8) 
                 for row in range(h) if 8 in I[row]), frozenset())
    obj8_shifted = shift(obj8, (h // 2 - uppermost(obj8) - height(obj8) // 2, w // 2 - leftmost(obj8) - width(obj8) // 2))
  else:
    obj8_shifted = recolor(8, {(h//2-1, w//2-1), (h//2, w//2-1), (h//2-1, w//2), (h//2, w//2)})

  O = paint(canvas(0, (h, w)), obj2_shifted)
  O = paint(O, obj8_shifted)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Simplified Object Search:**  This version streamlines the object identification process by iterating directly through rows and checking for the desired color.
2. **"2" Relocation:** The "2" object is moved to the bottom center of the grid.
3. **"8" Object Handling:** It efficiently checks for the presence of the "8" color and creates or repositions the object accordingly. 
4. **Grid Assembly:** The "2" and "8" objects are painted onto a blank canvas to produce the final output grid.
