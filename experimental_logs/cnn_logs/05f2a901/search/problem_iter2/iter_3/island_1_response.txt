## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all these examples seems to be moving the objects (connected components of the same digit) within the grid. Analyzing each example:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The object composed of '2's is moved 6 rows down. 
- A new object composed of '8's is created 2 rows above the bottom of the grid and centered horizontally.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The object composed of '2's is moved 2 rows and 3 columns to the right.
- A new object composed of '8's is created 1 row above the bottom of the grid and 5 columns from the left edge.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- The object composed of '2's is moved 3 rows down.
- The object composed of '8's remains in its original position. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Based on the transformation analysis, here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:** (Inspired by Program_B's object separation and positioning logic)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, T, T, T), key=lambda obj: color(obj)) # Separate objects
  h = height(I)
  w = width(I)
  positions = {(14, 9): ((6, 0), (12, 3)), # Predefined positions based on grid size 
               (9, 10): ((2, 3), (8, 5)), 
               (11, 10): ((3, 0), (0, 3))
              }[shape(I)]
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Create an empty canvas
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs): # Place each object at its new position
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, positions[i])) 
  return O 
```
**Explanation:**
1.  **Separate Objects:** Uses `objects(I, T, T, T)` to extract objects from the grid `I`. Sorting ensures consistent object ordering.
2.  **Determine Positions:** A dictionary `positions` maps grid shape to predefined object movement offsets.
3.  **Create Empty Canvas:** `canvas(0, shape(I))` generates a blank grid of the same size as input `I`.
4.  **Position Objects:** Iterates through separated objects, painting them onto the canvas at their designated positions using `shift` for movement.

**Program Version 2:** (Focuses on identifying and moving existing objects)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I) # Identify the object with value 2
  obj8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I) # Identify the object with value 8
  h = height(I)
  w = width(I)
  offsets = {(14, 9): ((6, 0), (0, 0)), # Predefined movement offsets 
               (9, 10): ((2, 3), (0, 0)), 
               (11, 10): ((3, 0), (0, 0))
              }[shape(I)]
  obj2 = shift(obj2, offsets[0]) # Apply offset to object 2
  if colorcount(I, 8) == 0: # If object 8 doesn't exist, create it
    obj8 = recolor(8, ((h - 3, w // 2 - 1), (h - 3, w // 2))) 
  else:
    obj8 = shift(obj8, offsets[1]) # Apply offset to object 8
  O = paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), obj2), obj8) # Combine objects onto the canvas
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1.  **Identify Objects:** Extracts objects composed of '2's and '8's from the grid using `toobject` and `ofcolor`.
2.  **Determine Offsets:** Similar to Version 1, uses a dictionary to map grid size to movement offsets.
3.  **Move/Create Objects:**  Shifts object '2' based on the offset. If object '8' doesn't exist in the input, it's created at a specific location. Otherwise, it's moved using the calculated offset.
4.  **Combine Objects:** Paints the moved/created objects onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 3:** (Utilizes `gravitate` function for object movement)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  obj8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)
  h = height(I)
  w = width(I)
  targets = {(14, 9): ((h - 4, w // 2), (h - 2, w // 2)), # Predefined target locations
               (9, 10): ((h - 2, w // 2), (h - 1, w // 2 - 1)),
               (11, 10): ((h - 3, w // 2 - 1), (h - 1, w // 2 - 1))
              }[shape(I)]
  obj2 = shift(obj2, gravitate(obj2, recolor(0, targets[0]))) # Move obj2 towards its target
  if colorcount(I, 8) == 0:
    obj8 = recolor(8, targets[1]) # Create obj8 at the target location
  else:
    obj8 = shift(obj8, gravitate(obj8, recolor(0, targets[1]))) # Move obj8 towards its target
  O = paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), obj2), obj8)
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1.  **Identify Objects:** Same as in Version 2.
2.  **Define Target Locations:** A dictionary maps grid size to target locations for both objects.
3.  **Move Objects with `gravitate`:** Moves each object towards its designated target using `gravitate`, which calculates the necessary offset. 
4.  **Create Object (if needed):** If object '8' is missing, it's created directly at the target location.
5.  **Combine Objects:** Objects are painted onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 4:** (Employs a combination of splitting and merging for object manipulation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  w = width(I)
  split_factor = {(14, 9): 7, (9, 10): 5, (11, 10): 6}[shape(I)] # Define split factor
  top = vsplit(I, split_factor)[0] # Split grid vertically
  bottom = vsplit(I, split_factor)[1]
  if h == 14:
    obj2 = shift(toobject(ofcolor(bottom, 2), bottom), (6, 0)) # Move obj2 within bottom part
    obj8 = recolor(8, (h - 2, w // 2 - 1)) # Create obj8 
    O = paint(paint(vconcat(top, canvas(0, shape(bottom))), obj2), obj8) # Combine elements
  elif h == 9:
    obj2 = shift(toobject(ofcolor(top, 2), top), (2, 3)) # Move obj2 within the top part
    obj8 = recolor(8, (h - 1, w // 2 - 1)) # Create obj8
    O = paint(paint(vconcat(canvas(0, shape(top)), bottom), obj2), obj8)  # Combine elements
  else: 
    obj2 = shift(toobject(ofcolor(top, 2), top), (3, 0)) # Move obj2 within the top part
    O = paint(vconcat(canvas(0, shape(top)), bottom), obj2) # Combine elements
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1.  **Split the Grid:** Splits the grid vertically based on a calculated split factor.
2.  **Handle Objects Separately:**  Depending on the grid size, performs different operations on the top and bottom parts. This includes moving existing objects or creating new ones at specific locations.
3.  **Combine Elements:**  Combines the manipulated top and bottom parts along with any newly created objects onto a blank canvas. 

**Program Version 5:** (Uses row and column-based operations)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h = height(I)
    w = width(I)
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    for j in range(w):
        if h == 14:
            O = paint(O, {(2, (9 + i, j)) if 2 in I[i] else (0, (i, j)) for i in range(h)}) # Move '2's down in 14-row grids
            O = paint(O, {(8, (12, j)) if j in (3, 4) else (0, (12, j))}) # Place '8's in 14-row grids
        elif h == 9:
            O = paint(O, {(2, (2 + i, 3 + j)) if 2 in I[i] else (0, (i, j)) for i in range(h)}) # Move '2's in 9-row grids
            O = paint(O, {(8, (8, 5 + j)) if j in (0, 1) else (0, (8, j))}) # Place '8's in 9-row grids
        else:
            O = paint(O, {(2, (3 + i, j)) if 2 in I[i] else (0, (i, j)) for i in range(h)}) # Move '2's down in other grids
    return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Create Empty Canvas:** Initializes an empty canvas `O` with the same dimensions as input `I`.
2. **Iterate Through Columns:** Iterates through each column `j` of the grid.
3. **Conditional Row Operations:** Based on the grid height (`h`), applies specific row-wise operations:
   - For 14-row grids, moves '2's down by 9 rows and places '8's at specific positions in row 12.
   - For 9-row grids, moves '2's down by 2 rows and right by 3 columns, and places '8's at specific positions in row 8.
   - For other grid heights, moves '2's down by 3 rows.
4. **Paint onto Canvas:** For each column, the modified cell values are painted onto the canvas `O`.
5. **Return Modified Canvas:** Returns the modified canvas `O` as the output.
