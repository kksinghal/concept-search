## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects in the input grid (groups of connected, non-zero digits) and moving them to specific locations in the output grid. The background remains unchanged (filled with zeros). Here's a breakdown for each example:

**Input_0:**

- **Object 1:** The "2" shaped object is moved from the top left corner to the bottom left corner.
- **Object 2:** The "8" shaped object is moved from the top center to the middle center. 

**Input_1:**

- **Object 1:** The "2" shaped object is moved downwards and slightly to the right.
- **Object 2:** The "8" shaped object is moved downwards and placed to the right of the "2" shaped object.

**Input_2:**

- **Object 1:** The "8" shaped object remains in the same location.
- **Object 2:** The "2" shaped object is moved upwards.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct code versions for achieving this transformation using the provided DSL:


### Program Version 1: 

**Code:**

```python
def solve_version1(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) 
  obj2 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == TWO)
  obj8 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == EIGHT)
  obj2_new = shift(obj2, (height(I) - height(obj2), 0)) 
  obj8_new = shift(obj8, (height(I) // 2 - height(obj8) // 2 - uppermost(obj8), 0))
  O = paint(paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), obj2_new), obj8_new)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The `objects` function identifies the "2" and "8" shaped objects. 
2. **Extract Objects:** The `extract` function separates the objects based on their color.
3. **Calculate New Positions:** The new positions for each object are calculated relative to the grid's height.
4. **Shift Objects:** The `shift` function moves the objects to their new positions.
5. **Create Output Grid:** A blank canvas is created using `canvas` and then painted with the shifted objects using `paint`.

### Program Version 2: 

**Code:**

```python
def solve_version2(I):
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, TWO), I)
  obj8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, EIGHT), I)
  O = paint(paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), shift(obj2, (height(I) - height(obj2), 0))), shift(obj8, (height(I) // 2 - centerofmass(obj8)[0], 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Object Indices:** The `ofcolor` function retrieves the indices of cells with color "2" and "8".
2. **Construct Objects:** The `toobject` function constructs the "2" and "8" shaped objects using their indices.
3. **Calculate New Positions:** New positions are determined based on the grid's height and object's center of mass.
4. **Shift and Paint:** Similar to version 1, the objects are shifted and painted onto a blank canvas.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_version3(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  obj_positions = {
    TWO: (height(I) - height(extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == TWO)), 0),
    EIGHT: (height(I) // 2 - height(extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == EIGHT)) // 2, 0)
  }
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, obj_positions[color(obj)]))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1, objects are identified using the `objects` function.
2. **Store Target Positions:** A dictionary stores the target positions for each object type based on its color.
3. **Iterate and Paint:** The code iterates through the identified objects, retrieves their target positions, and paints them onto a blank canvas.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_version4(I):
  h = height(I)
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, TWO), I)
  obj8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, EIGHT), I)
  O = fill(fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, shift(toindices(obj2), (h - height(obj2), 0))), EIGHT, shift(toindices(obj8), (h // 2 - centerofmass(obj8)[0], 0)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Retrieve Object Indices:** Similar to version 2, the `ofcolor` function is used to retrieve object cell indices.
2. **Construct and Shift Indices:** The `toindices` function extracts indices from the objects, which are then shifted to their target locations.
3. **Fill Canvas:** The `fill` function directly fills the blank canvas with the appropriate color at the calculated indices. 

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_version5(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    c = color(obj)
    if c == TWO:
      O = move(O, obj, (height(I) - height(obj), 0))
    elif c == EIGHT:
      O = move(O, obj, (height(I) // 2 - centerofmass(obj)[0], 0))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The `objects` function identifies the objects in the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Move:** The code iterates through the objects. Based on the object's color ("2" or "8"), it calculates the target position and uses the `move` function to directly move the object on the grid.



These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation using the DSL. Each version leverages different combinations of functions and logic, highlighting the flexibility of the DSL in solving spatial reasoning tasks.
