## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to involve moving objects of different colors to specific locations within the grid. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input 0 - Output 0:**

* The object composed of '2's is moved downwards to the bottom of the grid.
* The object composed of '8's does not exist in the input and is created new in the output, centered horizontally and placed above the '2' object.

**Input 1 - Output 1:**

* The object composed of '2's is moved downwards by a distance equal to its height and shifted right by a distance equal to its width. 
* The object composed of '8's is created new and placed to the right of the moved '2' object.

**Input 2 - Output 2:**

* The object composed of '2's is moved upwards until its top is aligned with the bottom of the '8' object.
* The object composed of '8's remains in its original position.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  obj2 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == TWO)
  obj8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, EIGHT), I)
  
  # Move '2' object
  obj2_shifted = shift(obj2, (h - height(obj2), width(obj2)))

  # Place '8' object (create new if it doesn't exist)
  if len(obj8) == 0:
    obj8_shifted = toobject(ofcolor(canvas(EIGHT, (2, 2)), EIGHT), canvas(EIGHT, (2, 2)))
    obj8_shifted = shift(obj8_shifted, (h // 2 - 1, width(obj2) + 1))
  else:
    obj8_shifted = obj8

  O = paint(paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), obj2_shifted), obj8_shifted)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extract the object composed of '2's and '8's. 
2. **Move '2' Object:** Shift the '2' object downwards by its height and right by its width.
3. **Place '8' Object:** If the '8' object doesn't exist, create a new one of size 2x2 and place it. If it exists, keep it in its original position.
4. **Paint Objects:** Paint the shifted '2' and '8' objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input. 


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, TWO), I)
  obj8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, EIGHT), I)
  
  # Move '2' object
  obj2_shifted = shift(obj2, (h - uppermost(obj2) - height(obj2), w - rightmost(obj2)))

  # Place '8' object (create new if it doesn't exist)
  if len(obj8) == 0:
    obj8_shifted = recolor(EIGHT, toindices(crop(I, (h // 2 - 1, w // 2 - 1), (2, 2))))
  else:
    obj8_shifted = obj8

  O = paint(paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), obj2_shifted), obj8_shifted)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Move '2' Object:** Shift the '2' object to the bottom right corner of the grid.
3. **Place '8' Object:** If it doesn't exist, create a new 2x2 '8' object at the center of the grid. If it exists, leave it untouched.
4. **Paint Objects:** Similar to Version 1.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  obj2 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == TWO)
  obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == EIGHT)

  # Move '2' object 
  if len(obj8) > 0:
    obj2_shifted = shift(obj2, (lowermost(obj8) - uppermost(obj2), 0))
  else:
    obj2_shifted = shift(obj2, (h - height(obj2), 0))

  # Place '8' object (create new if it doesn't exist)
  if len(obj8) == 0:
    obj8_shifted = recolor(EIGHT, {(h // 2 - 1, 5), (h // 2, 5), (h // 2 - 1, 6), (h // 2, 6)})
  else:
    obj8_shifted = obj8

  O = paint(paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), obj2_shifted), obj8_shifted)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Move '2' Object:** If the '8' object exists, align the top of the '2' object with the bottom of the '8' object. Otherwise, move the '2' object to the bottom of the grid.
3. **Place '8' Object:**  If it doesn't exist, create a new 2x2 '8' object at a specific location. Otherwise, keep its position.
4. **Paint Objects:** Similar to Version 1.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  w = width(I)
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, TWO), I)
  obj8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, EIGHT), I)

  # Move '2' object
  obj2_shifted = shift(obj2, (h - uppermost(obj2) - height(obj2), 0)) 

  # Place '8' object (create new if it doesn't exist)
  if len(obj8) == 0:
    obj8_shifted = recolor(EIGHT, {(h // 2 - 1, w // 2 - 1), (h // 2, w // 2 - 1), (h // 2 - 1, w // 2), (h // 2, w // 2)}) 
  else:
    obj8_shifted = obj8

  O = paint(paint(canvas(ZERO, (h, w)), obj2_shifted), obj8_shifted)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Move '2' object:** Shift the '2' object to the bottom of the grid.
3. **Place '8' object:**  If it doesn't exist, create a new 2x2 '8' object at the center of the grid. Otherwise, keep its position.
4. **Paint Objects:**  Similar to Version 1.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj2 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == TWO)
  obj8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, EIGHT), I)
  h = height(I)

  # Move '2' object
  obj2_shifted = shift(obj2, (h - height(obj2), 0)) 

  # Place '8' object (create new if it doesn't exist)
  if len(obj8) == 0:
    obj8_shifted = recolor(EIGHT, toindices(crop(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), (h // 2 - 1, len(I[0]) // 2 - 1), (2, 2))))
  else:
    obj8_shifted = obj8

  O = paint(paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), obj8_shifted), obj2_shifted)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Move '2' object:** Shift the '2' object to the bottom of the grid.
3. **Place '8' object:** If it doesn't exist, create a new 2x2 '8' object at the center of the grid. If it exists, leave it untouched.
4. **Paint Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
