## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving the objects made of "2" and "8" downwards to specific locations while preserving their original shape. The target locations depend on the input grid's dimensions:

**Input_0 (14x9):**
- Object "2" moves to the bottom-left, leaving one empty row above it. 
- Object "8" is created at the bottom center, two rows above the bottom.

**Input_1 (9x10):**
- Object "2" moves to the top center, leaving one empty row below it.
- Object "8" is created to the right of the moved "2" object, leaving one empty column between them.

**Input_2 (11x10):**
- Object "8" remains in its position.
- Object "2" moves above object "8," leaving one empty row between them.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h = height(I)
  w = width(I)
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  obj8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)
  if h == 14:
    obj2 = shift(obj2, (h-4-uppermost(obj2), w//2-leftmost(obj2)))
    obj8 = recolor(8, {(h-2, w//2-1), (h-2, w//2)})
  elif h == 9:
    obj2 = shift(obj2, (1-uppermost(obj2), w//2-leftmost(obj2)+1))
    obj8 = recolor(8, {(h-2, w//2), (h-2, w//2+1)})
  else:
    obj2 = shift(obj2, (3-uppermost(obj2), 0))
  O = paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), obj2), obj8)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Find the objects composed of "2" and "8" in the input grid.
2. **Calculate target positions:** Determine the target locations for each object based on the input grid height.
3. **Move/Create objects:**
    - If `h == 14`: Move object "2" to the bottom-left and create object "8" at the bottom center.
    - If `h == 9`:  Move object "2" to the top center and create object "8" to its right.
    - If `h == 11`: Move object "2" above object "8".
4. **Paint objects:** Paint the moved and/or created objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  target_positions = {(14, 9): {2: (h-4, w//2-1), 8: (h-2, w//2-1)},
                    (9, 10): {2: (1, w//2), 8: (h-2, w//2)},
                    (11, 10): {2: (3, 0), 8: (6, 0)}}
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for v in [2, 8]:
    obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, v), I)
    target_i, target_j = target_positions[(h, w)][v]
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (target_i - uppermost(obj), target_j - leftmost(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define target positions:** Create a dictionary storing target top-left corner coordinates for "2" and "8" objects based on grid dimensions.
2. **Iterate through colors:** Loop through colors "2" and "8."
3. **Retrieve target and move:** For each color, find the object, retrieve its target position from the dictionary, and shift it to the target location.
4. **Paint and return:** Paint the shifted object onto a blank canvas and return the final grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  if h == 14:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (h,w)), shift(toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I), (h-4-uppermost(toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)), w//2-leftmost(toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(h-2, w//2-1), (h-2, w//2)}))
  elif h == 9:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (h,w)), shift(toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I), (1-uppermost(toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)), w//2-leftmost(toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I))+1)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(h-2, w//2), (h-2, w//2+1)}))
  else:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (h,w)), shift(toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I), (6-uppermost(toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)), 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I), (3-uppermost(toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)), 0)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate dimensions:** Determine the height and width of the input grid.
2. **Conditional transformations:**
    - If `h == 14`: Move object "2" to the bottom-left and paint it. Then, create object "8" at the bottom center and paint it.
    - If `h == 9`:  Move object "2" to the top center and paint it. Then, create object "8" to its right and paint it.
    - If `h == 11`:  Move object "8" downwards and paint it. Then, move object "2" above object "8" and paint it.
3. **Return output:** Return the final grid with transformed objects.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  obj8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)
  if (h, w) == (14, 9):
    O = paint(paint(canvas(0, (h, w)), shift(obj2, (h-4-uppermost(obj2), w//2-leftmost(obj2)))), recolor(8, {(h-2, w//2-1), (h-2, w//2)}))
  elif (h, w) == (9, 10):
    O = paint(paint(canvas(0, (h, w)), shift(obj2, (1-uppermost(obj2), w//2-leftmost(obj2)+1))), recolor(8, {(h-2, w//2), (h-2, w//2+1)}))
  else:
    O = paint(paint(canvas(0, (h, w)), shift(obj8, (6-uppermost(obj8), 0))), shift(obj2, (3-uppermost(obj2), 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Find the objects composed of "2" and "8" in the input grid.
2. **Conditional transformations based on dimensions:**
    - If the dimensions are (14, 9): Move object "2" to the bottom-left, create object "8" at the bottom center, and paint both on a blank canvas.
    - If the dimensions are (9, 10): Move object "2" to the top center, create object "8" to its right, and paint both on a blank canvas.
    - If the dimensions are (11, 10): Move object "8" downwards, move object "2" above object "8," and paint both on a blank canvas.
3. **Return output:** Return the final grid with transformed objects.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h = height(I)
  w = width(I)
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  obj8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  if h == 14:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj2, (h-4-uppermost(obj2), w//2-leftmost(obj2))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(h-2, w//2-1), (h-2, w//2)}))
  elif h == 9:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj2, (1-uppermost(obj2), w//2-leftmost(obj2)+1)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(h-2, w//2), (h-2, w//2+1)}))
  else:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj8, (6-uppermost(obj8), 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj2, (3-uppermost(obj2), 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Find the objects composed of "2" and "8" in the input grid.
2. **Create a blank canvas:** Generate a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3. **Conditional transformations based on height:**
    - If the height is 14: Move object "2" to the bottom-left and paint it on the canvas. Then, create object "8" at the bottom center and paint it.
    - If the height is 9: Move object "2" to the top center and paint it on the canvas. Then, create object "8" to its right and paint it.
    - If the height is 11: Move object "8" downwards and paint it on the canvas. Then, move object "2" above object "8" and paint it.
4. **Return output:** Return the final canvas with transformed objects.

These five versions utilize different approaches and DSL function combinations to achieve the same transformation, showcasing diverse solutions for the given problem.
