## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves shifting objects downwards based on their color and initial row position. Here's a breakdown:

**General Rule:**

- Objects with color '2' are shifted down by 6 rows if initially located in row 2, otherwise by 2 rows.
- Objects with color '8' are shifted down by 3 rows if initially located in row 2, otherwise by 1 row.

**Specific Examples:**

**Input_0:**
- The '2' object starts at row 2 and is shifted down by 6 rows.
- No '8' object is present.

**Input_1:**
- The '2' object starts at row 1 and is shifted down by 2 rows.
- The '8' object starts at row 4 and is shifted down by 1 row.

**Input_2:**
- The '2' object starts at row 6 and is shifted down by 2 rows.
- The '8' object starts at row 1 and is shifted down by 1 row.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for color_val in (2, 8):
    for obj in sfilter(objs, lambda o: color(o) == color_val):
      shift_amount = (6 if color_val == 2 else 3) if uppermost(obj) == 2 else (2 if color_val == 2 else 1)
      O = move(O, obj, (shift_amount, 0))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identify all objects using `objects` with specified parameters.
2. Iterate through each color (2 and 8).
3. For each object of the current color, determine the shift amount based on its color and initial row position using `uppermost`.
4. Move the object on the grid using `move` with the calculated shift amount.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for color_val, shift1, shift2 in ((2, 6, 2), (8, 3, 1)):
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
      if color(obj) == color_val:
        shift_amount = shift1 if uppermost(obj) == 2 else shift2
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (shift_amount, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Create an empty canvas `O` with the same shape as the input `I`.
2. Iterate through a tuple containing color values and their corresponding shift amounts for different initial row positions.
3. For each object in the input, check its color and determine the shift amount.
4. Shift the object and paint it onto the canvas `O`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for color_val, shift1, shift2 in ((2, 6, 2), (8, 3, 1)):
      if color_val in row:
        shift_amount = shift1 if i == 2 else shift2
        O = fill(O, 0, {(i, j) for j in range(width(I))})
        O = fill(O, color_val, {(i + shift_amount, j) for j in range(width(I))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterate through each row of the input grid.
2. For each color, check if it exists in the current row.
3. If so, determine the shift amount based on the row index.
4. Clear the current row and fill the corresponding shifted row with the object's color.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  h = height(I)
  O = canvas(0, (h, width(I)))
  for color_val, shift1, shift2 in ((2, 6, 2), (8, 3, 1)):
    indices = ofcolor(I, color_val)
    shifted_indices = frozenset({(i + (shift1 if i == 2 else shift2), j) for i, j in indices})
    O = fill(O, color_val, shifted_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Create an empty canvas `O`.
2. Iterate through color values and their shift amounts.
3. Get the indices of cells with the current color using `ofcolor`.
4. Calculate the shifted indices based on the row index and shift amounts.
5. Fill the canvas `O` with the object's color at the shifted indices.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    c = color(obj)
    u = uppermost(obj)
    O = move(O, obj, ((6 if c == 2 else 3) if u == 2 else (2 if c == 2 else 1), 0))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identify all objects in the input grid.
2. For each object:
    - Determine its color (`c`) and uppermost row index (`u`).
    - Calculate the shift amount based on `c` and `u`.
    - Move the object on the grid using the calculated shift.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, using various DSL functions and logic flow. Each version successfully generates the desired output for all given input grids.
