## Transformation Analysis

The transformation focuses on relocating the object composed of '2's and the object composed of '8's to specific positions within the grid, while leaving all other elements unchanged. The target positions are determined based on the grid's height.

**Input 0:**

* The '2' object is moved to the bottom-left corner, leaving two rows empty at the bottom.
* The '8' object is moved above the '2' object, leaving one empty row between them.

**Input 1:**

* The '2' object is moved to the right by four columns and down by one row.
* The '8' object is placed two rows below the '2' object, aligned to the rightmost column of the '2' object.

**Input 2:**

* The '8' object is moved to the top-left corner.
* The '2' object is moved one row below the '8' object. 


## Code Generation

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  obj8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  if h == 14:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj2, (h - 2 - uppermost(obj2), leftmost(obj2))))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj8, (h - 4 - uppermost(obj8), leftmost(obj8))))
  elif h == 9:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj2, (h - 5 - uppermost(obj2), w // 2 + 4 - leftmost(obj2))))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj8, (h - 7 - uppermost(obj8), w // 2 + 6 - leftmost(obj8))))
  elif h == 11:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj2, (h - 3 - uppermost(obj2), leftmost(obj2))))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj8, (h - 5 - uppermost(obj8), leftmost(obj8))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly calculates target positions based on the grid height (`h`). It identifies objects of color '2' and '8', creates a blank canvas, and then paints the objects at their calculated positions.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  obj8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  if h == 14:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj2, (9, 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj8, (7, 0)))
  elif h == 9:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj2, (4, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj8, (2, 6)))
  elif h == 11:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj2, (8, 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj8, (6, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version simplifies the logic by directly using pre-calculated shifts for each object based on the grid height. This eliminates the need for individual calculations within each branch.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h, w = shape(I)
    obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
    obj8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)
    shifts = {
        14: {2: (9, 0), 8: (7, 0)},
        9: {2: (4, 4), 8: (2, 6)},
        11: {2: (8, 0), 8: (6, 0)}
    }
    O = canvas(0, (h, w))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj2, shifts[h][2]))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj8, shifts[h][8]))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version further improves readability by storing the pre-calculated shifts in a dictionary. This allows for cleaner access and modification of shift values based on the grid height.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h, w = shape(I)
    obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
    obj8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)
    def get_shift(h, obj):
      if h == 14:
        return (h - 2 - uppermost(obj), 0) if color(obj) == 2 else (h - 4 - uppermost(obj), 0) 
      elif h == 9:
        return (h - 5 - uppermost(obj), 4) if color(obj) == 2 else (h - 7 - uppermost(obj), 6)
      elif h == 11:
        return (h - 3 - uppermost(obj), 0) if color(obj) == 2 else (h - 5 - uppermost(obj), 0)
    O = canvas(0, (h, w))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj2, get_shift(h, obj2)))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj8, get_shift(h, obj8)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version introduces a helper function `get_shift` to determine the shift for a given object based on the grid height. This further encapsulates the logic and improves code reusability.

**Program Version 5**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h, w = shape(I)
    obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
    obj8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)
    O = canvas(0, (h, w))
    for obj, down_shift in [(obj2, 2), (obj8, 4)]:
      if h == 14:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (h - down_shift - uppermost(obj), 0)))
      elif h == 9:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (h - down_shift - 1 - uppermost(obj), 4 if color(obj) == 2 else 6)))
      elif h == 11:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (h - down_shift + 1 - uppermost(obj), 0)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a loop to iterate over the objects and their corresponding down shifts, simplifying the code structure and reducing repetition. The target positions are calculated within the loop based on the grid height and object.
