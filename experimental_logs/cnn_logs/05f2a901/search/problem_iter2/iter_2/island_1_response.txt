## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently repositions two distinct objects within the input grid to specific locations in the output grid, maintaining their original shape and orientation. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** 
- The object composed of '2's is moved from the top-left corner to the bottom-left corner.
- The object composed of '8's (not present in the input) is added to the grid just above the repositioned '2' object.

**Pair 1:** 
- The '2' object is moved downwards and slightly to the right.
- The '8' object is placed to the right of the '2' object.

**Pair 2:** 
- The '2' object is moved upwards. 
- The '8' object remains in its original position.

## Code Generation:

Based on the transformation analysis, here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated":

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  obj2 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  obj8 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 8) if any(color(o) == 8 for o in objs) else recolor(8, {(0, 0)})
  h = height(I)
  if h == 14:
    O = paint(paint(canvas(0, (14, 9)), shift(obj2, (9, 1))), shift(obj8, (8, 1)))
  elif h == 10:
    O = paint(paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), shift(obj2, (4, 4))), shift(obj8, (4, 6)))
  else:
    O = paint(paint(canvas(0, (11, 10)), shift(obj2, (3, 2))), shift(obj8, (0, 2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extracts objects composed of '2' and '8'. If '8' is absent, creates a dummy '8' object.
2. **Grid-Specific Positioning:** Based on grid height, applies predefined offsets to place the objects in their target locations.
3. **Canvas and Painting:** Uses a blank canvas and 'paint' to construct the output grid with repositioned objects.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  obj8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I) if colorcount(I, 8) > 0 else recolor(8, {(0, 0)})
  h = height(I)
  if h == 14:
    O = paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shift(obj2, (9, 1))), shift(obj8, (8, 1)))
  elif h == 10:
    O = paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shift(obj2, (5, 3))), shift(obj8, (5, 5)))
  else:
    O = paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shift(obj2, (4, 2))), shift(obj8, (0, 2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction via Indices:**  Identifies object indices using 'ofcolor' and constructs objects using 'toobject'.
2. **Conditional '8' Object:**  Handles cases where the '8' object is absent.
3. **Grid-Specific Placement:** Similar to version 1, uses grid height for object positioning.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  positions = {(14, 9): ((9, 1), (8, 1)), 
               (10, 10): ((4, 4), (4, 6)), 
               (11, 10): ((4, 2), (0, 2))
              }[shape(I)]
  obj2 = shift(toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I), positions[0])
  obj8 = shift(toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I), positions[1]) if colorcount(I, 8) > 0 else recolor(8, positions[1][0])
  O = paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), obj2), obj8)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Predefined Position Mapping:**  Utilizes a dictionary to map grid shapes to corresponding object positions.
2. **Simultaneous Shifting:**  Shifts both objects to their target locations during object construction. 

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  obj8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I) if colorcount(I, 8) > 0 else recolor(8, {(0, 0)})
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj, pos in zip([obj2, obj8], [(9, 1), (8, 1)] if h == 14 else [(4, 4), (4, 6)] if h == 10 else [(4, 2), (0, 2)]):
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, pos))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object and Position Lists:**  Creates lists to store objects and their target positions.
2. **Iterative Painting:**  Iterates through the lists, painting each object at its designated position.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  obj2 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  obj8 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 8) if any(color(o) == 8 for o in objs) else recolor(8, {(0, 0)})
  if h == 14:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (14, 9)), shift(obj2, (9, 1)))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj8, (8, 1)))
  elif h == 10:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (10, 10)), shift(obj2, (4, 4)))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj8, (4, 6)))
  else:
    O = paint(canvas(0, (11, 10)), shift(obj2, (4, 2)))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj8, (0, 2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Separate Painting:** Instead of nested painting, it paints each object onto the canvas separately.
2. **Direct Positioning:** Similar to other versions, it uses grid height to determine the target positions.


These versions employ a variety of approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing diverse applications of the provided DSL functions. Each version offers a distinct logical path while ensuring the accurate repositioning of objects within the grid.
