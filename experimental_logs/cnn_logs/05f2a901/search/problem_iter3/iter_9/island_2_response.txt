## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to extract objects of color '2' and '8' from the input grid and move them to the bottom of the grid without changing their internal structure. The objects maintain their original horizontal position while their vertical placement shifts to occupy the bottom rows of the grid.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The '2' object is moved down to occupy rows 9 and 10.
- The '8' object is moved down to occupy rows 11 and 12.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The '2' object is moved down to occupy rows 2, 3, 4, and partially 5.
- The '8' object is moved down and placed next to the '2' object, occupying a portion of row 5 and row 6.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- The '8' object is moved down to occupy rows 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- The '2' object is moved down to occupy rows 4, 5, and 6, overlapping with the '8' object.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions in the provided DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    obj2 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
    obj8 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
    h = height(I)
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    if obj2:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj2, (h - height(obj2) - uppermost(obj2), 0)))
    if obj8:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj8, (h - height(obj8) - uppermost(obj8), 0)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. Extract objects of color '2' and '8' from the input grid `I` using `objects`, `extract`, and `color`.
2. Create a blank canvas `O` with the same shape as the input grid using `canvas` and `shape`.
3. Calculate the vertical shift required to move each object to the bottom using `height` and `uppermost`.
4. Paint the shifted objects onto the canvas using `paint` and `shift`.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  def move_down(obj):
    return shift(obj, (h - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), 0))
  return paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), move_down(extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2))), move_down(extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)))
```

**Explanation:**
1. Define a helper function `move_down` to calculate the downward shift for any given object.
2. Extract objects of color '2' and '8' within the main function call.
3. Apply `move_down` to each extracted object.
4. Paint the shifted objects directly onto the canvas created using `canvas` and `shape`.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h, w = shape(I)
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    def shift_bottom(obj):
        return shift(obj, (h - uppermost(obj) - height(obj), 0))
    shifted_objs = apply(shift_bottom, objs)
    O = canvas(0, (h, w))
    for obj in shifted_objs:
        O = paint(O, obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. Extract all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. Define a function `shift_bottom` to calculate the shift needed to move an object to the bottom.
3. Apply `shift_bottom` to all extracted objects.
4. Create a blank canvas `O` and iteratively paint each shifted object onto the canvas.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  h = height(I)
  def reposition(obj):
    return shift(obj, (h - uppermost(obj) - height(obj),  -leftmost(obj)))
  shifted_objs = apply(reposition, objs)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in shifted_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. Extract all objects from the input grid.
2. Define a function `reposition` to shift an object to the bottom and align its left edge with the left edge of the canvas.
3. Apply `reposition` to all extracted objects.
4. Create a blank canvas and iteratively paint each repositioned object onto the canvas.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  def move_to_bottom(obj):
    return shift(obj, (h - uppermost(obj) - height(obj), 0))
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) in (2, 8))
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(apply(move_to_bottom, filtered_objs)))
```

**Explanation:**
1. Define a helper function `move_to_bottom` to shift an object to the bottom.
2. Filter the extracted objects to keep only those with color '2' or '8'.
3. Apply `move_to_bottom` to each filtered object.
4. Merge all shifted objects and paint them onto a blank canvas created with the same shape as the input grid.

These five program versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the desired transformation using the DSL. Each version utilizes distinct function combinations and logical flow, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL in solving spatial reasoning tasks.
