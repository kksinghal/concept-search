## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying and moving specific objects within the grid downwards. The objects are defined by their unique color values, and the movement is determined by the object's position relative to other objects in the input grid. 

**Input 0:**
- The '2' object is moved down to the 9th and 10th rows.
- The '8' object is moved down to the 11th and 12th rows.

**Input 1:**
- The '2' object is moved down to the 2nd to 5th rows, shifted right by 5 columns.
- The '8' object is moved down to the 5th and 6th rows, shifted right by 7 columns.

**Input 2:**
- The '8' object remains in its original position.
- The '2' object is moved down to the 4th to 6th rows. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct programs ("Program_to_be_generated") that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    obj2 = extract(objs, lambda o: color(o) == 2)
    obj8 = extract(objs, lambda o: color(o) == 8)
    
    new_obj2 = shift(obj2, (height(I) - height(obj2) - uppermost(obj2), 0))
    new_obj8 = shift(obj8, (height(I) - height(obj8) - uppermost(obj8), 0))

    O = paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), new_obj2), new_obj8)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Extract the objects with color '2' and '8'.
2. **Calculate New Positions:** Determine the new starting row for each object to be positioned at the bottom.
3. **Shift Objects:** Move the objects to their new positions.
4. **Paint Objects:** Create a blank canvas and paint the shifted objects onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj2 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  obj8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)
  h = height(I)
  
  O = paint(
      paint(
          canvas(0, shape(I)), 
          shift(obj2, (h - uppermost(obj2) - height(obj2), 0))
      ),
      shift(obj8, (h - uppermost(obj8) - height(obj8), 0))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Find the indices of cells with color '2' and '8', then convert them to objects.
2. **Calculate New Positions:** Determine the new starting row for each object based on their original position and the grid height.
3. **Shift and Paint:** Create a blank canvas and sequentially paint the shifted '2' and '8' objects onto it.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h = height(I)
  return paint(
      paint(
          canvas(0, shape(I)), 
          recolor(2, shift(ofcolor(I, 2), (h - lowermost(ofcolor(I, 2)), 0)))
      ), 
      recolor(8, shift(ofcolor(I, 8), (h - lowermost(ofcolor(I, 8)), 0)))
  )
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Target Positions:** Calculate the new starting row for each color based on their lowest occurrence in the input.
2. **Shift and Recolor:** Shift the indices of cells with color '2' and '8' to their new positions and recolor them.
3. **Paint on Canvas:** Create a blank canvas and paint the recolored indices.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def move_down(color_val):
    indices = ofcolor(I, color_val)
    return recolor(color_val, shift(indices, (height(I) - lowermost(indices), 0)))

  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for color_val in palette(I) - {0}:
    O = paint(O, move_down(color_val))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Define `move_down` Function:** This function takes a color value and moves all cells of that color to the bottom of the grid.
2. **Iterate Through Colors:** Apply the `move_down` function to each non-background color in the input grid.
3. **Paint on Canvas:** Create a blank canvas and paint the moved objects onto it.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def new_pos(obj):
    return (height(I) - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), 0)
  
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)), 
      merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, new_pos(obj)), objects(I, T, F, T)))
  )
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Define `new_pos` Function:** This function calculates the new starting position of an object to be at the bottom.
2. **Process Objects:** Extract all objects from the input grid and apply the `new_pos` and `shift` functions to each object.
3. **Paint on Canvas:** Create a blank canvas and paint the merged set of shifted objects.


Each of these program versions provides a distinct approach to achieving the desired transformation, demonstrating diverse logic and DSL function combinations.
