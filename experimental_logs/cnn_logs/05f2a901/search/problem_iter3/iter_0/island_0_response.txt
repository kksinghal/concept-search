## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving objects within the grid based on their color and size. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** 
* The '2' object moves to the bottom-left corner of the grid.
* The '8' object moves two rows below its original position.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:** 
* The '2' object moves one row down and one column right.
* An '8' object appears adjacent to the right of the '2' object, spanning the bottom two rows. 

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
* The '8' object moves to the top of the grid. 
* The '2' object moves three rows up.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_transformation(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, True, True) 
  h, w = shape(I)

  for obj in objs:
    value = color(obj) 
    if value == 2:
      obj = shift(obj, (h - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj)))  
    elif value == 8:
      obj = shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), 0))  
    I = paint(cover(I, obj), obj) 

  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We use `objects(I, True, True, True)` to identify all distinct objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate and Move:** For each object:
    * If the object's color (`value`) is 2, we shift it to the bottom-left corner using `shift(obj, (h - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj))).`
    * If the object's color is 8, we shift it to the top using `shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), 0))`.
    * We then use `paint(cover(I, obj), obj)` to "erase" the object from its original position and redraw it at its new location.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_transformation(I):
  twos = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  eights = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)
  h, w = shape(I)
  I = cover(I, twos)
  I = cover(I, eights)
  I = paint(I, shift(twos, (h - height(twos), 0)))  
  I = paint(I, shift(eights, (-uppermost(eights), 0)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** We directly extract the '2' and '8' objects using `toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)` and `toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)`, respectively.
2. **Cover Existing Objects:** We use `cover` to remove both objects from their original positions on the grid.
3. **Repaint at New Locations:** 
    * We repaint the '2' object at the bottom using `shift(twos, (h - height(twos), 0))`.
    * We repaint the '8' object at the top using `shift(eights, (-uppermost(eights), 0))`.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_transformation(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, True, True)
  h = height(I)
  I = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Clear the grid
  for obj in objs:
    c = color(obj)
    if c == 2: 
      I = paint(I, shift(obj, (h-height(obj), 0)))
    elif c == 8: 
      I = paint(I, shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), 0))) 
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Clear:** Identify objects, then clear the entire grid using `canvas(0, shape(I))`.
2. **Selective Repainting:**  Iterate through objects:
    * If color is 2, paint at the bottom.
    * If color is 8, paint at the top.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def move_object(obj, grid):
  c = color(obj)
  h = height(grid)
  if c == 2:
    return shift(obj, (h - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj)))
  elif c == 8:
    return shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), 0))
  return obj 

def solve_transformation(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, True, True)
  I = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    I = paint(I, move_object(obj, I)) 
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Helper Function:** Introduces `move_object` to handle specific object movements based on color.
2. **Clear and Repaint:** Clears the grid, then iterates through objects, using the helper function to determine and apply the correct movement before repainting.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_transformation(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  twos = ofcolor(I, 2)
  eights = ofcolor(I, 8)
  I = canvas(0, (h, w))  
  I = fill(I, 2, shift(twos, (h - height(twos) - uppermost(twos), -leftmost(twos)))) 
  I = fill(I, 8, shift(eights, (-uppermost(eights), 0)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Manipulation with Indices:**  Instead of working with objects directly, this version primarily manipulates indices. 
2. **Clear and Fill:**  Clears the grid, then uses `fill` to place the colors at the desired locations based on calculated index shifts. This avoids iterating through objects altogether.
