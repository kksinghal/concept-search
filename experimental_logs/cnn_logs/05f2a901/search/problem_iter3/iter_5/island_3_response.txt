## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of color '2' and '8', and moving them to the bottom of the grid while preserving their relative positions. 

**Input 0:** 
- The '2' object is moved to the bottom left corner. 
- The '8' object is moved below the '2' object.

**Input 1:**
- The '2' object is moved to the bottom center.
- The '8' object is placed to the right of the '2' object, also at the bottom.

**Input 2:**
- The '8' object remains in its position at the top.
- The '2' object is moved directly below the '8' object.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1: Using `shift` and object properties**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), TWO))
  obj8 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), EIGHT))
  h = height(I)
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  O = paint(O, shift(obj2, (h - height(obj2), 0)))
  O = paint(O, shift(obj8, (h - height(obj2) - height(obj8), 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** We find the objects corresponding to colors '2' and '8' using `objects`, `colorfilter`, and `first`.
2. **Calculate positions:** We calculate the target bottom-left positions for both objects based on their heights and the grid height.
3. **Create canvas:** We initialize an empty canvas `O` of the same shape as the input grid `I`.
4. **Paint objects:** We use `paint` and `shift` to place the '2' object at the calculated position, and then the '8' object below it.

**Version 2: Using `extract` and `add`**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  twos = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda x: color(x) == TWO)
  eights = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda x: color(x) == EIGHT)
  bottom_left = (height(I) - height(twos), 0)
  O = paint(paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), shift(twos, bottom_left)), 
            shift(eights, add(bottom_left, (height(twos), 0))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:**  Similar to version 1, we identify the objects, this time using `extract`.
2. **Calculate base position:** We calculate the bottom-left position for the '2' object.
3. **Paint with offset:** We paint the '2' object at the base position and the '8' object below it by adding an offset to the base position.

**Version 3: Using `recolor` and corner manipulation**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  two = first(colorfilter(objs, TWO))
  eight = first(colorfilter(objs, EIGHT))
  h = height(I)
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  O = paint(O, shift(two, (h - height(two), -leftmost(two))))
  O = paint(O, shift(eight, (h - height(two) - height(eight), -leftmost(eight))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Obtain objects:** We find the '2' and '8' objects.
2. **Adjust for leftmost:** We calculate the shift values considering both height and leftmost position of each object.
3. **Paint with adjustments:** Objects are painted onto the canvas with the calculated shifts.

**Version 4: Iterating over objects and conditional shifting**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  h = height(I)
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  current_height = h
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == TWO:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (current_height - height(obj), 0)))
      current_height -= height(obj)
    elif color(obj) == EIGHT:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (current_height - height(obj), 0)))
      current_height -= height(obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and identify:** This version iterates over all objects and identifies '2' and '8' objects within the loop.
2. **Dynamic height adjustment:** The `current_height` variable is used to dynamically adjust the vertical placement of each relevant object.

**Version 5: Using `vconcat` for vertical stacking**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), TWO))
  obj8 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), EIGHT))
  h = height(I)
  empty_grid = canvas(ZERO, (h - height(obj2) - height(obj8), width(I)))
  O = vconcat(empty_grid, shift(obj2, (0, 0)))
  O = vconcat(O, shift(obj8, (0, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Similar to previous versions, we first identify the '2' and '8' objects.
2. **Create empty space:** We create an empty grid representing the space above the objects in the final output.
3. **Vertically stack:**  We use `vconcat` to stack the empty grid, followed by the '2' object and then the '8' object to achieve the final output. 

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to solve the given transformation using different DSL functions and logic. Each version offers a distinct perspective while achieving the same output for all input examples.
