## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid and moving them to specific locations in the output grid. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The '2' object is moved to the bottom-left corner.
- The '8' object is moved below the '2' object.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The '2' object is moved to the right and down by a few cells.
- The '8' object is moved to the right of the '2' object. 

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- The '8' object remains in place.
- The '2' object is moved above the '8' object.


## Program Versions & Explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    twos = first(sizefilter(objs, colorcount(I, TWO)))
    eights = first(sizefilter(objs, colorcount(I, EIGHT)))
    bottom_left = (height(I) - height(twos), 0)
    O = paint(paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), shift(twos, bottom_left)), shift(eights, add(bottom_left, (height(twos), 0))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies objects (connected regions of the same digit).
2. **Filter Objects:** `sizefilter(objs, colorcount(I, TWO))` and `sizefilter(objs, colorcount(I, EIGHT))` filter for the objects consisting of '2's and '8's respectively. `first` selects the first object from the filtered sets.
3. **Calculate Target Positions:**  `bottom_left` calculates the target position for the '2' object (bottom-left corner). The '8' object's target position is calculated relative to the '2' object.
4. **Construct Output:** A blank canvas is created using `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`. The objects are then shifted to their target locations using `shift` and painted onto the canvas using `paint`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    obj2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), TWO))
    obj8 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), EIGHT))
    h, w = shape(I)
    pos2 = (h - height(obj2), 0)
    pos8 = (h - height(obj2) - height(obj8), 0)
    O = paint(cover(I, obj2), shift(obj2, pos2))
    O = paint(cover(O, obj8), shift(obj8, pos8))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Filter Objects:** Similar to version 1, it identifies objects and filters for '2' and '8' objects.
2. **Calculate Target Positions:**  Calculates target positions for both objects, placing the '2' object at the bottom-left corner and the '8' object above it.
3. **Construct Output:** The original grid is used as the base. The objects are then covered (removed) using `cover`, shifted to their target positions using `shift`, and painted back onto the grid using `paint`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    two = extract(objs, lambda x: color(x) == TWO)
    eight = extract(objs, lambda x: color(x) == EIGHT)
    h = height(I)
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    O = paint(O, shift(two, (h - height(two), 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(eight, (h - height(two) - height(eight), 0)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Filter Objects:**  Uses `objects` to find all objects.  Then `extract` finds the specific object containing the color '2' and '8'.
2. **Calculate Target Positions:** Calculates target positions, similar to previous versions.
3. **Construct Output:** Creates a blank canvas and paints the '2' and '8' objects onto it at their calculated target positions.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    obj2 = argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda x: color(x) == TWO and size(x))
    obj8 = argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda x: color(x) == EIGHT and size(x))
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj2, (height(I) - height(obj2), 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj8, (height(O) - height(obj2) - height(obj8), 0)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Filter Objects:** `argmax` is used to directly extract the largest object with the color '2' and '8' respectively.
2. **Calculate Target Positions:** Target positions are calculated similarly to previous versions.
3. **Construct Output:** A blank canvas is created, and the objects are painted onto it at their target positions.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    obj2 = next(o for o in objects(I, T, F, T) if color(o) == TWO)
    obj8 = next(o for o in objects(I, T, F, T) if color(o) == EIGHT)
    h = height(I)
    canvas_ = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, shift(obj2, (h - height(obj2), 0)))
    canvas_ = paint(canvas_, shift(obj8, (h - height(obj2) - height(obj8), 0)))
    return canvas_
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Filter Objects:**  This version iterates through the identified objects and extracts the first object that has the color '2' and '8'.
2. **Calculate Target Positions:** Similar to other versions, it calculates the target positions.
3. **Construct Output:** A blank canvas is created and the objects are painted at their target positions.
