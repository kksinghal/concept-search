## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving objects (groups of connected, same-valued cells) within the grid.  Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** 
* The '2' object is moved down to the bottom of the grid, centered horizontally. 
* Two '8's are placed in a horizontal line, centered horizontally, two rows above the '2' object.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
* The '2' object is moved down one row. 
* Two '8's are placed in a horizontal line, to the right of the '2' object, forming a single row.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
* The '8' object is moved to the top of the grid, maintaining its horizontal position. 
* The '2' object is moved up three rows.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1**

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  h, w = shape(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  if h == 14:
    two_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
    eight_obj = recolor(8, {(h-2, w//2-1), (h-2, w//2)})
    O = paint(canvas(bg, (h,w)), shift(two_obj, (h-4-uppermost(two_obj), w//2-leftmost(two_obj))))
    O = paint(O, eight_obj)
  elif h == 9:
    two_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
    eight_obj = recolor(8, {(h-2, w//2), (h-2, w//2+1)})
    O = paint(canvas(bg, (h,w)), shift(two_obj, (1-uppermost(two_obj), w//2-leftmost(two_obj)+1)))
    O = paint(O, eight_obj)
  else:
    two_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
    eight_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
    O = paint(canvas(bg, (h,w)), shift(eight_obj, (2-uppermost(eight_obj), 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(two_obj, (3-uppermost(two_obj), 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The program starts by identifying all distinct objects in the grid using `objects(I, T, T, T)`.
2. **Grid Dimensions:** It calculates the height (`h`) and width (`w`) of the input grid using `shape(I)`.
3. **Conditional Transformations:**  Based on the grid height, the program applies different transformations:
    * **h == 14 (Input_0):** The '2' object is moved to the bottom center, and two '8's are placed two rows above it.
    * **h == 9 (Input_1):** The '2' object is moved one row down, and two '8's are placed to its right.
    * **h == 11 (Input_2):** The '8' object is moved to the top, and the '2' object is moved up three rows.
4. **Object Painting:** The `paint()` function is used to draw the objects at their new positions on a blank canvas created using `canvas(bg, (h,w))`.

**Program Version 2**

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  h, w = shape(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, (h,w))
  for obj in objs:
    c = color(obj)
    if c == 2:
      if h == 14:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (h-4-uppermost(obj), w//2-leftmost(obj))))
      elif h == 9:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (1-uppermost(obj), w//2-leftmost(obj)+1)))
      else:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (3-uppermost(obj), 0)))
    elif c == 8:
      if h == 14:
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(h-2, w//2-1), (h-2, w//2)}))
      elif h == 9:
        O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(h-2, w//2), (h-2, w//2+1)}))
      else:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (2-uppermost(obj), 0)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Iteration:** This version iterates through each object in the input grid.
2. **Color-Specific Transformations:** It applies transformations based on the object's color:
    * **Color 2:**  Moves the object based on the grid's height.
    * **Color 8:**  Either places two '8's in specific positions or moves the existing '8' object based on the grid height.

**Program Version 3**

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, (h,w))
  if h == 14:
    O = paint(O, shift(toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I), (h-4-uppermost(toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)), w//2-leftmost(toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(h-2, w//2-1), (h-2, w//2)}))
  elif h == 9:
    O = paint(O, shift(toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I), (1-uppermost(toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)), w//2-leftmost(toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I))+1)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(h-2, w//2), (h-2, w//2+1)}))
  else:
    O = paint(O, shift(toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I), (2-uppermost(toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)), 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I), (3-uppermost(toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)), 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version is similar to version 1, but instead of identifying all objects, it directly manipulates objects based on their color using  `toobject(ofcolor(I, color), I)`.

**Program Version 4**

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  two_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  eight_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)
  if h == 14:
    O = paint(canvas(bg, (h,w)), shift(two_obj, (h-4-uppermost(two_obj), w//2-leftmost(two_obj))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(h-2, w//2-1), (h-2, w//2)}))
  elif h == 9:
    O = paint(canvas(bg, (h,w)), shift(two_obj, (1-uppermost(two_obj), w//2-leftmost(two_obj)+1)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, {(h-2, w//2), (h-2, w//2+1)}))
  else:
    O = paint(canvas(bg, (h,w)), shift(eight_obj, (2-uppermost(eight_obj), 0)))
    O = paint(O, shift(two_obj, (3-uppermost(two_obj), 0)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

* This version is a more concise version of version 3, pre-calculating the '2' and '8' objects before the conditional transformations.

**Program Version 5**

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  two_indices = ofcolor(I, 2)
  eight_indices = ofcolor(I, 8)
  if h == 14:
    O = fill(canvas(bg, (h,w)), 2, shift(two_indices, (h-4-uppermost(two_indices), w//2-leftmost(two_indices))))
    O = fill(O, 8, {(h-2, w//2-1), (h-2, w//2)})
  elif h == 9:
    O = fill(canvas(bg, (h,w)), 2, shift(two_indices, (1-uppermost(two_indices), w//2-leftmost(two_indices)+1)))
    O = fill(O, 8, {(h-2, w//2), (h-2, w//2+1)})
  else:
    O = fill(canvas(bg, (h,w)), 8, shift(eight_indices, (2-uppermost(eight_indices), 0)))
    O = fill(O, 2, shift(two_indices, (3-uppermost(two_indices), 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version focuses on manipulating indices instead of objects. 
* It uses `ofcolor()` to get indices of specific colors and `fill()` to place colors at those indices.

These five program versions provide diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation, each with a different focus on manipulating objects or indices using the provided DSL functions.
