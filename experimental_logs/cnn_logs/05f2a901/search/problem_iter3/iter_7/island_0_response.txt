## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves these key steps for each input-output pair:

**1. Identify and Separate Objects:** The input grids contain two distinct objects, one formed by the digit '2' and the other by the digit '8'. The background is represented by the digit '0'.

**2. Repositioning Objects:** The '2' object is moved to the bottom-center of the grid, and the '8' object is moved to the bottom-left corner.

**3. Maintain Object Integrity:**  The spatial relationship within each object (the relative position of each '2' or '8' digit) remains unchanged after the transformation.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I) 
  bg = mostcolor(I) 
  two_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I) 
  eight_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I) 
  O = canvas(bg, (h, w))
  O = paint(O, shift(two_obj, (h - height(two_obj) - uppermost(two_obj), w // 2 - width(two_obj) // 2 - leftmost(two_obj))))
  O = paint(O, shift(eight_obj, (h - height(eight_obj) - uppermost(eight_obj), -leftmost(eight_obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  The code identifies the '2' and '8' objects using `ofcolor` and converts them to object representation using `toobject`.
2. **Calculate Target Positions:**  The target bottom-center position for the '2' object is calculated using `h`, `w`, `height`, `width`, `uppermost`, and `leftmost`. Similarly, the bottom-left position for the '8' object is determined.
3. **Shift and Paint:** The `shift` function moves each object to its calculated target position, and `paint` draws the object onto a blank canvas (`O`) created with the background color.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  twos = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)
  eights = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)
  return paint(paint(canvas(bg, (h, w)), 
                      shift(twos, (h - height(twos) - uppermost(twos), w // 2 - width(twos) // 2 - leftmost(twos)))), 
                      shift(eights, (h - height(eights) - uppermost(eights), -leftmost(eights))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version streamlines the code by nesting the `paint` operations directly. It follows the same logic as Version 1, extracting objects, calculating target positions, shifting, and painting them onto the canvas.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, True, True)
  h, w = shape(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, (h, w))
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (h - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), w // 2 - width(obj) // 2 - leftmost(obj))))
    elif color(obj) == 8:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (h - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract All Objects:**  This version first extracts all objects from the input grid using `objects(I, True, True, True)`. 
2. **Iterate and Differentiate:** It then iterates through each object and uses an `if-elif` block to differentiate between the '2' and '8' objects based on their color (`color(obj)`).
3. **Position and Paint:**  The corresponding target position is calculated, and the object is shifted and painted onto the canvas.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  return paint(
    paint(
      canvas(bg, (h, w)),
      shift(toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I), (h - 1 - lowermost(toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)), w // 2 - leftmost(toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)) - width(toobject(ofcolor(I, 2), I)) // 2))
    ),
    shift(toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I), (h - 1 - lowermost(toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)), -leftmost(toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I))))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version combines elements from previous versions. It utilizes nested `paint` calls and directly embeds object extraction and shifting calculations within the painting operations, resulting in a more compact code structure.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  two_indices = ofcolor(I, 2)
  eight_indices = ofcolor(I, 8)
  O = canvas(bg, (h, w))
  O = fill(O, 2, shift(two_indices, (h - uppermost(two_indices) - height(toobject(two_indices, I)), w // 2 - width(toobject(two_indices, I)) // 2 - leftmost(two_indices))))
  O = fill(O, 8, shift(eight_indices, (h - uppermost(eight_indices) - height(toobject(eight_indices, I)), -leftmost(eight_indices))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version takes a slightly different approach by working with indices instead of full object representations:

1. **Extract Indices:** It first identifies the indices of '2' and '8' cells using `ofcolor`.
2. **Calculate Dimensions:**  It then calculates the target positions using the `height`, `width`, `uppermost`, and `leftmost` functions applied to objects constructed from the extracted indices.
3. **Shift and Fill:**  Finally, it uses `shift` to move the indices to their target locations and directly fills those positions with the corresponding digit value (2 or 8) on the canvas using `fill`. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches and function combinations within the DSL to achieve the same transformation, ensuring diversity in logic and implementation.
