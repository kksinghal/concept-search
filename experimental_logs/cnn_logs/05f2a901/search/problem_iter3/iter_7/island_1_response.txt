## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves stacking all non-8 objects on top of each other at the bottom center of the grid, and placing an 8-colored 2x2 square object at the bottom right of the stacked objects.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
1. The 2x3 and 2x2 objects are moved to the bottom center of the grid and stacked vertically.
2. A new 2x2 object of color 8 is placed to the right of the bottommost object, one row up.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
1. The 2x2 objects are moved to the bottom center of the grid and stacked vertically.
2. A new 2x2 object of color 8 is placed to the right of the bottommost object.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
1. The 2x6 and 3x2 objects are moved to the bottom center of the grid and stacked vertically. 
2. A new 2x2 object of color 8 is placed to the right of the bottommost object, one row up.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract all objects except the background.
  bg = mostcolor(I) # Get background color.
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I)) # Create empty canvas of same size as input.
  bottom = height(I) # Get bottom row index.
  rightmost_pos = 0 # Initialize rightmost position of stacked objects.
  for obj in objs: 
    if color(obj) != EIGHT: # Skip the 8-colored object if it exists.
      obj_w = width(obj) # Get width of the object.
      offset = (width(I) - obj_w) // 2  # Calculate horizontal offset for centering.
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (bottom - height(obj), offset))) # Paint object at calculated position.
      rightmost_pos = max(rightmost_pos, rightmost(obj)) # Update rightmost position if current object extends further.
      bottom -= height(obj) # Update bottom position for next object.
  new_obj = recolor(EIGHT, asindices(canvas(ZERO, (TWO, TWO)))) # Create new 2x2 object of color 8.
  O = paint(O, shift(new_obj, (bottom - TWO, rightmost_pos - ONE))) # Paint 8 object at calculated position.
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version iterates through each non-8 object, calculates its centered position above the bottom row, paints it, and updates the bottom row index for the next object.
2. It keeps track of the rightmost position reached by any object during stacking.
3. Finally, it creates a new 2x2 object with color 8 and paints it at the bottom right of the stacked objects.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = order(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: -height(obj)) # Extract objects, ordered by height (descending).
  bg = mostcolor(I) # Get background color.
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I)) # Create empty canvas.
  current_height = height(I) # Initialize current height from the bottom.
  rightmost = 0 # Initialize rightmost position.
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) != EIGHT: # Skip 8-colored object.
      w = width(obj) # Get object width.
      offset = (width(I) - w) // 2 # Calculate center offset.
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (current_height - height(obj), offset))) # Paint the object.
      rightmost = max(rightmost, rightmost(obj) + offset) # Update rightmost position.
      current_height -= height(obj) # Update current height.
  new_obj = recolor(EIGHT, asindices(canvas(ZERO, (TWO, TWO)))) # Create new 8-colored object.
  O = paint(O, shift(new_obj, (current_height - ONE, rightmost - ONE))) # Paint 8 object.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version prioritizes stacking by height, placing taller objects first.
2. It calculates the object's position based on the current height and centers it horizontally.
3. The rightmost position is updated after each object is placed.
4. The new 8-colored object is then placed based on the final current height and rightmost position.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  non_8_objs = sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) != EIGHT) # Filter out objects of color 8.
  bg = mostcolor(I) # Get background color.
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I)) # Create empty canvas.
  current_y = height(I) # Initialize current vertical position.
  rightmost_x = 0 # Initialize rightmost horizontal position.
  for obj in non_8_objs:
    obj_width = width(obj) # Get object width.
    x_offset = (width(I) - obj_width) // 2 # Calculate center offset.
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (current_y - height(obj), x_offset))) # Paint the object.
    rightmost_x = max(rightmost_x, rightmost(obj) + x_offset) # Update rightmost position.
    current_y -= height(obj) # Update current vertical position.
  eight_obj = recolor(EIGHT, asindices(canvas(ZERO, (TWO, TWO)))) # Create new 8-colored object.
  O = paint(O, shift(eight_obj, (current_y - TWO, rightmost_x - ONE))) # Paint 8 object.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version first filters out 8-colored objects from the extracted objects.
2. Similar to version 2, it then stacks the remaining objects by calculating their positions and updating the current vertical and rightmost positions.
3. The 8-colored object is created and placed in the end based on the final positions.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract all objects except the background.
  bg = mostcolor(I)  # Get background color.
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))  # Create empty canvas of same size as input.
  bottom = height(I)  # Get bottom row index.
  rightmost_pos = 0  # Initialize rightmost position of stacked objects.
  for obj in sorted(objs, key=lambda x: -height(x)):  # Iterate through objects, ordered by height (descending).
    if color(obj) != EIGHT:  # Skip the 8-colored object if it exists.
      obj_w = width(obj)  # Get width of the object.
      offset = (width(I) - obj_w) // 2  # Calculate horizontal offset for centering.
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (bottom - height(obj), offset)))  # Paint object at calculated position.
      rightmost_pos = max(rightmost_pos, rightmost(obj) + offset)  # Update rightmost position if current object extends further.
      bottom -= height(obj)  # Update bottom position for next object.
  new_obj = recolor(EIGHT, asindices(canvas(ZERO, (TWO, TWO))))  # Create new 2x2 object of color 8.
  O = paint(O, shift(new_obj, (bottom - TWO, rightmost_pos - ONE)))  # Paint 8 object at calculated position.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version combines elements from previous versions. It sorts the extracted objects by height in descending order.
2. It then iterates through these sorted objects, calculates their centered positions above the bottom row, paints them, and updates the bottom row index and rightmost position.
3. Finally, it creates and places the new 8-colored object similarly to previous versions.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  non_eights = sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) != EIGHT)  # Filter out 8-colored objects.
  bg = mostcolor(I)  # Get background color.
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))  # Create an empty canvas of the same size as the input.
  y = height(I)  # Start from the bottom row of the canvas.
  rightmost = 0  # Initialize the rightmost position of placed objects.
  for obj in non_eights:
    x = (width(I) - width(obj)) // 2  # Calculate the x-coordinate to center the object.
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (y - height(obj), x)))  # Paint the object at the calculated position.
    rightmost = max(rightmost, rightmost(obj) + x)  # Update the rightmost position if necessary.
    y -= height(obj)  # Move up the canvas by the height of the placed object.
  new_obj = recolor(EIGHT, asindices(canvas(ZERO, (TWO, TWO))))  # Create a new 2x2 object with color 8.
  O = paint(O, shift(new_obj, (y - TWO, rightmost - ONE)))  # Place the 8-colored object.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version utilizes `sfilter` to directly filter out any 8-colored objects, simplifying the object iteration.
2. It then iteratively places each remaining object at the bottom center of the canvas and updates the vertical position (y) and rightmost position accordingly.
3. Finally, it places the 8-colored object based on the final values of y and rightmost.


These versions demonstrate different approaches and function combinations to achieve the same transformation, ensuring diversity in the generated code solutions.
