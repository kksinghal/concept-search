## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all examples aims to move all objects to the bottom of the grid without changing their horizontal position or shape. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The '2' object and '8' object are both moved down to the bottom of the grid, occupying rows 8 and 9 for the '2' object and rows 10 and 11 for the '8' object.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The '2' object is moved down, now spanning rows 1 to 4. The '8' object also shifts down to maintain its relative position, occupying rows 4 and 5.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- Both the '8' and '2' objects are shifted downwards. Notably, the '2' object now occupies the bottom rows, pushing the '8' object slightly up to rows 2 and 3.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), 
               merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj) - 1, 0)),
                           fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))`**: Create a blank canvas with the most common color (background) and the same shape as the input grid.
2. **`fgpartition(I)`**: Separate all non-background objects from the input grid.
3. **`apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj) - 1, 0)), ...)`**:  For each object, calculate the vertical shift required to move it to the bottom and apply the shift. 
4. **`merge(...)`**: Combine all shifted objects.
5. **`paint(..., ...)`**:  Paint the combined shifted objects onto the blank canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj) - 1, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))`**: Creates a blank canvas.
2. **`for obj in fgpartition(I)`**: Iterates through each non-background object.
3. **`shift(obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj) - 1, 0))`**: Calculates and applies the downward shift for the current object.
4. **`paint(O, ...)`**: Paints the shifted object onto the canvas.
5. **`return O`**: Returns the final canvas with objects moved to the bottom.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  def move_to_bottom(obj):
    return shift(obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj) - 1, 0))
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), 
               merge(apply(move_to_bottom, fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`move_to_bottom(obj)`**: Defines a helper function to calculate and apply the downward shift for an object.
2. **`fgpartition(I)`**:  Separates non-background objects.
3. **`apply(move_to_bottom, ...)`**:  Applies the `move_to_bottom` function to each object.
4. **`merge(...)`**: Combines shifted objects.
5. **`paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), ...)`**: Paints the combined objects onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  shifted_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj) - 1, 0)) 
                         for obj in objs)
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(shifted_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`**:  Extracts non-background objects.
2. **`shifted_objs = frozenset(...)`**: Creates a new set of objects, each shifted downwards using a set comprehension.
3. **`merge(shifted_objs)`**:  Combines the shifted objects.
4. **`paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), ...)`**: Paints the combined, shifted objects onto a blank canvas. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  def process_object(obj, grid_height):
    return shift(obj, (grid_height - lowermost(obj) - 1, 0))
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)),
               merge(apply(lambda obj: process_object(obj, height(I)), 
                           fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`process_object(obj, grid_height)`**: Defines a helper function that takes an object and the grid height as input and returns the object shifted downwards.
2. **`fgpartition(I)`**:  Extracts non-background objects.
3. **`apply(lambda obj: process_object(obj, height(I)), ...)`**:  Applies the `process_object` function to each object, passing the grid height as an argument.
4. **`merge(...)`**:  Combines the shifted objects.
5. **`paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), ...)`**:  Paints the combined shifted objects onto a blank canvas.
