## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve moving the objects containing the digit '8' to a new position based on other objects in the grid. 

**Input 0:** The '8' object is moved to the bottom of the grid, below the '2' object.
**Input 1:** The '8' object is moved one row down from its original position.
**Input 2:** The '8' object is moved to the row directly below the '2' object.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions inspired by existing code but improved to solve the given transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) 
  eight_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: 8 in palette(obj)) 
  other_objs = remove(eight_obj, objs) 
  lowest_other = argmax(other_objs, lambda obj: lowermost(obj))
  target_pos = (lowermost(lowest_other) + 1, leftmost(eight_obj)) 
  O = paint(cover(I, eight_obj), shift(eight_obj, subtract(target_pos, ulcorner(eight_obj))))  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Locate '8' Object:** Extract the object containing the digit '8'.
3. **Find Lowest Object:** Among the remaining objects, find the one with the lowest position (highest row index).
4. **Calculate Target Position:**  The target position for the '8' object is one row below the lowest object, aligned with the '8' object's leftmost column.
5. **Move '8' Object:** Remove the '8' object from its original position, then paint it at the calculated target position.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  eights = ofcolor(I, 8)
  other_indices = difference(asindices(I), eights)
  lowest_row = maximum(apply(lambda ij: ij[0], other_indices))
  shifted_eights = shift(eights, (lowest_row + 1 - uppermost(eights), 0))
  O = paint(cover(I, eights), recolor(8, shifted_eights))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find '8' Indices:** Get the indices of all cells containing the digit '8'.
2. **Get Other Indices:** Get the indices of all cells not containing the digit '8'.
3. **Find Lowest Row:** Find the row index of the lowest non-'8' cell.
4. **Shift '8' Indices:** Calculate the shift needed to move the '8' cells to the row below the lowest row and apply the shift to the '8' indices.
5. **Paint '8' at New Position:**  Remove the original '8' cells and paint new '8' cells at the shifted indices. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  eight_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  non_eights = difference(objs, {eight_obj})
  sorted_objs = order(non_eights, lambda obj: lowermost(obj))
  bottom_obj = last(sorted_objs)
  target_row = lowermost(bottom_obj) + 1
  O = paint(cover(I, eight_obj), shift(eight_obj, (target_row - uppermost(eight_obj), 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Extract '8' Object:**  Extract the object with color '8'.
3. **Sort Other Objects:** Sort the remaining objects based on their lowermost row index in ascending order.
4. **Get Bottom Object:**  Select the last object in the sorted list, which represents the lowest object in the grid.
5. **Calculate Target Row:**  The target row is one row below the lowest object.
6. **Move '8' Object:** Remove the '8' object and paint it at the target row, keeping its horizontal position intact.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  target_row = max([i for i in range(len(I)) if any(v != 0 for v in I[i])]) + 1
  eights = {(8, (i, j)) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, val in enumerate(row) if val == 8}
  O = paint(cover(I, eights), shift(eights, (target_row - uppermost(eights), 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find Target Row:** Find the target row by iterating through rows and identifying the last row containing any non-zero value. The target row is one row below this.
2. **Extract '8' Cells:** Get the coordinates of all cells containing the digit '8'.
3. **Move '8' Object:** Remove the '8' cells and paint them on the target row, maintaining their relative horizontal positions.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  eight_obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: 8 in palette(obj))
  bottom_edge =  max(i for i, j in toindices(eight_obj)) 
  shifted_obj = shift(eight_obj, (len(I) - bottom_edge - 1, 0))
  O = paint(cover(I, eight_obj), shifted_obj) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify '8' Object:**  Identify the object containing the digit '8'.
2. **Find Bottom Edge:** Find the row index of the bottom edge of the '8' object.
3. **Calculate Shift:**  Calculate the shift needed to move the bottom edge of the '8' object to the bottom row of the grid.
4. **Move '8' Object:** Remove the '8' object from its current position and paint it at its new location shifted by the calculated amount.


These five program versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and diversity of the provided DSL.
