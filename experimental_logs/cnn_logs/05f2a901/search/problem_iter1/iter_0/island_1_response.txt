## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving all non-background objects to the bottom of the grid while maintaining their relative horizontal positions. 

**Input_0:** Both the '2' object and the '8' object are moved to the bottom of the grid, maintaining their horizontal positions and relative order.

**Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, both objects are moved to the bottom, keeping their original horizontal arrangement.

**Input_2:** Again, both objects are shifted downwards. The '8' object, initially at the top, is placed above the '2' object, preserving their relative vertical order from the input.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_custom(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  shifted_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (height(I) - uppermost(obj) - height(obj), 0)) for obj in objs)
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(shifted_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background and objects:** Determine the background color (`bg`) and extract all non-background objects (`objs`).
2. **Calculate shift amount:** For each object, calculate the vertical shift amount to move it to the bottom. 
3. **Shift objects:** Shift each object downwards by the calculated amount (`shifted_objs`).
4. **Reconstruct grid:** Create a blank canvas filled with the background color and paint the shifted objects onto it.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_custom(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(bg, (h, w))
  for j in range(w):
    column = tuple(I[i][j] for i in range(h))
    filtered_column = tuple(v for v in column if v != bg)
    O = paint(O, {(v, (i + h - len(filtered_column), j)) for i, v in enumerate(filtered_column)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate column-wise:** Iterate through each column of the input grid.
2. **Extract and filter non-background values:** Extract all values in the current column and filter out the background color.
3. **Calculate new positions:** Determine the new starting row for the filtered values to be placed at the bottom.
4. **Paint onto the output grid:** Paint the filtered values at their new positions in the output grid.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_custom(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = sorted(objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), key=lambda obj: uppermost(obj))
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  current_height = height(I)
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (current_height - uppermost(obj) - height(obj), 0)))
    current_height -= height(obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sort objects by vertical position:** Extract objects and sort them based on their uppermost row position.
2. **Iterate and place objects:** Iterate through the sorted objects and place them sequentially from the bottom of the output grid. 
3. **Update placement height:** Track the current placement height to ensure objects are stacked without gaps.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_custom(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  transposed = dmirror(I)
  transformed_transposed = tuple(tuple(v for v in r if v != bg) + tuple(bg for _ in range(len(r) - len(tuple(v for v in r if v != bg)))) for r in transposed)
  O = dmirror(transformed_transposed)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transpose the grid:** Transpose the input grid, turning rows into columns and vice versa.
2. **Shift values within each column:** For each column in the transposed grid, move all non-background values to the beginning of the column.
3. **Transpose back:** Transpose the transformed grid back to its original orientation.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_custom(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  h, w = shape(I)
  flattened = tuple(v for r in I for v in r if v != bg)
  O = canvas(bg, (h, w))
  i = h - 1
  j = 0
  for v in flattened:
    O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j))})
    j += 1
    if j == w:
      j = 0
      i -= 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Flatten and filter:** Flatten the input grid into a single list, discarding all background values.
2. **Iterate and place:** Iterate through the flattened list and place each value onto the output grid, starting from the bottom right corner and moving leftwards, then upwards.
