## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving all non-background objects to the bottom of the grid while maintaining their relative horizontal positions.

**Input_0:** 
- Two objects: One formed by '2's, the other by '8's.
- Both objects are moved to the bottom, preserving their shapes and horizontal alignment.

**Input_1:**
- Similar to Input_0, two objects are moved to the bottom. 
- The relative horizontal spacing between the objects is maintained.

**Input_2:**
- Again, two objects are moved downwards.
- Notice that the empty rows at the top are retained, showcasing that only the objects are shifted, not the entire grid content.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve this transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True) # Identify all non-background objects
  moved_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (height(I) - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), 0)), objs) # Shift each object downwards
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(moved_objs)) # Paint the shifted objects onto a blank canvas of the same size
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` extracts all distinct non-background objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Calculate Downward Shift:** For each object `obj`, `height(I) - height(obj) - uppermost(obj)` determines the vertical shift required to move it to the bottom.
3. **Shift Objects:** `shift(obj, (calculated_shift, 0))` moves each object downwards by the calculated shift.
4. **Paint on Canvas:** `paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(moved_objs))` creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input and paints the shifted objects onto it.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  bottom_positions = sorted((uppermost(obj) + height(obj), obj) for obj in objs) # Calculate the bottom edge Y-coordinate of each object and sort by it
  shifted_objs = [shift(obj, (height(I) - bottom_pos, 0)) for bottom_pos, obj in bottom_positions] # Shift objects based on sorted bottom positions
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(shifted_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Bottom Positions:** Calculate the bottom edge Y-coordinate of each object and store them with the object itself.
2. **Sort by Bottom Position:** Sort the objects based on their bottom edge Y-coordinates.
3. **Shift Based on Order:** Shift objects downwards according to their sorted order, ensuring they are placed from bottom to top.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  result = canvas(0, (h, w)) # Initialize an empty canvas
  for i in range(h - 1, -1, -1): # Iterate through rows from bottom to top
    row_objs = [crop(I, (i, 0), (1, w)), crop(result, (i, 0), (1, w))] # Get current row from input and result
    result = vconcat(vsplit(result, h - i - 1) + (hconcat(*row_objs),) + vsplit(result, i + 1)) # Insert the current row into the result
  return result
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Rows Bottom-Up:** Loop through the grid rows starting from the bottom.
2. **Extract and Combine Rows:** For each row, extract the corresponding row from the input and the current result. Concatenate these rows horizontally.
3. **Build Result Grid:**  Insert the combined row into the result grid, effectively shifting objects downwards.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  sorted_objs = order(objs, lambda obj: -uppermost(obj)) # Sort objects from bottom to top
  O = I
  for obj in sorted_objs:
    O = move(O, obj, (height(I) - uppermost(obj) - height(obj), 0)) # Move each object to the bottom, starting with the bottom-most object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sort Objects:**  Sort the identified objects based on their uppermost row index in descending order (bottom to top).
2. **Iterative Movement:**  Iterate through the sorted objects, moving each one to the bottom of the grid using the `move` function.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  return vconcat(canvas(0, (height(I) - height(compress(I)), width(I))), compress(I)) # Compress the grid to remove empty rows, then add them back to the top
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Compress Grid:** `compress(I)` removes all empty rows from the input grid, effectively pushing all objects to the bottom.
2. **Calculate Missing Rows:**  Determine the number of empty rows removed by comparing the height of the original grid and the compressed grid.
3. **Create and Concatenate Canvas:** Create a new canvas with the calculated number of empty rows and the same width as the input. Concatenate this canvas on top of the compressed grid.
