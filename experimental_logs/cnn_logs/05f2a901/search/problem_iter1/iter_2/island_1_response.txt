## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied in all these examples appears to be moving all objects (clusters of non-zero digits) to the bottom of the grid without changing their shape or relative horizontal positions. Here's a breakdown:

**Input_0:**
- Two objects: a '2' shape and an '8' shape.
- Transformation: Both objects are moved to the bottom of the grid, maintaining their original forms and horizontal alignment.

**Input_1:**
- Two objects: a '2' shape and an '8' shape.
- Transformation: Same as Input_0 - both objects shifted downwards to the grid's bottom edge, preserving their structure.

**Input_2:**
- Two objects: a '2' shape and an '8' shape.
- Transformation:  Consistent with the previous two â€“ objects are relocated to the bottommost rows of the grid while retaining their original configurations.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions to achieve this transformation:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  moved_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (height(I) - uppermost(obj) - height(obj), 0)) for obj in objs)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(moved_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies all objects within the input grid `I`. 
2. **Calculate Shift:**  For each object `obj`,  `height(I) - uppermost(obj) - height(obj)` determines the downward shift required to move it to the bottom.
3. **Shift Objects:**  `shift(obj, (calculated_shift, 0))` moves each object downwards by the calculated shift amount.
4. **Create Blank Canvas:** `canvas(0, shape(I))` creates a grid of zeroes with the same dimensions as the input grid.
5. **Paint Objects:**  `paint(canvas, merged_objects)` draws all the shifted objects onto the blank canvas.
6. **Return Output:**  The transformed grid `O` is returned.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h = height(I)
  O = tuple(tuple(0 for _ in range(width(I))) for _ in range(h))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v != 0:
        O = fill(O, v, {(h - i - 1, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Grid:** Create a grid `O` filled with zeros, having the same dimensions as the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate and Shift:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid `I`. If a cell contains a non-zero value, place that value in the corresponding column of `O` but at a row index that's mirrored vertically. 
3. **Return Output:** Return the modified grid `O`.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = partition(I) - colorfilter(partition(I), 0)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj) - 1, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Non-Zero Objects:** `partition(I) - colorfilter(partition(I), 0)` identifies all objects in the grid excluding the background (color 0).
2. **Initialize Canvas:**  `canvas(0, shape(I))` creates an empty grid of the same size as the input, filled with zeros.
3. **Shift and Paint:** For each object, calculate the vertical shift needed to bring its bottom edge to the bottom of the grid.  Paint the shifted object onto the canvas.
4. **Output:** The function returns the final canvas `O`, representing the transformed grid.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  return vconcat(canvas(0, (height(I) - height(objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)[0]), width(I))), 
                 crop(I, (uppermost(objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)[0]), 0), 
                       (height(objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)[0]), width(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Calculate Heights:** `objects(...)` identifies all objects in the grid. `height(...)` calculates the height of the first object, representing the combined height of all objects since they are moved as a whole to the bottom.
2. **Create Top and Bottom Sections:** 
    - `canvas(...)` generates a grid of zeros representing the top section of the output, sized to accommodate the shifted objects.
    - `crop(...)` extracts the bottom section of the input grid containing all the objects.
3. **Concatenate Sections:** `vconcat(...)` vertically joins the top and bottom sections, effectively moving the objects to the bottom.
4. **Output:** The combined grid is returned.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for j in range(w):
    column = tuple(I[i][j] for i in range(h))
    non_zeros = tuple(v for v in column if v != 0)
    O = fill(O, non_zeros, product(interval(h-len(non_zeros), h, 1), {j}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Get the dimensions (height `h`, width `w`) of the input grid `I`. Create an output grid `O` of the same size filled with zeros.
2. **Column-wise Processing:** Iterate through each column `j` of the input grid.
3. **Extract and Position Non-Zero Values:** Extract non-zero values from the current column and store them in `non_zeros`. Calculate the starting row index in `O` to place these values to ensure they are at the bottom.
4. **Fill Output Grid:** Use `fill` to place the `non_zeros` values in the corresponding column of `O`, starting from the calculated row index.
5. **Return Output:** After processing all columns, return the transformed grid `O`.

These programs provide five different approaches to achieve the desired transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and demonstrating flexibility in problem-solving.
