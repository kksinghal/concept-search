## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving objects within the grid to new locations. The target locations seem to be determined by the positions of other objects and the overall structure of the grid. 

* **Input_0:** The "2" object is moved to the bottom left, and the "8" object is moved directly above it.
* **Input_1:** The "2" object is moved to the top right, and the "8" object is placed directly below it.
* **Input_2:** The "8" object is moved to the bottom center, and the "2" object is placed directly above it. 

The transformation appears to prioritize placing the "8" object first, followed by placing the other object ("2" in these cases) relative to the "8" object's new position.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_4093f84a(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) 
  eight_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: 8 in palette(obj))
  other_objs = remove(eight_obj, objs) 
  target_pos = (len(I) - height(eight_obj), center(bottomhalf(I))[1] - width(eight_obj) // 2)
  moved_eight = shift(eight_obj, subtract(target_pos, ulcorner(eight_obj)))
  above_eight = (uppermost(moved_eight) - 1, center(moved_eight)[1] - width(other_objs.pop()) // 2)
  O = paint(I, moved_eight)
  for obj in other_objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, subtract(above_eight, ulcorner(obj))))
    above_eight = (above_eight[0] - height(obj), above_eight[1])
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects in the grid, extract the "8" object, and store the remaining objects.
2. **Position "8" Object:** Calculate the target position for the "8" object (bottom center) and move it.
3. **Position Other Objects:** Calculate a position one row above the "8" object and iteratively place the remaining objects above it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_4093f84a(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  eight_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  target_row = len(I) - height(eight_obj)
  target_col = (len(I[0]) - width(eight_obj)) // 2
  new_eight_obj = shift(eight_obj, (target_row - uppermost(eight_obj), target_col - leftmost(eight_obj)))
  I = cover(I, eight_obj)
  I = paint(I, new_eight_obj)
  for obj in remove(eight_obj, objs):
    target_row -= height(obj)
    target_col = (len(I[0]) - width(obj)) // 2
    new_obj = shift(obj, (target_row - uppermost(obj), target_col - leftmost(obj)))
    I = paint(I, new_obj)
  return I 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find and Move "8":** Locate the "8" object, determine its bottom-center target position, and move it.
2. **Iterate and Place:**  Iterate through remaining objects, calculating their positions based on the "8" object and the grid's dimensions, placing them one above the other.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_4093f84a(I):
  e = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: 8 in palette(o))
  t = (len(I) - height(e), (len(I[0]) - width(e)) // 2)
  I = paint(cover(I, e), shift(e, subtract(t, ulcorner(e))))
  for o in order(objects(I, T, F, T) - {e}, lambda o: -uppermost(o)):
    t = (t[0] - height(o), t[1])
    I = paint(I, shift(o, subtract(t, ulcorner(o))))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate and Relocate "8":**  Find the "8" object, calculate its new position (bottom center), erase it from its original location, and paint it at the new position.
2. **Order and Position:**  Identify remaining objects, order them based on their vertical position (top to bottom), calculate their positions based on the "8" object, and paint them onto the grid.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_4093f84a(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  eight = extract(objs, lambda o: 8 in palette(o))
  others = order(objs - {eight}, lambda o: -uppermost(o))
  bottom = len(I)
  for obj in [eight] + list(others):
    left = (len(I[0]) - width(obj)) // 2
    I = paint(cover(I, obj), shift(obj, (bottom - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), left - leftmost(obj))))
    bottom -= height(obj)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Order:** Extract the "8" object and order the remaining objects from top to bottom.
2. **Iterative Placement:**  Iterate through the ordered objects, including the "8", and place them sequentially from the bottom of the grid, adjusting the starting position for each object based on the previous object's height. 


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_4093f84a(I):
    eight = extract(objects(I,T,F,T), lambda obj: 8 in palette(obj))
    rest = objects(I,T,F,T) - {eight}
    height_eight = height(eight)
    width_eight = width(eight)
    height_rest = sum(height(obj) for obj in rest)
    I = canvas(0, (len(I), len(I[0])))
    I = paint(I, shift(eight, (len(I)-height_eight, (len(I[0])-width_eight)//2)))
    current_height = len(I)-height_eight-1
    for obj in rest:
        current_width = (len(I[0])-width(obj))//2
        I = paint(I, shift(obj, (current_height - uppermost(obj), current_width - leftmost(obj))))
        current_height -= height(obj)
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Isolate Objects and Calculate Dimensions:** Identify the "8" object, the remaining objects, and calculate the heights and widths of the "8" object and the combined height of the remaining objects.
2. **Create Blank Canvas and Place "8":** Create a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid and position the "8" object at the bottom center of this new canvas.
3. **Place Remaining Objects:**  Iterate through the remaining objects and place them one above the other, starting from the top of the "8" object on the new canvas.

These five versions provide a diverse set of solutions for the given transformation, showcasing different strategies and combinations of DSL functions.
