## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects based on connected pixels of the same color and then moving them to a new location within the grid. The background color (most frequent) remains unchanged. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The object consisting of '2's is moved from the top left corner to the bottom left corner, while the object of '8's is moved down by 2 rows.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  The object of '2's is moved down by 1 row and right by 4 columns, while the object of '8's remains in place.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The object of '8's is moved down by 3 rows, while the object of '2's remains in place.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  moved_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      moved_objs = moved_objs.union(frozenset({shift(obj, (height(I) - height(obj), 0))}))
    elif color(obj) == 8:
      moved_objs = moved_objs.union(frozenset({shift(obj, (2, 0))}))
  O = paint(fill(I, 0, asindices(I)), moved_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, True, False, True)`:  Identifies all connected objects in the grid `I`, considering only directly adjacent cells (not diagonal) and excluding the background.
2. **Loop:** Iterates through each identified object (`obj`).
3. **Conditional Movement:**
   - If `color(obj) == 2`: Shifts the object of '2's down to the bottom of the grid by an offset equal to the grid's height minus the object's height.
   - If `color(obj) == 8`: Shifts the object of '8's down by 2 rows.
4. `paint(fill(I, 0, asindices(I)), moved_objs)`:  Creates a blank canvas by filling the original grid with '0's and then paints the moved objects onto this canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj2 = first(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  obj8 = first(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  new_obj2 = shift(obj2, (height(I) - height(obj2), 0))
  new_obj8 = shift(obj8, (2, 0))
  O = paint(paint(fill(I, 0, asindices(I)), new_obj2), new_obj8)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Finds the object of '2's (`obj2`) and '8's (`obj8`) separately using `first` and a lambda function to filter objects by color.
2.  Calculates the new positions for each object:
    - `new_obj2`:  Object of '2's shifted to the bottom of the grid.
    - `new_obj8`: Object of '8's shifted down by 2 rows.
3.  Creates a blank canvas and paints the moved objects onto it in sequence.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  moved_grid = I
  for v in [2, 8]:
    obj = first(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == v)
    if v == 2:
      offset = (height(I) - height(obj), 0)
    else:
      offset = (2, 0)
    moved_grid = move(moved_grid, obj, offset)
  return moved_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Iterates through the values '2' and '8'.
2.  For each value, finds the corresponding object in the grid.
3.  Determines the offset based on the object's color.
4.  Uses the `move` function to directly move the object on the grid to its new position.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  new_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (height(I) - height(obj), 0)) if color(obj) == 2 else (shift(obj, (2, 0)) if color(obj) == 8 else obj), objs)
  O = paint(fill(I, 0, asindices(I)), new_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Identifies all objects in the grid.
2.  Uses `apply` with a lambda function to conditionally shift objects based on their color:
    - '2':  Shifted to the bottom.
    - '8':  Shifted down by 2 rows.
    - Others: Remain unchanged.
3.  Creates a blank canvas and paints the modified objects onto it.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def move_object(obj):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      return shift(obj, (height(I) - height(obj), 0))
    elif color(obj) == 8:
      return shift(obj, (2, 0))
    else:
      return obj
  moved_objs = frozenset(map(move_object, objects(I, True, False, True)))
  O = paint(fill(I, 0, asindices(I)), moved_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Defines a helper function `move_object` to encapsulate the logic for moving objects based on their color.
2.  Uses `map` with the `move_object` function to create a new set of moved objects.
3.  Creates a blank canvas and paints the moved objects onto it.

These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the same grid transformation while adhering to the DSL constraints.
