## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving objects in the grid downwards such that their upper boundaries align with the row containing the first '8' in the grid. 

**Input_0:**
- The '2' object is moved down to align with the row containing the '8' object.

**Input_1:**
- The '2' object is moved down to align with the row containing the '8' object.

**Input_2:**
- The '2' object is moved down to align with the row containing the '8' object.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_d6ad076f(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  target_row = uppermost(extract(objs, lambda o: color(o) == 8))
  moved_objs = frozenset(
    shift(obj, (target_row - uppermost(obj), 0))
    if color(obj) != 8 else obj for obj in objs
  )
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(moved_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Target Row:** The program first identifies all objects in the grid and determines the row index where the first '8' object starts. 
2. **Shift Objects:**  It then iterates over each object and calculates the vertical shift needed to align its top edge with the target row. Objects with color 8 are not moved.
3. **Reconstruct Grid:** Finally, it creates a blank canvas and paints the shifted objects onto it, resulting in the output grid.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_b548a754(I):
  target_row = min(i for i, r in enumerate(I) if 8 in r)
  O = tuple(
    tuple(8 if 8 in row else v for v in r) if i >= target_row else 
    (tuple(0 for _ in r) if i < target_row else r) 
    for i, r in enumerate(I)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Target Row:**  Finds the row index of the first occurrence of '8' in the grid.
2. **Conditional Row Modification:** Iterates through each row, applying different modifications based on its position relative to the target row:
    - Rows above the target row are filled with '0'.
    - Rows at and below the target row retain their values, but any '8' is kept while other values are replaced with '0'.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_d6ad076f(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  eight_obj = extract(objs, lambda o: color(o) == 8)
  target_row = uppermost(eight_obj)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) != 8:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (target_row - uppermost(obj), 0)))
  O = paint(O, eight_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate Objects and Target:**  Identifies all objects and the row where the '8' object starts.
2. **Paint Shifted Objects:** Iterates through the objects, painting them onto a blank canvas. Objects other than '8' are shifted downwards to align with the target row.
3. **Paint '8' Object:** Finally, the '8' object is painted in its original position.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_b548a754(I):
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    if 8 in row:
      target_row = i
      break
  O = tuple(
    tuple(v if i >= target_row and v != 8 else 0 for v in r)
    if i < target_row else r
    for i, r in enumerate(I)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Determine Target Row:** Iterates through rows to find the first occurrence of '8', marking that row index as the target.
2. **Conditional Value Modification:**  Modifies cell values based on row position:
    - Above target: All cells become '0'.
    - At/Below target: Cells retain values, except non-'8' values become '0'.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_d6ad076f(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  for i in range(h):
    if 8 in I[i]:
      target_row = i
      break
  O = tuple(
      tuple(I[i + target_row][j] if i + target_row < h else 0 for j in range(w))
      for i in range(h)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Row:**  Finds the row index of the first '8' occurrence.
2. **Shift Values Downwards:** Constructs the output grid by shifting values from the input grid downwards. 
    - Cells above the target row are filled with values from rows shifted down, with '0' filling in the remaining space. 
    - Cells at and below the target row retain their original values.
