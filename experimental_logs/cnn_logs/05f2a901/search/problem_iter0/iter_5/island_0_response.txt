## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving all non-background objects to the bottom of the grid while preserving their relative horizontal positions. The order of the objects from top to bottom in the output corresponds to the order they appear in the input from top to bottom.

**Example:**

In Input_0, there are two objects: a '2' object and an '8' object. The '2' object appears first when looking from top to bottom. In Output_0, the '2' object is placed at the bottom of the grid, followed by the '8' object above it.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  x2 = order(x1, uppermost)
  x3 = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  x4 = tojvec(height(I))
  x5 = astuple(x2, repeat(x4, size(x2)))
  x6 = mapply(lambda obj, off: shift(obj, off), x5)
  O = paint(x3, merge(x6))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects (x1):** We use `objects` to identify all non-background objects within the input grid `I`.
2. **Order Objects (x2):** We order the identified objects based on their uppermost row using `order` and `uppermost`. This ensures the objects are placed in the correct order from bottom to top in the output.
3. **Create Canvas (x3):** A new grid (canvas) is created with the same dimensions as the input grid and filled with the background color.
4. **Calculate Vertical Offset (x4):** We calculate the vertical offset needed to shift objects to the bottom of the grid using `tojvec` and the grid's height.
5. **Prepare Objects for Shifting (x5):**  We pair each object with the calculated vertical offset using `astuple`, `repeat`, and `size`.
6. **Shift Objects (x6):** Each object is shifted downwards using `mapply` and `shift` according to the calculated offset.
7. **Paint Objects to Canvas (O):** Finally, we paint the shifted objects onto the canvas using `paint` and `merge` to get the output grid `O`.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = mostcolor(I)
  x2 = canvas(x1, shape(I))
  x3 = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  x4 = order(x3, uppermost)
  x5 = lambda obj: shift(obj, (height(I)-height(obj), 0))
  x6 = apply(x5, x4)
  O = paint(x2, merge(x6))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background Color (x1):** Identify the background color using `mostcolor`.
2. **Create Empty Canvas (x2):** Create an empty canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
3. **Extract Objects (x3):** Extract all non-background objects using `objects`.
4. **Order Objects (x4):** Order objects based on their top row using `order` and `uppermost`.
5. **Shift Function (x5):** Define a function `x5` that shifts an object downwards by the difference between the grid height and the object height.
6. **Apply Shift (x6):** Apply the shift function `x5` to each ordered object using `apply`.
7. **Paint Objects (O):** Paint the shifted objects onto the empty canvas using `paint` and `merge` to obtain the final output grid `O`.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  x2 = lambda obj: (uppermost(obj), obj)
  x3 = order(apply(x2, x1), lambda x: x[0])
  x4 = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  x5 = lambda o: paint(x4, shift(o[1], (height(I) - height(o[1]), 0)))
  O = last(apply(x5, x3))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects (x1):** Identify all non-background objects using `objects`.
2. **Pair with Uppermost Row (x2):** Define a function `x2` to pair each object with its uppermost row index.
3. **Order Objects (x3):** Apply `x2` to each object and order the resulting pairs based on the uppermost row index using `order`.
4. **Create Canvas (x4):** Create an empty canvas filled with the background color and same size as the input.
5. **Paint and Shift Function (x5):** Define a function `x5` that paints an object onto the canvas after shifting it downwards. The shift amount is calculated based on the object's height and the grid height.
6. **Apply, Paint, and Get Final Grid (O):** Apply the `x5` function to each ordered object. The `last` function is used to obtain the final state of the canvas after all objects are painted, which is the output grid `O`. 

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = mostcolor(I)
  x2 = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  x3 = lambda obj: (obj, height(I)-uppermost(obj)-height(obj))
  x4 = apply(x3, x2)
  x5 = order(x4, lambda x: x[1])
  x6 = canvas(x1, shape(I))
  x7 = lambda obj, grid: paint(grid, shift(obj, (height(I)-height(obj), 0)))
  O = last(papply(x7, totuple(x5)[0::2], repeat(x6, size(x5))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background Color (x1):** Identify the background color using `mostcolor`.
2. **Identify Objects (x2):** Identify all non-background objects using `objects`.
3. **Calculate Object Offset (x3):** Define a function `x3` to calculate the vertical offset required for each object to reach the bottom.
4. **Apply Offset Calculation (x4):** Apply the `x3` function to each object.
5. **Order by Offset (x5):** Order the objects based on their calculated offset using `order`.
6. **Create Canvas (x6):** Create an empty canvas filled with the background color.
7. **Paint and Shift Function (x7):** Define a function `x7` that paints a shifted object onto a grid.
8. **Iterate and Paint (O):**  Iterate over the ordered objects and use the `papply` function to apply the `x7` function, effectively painting each object onto the canvas with its calculated offset. The `last` function extracts the final output grid `O`.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  x2 = lambda obj: (-uppermost(obj), obj) 
  x3 = order(apply(x2, x1), lambda x: x[0])
  x4 = lambda obj: shift(obj[1], (height(I)-height(obj[1]), 0)) 
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(x4, x3)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects (x1):** Identify all non-background objects using `objects`.
2. **Pair with Negative Uppermost Row (x2):** Define a function `x2` that pairs each object with the negative of its uppermost row index. This is done to facilitate sorting in descending order.
3. **Order Objects (x3):** Apply `x2` to each object and order them based on their negated uppermost row indices using `order`, effectively ordering them from bottom to top based on their position in the input.
4. **Shift Objects Downwards (x4):** Define a function `x4` that shifts an object downwards to the bottom of the grid based on its height.
5. **Paint Shifted Objects (O):**  Apply the `x4` function to each ordered object to shift them. The shifted objects are then painted onto a blank canvas created using `canvas` with the background color, resulting in the final output grid `O`.

These programs provide five distinct ways to achieve the desired transformation, each utilizing different combinations of functions and logic within the DSL.
