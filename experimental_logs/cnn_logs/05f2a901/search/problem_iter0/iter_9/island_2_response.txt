## Transformation Analysis

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as **"gravity shifting"**:

* **Identify Objects:**  Each unique digit (excluding the background color, 0) represents a distinct object.
* **Shift Downwards:** Each object is independently shifted downwards until it reaches the bottom of the grid or encounters another object.

Let's illustrate with an example using `Input_1`:

**Input_1:**

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 0 0 0 8 8 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
```

**Output_1:**

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 2 2 8 8 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
```

The '2' object is shifted down until its lowest point reaches the bottom. The '8' object also shifts down, but its descent is stopped by the presence of the '2' object. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the "gravity shift" transformation:

**Program Version 1: Object Iteration with Maximum Lowermost**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract non-background objects
  shifted_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    lowest_row = lowermost(obj)  # Find the lowest row of the object
    shift_distance = height(I) - lowest_row - 1  # Calculate downward shift distance
    shifted_objs.add(shift(obj, (shift_distance, 0)))  # Shift the object downwards
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), frozenset(shifted_objs))  # Paint onto a blank canvas
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Identifies all non-background objects using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Iterate and Shift:**  Iterates through each object and determines the required downward shift to bring its lowest point to the grid's bottom. It achieves this using `lowermost` and `height` functions. The object is then shifted using the `shift` function.
3. **Paint:** Finally, all shifted objects are painted onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.

**Program Version 2: Sorting Objects by Lowermost Row**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  sorted_objs = order(objs, lowermost)  # Sort objects from top to bottom
  shifted_objs = set()
  occupied = set()
  for obj in sorted_objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      new_i = i
      while (new_i, j) not in occupied and new_i < height(I) - 1:
        new_i += 1  # Find the next available space below
      shifted_objs.add((v, (new_i, j)))
      occupied.add((new_i, j))
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), frozenset(shifted_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Sort:** Extracts objects and sorts them based on their lowest row position using `lowermost` within the `order` function. This ensures that objects are processed from top to bottom.
2. **Find and Shift:** Iterates through each sorted object. For every cell in the object, it finds the lowest available empty space below its current position and places the cell there.
3. **Paint:**  Paints the shifted cells onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 3: Column-wise Shifting**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)  # Get grid dimensions
  new_grid = [[ZERO for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(h)]  # Initialize empty grid
  for j in range(w):  # Iterate over columns
    column = [I[i][j] for i in range(h)]  # Extract column
    non_zeros = [v for v in column if v != ZERO]  # Filter out zeros
    new_grid[h - len(non_zeros):h] = non_zeros  # Place non-zeros at the bottom
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)  # Convert to tuple
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty grid of the same size as the input.
2. **Column Processing:**  Iterates over each column, extracts it from the input grid, and filters out the zero (background) values.
3. **Shifting:** Places the non-zero values at the bottom of the corresponding column in the new grid. 
4. **Output:** Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 4: Using `gravitate` Function (adapted from Program_B)**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects
  bottom_edge = frozenset((height(I) - 1, j) for j in range(width(I)))  # Define the bottom edge 
  shifted_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    shift_amount = gravitate(obj, bottom_edge)  # Calculate shift needed to reach bottom
    shifted_objs.add(shift(obj, shift_amount))  # Apply the shift
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), frozenset(shifted_objs)) # Paint onto a blank canvas
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects and Define Bottom Edge:** Identifies all non-background objects. Defines the bottom edge of the grid as the target for gravitation.
2. **Calculate and Apply Shifts:** Iterates through each object and uses the `gravitate` function to determine the shift required to bring the object to the bottom edge. This shift is then applied to the object using the `shift` function. 
3. **Paint:** Paints the shifted objects onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 5:  Direct Shifting with Object Modification (inspired by Program_A)**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Extract objects
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), 
               frozenset(
                   recolor(color(obj), # Maintain object color
                           {(i + height(I) - 1 - lowermost(obj), j) 
                            for i, j in toindices(obj)}) # New indices for bottom placement
                   for obj in objs
               ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Identifies all non-background objects. 
2. **Calculate New Indices and Recolor:** For each object, calculates the new indices of its cells after shifting to the bottom. It utilizes `height`, `lowermost`, and `toindices` functions for this. Recolors the new indices with the original object's color.
3. **Paint:** Paints the objects with the updated indices and colors onto a blank canvas.
