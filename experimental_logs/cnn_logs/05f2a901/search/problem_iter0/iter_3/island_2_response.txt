## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation shifts all non-background objects to the bottom of the grid without changing their horizontal position. Here's a breakdown:

* **Input_0:** The '2' object and the '8' object are both moved downwards until their bottom edges align with the bottom edge of the grid.
* **Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0, both objects are moved down.  The '8' object already touches the bottom, so its position remains unchanged.
* **Input_2:** Again, both objects are moved down to the bottom of the grid.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract non-background objects
  moved_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (height(I) - 1 - uppermost(obj) - height(obj), 0)) for obj in objs) # Calculate shift and move objects
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), moved_objs) # Create canvas and paint objects
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** We identify all non-background objects in the grid using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Calculate Shift:** For each object, we determine the required downward shift to align its bottom edge with the grid's bottom edge. This is done by subtracting the object's uppermost row, its height, and 1 (for zero-based indexing) from the grid's height.
3. **Move Objects:** Using `shift(obj, (calculated_shift, 0))`, each object is moved down by the calculated shift.
4. **Paint on Canvas:** A blank canvas of the same size as the input grid is created using `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`, and the shifted objects are painted onto it using `paint()`. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return vconcat(canvas(ZERO, (height(I) - height(compress(I)), width(I))), compress(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Compress Grid:**  We use `compress(I)` to remove any empty rows from the input grid, effectively moving all objects down as far as possible.
2. **Calculate Empty Rows:**  The difference in height between the original grid and the compressed grid gives us the number of empty rows needed at the top.
3. **Create Top Canvas:** We generate a blank canvas using `canvas(ZERO, (calculated_empty_rows, width(I)))` to represent the top portion of the output grid.
4. **Concatenate:** Finally, we vertically concatenate the top canvas and the compressed grid using `vconcat()` to create the final output.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(ZERO for _ in range(width(I))) 
      for _ in range(height(I) - height(compress(I)))
  ) + compress(I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Compress Grid:** Similar to version 2, we first use `compress(I)` to remove empty rows and shift objects downwards.
2. **Generate Empty Rows:** We directly create a tuple of tuples representing the empty rows. The number of empty rows is calculated as in version 2.
3. **Concatenate:** The generated empty rows are concatenated with the compressed grid using the `+` operator to form the final output.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  bottom_row = height(I) - 1  # Calculate bottom row index
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), frozenset(shift(obj, (bottom_row - lowermost(obj), 0)) for obj in objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** We extract non-background objects using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Calculate Shift using Bottom Row:** We determine the shift by subtracting the object's lowermost row index from the grid's bottom row index.
3. **Shift and Paint:** We shift each object downwards using `shift()` and paint them onto a blank canvas, similar to previous versions.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def move_down(obj):
    return shift(obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj) - 1, 0))
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), apply(move_down, objects(I, T, F, T))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `move_down` Function:** We define a helper function `move_down(obj)` to calculate the shift and move a single object downwards.
2. **Extract and Apply:** Non-background objects are extracted, and the `move_down` function is applied to each object using `apply()`.
3. **Paint on Canvas:**  Finally, we paint the moved objects onto a blank canvas to generate the output grid.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL. They showcase the flexibility and power of the DSL by employing various strategies like object manipulation, grid compression, and helper function definitions.
