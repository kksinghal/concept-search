## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to move all non-background objects to the bottom of the grid, maintaining their relative horizontal positions. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** 
- The '2' object is moved down to the bottom, leaving the background '0' at the top. 
- The '8' object is also moved down, maintaining its position relative to the bottom of the grid.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- Similar to Input_0, both the '2' and '8' objects are moved down. 
- The '2' object, being taller, occupies the bottom rows, while the '8' object sits above it.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
- This example showcases that object order is maintained during the transformation.
- The '8' object, initially positioned higher than the '2' object, remains above it after being moved to the bottom. 

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)  # Identify the background color
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)  # Extract objects
  moved_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj) - 1, 0)) for obj in objs) # Calculate offset for each object to be at the bottom
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(moved_objs)) # Create a blank canvas and paint the moved objects
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1.  **Identify Background:** Determine the background color using `mostcolor(I)`.
2.  **Extract Objects:** Extract all non-background objects using `objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`.
3.  **Calculate Offsets:** For each object, calculate the vertical offset required to move it to the bottom of the grid using `height(I) - lowermost(obj) - 1`.
4.  **Move Objects:** Shift each object downwards by its calculated offset using `shift(obj, (offset, 0))`.
5.  **Paint Objects:** Create a canvas filled with the background color using `canvas(bg, shape(I))` and paint the moved objects onto it using `paint(canvas, merged_objects)`.

**Program Version 2:**

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  bottom_aligned = lambda obj: (obj, lowermost(obj)) # Create tuple (object, its lowermost row)
  sorted_objs = order(apply(bottom_aligned, objs), lambda x: -x[1]) # Sort by the second element (lowermost row) in descending order
  result = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj, _ in sorted_objs: # Paint objects from bottom to top
    result = paint(result, shift(obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj) - 1, 0))) 
  O = result
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Background and Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Associate with Lowermost Row:** Create tuples pairing each object with its lowermost row index using `lowermost(obj)`.
3. **Sort by Lowermost Row:** Sort the object tuples based on their lowermost row index in descending order.
4. **Paint in Sorted Order:** Iterate through the sorted objects and paint them onto a blank canvas, starting from the objects with the highest lowermost row index, ensuring objects are painted from bottom to top.

**Program Version 3:**

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  painted = I
  for i in range(height(I)-1, -1, -1): # Iterate through rows from bottom to top
    row_objs = objects(crop(I, (i, 0), (1, width(I))), univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True) # Extract objects in the current row
    for obj in row_objs:
      painted = move(painted, obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj) - 1, 0)) # Move each object to the bottom
  O = painted
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate Rows Bottom-Up:** Loop through the rows of the input grid, starting from the bottom row.
2. **Extract Row Objects:**  For each row, extract the objects present using `objects` function on a cropped portion representing the current row.
3. **Move to Bottom:**  For each object in the row, calculate its offset from the bottom and move it down using the `move` function.

**Program Version 4:**

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  max_height = valmax(objs, height) # Find the height of the tallest object
  result = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  current_height = height(I) - max_height # Start placing from bottom
  for obj in objs:
    result = paint(result, shift(obj, (current_height - uppermost(obj), 0))) # Place the object 
    current_height -= height(obj) # Update current height
  O = result
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Background and Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Find Tallest Object:** Determine the height of the tallest object using `valmax(objs, height)`.
3. **Place Objects Iteratively:**  Starting from the bottom of the canvas, place each object, updating the current height after each placement to ensure no overlapping.

**Program Version 5:**

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  transformed = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    transformed = paint(cover(transformed, obj), shift(obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj) - 1, 0))) # Erase the object and paint it back at the bottom
  O = transformed
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate Through Objects:**  Loop through all non-background objects.
2. **Erase and Repaint:**  For each object, first, erase it from the grid using `cover`. Then, calculate the offset to the bottom and repaint it at the new location.

These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the same grid transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. Each version utilizes different function combinations and logic flow, highlighting the diverse ways to solve the problem.
