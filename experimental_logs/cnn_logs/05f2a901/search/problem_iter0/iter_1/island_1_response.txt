## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to move all objects (groups of connected, same-valued digits) to the bottom of the grid while maintaining their original shape and relative horizontal position. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The '2' object is moved from the top to the bottom of the grid.
* The '8' object is moved down, leaving one empty row above it. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The '2' object is moved down, filling the space below it.
* The '8' object is also moved down, maintaining its distance from the '2' object.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The '8' object is moved down two rows.
* The '2' object is moved down, filling the space left by the '8' object.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  h = height(I)
  moved_objs = frozenset({shift(obj, (h - uppermost(obj) - height(obj), 0)) for obj in objs})
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(moved_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` finds all connected objects within the input grid `I`.
2. **Calculate Target Position:** For each object, the vertical offset to move it to the bottom is calculated using `h - uppermost(obj) - height(obj)`.
3. **Move Objects:** Each object is shifted down by the calculated offset using `shift(obj, offset)`.
4. **Create Output Grid:** A blank canvas of the same size as the input is created using `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`.
5. **Paint Objects:** The moved objects are painted onto the blank canvas using `paint(canvas, objects)`.
6. **Return Output:** The final transformed grid `O` is returned.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  filled = fill(I, bg, asindices(I))
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  bottom_y = height(I) - 1
  moved_objs = {frozenset({(v, (bottom_y - i + uppermost(obj), j)) for v, (i, j) in obj}) for obj in objs}
  O = paint(filled, merge(moved_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Fill Grid:** The input grid is first filled with the background color using `fill(I, bg, asindices(I))`.
2. **Identify Objects:** Objects are identified as in Version 1.
3. **Calculate New Y-Coordinates:** For each object and its cells, new y-coordinates are calculated to place them at the bottom.
4. **Create Moved Objects:** New objects are created with updated cell coordinates.
5. **Paint and Return:** Moved objects are painted onto the filled grid and returned.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  sorted_objs = order(objs, lambda obj: -uppermost(obj))
  O = I
  for obj in sorted_objs:
    O = move(O, obj, (height(I) - uppermost(obj) - height(obj), 0))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Sort Objects:** Objects are identified and sorted based on their uppermost row position in descending order.
2. **Iterate and Move:** Iterating through sorted objects, each object is moved to the bottom based on its height and uppermost row position using the `move` function.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  rows = vsplit(I, height(I))
  non_bg_rows = [row for row in rows if any(v != bg for v in row)]
  bg_rows = [row for row in rows if all(v == bg for v in row)]
  O = vconcat(tuple(bg_rows), tuple(non_bg_rows)) 
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Split into Rows:** The grid is split into individual rows.
2. **Identify Non-Background Rows:** Rows containing at least one non-background color are identified.
3. **Reconstruct Grid:**  The grid is reconstructed by placing non-background rows at the bottom, followed by background rows. 


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    h = height(I)
    moved_objs = []
    for obj in objs:
        new_obj = set()
        for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
            new_i = h - 1 - (uppermost(obj) + height(obj) - 1 - i)
            new_obj.add((v, (new_i, j)))
        moved_objs.append(new_obj)
    O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(moved_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all connected objects in the input grid.
2. **Calculate New Positions:**  For each cell in each object, calculate its new row position, ensuring it's placed at the bottom while maintaining the object's internal structure.
3. **Create Moved Objects:** Create new objects with cells at their calculated positions.
4. **Paint to Canvas:** Paint the moved objects onto a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input.
5. **Return Output:** Return the newly created grid with objects moved to the bottom.
