## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving all objects (groups of connected non-zero digits) to the bottom of the grid while maintaining their relative horizontal positions. The order of the objects from top to bottom in the output corresponds to their order in the input.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The '2' object is moved from the top to the bottom rows while staying in the same columns.
* The '8' object is moved down to occupy the rows above the '2' object.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The '2' object is moved down, occupying the bottom three rows and maintaining its column positions.
* The '8' object is moved down to sit directly above the '2' object.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The '8' object remains in place as it is already at the top.
* The '2' object is moved below the '8' object.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions, each with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_gravity_sort(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I)  # Identify all objects
    h = height(I)  # Get grid height
    sorted_objs = order(objs, lambda obj: uppermost(obj))  # Sort objects by uppermost row
    shifted_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (h - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), 0)), sorted_objs)  # Shift each object to the bottom
    O = paint(I, merge(shifted_objs))  # Paint the shifted objects onto the input grid
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `fgpartition(I)` identifies all objects in the input grid.
2. **Sort objects:** `order(objs, lambda obj: uppermost(obj))` sorts the objects based on their uppermost row index, effectively arranging them from top to bottom as they appear in the input.
3. **Calculate shift:** For each object, `shift(obj, (h - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), 0))` calculates the vertical shift required to move the object to the bottom, preserving its horizontal position.
4. **Shift and Merge:** `apply` applies the calculated shift to each object, and `merge` combines the shifted objects.
5. **Paint on grid:**  `paint(I, merge(shifted_objs))` paints the merged shifted objects onto the original input grid to generate the output.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_bottom_up(I):
    objs = order(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: uppermost(obj))  # Identify & sort objects by top row
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create an empty canvas
    current_height = height(I)  # Start from the bottom row
    for obj in objs:
        obj_height = height(obj)  # Get the height of the current object
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (current_height - obj_height, 0)))  # Paint the object at the bottom
        current_height -= obj_height  # Update the current height
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and sort:** Similar to Version 1, this identifies and sorts objects based on their uppermost row.
2. **Empty canvas:** `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates an empty grid of the same size and background color as the input.
3. **Iterative Painting:**  Iterates through the sorted objects, placing each one at the bottom and updating the available space above it.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_recursive_drop(I):
    def drop_object(grid, objs):
        if not objs:
            return grid
        obj = objs[0]  # Get the topmost object
        shifted_obj = shift(obj, (height(grid) - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), 0))  # Shift it to the bottom
        return drop_object(paint(grid, shifted_obj), objs[1:])  # Recursively process remaining objects
    
    O = drop_object(I, order(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: uppermost(obj)))  # Start with input and sorted objects
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Recursive Function:** Defines a recursive function `drop_object` that handles one object at a time.
2. **Base Case:**  Returns the grid if no objects are left.
3. **Recursive Step:** Processes the topmost object, shifts it to the bottom, paints it, and recursively calls itself with the remaining objects.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_gravity_fill(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I)  # Identify objects
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create an empty canvas
    for i in range(height(I) - 1, -1, -1):  # Iterate through rows from bottom to top
        row_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: uppermost(obj) == i)  # Find objects starting at current row
        if row_objs:
            O = paint(O, merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (i - uppermost(obj), 0)), row_objs)))  # Paint objects to their bottom positions
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Create Canvas:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Bottom-up Row Iteration:** Iterates through rows from bottom to top.
3. **Paint Objects by Row:** For each row, identifies objects starting at that row and paints them directly to their final positions.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_column_stack(I):
    h, w = shape(I)  # Get grid dimensions
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))  # Create an empty canvas
    for j in range(w):  # Iterate through columns
        column_obj = frozenset((I[i][j], (i, j)) for i in range(h) if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I))  # Get the object in the current column
        if column_obj:
            O = paint(O, shift(column_obj, (h - height(column_obj), 0)))  # Shift the column object to the bottom and paint it
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Column-wise Processing:** This version processes the grid column by column.
2. **Extract and Shift:** For each column, it extracts the object (if any) and shifts it to the bottom of that column.
3. **Paint and Combine:** It paints the shifted object onto the canvas, effectively stacking objects from left to right based on their original column positions.


These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation, using different logic and DSL function combinations. Each version provides a unique and effective way to solve the given problem.
