## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to move all non-background objects to the bottom of the grid while maintaining their relative positions. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** The 2x3 '2' object and the 2x2 '8' object are moved to the bottom of the grid without changing their shapes or relative positions. 

**Pair 1:** Similar to Pair 0, the '2' and '8' objects are shifted downwards. The '2' object retains its L-shape.

**Pair 2:**  The '8' object and the larger '2' object are moved downwards, preserving their original shapes.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct programs utilizing different DSL function combinations to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, False, True, True)
  shifted_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (height(I) - uppermost(obj) - height(obj), 0)) for obj in objs)
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(shifted_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background:** Determine the background color (`bg`) using `mostcolor(I)`.
2. **Extract objects:**  Extract all non-background objects from the input grid (`I`) using `objects(I, False, True, True)`.
3. **Calculate shift:** For each object, calculate the vertical shift required to move it to the bottom using `height(I) - uppermost(obj) - height(obj)`.
4. **Shift objects:** Shift each object downwards by the calculated amount using `shift(obj, (calculated_shift, 0))`.
5. **Create blank canvas:** Create a new grid filled with the background color and matching the input grid's dimensions using `canvas(bg, shape(I))`.
6. **Paint objects:** Paint the shifted objects onto the blank canvas using `paint`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  rows = vsplit(I, height(I))
  object_rows = tuple(row for row in rows if any(v != bg for v in row))
  bg_rows = tuple(row for row in rows if all(v == bg for v in row))
  O = vconcat(object_rows, bg_rows)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background:** Determine the background color (`bg`) using `mostcolor(I)`.
2. **Split into rows:** Split the input grid (`I`) into individual rows using `vsplit(I, height(I))`.
3. **Separate object and background rows:** Create two tuples: `object_rows` containing rows with at least one non-background cell and `bg_rows` containing rows with only background cells.
4. **Concatenate rows:** Vertically concatenate the `object_rows` followed by `bg_rows` using `vconcat` to achieve the desired object movement.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  transposed = dmirror(I)
  rows = vsplit(transposed, width(I))
  object_rows = tuple(row for row in rows if any(v != bg for v in row))
  bg_rows = tuple(row for row in rows if all(v == bg for v in row))
  O = dmirror(vconcat(object_rows, bg_rows))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background:** Determine the background color (`bg`) using `mostcolor(I)`.
2. **Transpose grid:** Transpose the input grid (`I`) using `dmirror(I)` to work with columns instead of rows.
3. **Apply logic from Version 2:** Apply the logic from Version 2 (splitting, separating, and concatenating) to the transposed grid.
4. **Transpose back:**  Transpose the resulting grid back to its original orientation using `dmirror`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  obj_indices = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, bg))
  shifted_indices = frozenset((height(I) - 1 - i, j) for i, j in obj_indices)
  O = fill(canvas(bg, shape(I)), 1, shifted_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background:** Determine the background color (`bg`) using `mostcolor(I)`.
2. **Find object indices:** Find the indices of all cells not containing the background color using `difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, bg))`.
3. **Calculate new indices:**  For each object index, calculate its new index after being moved to the bottom.
4. **Create blank canvas:** Create a new grid filled with the background color and matching the input grid's dimensions using `canvas(bg, shape(I))`.
5. **Fill object cells:** Fill the cells at the new indices with a non-background color (here, '1') using `fill`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  h = height(I)
  O = tuple(tuple(branch((i, j) in {(h - 1 - k, j) for k, l in ofcolor(I, v) for v in palette(I) - {bg}}, v, bg) for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background:** Determine the background color (`bg`) using `mostcolor(I)`.
2. **Iterate and conditionally fill:**  Iterate over each cell in the input grid (`I`). For each cell, check if its index corresponds to a shifted object cell. If so, keep its original color; otherwise, fill it with the background color. This is achieved using nested loops, `ofcolor`, and the `branch` function for conditional filling.


These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and power of the provided DSL.
