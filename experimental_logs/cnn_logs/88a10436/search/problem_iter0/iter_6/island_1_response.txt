## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying an object (defined by connected cells of the same color) with the color 5 and shifting it based on its position in the grid. 

* **Upward Shift:** The object is always shifted upwards.
    * If the uppermost row of the object is at row index 0 or 1, it's shifted up by 1 unit.
    * If the uppermost row of the object is at row index 2 or greater, it's shifted up by 2 units.
* **Leftward Shift:** The object is only shifted leftwards if its leftmost column is at column index 0. In this case, it's shifted left by 1 unit (effectively shifting it out of the grid and wrapping it around to the rightmost column).

**Example (Input_0):**

1. **Object Identification:**  The object with color 5 is at the bottom center.
2. **Shift Calculation:**
    * Upward shift: Since the uppermost row of the object is at index 5 (greater than 2), it's shifted upwards by 2 units.
    * Leftward shift: The leftmost column of the object is not at index 0, so no leftward shift is applied.
3. **Result:** The object is moved two cells up from its original position.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1 (Inspired by extracting and shifting the object):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    five_obj = extract(objects(I, False, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 5)
    up_shift = -2 + (uppermost(five_obj) <= 1)
    left_shift = (leftmost(five_obj) == 0)
    O = paint(cover(I, five_obj), shift(five_obj, (up_shift, left_shift)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`five_obj = extract(objects(I, False, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 5)`:** Extracts the object with color 5.
2. **`up_shift = -2 + (uppermost(five_obj) <= 1)`:** Calculates the upward shift amount: -2 for a shift of 2, and -1 for a shift of 1.
3. **`left_shift = (leftmost(five_obj) == 0)`:**  Calculates the leftward shift: 1 if the object's leftmost column is at index 0, otherwise 0.
4. **`O = paint(cover(I, five_obj), shift(five_obj, (up_shift, left_shift)))`:**  Paints the shifted object onto the grid after covering the original object.

**Version 2 (Inspired by iterating through object cells):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    five_obj = extract(objects(I, False, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 5)
    O = cover(I, five_obj)
    for v, (i, j) in five_obj:
        new_i = i - 2 if i > 1 else i - 1
        new_j = (j + 1) % width(I) if j == 0 else j
        O = paint(O, {(v, (new_i, new_j))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`five_obj = ...`:**  Extracts the object with color 5.
2. **`O = cover(I, five_obj)`:** Creates a base grid with the object removed.
3. **`for v, (i, j) in five_obj:`:** Iterates through each cell of the object.
4. **`new_i = i - 2 if i > 1 else i - 1`:**  Calculates the new row index based on the upward shift rule.
5. **`new_j = (j + 1) % width(I) if j == 0 else j`:** Calculates the new column index, handling the leftward wrapping.
6. **`O = paint(O, {(v, (new_i, new_j))})`:** Paints each cell at its new position.

**Version 3 (Inspired by using indices and a single shift):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    five_indices = toindices(extract(objects(I, False, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 5))
    up_shift = -2 + (min(i for i, j in five_indices) <= 1)
    left_shift = (min(j for i, j in five_indices) == 0)
    O = paint(cover(I, five_indices), recolor(5, shift(five_indices, (up_shift, left_shift))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`five_indices = ...`:** Extracts the indices of the object with color 5.
2. **`up_shift = ...` and `left_shift = ...`:** Calculates the shifts based on minimum row and column indices.
3. **`O = paint(cover(I, five_indices), recolor(5, shift(five_indices, (up_shift, left_shift))))`:** Covers the original object, shifts the indices, recolors them to 5, and paints them back.

**Version 4 (Inspired by using conditional statements for shifting):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    five_obj = extract(objects(I, False, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 5)
    O = I
    if uppermost(five_obj) <= 1:
        O = paint(cover(O, five_obj), shift(five_obj, (-1, 0)))
    else:
        O = paint(cover(O, five_obj), shift(five_obj, (-2, 0)))
    if leftmost(five_obj) == 0:
        O = paint(cover(O, five_obj), shift(five_obj, (0, 1)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`five_obj = ...`:** Extracts the object with color 5.
2. **`if uppermost(five_obj) <= 1: ... else: ...`:** Applies the appropriate upward shift based on the object's top row.
3. **`if leftmost(five_obj) == 0: ...`:** Applies the leftward shift if necessary.

**Version 5 (Inspired by calculating a single shift amount):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    five_obj = extract(objects(I, False, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 5)
    up_shift = -2 + (uppermost(five_obj) <= 1)
    left_shift = (leftmost(five_obj) == 0) * width(I)  # Wrap around by grid width
    O = paint(cover(I, five_obj), shift(five_obj, (up_shift, left_shift)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`five_obj = ...`:** Extracts the object with color 5.
2. **`up_shift = ...`:**  Calculates the upward shift.
3. **`left_shift = (leftmost(five_obj) == 0) * width(I)`:**  Calculates the leftward shift, using grid width for wrapping.
4. **`O = paint(cover(I, five_obj), shift(five_obj, (up_shift, left_shift)))`:** Applies the combined shift in one step.
