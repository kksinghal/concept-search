## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation takes the object composed of digits '1', '2', and '3' and mirrors it along the counterdiagonal, placing the mirrored object below the original with the background color (0) separating them.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the previous transformation, this one also mirrors the object (composed of digits '1', '2', and '6') along the counterdiagonal. However, instead of placing the mirrored object below, it is placed to the left of the original, again separated by the background.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** This transformation only affects the object formed by digits '2' and '3'. This object is mirrored along the horizontal axis and placed above its original position. 

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, False, True, True)
  obj = first(objs)
  cmirrored = cmirror(obj)
  shifted = shift(cmirrored, (height(obj) + 1, 0))
  O = paint(paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), obj), shifted)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background and objects:** The code identifies the background color and isolates the objects within the grid.
2. **Mirror the object:** The target object is mirrored along the counterdiagonal.
3. **Shift and paint:** The mirrored object is shifted to its new position and painted onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input, followed by painting the original object.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, False, True, True)
  obj = first(objs)
  mirrored_indices = cmirror(toindices(obj))
  shifted_indices = shift(mirrored_indices, (height(obj) + 1, 0))
  O = fill(fill(canvas(bg, shape(I)), index(I, first(obj)[1]), shifted_indices), index(I, first(obj)[1]), obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background and objects:**  Similar to version 1.
2. **Mirror and shift indices:** Instead of mirroring the object directly, this version mirrors the indices of the object and then shifts them.
3. **Fill indices with color:** The shifted indices are filled with the original object's color on a blank canvas, followed by filling the original object's indices.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  obj = toobject(extract(objects(I, False, True, True), lambda x: len(x) > 1), I)
  cmirrored = cmirror(obj)
  shifted = shift(cmirrored, (height(obj) + 1, 0))
  O = paint(paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), obj), shifted)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract object:** This version directly extracts the object from the grid using `toobject`.
2. **Mirror, shift, and paint:** The rest of the steps are similar to version 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = toobject(extract(objects(I, False, True, True), lambda x: len(x) > 1), I)
  mirrored = cmirror(obj)
  O = paint(I, shift(mirrored, (height(obj) + 1, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract object:** Similar to version 3.
2. **Mirror and paint directly:** This version skips creating a blank canvas and directly paints the mirrored object onto the input grid after shifting.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, False, True, True)
  obj = first(objs)
  mirrored_indices = cmirror(toindices(obj))
  O = I
  for i, j in mirrored_indices:
    O = fill(O, index(I, first(obj)[1]), {(i + height(obj) + 1, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background and objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Iterate and fill:** This version iterates through the mirrored indices and fills each corresponding location on a copy of the input grid with the original object's color.

These are just a few examples, and many other variations are possible using different combinations of DSL functions and logic. The key is to analyze the transformation logic carefully and choose the most efficient and elegant solution.
