## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves rotating objects within the grid 90 degrees counterclockwise. However, the rotation is not applied globally, but rather to each object individually, preserving its original position relative to its own bounding box. 

**Here's a breakdown of the transformation for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 -> Output_0:** The object formed by '2's and the object formed by '1' and '3' are each rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise within the space they occupy.
* **Input_1 -> Output_1:** The objects formed by '6', '1's, and '2's are each rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise. Note how the single '5' remains unchanged as it's not considered an object for rotation.
* **Input_2 -> Output_2:** Similar to the previous examples, the objects formed by '2's and the object formed by '3's and '1' are rotated individually. The '5' remains in place.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, F, F, F):
    if len(obj) > 1:
      O = paint(O, rot270(toobject(obj, I)))
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Creates a blank canvas (`O`) with the same dimensions as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate through Objects:** Loops through each object identified in the input grid using `objects(I, F, F, F)`.
3. **Conditional Rotation:** 
   - If an object has more than one cell (`len(obj) > 1`), it's rotated:
      - The object is extracted from the grid and converted to an object representation using `toobject(obj, I)`.
      - The object is rotated counterclockwise by 270 degrees using `rot270()`.
      - The rotated object is painted onto the canvas `O`.
   - If the object is a single cell, it's painted directly onto the canvas without rotation.
4. **Return Output:** The modified canvas `O` containing the rotated objects is returned.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, F, F, F):
        if size(obj) > 1:
            offset = subtract(centerofmass(obj), ORIGIN)
            shifted_obj = shift(obj, invert(offset))
            rotated_obj = rot270(toobject(shifted_obj, I))
            O = paint(O, shift(rotated_obj, offset))
        else:
            O = paint(O, obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:**  Creates an empty canvas (`O`) of the same dimensions as input `I`.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Iterates through each object in the input using `objects(I, F, F, F)`.
3. **Conditional Rotation and Positioning:**
    - If an object has more than one cell (`size(obj) > 1`):
        - Calculates the object's offset from the origin using `subtract(centerofmass(obj), ORIGIN)`.
        - Shifts the object to align its top-left corner with the origin using `shift(obj, invert(offset))`.
        - Rotates the shifted object counterclockwise by 270 degrees using `rot270()`.
        - Shifts the rotated object back to its original position using `shift(rotated_obj, offset)`.
        - Paints the repositioned, rotated object onto the canvas.
    - Single-cell objects are painted directly onto the canvas without modification.
4. **Return Output:** Returns the modified canvas `O` containing the transformed objects.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, F, F, F):
    if len(obj) > 1:
      O = cover(O, obj)
      rotated_obj = rot270(toobject(obj, I))
      O = paint(O, rotated_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output as Input:** Starts by copying the input grid (`I`) to the output grid (`O`).
2. **Iterate through Objects:** Iterates through each object in the input grid using `objects(I, F, F, F)`.
3. **Rotate and Replace:**
   - If an object has more than one cell (`len(obj) > 1`):
     - The object is removed from the output grid using `cover(O, obj)`.
     - The object is extracted, rotated counterclockwise by 270 degrees using `rot270(toobject(obj, I))`, and then painted back onto the output grid at its original position.
4. **Return Output:** The modified grid (`O`) containing the rotated objects is returned. 


**Program Version 4** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, F, F, F)
    rotated_objs = {rot270(toobject(obj, I)) if len(obj) > 1 else obj for obj in objs}
    O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(rotated_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identifies all objects within the input grid `I` using `objects(I, F, F, F)`, storing them in the `objs` set.
2. **Rotate Objects:** Creates a new set `rotated_objs` containing either the rotated versions of objects (if they have more than one cell) or the original objects (if they are single cells).  This is done using a set comprehension:
   - `rot270(toobject(obj, I)) if len(obj) > 1 else obj`:  For each `obj` in `objs`, if the object has more than one cell, it is extracted using `toobject`, rotated counterclockwise by 270 degrees using `rot270`, and added to the `rotated_objs` set. Otherwise, the original `obj` is added without rotation.
3. **Construct Output:**
   - Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid using `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`.
   - Merges all the rotated objects from `rotated_objs` using `merge`.
   - Paints the merged objects onto the canvas using `paint`. 
4. **Return Output:**  Returns the canvas `O` which now represents the input grid with the objects rotated as required.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, F, F, F):
        if size(obj) > 1:
            ul = ulcorner(obj)
            shifted_obj = shift(obj, subtract(ORIGIN, ul))
            rotated_obj = rot270(toobject(shifted_obj, I))
            O = paint(O, shift(rotated_obj, ul))
        else:
            O = paint(O, obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates an empty canvas (`O`) of the same size as input `I`.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Iterates through each object in the input using `objects(I, F, F, F)`.
3. **Rotate and Paint:**
   - For objects larger than one cell (`size(obj) > 1`):
     - Find the upper-left corner of the object using `ulcorner(obj)`.
     - Shift the object to align its upper-left corner with the origin using `shift` and `subtract`.
     - Rotate the shifted object counterclockwise by 270 degrees using `rot270`.
     - Shift the rotated object back to its original position by adding back the original upper-left corner coordinates.
     - Paint the transformed object onto the output canvas.
   - For single-cell objects, paint them directly onto the output canvas without any transformation.
4. **Return Output:** Return the final canvas `O` with the rotated objects.

This version strategically uses the object's upper-left corner as a reference point for shifting and rotating. This efficiently achieves the desired rotation while preserving the object's position within its bounding box.
