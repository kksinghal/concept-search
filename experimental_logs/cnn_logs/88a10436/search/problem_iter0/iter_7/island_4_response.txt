## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking a specific object (not the background) within the input grid and mirroring it while also shifting its position. The mirrored object is then painted onto the original grid without erasing any existing elements. Let's break down each example:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The object formed by digits '1', '2', and '3' is mirrored along its counter-diagonal and shifted down by a distance equal to its height.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  The object formed by digits '1', '2', and '6' is mirrored along its counter-diagonal and shifted down by a distance equal to its height.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The object formed by digits '1' and '3' is mirrored along its counter-diagonal and shifted up by a distance equal to its height. 


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = toobject(extract(objects(I, False, True, True), lambda x: size(x) > 1), I) 
  mirrored = cmirror(obj)
  shift_distance = height(obj)
  O = paint(I, shift(mirrored, (shift_distance, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Target Object:**  We first identify the object to be transformed. We assume it's the largest non-background object.
    - `objects(I, False, True, True)` extracts all objects from the grid.
    - `extract(..., lambda x: size(x) > 1)` finds the object with more than one cell.
    - `toobject(..., I)` converts the object's indices back to an object with color values.
2. **Mirror the Object:** `cmirror(obj)` mirrors the object along its counter-diagonal.
3. **Shift the Mirrored Object:** 
    - `shift_distance = height(obj)` determines the shift amount based on object height.
    - `shift(mirrored, (shift_distance, 0))` shifts the object downwards.
4. **Paint onto the Grid:**  `paint(I, ...)` draws the shifted, mirrored object onto the original grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  target_color = leastcolor(extract(objects(I, False, True, True), lambda x: size(x) > 1)) 
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, target_color), I)
  mirrored = cmirror(obj)
  O = paint(I, shift(mirrored, (height(obj), 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version identifies the object based on its least frequent color, assuming the target object contains a unique color. The rest of the logic remains the same as Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj_indices = extract(objects(I, False, True, True), lambda x: size(x) > 1)
  mirrored_indices = cmirror(obj_indices)
  mirrored_obj = toobject(mirrored_indices, I)
  O = paint(I, shift(mirrored_obj, (height(obj_indices), 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

Version 3 simplifies the process by performing the mirroring operation on the object's indices directly using `cmirror(obj_indices)`. The mirrored indices are then used to construct the mirrored object with color values.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = toobject(extract(objects(I, False, True, True), lambda x: size(x) > 1), I)
  O = paint(I, shift(cmirror(obj), (height(obj), 0))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

Version 4 combines the mirroring and shifting operations into a single line for conciseness. `cmirror(obj)` is directly passed to `shift`, streamlining the code.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, True, True)
  obj = toobject(extract(objs, lambda x: size(x) > 1), I)
  v_shift = height(obj)
  O = paint(I, {(v, (i + v_shift, j)) for v, (i, j) in cmirror(obj)}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly manipulates the cell coordinates during the painting process.  Instead of using the `shift` function, it calculates the new coordinates for each cell in the mirrored object.


## Conclusion:

These five program versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL functions. Each version highlights various aspects of the DSL, offering distinct logical approaches and function combinations.
