## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking each distinct object (defined as connected cells of the same color, excluding the background color 0) and moving them upwards until they hit another object or the top of the grid.

**Input_0:** The object {2, (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)} moves two steps up. The object {1, (2, 1)} moves three steps up. The object {3, (2, 2)} moves three steps up.

**Input_1:** The object {6, (0, 4)} moves four steps up. The object {1, (1, 5), (1, 6)} moves five steps up. The object {2, (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7)} moves six steps up.

**Input_2:** The object {5, (2, 4)} stays in place. The object {2, (6, 1), (6, 2)} moves two steps up. The object {3, (7, 2), (8, 1), (8, 2)} moves three steps up. The object {1, (7, 3), (8, 3)} moves three steps up. 


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_e76a88a6(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    moved_objs = set()
    for obj in objs:
        upper = uppermost(obj)
        while upper > 0:
            shifted = shift(obj, (-1, 0))
            collision = any(v != 0 for v, (i, j) in toobject(shifted, I) if (i, j) not in toindices(obj))
            if collision:
                break
            obj = shifted
            upper -= 1
        moved_objs.add(obj)
    O = paint(I, merge(moved_objs))
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` extracts connected components (objects) from the input grid `I`, considering only directly adjacent cells (`False` for diagonal) and excluding the background color (`True` for `without_bg`).
2. **Iterate and Move:** The code iterates through each object `obj`. For each object:
   - **Find Top Row:** `uppermost(obj)` determines the topmost row index of the object.
   - **Shift and Check:** While the object's top row is not at the top of the grid (`upper > 0`), the object is shifted upwards (`shift(obj, (-1, 0))`). Then, it checks for collisions with other non-background cells using `toobject` and `toindices`.
   - **Update Position:** If no collision occurs, the object's position is updated.
3. **Paint to Output:** Finally, all moved objects are painted onto the input grid `I` using `paint` to generate the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_e76a88a6(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, True, False, True), key=lambda obj: uppermost(obj))
  moved_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    shifted_obj = obj
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), 0, -1):
      new_obj = shift(shifted_obj, (-1, 0))
      if len(toobject(new_obj, I) - obj) == 0:
        shifted_obj = new_obj
    moved_objs.add(shifted_obj)
  return paint(I, merge(moved_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Sort Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` extracts objects like before. `sorted` arranges objects based on their topmost row position using `uppermost(obj)`.
2. **Iterate and Move:** It iterates through each object, starting with those highest up:
   - **Shift and Check:** The inner loop iterates from the object's top row towards the grid's top. For each row, it shifts the object up and checks for collisions with non-background cells using `toobject`.
   - **Update if No Collision:** If no collision, the object's position (`shifted_obj`) is updated.
3. **Paint to Output:** After processing all objects, they are painted onto the input grid to create the output.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_e76a88a6(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  grid = I
  for obj in objs:
    h = height(obj)
    upper = uppermost(obj)
    grid = cover(grid, obj)
    new_obj = shift(obj, (-upper, 0))
    new_obj = shift(new_obj, (h, 0))
    grid = paint(grid, new_obj)
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** Like before, it identifies objects in the input grid.
2. **Iterative Processing:** It iterates over each object:
   - **Clear Object:** It removes the object from the grid using `cover`.
   - **Calculate New Position:** It determines the new position of the object, placing it at the top and then shifting it down by its height.
   - **Paint at New Position:** It paints the object at the calculated position on the modified grid.
3. **Return Modified Grid:** After processing all objects, the function returns the modified grid as the final output.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_e76a88a6(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    grid = I
    for obj in objs:
        upper = uppermost(obj)
        while upper > 0:
            new_obj = shift(obj, (-1, 0))
            if len(toobject(new_obj, I) - obj) > 0: 
                break
            upper -= 1
            obj = new_obj
        grid = paint(cover(grid, obj), obj)
    return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Iterate:** Similar to previous versions, it identifies objects and iterates through them.
2. **Shift and Check:** For each object, it repeatedly shifts it upwards and checks for potential collisions with other non-background cells.
3. **Paint if No Collision:** If a collision is detected, the loop breaks, and the object is painted onto the grid at its current position. Otherwise, it continues shifting upwards.
4. **Return Modified Grid:** After processing all objects, the modified grid is returned as the final output.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_e76a88a6(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  for obj in objs:
    i = uppermost(obj)
    while i > 0 and len(toobject(shift(obj, (-1, 0)), I)) == len(obj):
      i -= 1
      obj = shift(obj, (-1, 0))
    I = paint(cover(I, obj), obj)
  return I 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` extracts objects from the input grid `I`, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate and Move:** The code iterates through each extracted object `obj`:
   - **Find Top Position:**  It finds the uppermost row index `i` of the current object.
   - **Shift and Check:** While the object's top row is not at the grid's top (`i > 0`) and shifting the object upwards doesn't result in overlapping with other non-background cells (checked by comparing the sizes of the original object and its shifted version using `toobject`), it continues shifting the object one row up (`shift(obj, (-1, 0))`).
   - **Paint to Grid:** After finding the final position, the code first "erases" the object from its original position in the grid `I` using `cover`. Then, it "draws" the object at its new position using `paint`.
3. **Return Modified Grid:** Finally, the function returns the modified grid `I` as the output.

These five program versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the desired transformation in the DSL. Each version leverages various functions and strategies to analyze object positions, check for collisions, and ultimately move the objects to their correct locations.
