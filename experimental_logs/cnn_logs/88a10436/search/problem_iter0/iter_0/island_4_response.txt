## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying specific objects based on their unique color values and rotating them 90 degrees counterclockwise. The objects maintain their original position relative to the grid's center.

**Input_0:** 
- The object composed of '1's and '3' is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise around its center.
- The object composed of '2' remains unchanged as a 90-degree rotation would not alter its appearance. 

**Input_1:**
- The object composed of '1's and '2's is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise around its center.
- The '6' remains unchanged.

**Input_2:**
- The object composed of '3's and '1' is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise around its center.
- The object composed of '2's remains unchanged. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, F)
  rot_objs = frozenset({rot270(toobject(obj, I)) if len(obj) > 1 else obj for obj in objs})
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(rot_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, F, F, F)` extracts all objects from the grid, regardless of their color uniqueness, connectedness, or background status.
2. **Rotate Multi-cell Objects:**  Iterate through each object. If an object has more than one cell, rotate it 270 degrees counterclockwise (`rot270`) after converting it to a grid (`toobject`). Single-cell objects remain unchanged.
3. **Paint Rotated Objects:** Create a blank canvas (`canvas`) with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with zeros. Paint the rotated objects onto this canvas using `paint`.
4. **Return Output:** The resulting grid `O` is the transformed output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    pivot = centerofmass(asindices(I))
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    for obj in objs:
        if len(obj) > 1:
            O = paint(O, shift(rot270(obj), subtract(pivot, centerofmass(obj))))
        else:
            O = paint(O, obj)
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects (Excluding Background):**  `fgpartition(I)` identifies objects in the grid, excluding the background color. 
2. **Calculate Pivot:**  `centerofmass(asindices(I))` determines the center point of the grid, which acts as the pivot for rotation.
3. **Iterate and Rotate:** Iterate through each object. If an object has multiple cells, rotate it 270 degrees counterclockwise (`rot270`). Then, calculate the offset needed to reposition the object correctly after rotation using the difference between the grid's center (`pivot`) and the object's center of mass (`centerofmass(obj)`). Shift the object by this offset using `shift`.
4. **Paint Objects:** Paint each object (rotated or not) onto a blank canvas (`canvas`) initialized with zeros.
5. **Return Output:**  `O` represents the final transformed grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, F)
  rot_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    if len(obj) > 1:
      c = centerofmass(obj)
      shifted_obj = shift(obj, subtract(ORIGIN, c))
      rot_obj = rot270(shifted_obj)
      rot_objs.add(shift(rot_obj, c))
    else:
      rot_objs.add(obj)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(rot_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:**  Similar to Version 1, `objects(I, F, F, F)` extracts all objects.
2. **Rotate Around Center of Mass:** For each multi-cell object:
   - Find its center of mass (`centerofmass`).
   - Shift the object so its center of mass aligns with the origin (`ORIGIN`).
   - Rotate the shifted object 270 degrees counterclockwise.
   - Shift the rotated object back to its original position relative to the center of mass.
3. **Combine and Paint:** Combine all objects (rotated and unchanged) and paint them onto a blank canvas.
4. **Return Output:**  The transformed grid `O` is returned.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, F, F, F):
        if len(obj) > 1:
            ul = ulcorner(obj)
            shifted_obj = shift(obj, subtract(ORIGIN, ul))
            rot_obj = rot270(shifted_obj)
            O = paint(O, shift(rot_obj, ul))
        else:
            O = paint(O, obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialize Canvas:** Create a blank canvas (`canvas`) of the same size as the input, filled with zeros.
2. **Iterate and Rotate:** Loop through each object in the input grid. 
   - If an object has more than one cell:
     - Calculate the coordinates of its upper-left corner (`ulcorner`).
     - Shift the object so that its upper-left corner aligns with the origin. 
     - Rotate the shifted object 270 degrees counterclockwise.
     - Shift the rotated object back to its original position by adding the original upper-left corner coordinates.
     - Paint the rotated object onto the canvas.
   - If an object has only one cell, paint it directly onto the canvas without rotation.
3. **Return Output:** The final transformed grid `O` is returned.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, F, F, F):
    if len(obj) > 1:
      O = cover(O, obj)
      O = paint(O, shift(rot270(obj), subtract(centerofmass(asindices(I)), centerofmass(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Direct Modification:** Instead of creating a separate canvas, this version modifies the input grid (`I`) directly.
2. **Iterate, Cover, and Rotate:** For each multi-cell object:
    - "Erase" the original object from the grid using `cover`.
    - Calculate the offset required to center the rotated object based on the grid's center of mass and the object's center of mass.
    - Rotate the object counterclockwise and shift it by the calculated offset.
    - Paint the rotated and shifted object onto the grid.
3. **Return Modified Input:**  Return the modified input grid `O` as the output.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressive power of the provided DSL.
