## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking the input grids to the output grids seems to involve the following logic:

* **Identifying Non-Background Objects:** The transformation focuses on objects formed by digits other than the background digit (most frequent digit). 
* **Moving Objects Upwards:**  The non-background objects are moved upwards until they hit either the top border of the grid or another non-background object. 

**Let's illustrate with examples:**

* **Input_0:** The object formed by digits 1, 2, and 3 is moved upwards until it hits the top border.
* **Input_1:** The object formed by digits 1 and 2 is moved upwards until it hits the top border. The object formed by digit 6 is moved upwards until it hits the object formed by digits 1 and 2.
* **Input_2:** The object formed by digits 3 and 1 is moved upwards until it hits the top border. The object formed by digits 2 is moved upwards until it hits the object formed by digits 3 and 1.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the DSL functions:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, True, True) 
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    shifted_obj = obj
    while uppermost(shifted_obj) > 0 and len(toobject(shift(toindices(shifted_obj), UP), I) - obj) == 0:
      shifted_obj = shift(shifted_obj, UP)
    O = paint(cover(O, obj), shifted_obj) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, False, True, True)` extracts all non-background objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate and Move:** The code iterates through each object `obj` in `objs`.
3. **Shift Upwards:** For each object, it keeps shifting it upwards (`shift(shifted_obj, UP)`) as long as the upper-most cell of the shifted object hasn't reached the top of the grid (`uppermost(shifted_obj) > 0`) and it's not overlapping with other objects (`len(toobject(...) - obj) == 0`).
4. **Paint to Output:** The shifted object is painted onto a copy of the input grid (`O`) after clearing its original position (`cover(O, obj)`).

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(1, len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        k = i
        while k > 0 and I[k-1][j] == mostcolor(I):
          k -= 1
        O = paint(cover(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))}), {(I[i][j], (k, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Cells:** This version iterates through each cell of the grid from the second row onwards.
2. **Check for Non-Background:** If a cell is not the background color, it's identified as part of an object.
3. **Find Destination Row:** The code then finds the highest empty row (`I[k-1][j] == mostcolor(I)`) above the current cell to move the object to. 
4. **Paint to Output:**  The cell is cleared from its original position and painted to the destination row on the output grid (`O`).

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
               merge(apply(lambda obj: toobject(
                 {(i, min(range(uppermost(obj), -1, -1), key=lambda r: index(I, (r, j)) != mostcolor(I))): (v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj},
                 I), 
               objects(I, False, True, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, False, True, True)` extracts all non-background objects.
2. **Calculate New Positions:**  For each object, `apply` calculates the new row position for each cell using `min` to find the highest available row within the object's vertical span.
3. **Create New Objects:**  `toobject` constructs new objects with cells at their new positions.
4. **Merge and Paint:**  The new objects are merged and painted onto a blank canvas of the background color.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(len(I[0])):
    for i in range(1, len(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        k = i - 1
        while k >= 0 and I[k][j] == mostcolor(I):
          k -= 1
        O = paint(cover(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))}), {(I[i][j], (k + 1, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is very similar to Version 2, but iterates through the grid column by column instead of row by row. The logic for finding the destination row and painting the object remains the same. 

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def move_up(obj, grid):
    shifted = shift(obj, UP)
    return shifted if uppermost(shifted) >= 0 and len(toobject(toindices(shifted), grid) - obj) == 0 else obj
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda obj: toobject(toindices(extract(rapply(move_up, obj, range(uppermost(obj))), identity), I), I), objects(I, False, True, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `move_up`:** This helper function attempts to move an object one row up if possible, otherwise returns the original object.
2. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, False, True, True)` extracts all non-background objects.
3. **Find New Positions:** For each object, it repeatedly applies the `move_up` function until the object can't move further up. 
4. **Create New Objects:**  `toobject` is used to construct new objects with cells in their new positions.
5. **Merge and Paint:** The new objects are merged and painted onto a blank canvas of the background color. 

## Conclusion:

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to solving the given task in the provided DSL. Each version utilizes distinct logic or function combinations while achieving the same desired transformation.
