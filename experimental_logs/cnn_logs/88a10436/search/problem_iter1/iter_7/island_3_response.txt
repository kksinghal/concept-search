## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place in these examples can be described as **"moving objects composed of non-zero digits to the bottom-left corner of the grid, preserving their spatial arrangement relative to each other"**. 

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
* The object formed by digits '1', '2' and '3' is moved to the bottom-left corner. 
* The relative positions of the '1', '2', and '3' digits within the object are maintained.
* The background (digit '0') remains unchanged.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
*  The two objects (formed by digits '1','2' and digit '6' respectively) are moved to the bottom-left.
* The relative vertical positioning of the objects is maintained ('6' above '1' and '2').
* Again, background digits ('0') are untouched.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
* Similar to the previous examples, the two objects are shifted to the bottom-left while preserving their internal structure and relative positions.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    shifted_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (height(I) - height(obj), -leftmost(obj))) for obj in objs)
    painted = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(shifted_objs))
    return painted 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, False, False, True)` extracts all objects formed by non-zero digits.
2. **Calculate shift:** For each object, calculate the vertical and horizontal shift required to move its upper-left corner to the bottom-left corner of the grid.
3. **Shift objects:** `shift(obj, (vertical_shift, horizontal_shift))` moves each object to its new position.
4. **Paint objects onto a blank canvas:** `paint` places the shifted objects onto a new grid filled with zeros.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
  non_zero_indices = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, 0))
  min_i, min_j = ulcorner(non_zero_indices)
  shifted_indices = frozenset((i - min_i + height(I) - 1, j - min_j) for i, j in non_zero_indices)
  return fill(canvas(0, shape(I)), 1, shifted_indices)
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find non-zero indices:** Identify all indices containing non-zero digits.
2. **Find top-leftmost non-zero index:**  This determines the required shift.
3. **Calculate shifted indices:** Shift all non-zero indices to their new positions relative to the bottom-left corner.
4. **Fill a blank canvas:** Create a new grid filled with zeros and fill in the shifted indices with '1's, effectively moving the objects.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  bottom_left_corner = (height(I)-1, 0)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(shift(obj, subtract(bottom_left_corner, ulcorner(obj))) for obj in objs))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Extract objects:** Similar to Version 1, extract objects composed of non-zero digits.
2. **Define the destination:**  Set the bottom-left corner of the grid as the target location.
3. **Calculate individual shifts:** For each object, calculate the shift vector needed to move its upper-left corner to the bottom-left.
4. **Shift and combine:**  Shift each object and merge them onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  shifted_grid = tuple(tuple(0 for _ in range(w)) for _ in range(h)) 
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != 0:
        shifted_grid[h - i - 1][j] = val
  return shifted_grid
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Create an empty grid:** Initialize a new grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with zeros.
2. **Iterate and shift:**  Iterate through the input grid, and for each non-zero digit, place it in the new grid with a vertically flipped index. 

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
    shifted = vmirror(I)
    return tuple(tuple(val if val != 0 else 0 for val in row) for row in shifted) 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Vertical mirroring:** `vmirror(I)` flips the input grid vertically.
2. **Return:** The mirrored grid now has the objects effectively moved to the bottom-left, maintaining their relative positions.


Each of these programs approaches the problem differently, demonstrating the flexibility of the DSL and showcasing various ways to achieve the desired transformation.
