## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects made up of specific colors (1, 2, and 3), then moving them vertically downwards, stacking them on top of each other. The stacking order seems to be determined by the order of appearance of the objects in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom scan of the input grid.

**Input_0:**

* The objects formed by colors 1, 2, and 3 are moved downwards and stacked. The object '2 2 \n 0 1' is moved first, followed by the object '1 3', resulting in the output grid.

**Input_1:**

* The object '1 1 \n 2 2 2' is moved first and placed at the bottom. Then, the object '6' is moved down on top of it.

**Input_2:**

* The objects '2 2' and '3 1 \n 3 3 1' are moved downwards. The '2 2' object is positioned first, followed by the larger object.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = sorted(mfilter(objects(I, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) in {1, 2, 3}), key=lambda obj: ulcorner(obj)[0] * 100 + ulcorner(obj)[1])
  offset = (0, 0)
  output = I
  for obj in objs:
    output = paint(cover(output, obj), shift(obj, offset))
    offset = add(offset, (height(obj), 0))
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Sort Objects:** `objs` filters the objects in the input grid (`I`) to only include those containing colors 1, 2, or 3, using functions from Program A. Then, it sorts these objects based on their upper-left corner's row and column index, ensuring a top-to-bottom, left-to-right processing order.
2. **Iterate and Move:** The program iterates through each object in the sorted `objs`. For each object:
    * It erases the object from its original position in the `output` grid using `cover`.
    * It calculates the new position using `offset` and shifts the object using `shift`.
    * It paints the shifted object onto the `output` grid using `paint`.
    * It updates the `offset` by adding the height of the current object to ensure the next object is stacked below.
3. **Return Output:** The modified grid (`output`) is returned.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = mfilter(objects(I, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) in {1, 2, 3})
  output = I
  bottom = height(I)
  for obj in objs:
    output = paint(cover(output, obj), shift(obj, (bottom - uppermost(obj), 0)))
    bottom -= height(obj)
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** This version identifies the objects containing colors 1, 2, or 3, similar to version 1.
2. **Calculate Bottom and Iterate:** It initializes `bottom` to the height of the input grid, representing the bottom-most available row for placement. It iterates through each object:
    * It covers the object in the `output` grid.
    * It calculates the vertical offset to position the object's top at the current `bottom`.
    * It shifts and paints the object onto the `output` grid.
    * It updates `bottom` by subtracting the object's height, preparing for the next object.
3. **Return Output:** The final `output` grid with stacked objects is returned.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  def move_obj(obj, grid, bottom):
    return paint(cover(grid, obj), shift(obj, (bottom - uppermost(obj), 0)))

  filtered_objs = mfilter(objects(I, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) in {1, 2, 3})
  return last(rapply(lambda bottom: last(rapply(lambda grid: move_obj(first(filtered_objs), grid, bottom), repeat(I, size(filtered_objs)))), interval(height(I) - sum(height(obj) for obj in filtered_objs), height(I), 1)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version takes a more functional approach, utilizing nested `rapply` calls for iteration and state management.

1. **Define `move_obj`:**  A helper function to move a single object to a given `bottom` position within a given `grid`.
2. **Filter Objects:** Similar to previous versions, it identifies the target objects.
3. **Nested `rapply`:** This is where the magic happens:
    * The outer `rapply` iterates through possible bottom positions for placing the objects.
    * The inner `rapply` iterates through the input grid multiple times (equal to the number of objects), effectively simulating a loop. 
    * In each iteration of the inner `rapply`, `first(filtered_objs)` picks the next object to be placed, `move_obj` places it at the current `bottom`, and the result is passed to the next iteration.
4. **Extract Final Grid:** Finally, `last` is used twice to select the final grid from the nested `rapply` results.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  def process_row(row_index, grid, objs):
    if not objs or row_index >= height(grid):
      return grid
    obj = first(objs)
    if uppermost(obj) == row_index:
      return process_row(row_index, paint(cover(grid, obj), shift(obj, (height(grid) - height(obj), 0))), remove(obj, objs))
    else:
      return process_row(row_index + 1, grid, objs)

  return process_row(0, I, mfilter(objects(I, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) in {1, 2, 3}))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes recursion and a helper function to process the grid row by row.

1. **Define `process_row`:** A recursive helper function that processes a single row at a given `row_index`:
    * It checks if there are any objects left or if the `row_index` is outside the grid; if so, it returns the current grid.
    * It picks the first object and checks if its uppermost row matches the current `row_index`.
    * If they match, it moves the object to the bottom, updates the grid, removes the object from the list, and recursively calls itself with the next row.
    * If they don't match, it recursively calls itself with the next row, keeping the object list and grid unchanged. 
2. **Initialize Recursion:** The main function calls `process_row` with the initial `row_index` as 0, the input grid (`I`), and the filtered list of objects.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  filtered_objs = sorted(mfilter(objects(I, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) in {1, 2, 3}), key=lambda obj: (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)))
  output = I
  bottom = height(I)
  for i in range(len(filtered_objs)):
    obj = filtered_objs[i]
    new_pos = (bottom - height(obj), leftmost(obj))
    output = paint(cover(output, obj), shift(obj, subtract(new_pos, ulcorner(obj))))
    bottom -= height(obj)
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes sorting and iterative object placement.

1. **Filter and Sort:**  It identifies the target objects and sorts them based on their upper-left corner's row and column index to ensure proper stacking order.
2. **Iterate and Calculate:** It initializes `bottom` to the grid height. It then iterates through the sorted object list:
    * For each object, it calculates the `new_pos` to align its top with the current `bottom` while maintaining its horizontal position.
    * It covers the object, shifts it to the `new_pos`, and paints it onto the `output` grid.
    * It updates `bottom` to the new available bottom position.
3. **Return Output:** The program returns the final `output` grid.
