## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) containing the digit '5' and mirroring them vertically, placing the mirrored copy directly above the original object. 

**Input 0:**

- The object containing '5' is mirrored vertically.
- The mirrored object is placed above the original, shifting the original object and the digit '1' downwards.

**Input 1:**

- The object containing '5' is mirrored vertically.
- The mirrored object is placed directly above the original.

**Input 2:**

- The object containing '5' is a single cell.
- The mirrored object, also a single cell, is placed directly above. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:


**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
    five_indices = ofcolor(I, FIVE)
    mirrored_indices = frozenset((height(I) - 1 - i, j) for i, j in five_indices)
    O = paint(I, recolor(FIVE, mirrored_indices)) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '5' locations:** `five_indices = ofcolor(I, FIVE)` identifies the indices of cells containing the digit '5'.
2. **Mirror indices:** `mirrored_indices = frozenset((height(I) - 1 - i, j) for i, j in five_indices)` calculates the mirrored indices for the identified '5' cells. The mirroring is done with respect to the horizontal line dividing the grid in half.
3. **Paint mirrored object:** `O = paint(I, recolor(FIVE, mirrored_indices))` creates a new grid ('O') by painting a new object with color '5' at the mirrored indices on top of the original grid ('I').


**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
    five_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), FIVE))
    mirrored_obj =  vmirror(five_obj)
    shift_amount = (height(five_obj), 0)
    shifted_obj = shift(mirrored_obj, shift_amount)
    O = paint(I, shifted_obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '5' object:**  `five_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), FIVE))` extracts the object containing '5' from the input grid.
2. **Mirror object:** `mirrored_obj =  vmirror(five_obj)` creates a vertically mirrored version of the extracted object.
3. **Calculate shift:** `shift_amount = (height(five_obj), 0)` determines the amount to shift the mirrored object downwards, which is equal to the height of the original object.
4. **Shift mirrored object:** `shifted_obj = shift(mirrored_obj, shift_amount)` moves the mirrored object to its final position above the original.
5. **Paint mirrored object:** `O = paint(I, shifted_obj)` paints the shifted mirrored object onto the original grid, creating the output grid.


**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
  five_indices = ofcolor(I, FIVE)
  top_row = uppermost(five_indices)
  mirrored_indices = frozenset((top_row - 1 - (i - top_row), j) for i, j in five_indices)
  O = paint(I, recolor(FIVE, mirrored_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '5' locations:** `five_indices = ofcolor(I, FIVE)` identifies the indices of cells containing the digit '5'.
2. **Find top row:** `top_row = uppermost(five_indices)` identifies the row index of the uppermost '5'.
3. **Mirror indices:** `mirrored_indices = frozenset((top_row - 1 - (i - top_row), j) for i, j in five_indices)` calculates the mirrored indices for the identified '5' cells. The mirroring is done with respect to the row immediately above the top row of the object. 
4. **Paint mirrored object:** `O = paint(I, recolor(FIVE, mirrored_indices))` creates a new grid ('O') by painting a new object with color '5' at the mirrored indices on top of the original grid ('I'). 


**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  five_obj = first(colorfilter(objs, FIVE))
  top_left_corner = ulcorner(five_obj)
  mirrored_obj =  shift(vmirror(five_obj), (2 * top_left_corner[0], 0))
  O = paint(I, mirrored_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, F)` extracts all objects from the input grid.
2. **Extract '5' object:** `five_obj = first(colorfilter(objs, FIVE))` extracts the object containing '5' from the extracted objects.
3. **Find top-left corner:** `top_left_corner = ulcorner(five_obj)` gets the index of the top-left corner of the '5' object.
4. **Mirror and shift:** `mirrored_obj =  shift(vmirror(five_obj), (2 * top_left_corner[0], 0))` mirrors the '5' object vertically and shifts it downwards by twice the row index of the top-left corner, effectively placing it above the original.
5. **Paint mirrored object:** `O = paint(I, mirrored_obj)` paints the mirrored and shifted object onto the original grid to produce the output grid. 


**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
  five_obj = first(colorfilter(partition(I), FIVE))
  mirrored_obj = vmirror(five_obj)
  O = paint(I, shift(mirrored_obj, (height(five_obj), 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition into objects:** `five_obj = first(colorfilter(partition(I), FIVE))` partitions the grid into objects based on connected components and extracts the object containing '5'.
2. **Vertical mirroring:** `mirrored_obj = vmirror(five_obj)` generates a vertically mirrored copy of the '5' object.
3. **Shift and paint:** `O = paint(I, shift(mirrored_obj, (height(five_obj), 0)))` shifts the mirrored object downwards by its height (placing it directly above the original) and paints it onto the input grid to produce the output.


These five programs offer different approaches to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL. They highlight the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL in solving spatial reasoning problems.
