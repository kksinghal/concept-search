## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to involve identifying an object containing the value '5' and then mirroring other objects in the grid based on the position of this '5' object. 

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The object with '5' acts as an axis of symmetry.
- The top-left portion of the grid is mirrored to the bottom-right.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The object with '5' acts as a pivot point.
- The grid is rotated 180 degrees around this pivot.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- The object with '5' again acts as an axis of symmetry.
- This time, the bottom-left portion of the grid is mirrored to the top-right.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    five_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), FIVE))
    five_center = centerofmass(five_obj)
    mirrored_objs = frozenset(
        hmirror(obj) if centerofmass(obj)[1] < five_center[1] else obj
        for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)
    )
    painted_grid = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), mirrored_objs)
    O = painted_grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find the '5' Object:** Identify the object containing the value '5'.
2. **Determine Axis of Symmetry:** Calculate the center of mass of the '5' object to determine the axis of symmetry.
3. **Mirror Objects:** Mirror objects based on their position relative to the axis of symmetry (horizontally in this case).
4. **Paint Mirrored Objects:** Create a blank canvas and paint the mirrored objects onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    five_loc = first(toindices(first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), FIVE))))
    O = rot180(shift(I, multiply(five_loc, NEG_TWO)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find the '5' Location:** Find the index of the '5' within the grid.
2. **Shift and Rotate:** Shift the grid to align the '5' with the origin and then rotate the grid by 180 degrees. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    five_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), FIVE))
    five_center = centerofmass(five_obj)
    mirrored_objs = frozenset(
        vmirror(obj) if centerofmass(obj)[0] < five_center[0] else obj
        for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)
    )
    painted_grid = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), mirrored_objs)
    O = painted_grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find the '5' Object:** Identify the object containing the value '5'.
2. **Determine Axis of Symmetry:** Calculate the center of mass of the '5' object to determine the axis of symmetry.
3. **Mirror Objects:** Mirror objects based on their position relative to the axis of symmetry (vertically in this case).
4. **Paint Mirrored Objects:** Create a blank canvas and paint the mirrored objects onto it.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    five_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), FIVE))
    five_center = centerofmass(five_obj)
    transformed_objs = frozenset(
        shift(
            hmirror(obj) if centerofmass(obj)[1] < five_center[1] else obj,
            (2 * (five_center[0] - centerofmass(obj)[0]), 0)
        )
        for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)
    )
    painted_grid = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), transformed_objs)
    O = painted_grid
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find '5' Object and Center:** Identify the object containing '5' and calculate its center of mass.
2. **Transform Objects:** Iterate through each object:
    - If an object's center is to the left of the '5' center, mirror it horizontally.
    - Shift each object vertically by twice the difference between the '5' center's row and the object's center's row.
3. **Paint to Canvas:** Paint the transformed objects onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    five_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), FIVE))
    five_center = centerofmass(five_obj)
    transformed_objs = frozenset(
        shift(
            vmirror(obj) if centerofmass(obj)[0] < five_center[0] else obj,
            (0, 2 * (five_center[1] - centerofmass(obj)[1]))
        )
        for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)
    )
    painted_grid = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), transformed_objs)
    O = painted_grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find '5' Object and Center:**  Identify the object containing '5' and calculate its center of mass.
2. **Transform Objects:** Iterate through each object:
    - If an object's center is above the '5' center, mirror it vertically.
    - Shift each object horizontally by twice the difference between the '5' center's column and the object's center's column.
3. **Paint to Canvas:** Paint the transformed objects onto a blank canvas. 

These are five distinct programs using different combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same transformation. They demonstrate different approaches to problem-solving and highlight the flexibility of the DSL.
