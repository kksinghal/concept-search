## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Object Isolation:** The input grid contains several objects formed by connected digits of the same value (e.g., the '2's form one object).
2. **Shifting:** Each object is individually shifted downwards until its topmost cell aligns with the bottommost row of the grid.
3. **Horizontal Rearrangement:**  While shifting, objects are also rearranged horizontally. The exact logic behind this rearrangement is not immediately clear, but it seems related to maintaining some spatial relationships between objects.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

This transformation is similar to the previous one:

1. **Object Isolation:** Objects are identified.
2. **Shifting:**  Objects are shifted downwards until they reach the bottom of the grid.
3. **Horizontal Compression:** Unlike the previous case, the horizontal positions of the objects are compressed, removing any empty columns that might have resulted from the downward shift.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

This transformation follows a similar pattern:

1. **Object Isolation:** Objects are identified.
2. **Shifting:**  Objects are shifted upwards until their bottommost cell aligns with the topmost row of the grid.
3. **Horizontal Rearrangement:** Similar to Input_0, objects are rearranged horizontally while being shifted upwards. Again, the logic isn't immediately obvious but seems to preserve spatial relationships.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  shifted_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    offset = (len(I) - lowermost(obj) - 1, centerofmass(obj)[1] - centerofmass(objs)[1])
    shifted_objs.add(shift(obj, offset))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(shifted_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** We first extract all non-background objects from the input grid (`objs`).
2. **Calculating Offsets:** For each object, we determine a vertical offset to bring its top to the bottom row. Additionally, a horizontal offset is calculated to center the object based on the average horizontal position of all objects.
3. **Shifting and Painting:** We then shift each object by the calculated offset and paint it onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  max_bottom = maximum(apply(lambda o: lowermost(o), objs))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda o: shift(o, (len(I) - max_bottom - 1, centerofmass(o)[1] - centerofmass(objs)[1])), objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction & Max Bottom:** Similar to Version 1, we extract objects and calculate the maximum bottom edge.
2. **Combined Shift and Paint:**  This version combines shifting and painting within a single `apply` function. We shift each object downwards by the difference between the grid height and the maximum bottom edge, and horizontally center it as before. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, False, False, True), key=lambda o: -lowermost(o))
  shifted_objs = set()
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    offset = (len(I) - lowermost(obj) - 1 - i, centerofmass(obj)[1] - centerofmass(objs)[1])
    shifted_objs.add(shift(obj, offset))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(shifted_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sorted Object Extraction:**  We extract objects and sort them based on their bottommost row, starting with the object furthest down.
2. **Sequential Shifting:** We iterate through the sorted objects, applying a downward shift based on the object's position in the sorted list. This ensures that objects don't overlap when shifted downwards.  Horizontal centering is still applied.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda o: shift(o, (len(I) - lowermost(o) - 1, (width(I) - width(o)) // 2)), objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on a potentially simpler horizontal rearrangement:

1. **Object Extraction:** Objects are extracted.
2. **Simplified Horizontal Centering:** Instead of using the average position of all objects, this version centers each object horizontally based on its width and the grid width.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  h = height(I)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda o: shift(o, (h - lowermost(o) - 1, (h - width(o)) // 2)), objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version simplifies the horizontal centering further, assuming a square input grid:

1. **Object Extraction & Grid Height:** Objects are extracted, and the grid height is stored.
2. **Height-Based Centering:** Objects are shifted downwards as before. The horizontal centering assumes the grid is square and uses the grid height to center objects.

## Note:

These programs are developed based on a limited understanding of the exact horizontal rearrangement logic. Further input-output pairs are needed to refine this logic and achieve a perfect score. The provided programs offer diverse approaches to shifting and rearranging objects, and with more examples, it should be possible to zero in on the correct transformation.
