## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying non-background objects within the input grid and moving them to a specific location. The destination seems to be dependent on the object's size and the order they appear in the grid. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The object consisting of digits 2 and 1 is moved to the bottom-left corner, leaving its original position empty. 

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* All three objects are moved to the left edge of the grid, maintaining their relative vertical positions.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* The object with digit 1 is removed.
* The objects with digits 2 and 3 are moved upwards, maintaining their original horizontal positioning.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve_25d487eb(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    sorted_objs = order(objs, size)
    moved_objs = []
    for i, obj in enumerate(sorted_objs):
        h = height(obj)
        offset = (len(I) - h * (i + 1), 0)
        moved_objs.append(shift(obj, offset))
    O = I
    for obj in moved_objs:
        O = paint(cover(O, obj), obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We use `objects(I, T, F, T)` to extract non-background objects from the grid.
2. **Sort Objects:**  Objects are sorted by their height using `order(objs, size)`.
3. **Calculate Offset:** For each object, the offset is calculated based on its height and its order in the sorted list. The offset moves the object to the bottom-left, stacking them vertically. 
4. **Move Objects:** Each object is moved to its new location by first covering the original position with the background color (`cover`) and then painting the object at the offset location (`paint`).

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve_25d487eb(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    O = I
    for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
        bg = mostcolor(I)
        O = fill(O, bg, toindices(obj))
        x = ulcorner(obj)[1]
        h = height(obj)
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (len(I) - h - i * h, -x)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1, `objects` is used to extract non-background objects.
2. **Iterate & Move:** The code iterates through each object. For each object:
    * It fills the object's original location with the background color.
    * It calculates the horizontal offset to align the object to the left edge (`-x`).
    * It calculates the vertical offset based on the object's height and its order in the iteration, ensuring they stack vertically from the bottom.
    * Finally, it paints the object at the new location.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve_25d487eb(I):
    O = I
    for v in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
        obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, v), I)
        O = cover(O, obj)
        h = height(obj)
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (len(I) - h - v * h, -leftmost(obj))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Colors:** Instead of identifying objects directly, this version iterates through each unique color in the grid (excluding the background color).
2. **Extract & Move:** For each color:
    * It extracts the object of that color using `toobject` and `ofcolor`.
    * It covers the object's original location.
    * It calculates the vertical offset based on the color value, leading to a deterministic stacking order.
    * It shifts and paints the object to the left edge.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve_25d487eb(I):
    objs = sorted(objects(I, T, F, T), key=lambda obj: (height(obj), -ulcorner(obj)[1]), reverse=True)
    O = I
    for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
        O = cover(O, obj)
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (len(I) - height(obj) * (i + 1), -leftmost(obj))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Sort:** This version extracts the objects and sorts them based on height and then by the column index of their upper-left corner (rightmost objects with the same height are prioritized).
2. **Move Objects:**  It iterates through the sorted objects and moves them to the left edge, stacking them vertically based on their position in the sorted list.


**Version 5:**

```python
def solve_25d487eb(I):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))
    objs = sorted(objects(I, T, F, T), key=lambda obj: (-height(obj), ulcorner(obj)[1]))
    y = h
    for obj in objs:
        h_obj = height(obj)
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (y - h_obj, -leftmost(obj))))
        y -= h_obj
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** This version creates an empty canvas filled with the background color.
2. **Extract and Sort:** It extracts the objects and sorts them based on height (descending) and then by the column index of their upper-left corner.
3. **Place Objects:** It iterates through the sorted objects and places them on the canvas from bottom to top, aligning them to the left edge.

These are just five examples, and many other variations are possible using the provided DSL functions. The key takeaway is to understand the underlying logic of the transformation and leverage the DSL's capabilities to express it in code effectively.
