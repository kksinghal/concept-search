## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation mirrors the input grid along the diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and then shifts all non-background objects to the left, aligning them to the left edge of the grid.

**Input 0:**

1. **Diagonal Mirroring:** The diagonal mirroring flips the positions of elements across the diagonal. For example, the element at (1,0) moves to (0,1) and vice versa.
2. **Left Shifting:**  After mirroring, all non-zero elements (representing objects) are shifted leftwards until they touch the left edge of the grid. 

**Input 1 & 2:**

The same logic of diagonal mirroring followed by left shifting applies to Input 1 and 2 as well.

## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  mirrored_grid = dmirror(I)
  objs = objects(mirrored_grid, False, False, True)
  shifted_objs = merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, -leftmost(obj))), objs))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), shifted_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mirrored_grid = dmirror(I)`:**  Mirrors the input grid (`I`) diagonally.
2. **`objs = objects(mirrored_grid, False, False, True)`:** Extracts non-background objects from the mirrored grid.
3. **`shifted_objs = merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, -leftmost(obj))), objs))`:** Shifts each object leftwards by a distance equal to the column index of its leftmost cell.
4. **`return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), shifted_objs)`:** Creates a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input grid and paints the shifted objects onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return dmirror(hconcat(compress(dmirror(I)), canvas(mostcolor(I), (height(I), width(I) - width(compress(dmirror(I)))))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`dmirror(I)`:** Mirrors the input grid diagonally.
2. **`compress(dmirror(I))`:** Removes empty columns from the left side of the mirrored grid.
3. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), (height(I), width(I) - width(compress(dmirror(I))))))`:** Creates a canvas of the background color with width equal to the number of removed columns. 
4. **`hconcat(...)`:** Concatenates the compressed grid with the newly created canvas, effectively pushing the objects to the left edge.
5. **`dmirror(...)`:** Mirrors the concatenated grid diagonally again to revert to the original orientation.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj))), objects(dmirror(I), False, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`dmirror(I)`:** Mirrors the input grid diagonally.
2. **`objects(..., False, False, True)`:** Extracts non-background objects from the mirrored grid.
3. **`apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj))), ...)`:** Shifts each object to the top-left corner (0,0).
4. **`merge(...)`:**  Merges all shifted objects.
5. **`paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), ...)`:**  Paints the merged objects onto a new canvas with the original background color and size.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return rot270(hconcat(compress(rot90(I)), canvas(mostcolor(I), (width(I), height(I) - width(compress(rot90(I)))))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes rotations to achieve the diagonal mirroring and left-shifting effect.

1. **`rot90(I)`:** Rotates the input grid 90 degrees clockwise.
2. **`compress(rot90(I))`:** Removes empty rows from the top (which were originally empty columns on the left).
3. **`canvas(...)`:** Creates a canvas of the background color with height equal to the number of removed rows.
4. **`hconcat(...)`:**  Concatenates the compressed grid with the new canvas, pushing the objects upwards.
5. **`rot270(...)`:** Rotates the grid 270 degrees clockwise (equivalent to a 90-degree anticlockwise rotation), bringing it back to the original orientation but with the objects shifted to the left.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), shift(toindices(dmirror(toobject(toindices(obj), I))), (-uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj)))), objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on manipulating individual cells of each object:

1. **`objs = objects(I, False, False, True)`:** Extracts non-background objects.
2.  **`apply(...)`:**  Applies a series of transformations to each object.
    - **`toindices(obj)`:**  Gets the indices of each object's cells.
    - **`toobject(toindices(obj), I)`:** Extracts the object with its original colors from the grid.
    - **`dmirror(...)`:** Mirrors the object diagonally.
    - **`shift(...)`:** Shifts the object to the top-left corner.
    - **`recolor(color(obj), ...)`:**  Recolors the shifted object with its original color.
3. **`merge(...)`:** Merges all transformed objects.
4. **`paint(...)`:** Paints the merged objects onto a blank canvas.


These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation using different combinations of DSL functions, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
