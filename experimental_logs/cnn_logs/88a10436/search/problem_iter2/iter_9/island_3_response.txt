## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be moving all non-background objects to the left side of the grid, maintaining their relative vertical positions. 

**Input 0:** Objects are shifted to the left, filling the empty spaces created by the background.
**Input 1:** Similar to Input 0, objects are moved leftwards, preserving their vertical order.
**Input 2:**  Again, the transformation shifts the objects towards the left, leaving the rightmost columns empty.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  """
  Iterates through each column from right to left. 
  Moves non-background objects in each column to the leftmost available position.
  """
  transformed = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  for j in range(width(grid) - 1, -1, -1):
    for i in range(height(grid)):
      if grid[i][j] != mostcolor(grid):
        obj = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda x: (i, j) in toindices(x))
        leftmost_empty = next((k for k in range(j) if transformed[i][k] == mostcolor(grid)), 0)
        transformed = paint(transformed, shift(obj, (0, leftmost_empty - j))) 
  return transformed
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates a blank canvas (`transformed`) filled with the background color, having the same shape as the input `grid`.
2. **Column-wise Iteration:** Iterates through each column (`j`) from right to left.
3. **Object Identification:** For each cell in the column, checks if it's a non-background color. If so, extracts the object using `extract` and `objects`.
4. **Leftmost Empty Cell:** Finds the leftmost empty cell in the same row (`i`) on the `transformed` grid.
5. **Shift and Paint:** Calculates the shift amount (`leftmost_empty - j`) and moves the object to the leftmost empty position using `shift` and `paint`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  """
  Collects all non-background objects and their upper-left corner positions.
  Sorts objects based on their column indices.
  Paints objects onto a blank canvas from left to right, respecting their order.
  """
  objs = [(ulcorner(obj)[1], obj) for obj in objects(grid, False, True, True)]
  objs.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
  transformed = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  current_j = 0
  for j, obj in objs:
    transformed = paint(transformed, shift(obj, (0, current_j - j)))
    current_j += width(obj)
  return transformed
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Collection & Sorting:** Extracts all objects and their upper-left corner column positions. Sorts them based on the column index.
2. **Canvas and Iteration:** Initializes a blank canvas and iterates through the sorted objects.
3. **Painting and Position Tracking:** Paints each object onto the canvas, starting from the leftmost position (`current_j`). Updates `current_j` to track the next available position. 


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  """
  Recursively moves the rightmost non-background object to the leftmost empty position.
  Repeats until no more objects can be moved.
  """
  def move_rightmost(g):
    for j in range(width(g) - 1, -1, -1):
      for i in range(height(g)):
        if g[i][j] != mostcolor(g):
          obj = extract(objects(g, False, True, True), lambda x: (i, j) in toindices(x))
          leftmost_empty = next((k for k in range(j) if g[i][k] == mostcolor(g)), 0)
          return paint(cover(g, obj), shift(obj, (0, leftmost_empty - j)))
    return g
  
  transformed = grid
  while transformed != move_rightmost(transformed):
    transformed = move_rightmost(transformed)
  return transformed
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`move_rightmost` Function:** Defines a helper function to find and move the rightmost object to the leftmost available position.
2. **Recursive Movement:** Repeatedly calls `move_rightmost` on the `transformed` grid until no further changes are made, indicating all objects are positioned correctly.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  """
  Creates a new grid with compressed width by removing empty columns from the right.
  Paints the objects from the original grid onto this compressed grid.
  """
  compressed_width = max(rightmost(obj) for obj in objects(grid, False, True, True)) + 1
  compressed_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), (height(grid), compressed_width))
  for obj in objects(grid, False, True, True):
    compressed_grid = paint(compressed_grid, obj)
  return compressed_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Compressed Width:** Determines the minimum width required to accommodate all objects without empty columns on the right.
2. **Compressed Grid:** Creates a new grid with this compressed width.
3. **Object Painting:**  Paints the objects from the original grid onto the compressed grid, effectively moving them to the left.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  """
  Utilizes the hsplit function to divide the grid into individual columns.
  Filters out empty columns and concatenates the remaining columns back together.
  """
  columns = hsplit(grid, width(grid))
  non_empty_columns = tuple(col for col in columns if any(v != mostcolor(grid) for row in col for v in row))
  return hconcat(*non_empty_columns) if non_empty_columns else grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Column Splitting:** Splits the grid into individual columns using `hsplit`.
2. **Empty Column Filtering:**  Filters out columns containing only the background color.
3. **Horizontal Concatenation:** Concatenates the remaining non-empty columns horizontally using `hconcat`, resulting in a grid with objects shifted to the left.

These five program versions offer different approaches to achieve the same transformation. Each version leverages distinct logic and combinations of DSL functions, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
