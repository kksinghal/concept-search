## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to extract all non-background objects from the input grid and stack them vertically on a new canvas. The order of stacking is determined by the object's color, with the smallest color value at the top and the largest at the bottom.

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

1. Three objects are identified (color 2, 1, and 3).
2. A new canvas is created with the background color (0) and dimensions to fit all objects.
3. The objects are painted onto the canvas from top to bottom, ordered by their color (2, then 1, then 3).

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

1. Four objects are identified (color 6, 1, 2, and 0).
2.  A new canvas is created, similar to the previous example.
3. Objects are stacked based on color (6, 1, 2) with the background object (0) essentially removed.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

1. Similar to previous examples, objects are identified (color 2, 3, and 1).
2. The new canvas is created.
3. Objects are stacked vertically in color order (2, then 3, then 1).


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = order(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj))
  canvas_height = sum(height(obj) for obj in objs)
  canvas_width = max(width(obj) for obj in objs)
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), (canvas_height, canvas_width))
  current_height = 0
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (current_height, 0)))
    current_height += height(obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Sort Objects:** Identifies non-background objects, sorts them by color.
2. **Create Canvas:**  Calculates canvas dimensions, initializes with background color.
3. **Stack Objects:** Iterates through sorted objects, painting each with a vertical offset determined by the total height of previously placed objects.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcommon(I), (sum(height(o) for o in order(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj))), 
                            max(width(o) for o in order(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj))))),
      merge([shift(obj, (sum([height(o) for o in order(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj))[:i]]), 0))
              for i, obj in enumerate(order(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj)))]))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **One-liner Approach:**  Combines canvas creation and object painting into a single expression for conciseness.
2. **Calculate Offsets:**  Calculates vertical offsets for each object based on the cumulative height of preceding objects.
3. **Merge and Paint:** Merges all shifted objects and paints them onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)),
      merge(apply(
          lambda obj: shift(obj, (sum(height(o) for o in objects(I, False, False, True) if color(o) < color(obj)), 0)),
          objects(I, False, False, True)
      ))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Functional Approach:** Leverages `apply` for a more functional programming style.
2. **Dynamic Offset Calculation:** Calculates each object's vertical offset by summing the heights of all objects with smaller color values.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  sorted_objs = sorted(objs, key=lambda obj: color(obj))
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), (sum([height(o) for o in sorted_objs]), max([width(o) for o in sorted_objs])))
  offset = 0
  for obj in sorted_objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (offset, 0)))
    offset += height(obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Explicit Sorting:** Separates object extraction and sorting for clarity.
2. **Iterative Painting:** Iterates through sorted objects, incrementing the offset after each object is painted.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  canvas_h = sum([height(o) for o in objs])
  canvas_w = max([width(o) for o in objs])
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), (canvas_h, canvas_w))
  y = 0
  for c in sorted(palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}): 
    for obj in sorted(colorfilter(objs, c), key=size):
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (y, 0)))
      y += height(obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Color-based Iteration:**  Iterates through colors in ascending order.
2. **Size-based Ordering:** For each color, sorts objects by size before painting.
3. **Progressive Stacking:** Places objects of the same color one after another, then moves on to the next color.

These five programs demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic. Each version offers a unique perspective on solving the problem while maintaining code clarity and efficiency.
