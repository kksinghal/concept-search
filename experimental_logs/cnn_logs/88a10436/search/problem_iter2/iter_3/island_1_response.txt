## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation takes each object in the grid and moves it down and right until it hits either the bottom or right edge of the grid or another object. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the previous transformation, objects move down and right until hitting an edge or another object. However, in this case, the objects seem to wrap around the grid - reappearing at the top when hitting the bottom edge.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** This transformation again follows the same down-right movement pattern with edge and object collisions. Here, it appears there's no wrapping around the grid, as seen in the previous example.

## Code Generation:

Due to the limitations of the provided DSL, achieving the exact wrapping behavior of Input_1 to Output_1 is challenging. However, we can still achieve the down-right movement with collision detection. Below are five program versions with varying approaches:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  new_objs = frozenset()
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  for obj in objs:
    i, j = ulcorner(toindices(obj))
    while i < h and j < w:
      next_i, next_j = i+1, j+1
      if next_i < h and next_j < w and len(toobject(frozenset({(next_i, next_j)}), I)) == 0:
        i, j = next_i, next_j
      else:
        break
    new_objs = new_objs | frozenset({shift(obj, (i - uppermost(obj), j - leftmost(obj)))})
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w)), new_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects in the grid (`objs`).
2. **Iterate & Move:** Iterate through each object and calculate its new position by moving it down and right until a collision occurs.
3. **Shift & Paint:** Shift the object to its new position and paint it on a blank canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  O = I
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        obj = toobject(frozenset({(i,j)}), I)
        ii, jj = i, j
        while ii < h-1 and jj < w-1 and I[ii+1][jj+1] == mostcolor(I):
          ii += 1
          jj += 1
        O = move(O, obj, (ii-i, jj-j))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Cells:** Iterate through each cell of the grid.
2. **Move Objects:** If a cell belongs to an object, move the object down-right until it encounters another object or the grid edge.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    shifted_obj = obj
    for _ in range(max(height(I), width(I))):
      next_obj = shift(shifted_obj, (1, 1))
      if all(0 <= i < height(I) and 0 <= j < width(I) and index(I, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I) for v, (i, j) in next_obj):
        shifted_obj = next_obj
      else:
        break
    O = paint(O, shifted_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iteratively Shift:** Shift each object diagonally until it collides with an existing object or reaches the edge of the grid.
2. **Paint:** Paint the shifted object onto the output grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    new_objs = set()
    for obj in objs:
        new_obj = set()
        for v, (i, j) in obj:
            new_i = min(i + j, height(I) - 1)
            new_j = min(j + i, width(I) - 1)
            new_obj.add((v, (new_i, new_j)))
        new_objs.add(frozenset(new_obj))
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), frozenset(new_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate New Position:** Calculate the target position of each cell in an object based on its initial position and potential down-right movement.
2. **Construct & Paint:** Construct the new object with shifted cells and paint it onto the output grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  O = I
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    O = cover(O, obj)
    down_shift = min(height(I) - uppermost(obj) - height(obj), width(I) - leftmost(obj) - width(obj))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (down_shift, down_shift)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Remove & Shift:** Remove each object from the grid, calculate its maximum down-right shift, apply the shift, and repaint the object.

These are just five potential solutions; many other variations are possible using the provided DSL functions. Each version approaches the problem slightly differently, offering varying levels of code complexity and efficiency.
