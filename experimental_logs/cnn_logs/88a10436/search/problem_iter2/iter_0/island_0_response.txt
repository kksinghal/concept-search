## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation involves moving each object in the grid towards the bottom-left corner until it touches both the bottom and left edges. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the previous transformation, objects are moved towards the bottom-left corner. However, in this case, objects stop moving once they touch either the bottom or the left edge.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** This transformation appears to focus on a specific object (composed of digits '3' and '1'). This object is moved upwards until it touches the top edge of another object (composed of digit '2'). 

## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  moved_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    while any(i == 0 or j == 0 for i, j in toindices(obj)) == False:
      obj = shift(obj, (-1,-1))
    moved_objs.add(obj) 
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(moved_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The code identifies non-background objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate and Move:** It iterates through each object. For each object, it repeatedly shifts it one step downwards and leftwards until at least one cell of the object touches either the top or left edge of the grid.
3. **Paint:** Finally, the shifted objects are painted back onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid, filled with the background color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  moved_objs = frozenset({shift(obj, (lowermost(obj) - len(I) + 1, leftmost(obj)) ) for obj in objs})
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(moved_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1, it identifies non-background objects.
2. **Calculate Shift:**  For each object, the code calculates the vertical and horizontal shift needed to move the object to its desired position.  The vertical shift is calculated as the difference between the object's lowermost row and the bottom row of the grid. The horizontal shift is simply the column index of the object's leftmost cell.
3. **Shift and Paint:** The objects are then shifted and painted onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  def move_obj(obj):
    while any(i == 0 or j == 0 for i, j in toindices(obj)) == False:
      obj = shift(obj, (-1,-1))
    return obj
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(move_obj, objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as the previous versions.
2. **Define `move_obj` Function:** This function encapsulates the logic of moving an object towards the bottom-left corner until it touches an edge.
3. **Apply and Paint:**  The `move_obj` function is applied to each object, and the resulting objects are painted onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge({shift(obj, (max(0, lowermost(obj) - len(I) + 1), max(0, leftmost(obj)))) for obj in objects(I, False, False, True)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **One-liner:** This version combines multiple steps into a single line of code.
2. **Calculate Shift (Bounded):** It calculates the shift for each object but ensures the shift values are non-negative using `max(0, ...)`. This prevents objects from moving out of the grid boundaries.
3. **Shift, Merge, and Paint:**  The shifted objects are merged and then painted onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge({shift(obj, (lowermost(obj) - len(I) + 1 if leftmost(obj) == 0 else 0, leftmost(obj) if lowermost(obj) == len(I) - 1 else 0)) for obj in objects(I, False, False, True)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Conditional Shift:** This version introduces a conditional shift. It calculates the shift based on whether the object is already touching either the left or the bottom edge. If an object is touching the left edge, it only calculates the vertical shift and vice-versa.
2. **Shift, Merge, and Paint:** Similar to other versions, it then shifts, merges, and paints the objects onto a canvas. 

These five versions offer diverse approaches to achieve the described transformation, leveraging different combinations and applications of DSL functions.
