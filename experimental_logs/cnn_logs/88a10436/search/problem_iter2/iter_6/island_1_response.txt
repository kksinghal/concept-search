## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied in all input-output pairs appears to be:

1. **Object Isolation:** Identify distinct objects (connected components) within the input grid. Objects are formed by adjacent cells with the same value, excluding diagonal connections. 
2. **Color-Based Shift:** Shift each object diagonally downwards and to the right by a number of cells equal to the object's color value.

**Example:** In Input_0, the object consisting of '1's is shifted 1 cell diagonally, the object with '2's is shifted 2 cells diagonally, and the object with '3's is shifted 3 cells diagonally. 

## Program Versions:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return paint(
    canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
    merge(
      {frozenset(
        {(v, (i + v, j + v)) for (v, (i, j)) in obj}
      ) for obj in objs}
    )
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts all objects (connected components) from the input grid `I`, considering only directly adjacent cells and excluding the background color.
2. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid, filled with the background color.
3. **`{(v, (i + v, j + v)) for (v, (i, j)) in obj}`:** For each cell `(v, (i, j))` in each object `obj`, it shifts the cell diagonally by `v` (the object's color) positions. 
4. **`frozenset(...) for obj in objs`:** Applies the shift operation to all cells in all objects.
5. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the shifted objects into a single set of cells.
6. **`paint(..., ...)`:**  Paints the shifted cells onto the blank canvas, resulting in the output grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(
        canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
        merge(
            apply(
                lambda obj: shift(obj, (color(obj), color(obj))), 
                objects(I, T, F, T)
            )
        )
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid.
2. **`lambda obj: shift(obj, (color(obj), color(obj)))`:** Defines a lambda function that takes an object as input and shifts it diagonally by its color value.
3. **`apply(..., objects(I, T, F, T))`:**  Applies the lambda function (shifting) to each object in the input grid.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the shifted objects.
5. **`paint(..., ...)`:** Paints the merged objects onto a blank canvas. 

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(
        canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
        frozenset(
            (v, add((i, j), (c, c)))
            for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)
            for c in repeat(color(obj), len(obj))
            for (v, (i, j)) in obj
        )
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Extracts objects from the input grid.
2. **`repeat(color(obj), len(obj))`:** Creates a sequence of the object's color, repeated as many times as there are cells in the object.
3. **`(v, add((i, j), (c, c))) ...`:** Shifts each cell `(i, j)` by adding its color `c` to both the row and column indices.
4. **`frozenset(...)`:** Creates a new object with the shifted cells.
5. **`paint(..., ...)`:** Paints the shifted objects onto a blank canvas. 

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(
        canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
        merge(
            {shift(obj, (v, v)) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) for (v, _) in obj}
        )
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Extracts objects from the input grid.
2.  **`{(v, _) in obj}`:** Extracts the color `v` from the first cell of each object.
3.  **`shift(obj, (v, v))`:** Shifts each object diagonally by its color `v`.
4.  **`{... for obj in objects(...) ...}`:**  Applies the shift to all objects.
5.  **`merge(...)`:** Merges the shifted objects.
6.  **`paint(..., ...)`:** Paints the merged objects onto a blank canvas.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  shifted_objs = {
      frozenset(
          (v, (i + color(obj), j + color(obj))) for (v, (i, j)) in obj
      )
      for obj in objs
  }
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(shifted_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Extracts objects from the input grid.
2. **`shifted_objs = {...}`**: Creates a new set `shifted_objs` to store the shifted objects.
3. **`(i + color(obj), j + color(obj))`**: For each cell in each object, it shifts the cell diagonally by the object's color.
4. **`frozenset(...) for obj in objs`:** Applies the shift operation to all objects and store them in `shifted_objs`.
5. **`merge(shifted_objs)`**: Merges the shifted objects into a single set.
6. **`paint(...)`**: Paints the merged objects onto a blank canvas to generate the output grid. 

These versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation using various DSL functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility of the language.
