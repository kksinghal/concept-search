## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to align all non-background objects to the bottom-center of the grid, preserving their original order from top to bottom.

**Input_0:**
- Objects are identified and moved to the bottom-center.
- The order of objects from top to bottom is maintained.

**Input_1:**
- Same as Input_0.

**Input_2:**
- Same as Input_0.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  # Identify non-background objects and their original row positions
  objs_with_rows = [(i, obj) for i, obj in enumerate(objects(I, False, False, True))]

  def place_object(data):
    # Unpack data
    i, obj = data
    # Calculate the vertical offset for bottom alignment
    offset_i = len(I) - (len(objs_with_rows) - i) * height(obj)
    # Calculate the horizontal offset for centering
    offset_j = width(I) // 2 - centerofmass(obj)[1]
    # Return the shifted object
    return shift(obj, (offset_i, offset_j))

  # Place each object based on its original position and centering
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(place_object, objs_with_rows)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects and rows:** We store each object along with its original row index in `objs_with_rows`.
2. **Calculate offsets:** In `place_object`, we calculate the vertical offset based on the object's original row and the total number of objects to ensure bottom alignment. Horizontal offset is calculated for centering.
3. **Paint objects:** We paint the shifted objects onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  # Get non-background objects
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)

  # Calculate the horizontal center of the grid
  grid_center_j = width(I) // 2

  def place_object(obj, i, total_objects):
    # Calculate the vertical offset for stacking
    offset_i = len(I) - (total_objects - i) * height(obj)
    # Calculate the horizontal offset for centering
    offset_j = grid_center_j - centerofmass(obj)[1]
    # Return the shifted object
    return shift(obj, (offset_i, offset_j))

  # Place each object on the canvas based on its order of appearance
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda obj, i: place_object(obj, i, len(objs)), enumerate(objs))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects and calculate center:** Similar to Version 1, we extract objects and calculate the grid's horizontal center.
2. **Iterate and place:** We iterate over the objects, calculate offsets based on the current index (`i`) and the total number of objects (`len(objs)`) to ensure correct stacking and centering.
3. **Paint onto canvas:** Shifted objects are painted onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  canvas_height = len(I)
  grid_center = width(I) // 2
  
  def stack_objects(obj, i):
    offset_i = canvas_height - (len(objs) - i) * height(obj)
    offset_j = grid_center - centerofmass(obj)[1]
    return shift(obj, (offset_i, offset_j))

  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda obj, i: stack_objects(obj, i), enumerate(objs))))
```

**Explanation:**

- **Simplified version of Version 2**: This version combines some steps for conciseness while maintaining the same logic.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  def process_row(row, y, total_objs):
    non_bg = [(x, v) for x, v in enumerate(row) if v != mostcolor(I)]
    if non_bg:
      return shift(frozenset({(v, (len(I) - total_objs * len(non_bg) + y * len(non_bg), x)) for x, v in non_bg}), ((len(I[0]) - len(non_bg)) // 2, 0))
    return frozenset()

  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda row, y: process_row(row, y, len(objs)), enumerate(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

- **Row-wise processing:** This version iterates through each row, identifies non-background cells, and calculates their new positions in the bottom-center aligned output.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  def reposition_object(obj, obj_index, total_objects):
    bottom_y = len(I) - obj_index * height(obj) - 1
    center_x = width(I) // 2
    obj_center_x = centerofmass(obj)[1]
    shift_x = center_x - obj_center_x
    return shift(obj, (bottom_y - lowermost(obj), shift_x))

  objects_sorted = sorted(objects(I, False, False, True), key=lambda obj: uppermost(obj))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda obj, i: reposition_object(obj, i, len(objects_sorted)), enumerate(objects_sorted))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sort objects:** Objects are sorted based on their uppermost row, ensuring original order is maintained.
2. **Calculate new position:** For each object, its new bottom-left corner position is calculated based on its index, height, and the grid's dimensions.
3. **Shift and paint:** Objects are shifted to their new positions and painted onto a blank canvas.


These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation using different combinations of DSL functions. Each version aims to be readable and efficient while adhering to the constraints of the provided DSL.
