## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves outlining and recoloring objects based on their original color and position. 

**General Logic:**

1. **Outline and Box:** Each object (defined as a connected group of the same digit, excluding the background color) is outlined with the digit '6' and boxed with the digit '4'.
2. **Recolor and Shift:**
   - Objects with the original color '3' are recolored to '1' and shifted diagonally down-right by one cell.
   - Objects with the original color '2' are recolored to '1' and shifted down by one cell. They are also duplicated and shifted one cell up and down from their new position.

**Specific Examples:**

- **Input_0:** The '8' object is outlined and boxed. The '3' object is recolored to '1' and shifted down-right. The '2' object is recolored to '1', shifted down, and duplicated above and below its new position.
- **Input_1:** The '3' object is outlined, boxed, recolored to '1', and shifted down-right.
- **Input_2:**  The '3' object is outlined, boxed, recolored to '1', and shifted down-right. The '2' object is recolored to '1', shifted down, and duplicated above and below.
- **Input_3:** The '8' object is outlined and boxed.


## Program_to_be_generated:

### Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create empty canvas
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):  # Iterate over objects
        O = paint(fill(O, 6, box(shift(obj, (-1, -1)))), O)  # Outline
        O = paint(fill(O, 4, box(obj)), O)  # Box
        if color(obj) == 3:
            obj = recolor(1, shift(obj, (1, 1)))  # Recolor and shift '3'
        elif color(obj) == 2:
            obj = recolor(1, shift(obj, (1, 0)))  # Recolor and shift '2' down
            O = paint(O, shift(obj, (1, 0)))  # Duplicate and shift down
            O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-1, 0)))  # Duplicate and shift up
        O = paint(O, obj)  # Paint object
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each object, outlines and boxes it, then applies the color-specific transformations. The '2' object duplication is achieved by painting shifted copies instead of merging them into a single object.

### Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for v in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
        obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, v), I)
        O = paint(fill(O, 6, box(shift(obj, (-1, -1)))), O)
        O = paint(fill(O, 4, box(obj)), O)
        if v == 3:
            obj = recolor(1, shift(obj, (1, 1)))
        elif v == 2:
            obj = recolor(1, shift(obj, (1, 0)))
            O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(obj, (1, 0))))
            O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(obj, (-1, 0))))
        O = paint(O, obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

Similar to Version 1, but iterates through colors and uses `toobject` and `ofcolor` to obtain the object instead of using `objects`. This version directly paints the shifted and recolored copies for the '2' object.

### Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I.copy()
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
        O = paint(fill(O, 6, box(shift(obj, (-1, -1)))), O)
        O = paint(fill(O, 4, box(obj)), O)
        if color(obj) == 3:
            O = paint(cover(O, obj), recolor(1, shift(obj, (1, 1))))
        elif color(obj) == 2:
            temp = recolor(1, shift(obj, (1, 0)))
            for d in (UP, DOWN):
                O = paint(O, shift(temp, d))
            O = paint(O, temp)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly modifies a copy of the input grid. It covers the original object before painting the transformed versions to avoid overwriting the outline and box.

### Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    O = paint(fill(O, 6,  box(shift(obj, (-1,-1)))),  O)
    O = paint(fill(O, 4,  box(obj)),  O)
    if color(obj) == 3:
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(obj,  (1, 1))))
    elif color(obj) == 2:
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(obj, (2, 0))))
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(obj, (1, 0))))
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(obj, (0, 0))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version explicitly paints the '2' object and its duplicates at their final positions after recoloring and shifting.

### Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
      shifted_obj = shift(obj, (-1, -1))
      O = paint(fill(O, 6,  box(shifted_obj)),  O)
      O = paint(fill(O, 4,  box(obj)),  O)
      if color(obj) == 3:
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(obj, (1, 1))))
      elif color(obj) == 2:
        obj = recolor(1, shift(obj, (2, 1)))
        O = paint(O, obj)
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-1, 0)))
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-2, 0)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version pre-calculates the shifted position for outlining and uses it directly. It also recolors and shifts the '2' object before painting its duplicates.

These are just a few examples. The DSL offers a variety of ways to achieve the same transformation, and you can experiment with different function combinations to find alternative solutions.
