## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific objects in the input grid and then creating new objects in the output grid based on the location and properties of the original objects. Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

1. **Object Identification:**  The transformation focuses on the object with color '8' and the object with color '3'. 
2. **Object Manipulation:**
   - The '8' object is copied to the output at the same position.
   - The '3' object is mirrored vertically and shifted one unit down. 
   - New objects are created:
      - A 3x1 object with color '4' is placed one unit above the '8' object.
      - A 1x3 object with color '1' is placed two units to the right of the '8' object.
      - A single cell with color '2' is placed one unit below and one unit to the right of the rightmost '1' cell.
      - A 3x1 object with color '6' is placed three units to the left of the mirrored '3' object.
3. **Background Fill:** The remaining cells in the output grid are filled with the background color '0'.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

This transformation follows the same logic as Input_0 -> Output_0, but with a smaller input grid.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

This transformation again follows the same logic as Input_0 -> Output_0, but the '8' object is absent in the input. The code should be robust enough to handle such cases.

**Input_3 -> Output_3:**

This is a simplified version of the previous transformations. The focus is on the '8' object, above which a 3x1 object with color '4' is placed.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each with an explanation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  obj3 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)

  obj3_transformed = shift(vmirror(obj3), (1, 0))
  obj4 = recolor(4, shift(toindices(obj8), (-1, 0)))
  obj1 = recolor(1, shift(toindices(obj8), (2, 0)))
  obj2 = recolor(2, shift(toindices(obj1), (0, 1)))
  obj6 = recolor(6, shift(toindices(obj3_transformed), (-1, -3)))

  O = paint(paint(paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), obj8), obj3_transformed), obj4), obj1)
  O = paint(paint(O, obj2), obj6)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** The code first extracts the objects with color '8' (obj8) and '3' (obj3) from the input grid (I) using `extract` and `objects`.
2. **Object Transformation:**
   - `obj3_transformed`:  Mirrors `obj3` vertically and shifts it down by one unit.
   - `obj4`: Creates a new object with color '4' by shifting the indices of `obj8` upwards.
   - `obj1`: Creates a new object with color '1' by shifting the indices of `obj8` to the right.
   - `obj2`: Creates a new single-cell object with color '2' by shifting the indices of `obj1` down and to the right.
   - `obj6`: Creates a new object with color '6' by shifting the indices of `obj3_transformed` to the left and up.
3. **Canvas Painting:** A canvas of the same size as the input grid is created, filled with the background color '0', and the transformed objects are painted onto it in the desired order.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
    obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, 8))
    obj3 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, 3))
    
    obj3_pos = ulcorner(obj3)
    
    O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), obj8)
    O = paint(O, recolor(4, shift(toindices(obj8), (-1, 0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(toindices(obj8), (2, 0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(toindices(obj8), (3, 1))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, (obj3_pos[0] - 1, obj3_pos[1] - 3)))
    O = paint(O, shift(vmirror(obj3), (1, 0)))
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** Similar to Version 1, it extracts objects with colors '8' and '3'.
2. **Position Tracking:** This version stores the upper-left corner position of `obj3` for later use.
3. **Direct Painting:**  Instead of creating intermediate objects, this version directly paints the desired colors onto the canvas at calculated positions relative to `obj8` and the stored position of `obj3`.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
    obj8 = extract(objects(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
    obj3 = extract(objects(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
    canvas_size = shape(I)
    
    O = canvas(0, canvas_size)
    if obj8:
        O = paint(O, obj8)
        O = paint(O, recolor(4, shift(obj8, (-1, 0))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(obj8, (2, 0))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(obj8, (3, 1))))
    if obj3:
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, shift(obj3, (-1, -3))))
        O = paint(O, shift(vmirror(obj3), (1, 0)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Conditional Painting:** This version introduces conditional statements to handle cases where either '8' or '3' objects might be missing from the input. 
2. **Simplified Logic:** It streamlines the code by directly using object positions for shifting and recoloring, instead of extracting and manipulating indices.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  obj3 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
  output = canvas(0, shape(I))
  if obj8:
    output = paint(output, obj8)
    for i, (v, (x, y)) in enumerate(obj8):
      if i == 0:
        output = paint(output, recolor(4, {(x - 1, y)}))
        output = paint(output, recolor(1, {(x + 2, y)}))
        output = paint(output, recolor(2, {(x + 3, y + 1)}))
  if obj3:
    for i, (v, (x, y)) in enumerate(obj3):
      if i == 0:
        output = paint(output, recolor(6, {(x - 1, y - 3)}))
    output = paint(output, shift(vmirror(obj3), (1, 0)))
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterative Approach:** This version iterates through the cells of the extracted objects (`obj8` and `obj3`) to determine the positions for placing the new objects.
2. **First Cell Reference:** It utilizes the coordinates of the first cell of each object as a reference point for positioning the new objects.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  obj8 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  obj3 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  if obj8: 
    O = paint(O, obj8)
    O = paint(O, recolor(4, shift(toindices(obj8), (-1, 0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(ulcorner(obj8)[0], ulcorner(obj8)[1] + 2)}))
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(ulcorner(obj8)[0] + 1, ulcorner(obj8)[1] + 3)}))
  if obj3:
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, {(ulcorner(obj3)[0] - 1, ulcorner(obj3)[1] - 3)}))
    O = paint(O, shift(vmirror(obj3), (1, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Combined Object Extraction:** It efficiently extracts all objects only once and then filters for '8' and '3'.
2. **Direct Coordinate Calculation:**  It directly calculates the coordinates of new objects using `ulcorner` and arithmetic operations, without iterating through cells.
