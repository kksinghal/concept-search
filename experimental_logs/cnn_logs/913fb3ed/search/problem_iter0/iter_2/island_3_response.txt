## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
* Identify the object with color '8'.
* Create a new object with color '4', shifted one unit upwards from the '8' object. 
* Create another object with color '1', shifted two units downwards from the '8' object. 
* Create a third object with color '2', shifted three units downwards and one unit to the right from the '8' object.
* Identify the object with color '3'.
* Create a new object with color '6', shifted one unit upwards and three units to the left from the '3' object. 
* Combine all the newly created objects and the original '8' object on a canvas of the same size as the input, filled with '0'. 

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
* Identify the object with color '3'.
* Create a new object with color '6', shifted one unit upwards and three units to the left from the '3' object. 
* Combine the newly created '6' object and the original '3' object on a canvas of the same size as the input, filled with '0'.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
* Identify the object with color '3'.
* Create a new object with color '6', shifted one unit upwards and three units to the left from the '3' object. 
* Identify the object with color '2'.
* Create a new object with color '1', positioned three units upwards and three units to the right from the '2' object.
* Combine the newly created objects on a canvas of the same size as the input, filled with '0'.

**Input_3 -> Output_3:**
* Identify the object with color '8'.
* Create a new object with color '4', shifted one unit upwards from the '8' object. 
* Combine the newly created '4' object and the original '8' object on a canvas of the same size as the input, filled with '0'.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, 8))
    obj3 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, 3))
    obj2 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, 2))
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    if obj8:
        O = paint(O, obj8)
        O = paint(O, recolor(4, shift(toindices(obj8), (-1, 0))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(toindices(obj8), (2, 0))))
        if obj2:
          O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(toindices(obj2), (3, 3))))
    if obj3:
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, shift(toindices(obj3), (-1, -3))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify and extract the objects with colors '8', '3', and '2' from the input grid `I`.
2. **Create Canvas:** Create an empty canvas `O` of the same size as the input grid, filled with '0'.
3. **Process Object 8:** If object '8' exists:
   - Paint the object '8' onto the canvas.
   - Create a new object with color '4' by shifting the indices of object '8' one unit upwards and recolor it. Then, paint it onto the canvas.
   - Create another new object with color '1' by shifting the indices of object '8' two units downwards and recolor it. Then, paint it onto the canvas.
   - If object '2' exists, create a new object with color '2' by shifting object '2' three units downwards and three units to the right. Then, paint it onto the canvas.
4. **Process Object 3:** If object '3' exists:
   - Create a new object with color '6' by shifting the indices of object '3' one unit upwards and three units to the left and recolor it. Then, paint it onto the canvas.
5. **Return Output:** Return the transformed canvas `O`.

This code directly implements the transformation logic identified for each input-output pair. The use of `if` statements ensures that the code adapts to different input configurations, handling cases where certain objects might not be present. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, 8))
    obj3 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, 3))
    obj2 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, 2))
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    if obj8:
        O = paint(paint(O, obj8), recolor(4, shift(toindices(obj8), (-1, 0))))
        O = paint(paint(O, recolor(1, shift(toindices(obj8), (2, 0)))), recolor(2, shift(toindices(obj8), (3, 1))))
    if obj3:
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, shift(toindices(obj3), (-1, -3))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 1 but consolidates the painting operations within the `if obj8` block for conciseness.  It directly paints the new objects ('4', '1', and conditionally '2') onto the canvas after recoloring and shifting, without creating intermediate variables.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    obj8 = next((obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) == 8), None)
    obj3 = next((obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) == 3), None)
    obj2 = next((obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) == 2), None)
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    if obj8:
        O = paint(O, obj8)
        O = paint(O, recolor(4, shift(toindices(obj8), (-1, 0))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(toindices(obj8), (2, 0))))
        if obj2:
          O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(toindices(obj2), (3, 3))))
    if obj3:
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, shift(toindices(obj3), (-1, -3))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version replaces the `extract` function with a generator expression combined with the `next` function to find the desired objects. This offers a slightly different approach to object extraction while maintaining the overall logic of Version 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  obj3 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
  obj2 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), obj8)
  if obj8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(4, shift(toindices(obj8), (-1, 0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(toindices(obj8), (2, 0))))
    if obj2:
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(toindices(obj2), (3, 3))))
  if obj3:
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, shift(toindices(obj3), (-1, -3))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is very similar to Version 1 but optimizes the painting of the initial '8' object by combining it with the canvas creation.  Instead of first creating a blank canvas and then painting, it directly paints the '8' object onto the canvas while creating it. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    obj8 = next((obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == 8), None)
    obj3 = next((obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == 3), None)
    obj2 = next((obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == 2), None)
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    if obj8:
        O = paint(paint(O, obj8), recolor(4, shift(obj8, (-1, 0))))
        O = paint(paint(O, recolor(1, shift(obj8, (2, 0)))), recolor(2, shift(toindices(obj2), (3, 3)))) if obj2 else paint(O, recolor(1, shift(obj8, (2, 0))))
    if obj3:
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, shift(obj3, (-1, -3))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version combines elements from previous versions, using a generator expression for object extraction and consolidating painting operations where possible.  It also utilizes a conditional expression (ternary operator) to handle the painting of the '2' object based on whether 'obj2' is found, streamlining the code further.

These five versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL. They showcase variations in object extraction, painting strategies, and code structure, highlighting the flexibility of the DSL and the potential for diverse solutions.
