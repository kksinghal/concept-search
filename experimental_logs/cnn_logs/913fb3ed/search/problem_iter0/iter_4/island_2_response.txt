## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently applies the following logic:

1. **Identify Objects:**  The transformation identifies all non-background objects within the input grid. 
2. **Draw Outlines:** For each object, it draws an outline using the value '4'.
3. **Highlight Corners:** The corners of the outlines are highlighted using the value '6'.
4. **Maintain Objects:** The original objects from the input grid are preserved within their respective outlines.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create a canvas with the background color
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Get all non-background objects
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, recolor(4, outbox(obj)))  # Draw outline with '4'
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, corners(outbox(obj))))  # Highlight corners with '6'
  return paint(O, asobject(I))  # Paint the original objects

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Creates a canvas filled with the background color and having the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each identified non-background object.
3. **Outline Drawing:** For each object, it paints its 'outbox' onto the canvas using the value '4'.
4. **Corner Highlighting:**  It then paints the corners of the 'outbox' onto the canvas using the value '6'.
5. **Object Preservation:** Finally, it paints the original objects from the input grid onto the canvas, ensuring their preservation.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I  # Start with the input grid
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = fill(O, 4, outbox(obj))  # Fill outer box with '4'
    O = fill(O, 6, corners(outbox(obj)))  # Fill corners with '6'
    O = paint(O, obj)  # Paint the object on top
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Modification:** Starts by directly modifying the input grid.
2. **Outline and Corner Filling:** Iterates through each non-background object, filling its 'outbox' with '4' and its corners with '6'.
3. **Object Overwrite:** Overwrites the filled outline and corners with the original object to preserve its shape and color.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create background canvas
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  outlines = mapply(outbox, objs)  # Calculate outlines for all objects
  corners_ = mapply(lambda x: corners(x), outlines)  # Calculate corners for outlines
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, merge(outlines)))  # Paint all outlines
  O = paint(O, recolor(6, merge(corners_)))  # Paint all corners
  return paint(O, asobject(I))  # Paint original objects
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Background Canvas:** Creates a canvas with the background color and input grid dimensions.
2. **Outline and Corner Calculation:** Uses `mapply` to efficiently calculate the outlines and corners for all objects simultaneously.
3. **Outline and Corner Painting:** Merges the outlines and corners and paints them onto the canvas.
4. **Object Restoration:** Overwrites the painted outlines and corners with the original objects from the input grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I 
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = underfill(O, 4, outbox(obj))  # Underfill outline with '4'
    O = underfill(O, 6, corners(outbox(obj)))  # Underfill corners with '6'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Input Modification:**  Starts with the input grid.
2. **Selective Filling:** Uses `underfill` to selectively fill the 'outbox' and corners of each object only where the background color exists.
3. **Implicit Object Preservation:**  The original objects are implicitly preserved as `underfill` only modifies the background.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create background canvas
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    outline = outbox(obj)
    O = paint(O, recolor(4, outline - corners(outline)))  # Paint outline excluding corners
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, corners(outline)))  # Paint corners
  return paint(O, asobject(I))  # Paint original objects
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Background Canvas:** Creates a canvas with the background color and input grid dimensions.
2. **Separate Outline and Corners:**  Calculates the outline and corners for each object.
3. **Outline Exclusion:** Paints the outline onto the canvas excluding the corner indices.
4. **Corner Highlighting:**  Paints the corners onto the canvas.
5. **Object Restoration:** Overwrites the painted outlines and corners with the original objects.
