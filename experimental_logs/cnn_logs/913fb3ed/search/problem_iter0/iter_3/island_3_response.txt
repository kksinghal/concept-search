## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific objects in the input grid and then reconstructing them in new positions with modified colors. Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**
- The object with color '8' is moved one cell up and its color is replaced by '4'. 
- A new object with color '1' is created two cells to the right of the original '8' object.
- The object with color '3' is preserved but a new object with color '6' is created surrounding it from the top and sides.
- The object with color '2' is moved 3 cells down and 3 cells to the right.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**
- The object with color '3' is preserved but a new object with color '6' is created surrounding it from the top and sides.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**
- The object with color '3' is moved 11 cells up.
- A new object with color '6' is created surrounding it from the top and sides.
- The object with color '2' is preserved but two new objects with color '1' are created, one 2 cells above and one 2 cells below it.

**Input_3 - Output_3:**
- The object with color '8' is moved one cell up and its color is replaced by '4'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, 8))
  obj3 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, 3))
  obj2 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, 2))
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  if obj8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(4, shift(obj8, (-1, 0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(obj8, (2, 0))))
  if obj3:
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, box(shift(obj3, (0, 0)))))
  if obj2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(obj2, (-2, 0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(obj2, (2, 0))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** The program first extracts the objects with colors 8, 3, and 2 (if they exist) from the input grid `I` and stores them in `obj8`, `obj3`, and `obj2` respectively. 
2. **Canvas Creation:** It then creates a blank canvas `O` of the same size as the input grid, filled with zeros.
3. **Object Transformation and Painting:**
   - **Object 8:** If `obj8` exists, it recolors it to '4' and shifts it one cell up. It then paints this transformed object onto the canvas. Next, it creates a new object with color '1' two cells to the right of the original '8' object and paints it onto the canvas.
   - **Object 3:** If `obj3` exists, it creates a new object with color '6' surrounding it by applying the `box` function and paints it onto the canvas.
   - **Object 2:** If `obj2` exists, it creates two new objects with color '1', one 2 cells above and one 2 cells below the original object, and paints them onto the canvas.
4. **Output:** Finally, the program returns the transformed canvas `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, 8))
  obj3 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, 3))
  obj2 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, 2))
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  if obj8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(4, shift(obj8, (-1, 0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(toindices(obj8), (2, 0))))
  if obj3:
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, shift(box(obj3), (0, 0))))
  if obj2:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(toindices(obj2), (-2, 0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(toindices(obj2), (2, 0))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

This version is very similar to Version 1, with the only difference being the use of  `toindices` function within the `shift` function calls for creating surrounding objects and shifted objects.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  obj3 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
  obj2 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  if obj8:
    O = paint(O, recolor(4, shift(obj8, (-1, 0))))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(obj8, (2, 0))))
    if obj2:
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(obj2, (3, 3))))
  if obj3:
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, shift(box(obj3), (-1, -3))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

This version is similar to version 1, except it uses lambda functions for object extraction.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, 8))
    obj3 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, 3))
    obj2 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, 2))
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    if obj8:
        O = paint(O, recolor(4, shift(obj8, (-1, 0))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(obj8, (2, 0))))
        if obj2:
          O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(toindices(obj2), (3, 3))))
    if obj3:
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, shift(box(toindices(obj3)), (-1, -3))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:** 

This version is similar to Version 3, with the only difference being the use of the `toindices` function on the object passed to the `box` function for creating surrounding objects. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    obj8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, 8))
    obj3 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, 3))
    obj2 = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), matcher(color, 2))
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    if obj8:
        O = paint(O, recolor(4, shift(toindices(obj8), (-1, 0))))
        O = paint(O, recolor(1, shift(toindices(obj8), (2, 0))))
        if obj2:
          O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(toindices(obj2), (3, 3))))
    if obj3:
        O = paint(O, recolor(6, shift(toindices(box(obj3)), (-1, -3))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:** 

This version is similar to Version 4, with the only difference being that instead of calling the `toindices` function on the object passed to the `box` function, the `toindices` function is being called on the output of the `box` function.
