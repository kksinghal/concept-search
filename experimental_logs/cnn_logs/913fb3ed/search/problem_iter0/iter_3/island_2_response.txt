## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves the following steps:

1. **Identify Non-Background Objects:** The program should first identify all the objects in the input grid that are not the background color (most frequent color). 
2. **Draw Outlines:** For each object, draw a rectangular outline using a specific color (e.g., '4'). The outline should be one cell thick and surround the object completely.
3. **Highlight Corners:** Additionally, highlight the four corners of the outline with a different color (e.g., '6').

**Example:**

Input:
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 8 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 3 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 
```

Output:
```
0 0 0 0 0 
0 4 4 4 0
0 4 8 4 0
0 4 4 4 0
0 0 0 0 0 
```

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") in the provided DSL, each with an explanation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create a canvas with the background color
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T): # Iterate over non-background objects
    O = paint(O, recolor(4, outbox(obj))) # Draw the outline
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, corners(outbox(obj)))) # Highlight the corners
    O = paint(O, obj)  # Paint the original object back on top
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  A canvas filled with the background color of the input grid is created.
2.  The code iterates over all non-background objects in the input grid.
3.  For each object:
    *   The outer box is drawn with color '4'.
    *   The corners of the outer box are highlighted with color '6'.
    *   The original object is painted back on top to ensure it's visible.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I # Start with the original grid
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):  # Iterate over non-background objects
    O = fill(O, 4, outbox(obj))  # Draw the outline
    O = fill(O, 6, corners(obj)) # Highlight the corners
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  The original grid is used as the starting point.
2.  The code iterates over all non-background objects.
3.  For each object:
    *   The outer box is filled with color '4'.
    *   The corners of the object are filled with color '6'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create a canvas with the background color
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):  # Iterate over non-background objects
    box_indices = outbox(obj) # Calculate the outline indices
    corner_indices = corners(box_indices) # Calculate the corner indices
    O = paint(O, recolor(4, box_indices)) # Draw the outline
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, corner_indices)) # Highlight the corners
    O = paint(O, obj) # Paint the original object back on top
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  A canvas filled with the background color is created.
2.  The code iterates over all non-background objects.
3.  For each object:
    *   The outline and corner indices are pre-calculated for efficiency.
    *   The outline is drawn with color '4'.
    *   The corners are highlighted with color '6'.
    *   The original object is painted back on top.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I  # Start with the original grid
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T): # Iterate over non-background objects
        for i, j in outbox(obj):  # Iterate over outline indices
            O = fill(O, 4, {(i, j)})  # Draw the outline
        for i, j in corners(obj):  # Iterate over corner indices
            O = fill(O, 6, {(i, j)}) # Highlight the corners
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  The original grid is used as the starting point.
2.  The code iterates over all non-background objects.
3.  For each object:
    *   It iterates through the indices of the outline and fills each cell with color '4'.
    *   It iterates through the corner indices and fills each cell with color '6'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create a canvas with the background color
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Get all non-background objects
  outlines = mapply(outbox, objs) # Calculate outlines for all objects
  corners_ = mapply(corners, outlines) # Calculate corners for all outlines
  O = paint(O, recolor(4, merge(outlines))) # Draw all outlines
  O = paint(O, recolor(6, merge(corners_))) # Highlight all corners
  O = paint(O, asobject(I))  # Paint all objects from the input grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  A canvas filled with the background color is created.
2.  All non-background objects, their outlines, and the corners of those outlines are pre-calculated.
3.  All outlines are drawn with color '4'.
4.  All corners are highlighted with color '6'.
5.  All objects from the input grid are painted back onto the canvas.

This version emphasizes efficiency by pre-calculating all necessary information before making changes to the grid.
