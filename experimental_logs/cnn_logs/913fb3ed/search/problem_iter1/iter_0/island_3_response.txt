## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves two main operations:

1. **Outbox Filling:** For digits `3` and `8`, the transformation fills the "outbox" area with specific colors. The outbox is a one-cell thick border surrounding the object. The filling color depends on the original digit: `3` gets surrounded by `6` and `8` by `4`. 

2. **Shifting and Extending:** The digit `2` undergoes a shifting and extending operation. It gets shifted one cell downwards, leaving the original position empty. Both the original and the shifted positions are then extended with a one-cell thick border of color `1`.

**Example Breakdown:**

- **Input 0:** The `3` and `8` get their respective outboxes filled. The `2` is shifted down and both the original and shifted positions get a `1` border.
- **Input 1, 2, 3:**  The same logic applies to these inputs, demonstrating the transformation's consistency across different object positions and sizes.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == EIGHT:
      O = underfill(O, FOUR, outbox(obj))
    elif color(obj) == THREE:
      O = underfill(O, SIX, outbox(obj))
    elif color(obj) == TWO:
      O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, box(obj)))
      O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, shift(obj, DOWN)))
      O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, box(shift(obj, DOWN))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Iterates through each non-background object in the input grid `I`.
- For objects of color `8`, it fills their outbox with color `4` in the output grid `O`.
- For objects of color `3`, it fills their outbox with color `6`.
- For objects of color `2`, it draws a border of `1` around the original object, shifts the object down, and then draws a border of `1` around the shifted object.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for v in palette(I) - {ZERO}:
    if v == EIGHT:
      O = underfill(O, FOUR, outbox(toobject(ofcolor(I, EIGHT), I)))
    elif v == THREE:
      O = underfill(O, SIX, outbox(toobject(ofcolor(I, THREE), I)))
    elif v == TWO:
      obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, TWO), I)
      O = underfill(O, ONE, box(obj) | box(shift(obj, DOWN)))
      O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, shift(obj, DOWN)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Iterates through each color in the input grid's palette (excluding the background color `0`).
- For colors `8` and `3`, it finds their corresponding objects and fills their outboxes with colors `4` and `6` respectively.
- For color `2`, it finds the object, draws the `1` border around both the original and shifted positions in a single step, and then paints the shifted object with color `2`.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = fill(I, mostcolor(I), asindices(I)) 
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == EIGHT:
      O = paint(O, recolor(FOUR, outbox(obj)))
      O = paint(O, obj)
    elif color(obj) == THREE:
      O = paint(O, recolor(SIX, outbox(obj)))
      O = paint(O, obj)
    elif color(obj) == TWO:
      O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, box(obj) | box(shift(obj, DOWN))))
      O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, shift(obj, DOWN)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Starts by creating a blank canvas `O` filled with the background color.
- Iterates through each non-background object in the input grid.
- For objects of colors `8` and `3`, it first paints their outboxes with `4` and `6` respectively, and then paints the original object on top.
- For objects of color `2`, it draws the combined `1` border for both positions and then paints the shifted object.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) in (THREE, EIGHT):
      O = underfill(O, {THREE: SIX, EIGHT: FOUR}[color(obj)], outbox(obj))
    elif color(obj) == TWO:
      shifted_obj = shift(obj, DOWN)
      O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, box(obj) | box(shifted_obj)))
      O = paint(cover(O, shifted_obj), shifted_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Iterates through each non-background object in the input grid.
- For objects with color `3` or `8`, it fills their outbox with the corresponding color using a dictionary lookup.
- For objects with color `2`:
  - It calculates the shifted object's position.
  - Draws the combined `1` border for both positions.
  - Clears the area of the shifted object and then paints the shifted object.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for v in palette(I) - {ZERO}:
    obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, v), I)
    if v == EIGHT:
      O = underfill(O, FOUR, outbox(obj))
    elif v == THREE:
      O = underfill(O, SIX, outbox(obj))
    elif v == TWO:
      O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, backdrop(obj) | backdrop(shift(obj, DOWN))))
      O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, shift(obj, DOWN)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Iterates through each color (except background) in the input grid.
- For each color, it finds the corresponding object.
- Applies outbox filling for colors `8` and `3`.
- For color `2`, it calculates the backdrop for both the original and shifted positions and fills them with `1`.  Then paints the shifted object with `2`.

These are just a few examples; many other valid and distinct programs can achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL.
