## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying the '2' objects and then filling the cells surrounding those objects with '1's. However, the surrounding cells should only be filled if they are initially '0'.

**Input 0:**
- The '2' object is surrounded by '0's.
- All surrounding '0's are replaced with '1's.

**Input 1:**
- The '2' objects have some '0's surrounding them.
- Only the surrounding '0's are replaced with '1's.

**Input 2:**
- Similar to Input 1, only the '0' cells directly surrounding the '2' objects are changed to '1's.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  twos = ofcolor(I, 2)  # Get indices of all '2' cells
  shifted = frozenset.union(*({(i + di, j + dj) for di, dj in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]} for i, j in twos))
  valid = sfilter(shifted, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 0)
  O = fill(I, 1, valid) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '2' cells:** `twos = ofcolor(I, 2)` finds all indices of cells containing the value '2'.
2. **Get surrounding cells:** For each '2' cell, generate the indices of its four surrounding neighbors and merge them into a single set (`shifted`).
3. **Filter valid cells:**  `valid = sfilter(...)` keeps only those surrounding cells that are within the grid boundaries and contain the value '0'.
4. **Fill valid cells:** `O = fill(I, 1, valid)` fills the 'valid' cells with the value '1' in the input grid 'I'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = partition(I)
  twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)
  surrounding = mpapply(lambda obj: sfilter(delta(obj), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0), twos)
  O = fill(I, 1, surrounding)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition into objects:**  `objs = partition(I)` divides the grid into objects based on connected cells of the same value.
2. **Filter '2' objects:** `twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)` selects only the objects consisting of '2's.
3. **Find valid surrounding cells:** For each '2' object, `sfilter(delta(obj), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0)` finds the surrounding cells (`delta`) that contain '0' in the original grid (`index(I, loc) == 0`) and merges them using `mpapply`.
4. **Fill valid cells:** `O = fill(I, 1, surrounding)` fills the 'surrounding' cells with '1' in the input grid 'I'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grids = [fill(I, 1, ofcolor(shift(asobject(I), d), 2)) for d in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]]
  O = I
  for grid in shifted_grids:
    O = cellwise(O, grid, 0)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift and fill:**  For each direction, the program shifts the input grid (`shift`), identifies the '2's in the shifted grid (`ofcolor`), and fills those locations with '1' in a copy of the original grid (`fill`). This results in four shifted grids with '1's surrounding the original '2's.
2. **Cellwise merge:** The program iterates through the shifted grids and uses `cellwise` to merge them with the original grid (`O`). The `fallback` value is set to '0', so only cells containing '1' in any of the shifted grids will be changed in the final output.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 0 and any(index(I, (i+di, j+dj)) == 2 for di, dj in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]):
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and check:**  This program iterates through each cell of the input grid.
2. **Check for '0' and neighboring '2':** If a cell contains '0' and has at least one neighboring cell containing '2', it's identified as a valid surrounding cell.
3. **Fill valid cells:** The `fill` function is used to change the value of the valid surrounding cell to '1' in the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 5:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  surrounding = frozenset()
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 2:
        surrounding |= {(i + di, j + dj) for di, dj in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]}
  filtered_surrounding = sfilter(surrounding, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 0)
  O = fill(I, 1, filtered_surrounding)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find potential surrounding cells:**  The program iterates through each cell and if it finds a '2', it adds the indices of its four surrounding cells to the `surrounding` set.
2. **Filter valid cells:** `filtered_surrounding` uses `sfilter` to keep only those surrounding cells within the grid boundaries and containing '0' in the input grid.
3. **Fill valid cells:** `O = fill(I, 1, filtered_surrounding)`  fills the 'filtered_surrounding' cells with '1' in the input grid 'I'.

These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation, demonstrating diverse utilization of the provided DSL functions.
