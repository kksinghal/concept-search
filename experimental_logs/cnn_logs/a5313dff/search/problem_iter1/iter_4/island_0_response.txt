## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation identifies objects within the grid and then fills a specific subset of the object's border cells with the value "1". This subset consists of the inner border cells, which are directly adjacent to other object cells. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

* **Pair 0:** The input has a single object (value '2'). The output fills the inner border cells of this object with '1'.
* **Pair 1:** The input has two objects (value '2').  The output fills the inner border cells of both objects with '1'.
* **Pair 2:**  Similar to previous pairs, the inner border cells of all '2' valued objects are filled with '1'.


## Program to be Generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    inner_border = mfilter(outbox(toindices(obj)), lambda x: len(intersection(neighbors(x), toindices(obj))) > 0)
    O = fill(O, ONE, inner_border)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over objects:**  The code iterates through each object (excluding background) found in the input grid `I` using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Find inner border:** For each object, it calculates the `outbox` (cells surrounding the object) and then uses `mfilter` to select only those cells (`inner_border`) that have at least one neighbor belonging to the object.
3. **Fill border cells:** Finally, it uses `fill` to set the value of the `inner_border` cells to `ONE` in the output grid `O`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = fill(O, ONE,  intersection(delta(toindices(obj)), backdrop(shift(toindices(obj), (1, 1)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over objects:** Similar to version 1, it iterates over each object.
2. **Calculate inner border:** For each object, it calculates the `delta` (border cells) and intersects it with the `backdrop` (all cells within the bounding box) of the object shifted diagonally by one unit. This intersection precisely identifies the inner border cells.
3. **Fill border cells:** It then fills the identified `inner_border` cells with `ONE`.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  inner_borders = set()
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    for cell in toindices(obj):
      for neighbor in dneighbors(cell):
        if neighbor not in toindices(obj) and 0 <= neighbor[0] < len(I) and 0 <= neighbor[1] < len(I[0]):
          inner_borders.add(neighbor)
  return fill(I, ONE, frozenset(inner_borders))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over cells and neighbors:** This version directly iterates over each cell of each object and its direct neighbors using `dneighbors`.
2. **Identify inner border:** It checks if a neighbor is not part of the object and within the grid boundaries. If so, it adds the neighbor to the `inner_borders` set.
3. **Fill border cells:** Finally, it fills all cells in the `inner_borders` set with `ONE`.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        border = mapply(lambda cell: sfilter(dneighbors(cell), lambda n: n not in toindices(obj) and 0 <= n[0] < len(I) and 0 <= n[1] < len(I[0])), toindices(obj))
        O = fill(O, ONE, border)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over objects:** Similar to previous versions, it iterates over each object.
2. **Find inner border using `mapply`:** For each cell in the object, it uses `mapply` to apply a lambda function that finds the direct neighbors not part of the object and within grid boundaries. These neighbors form the `border`.
3. **Fill border cells:**  Finally, it fills the `border` cells with `ONE` in the output grid.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    shifted_objs = (shift(obj, d) for d in ((1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)))
    inner_border =  reduce(lambda a, b: a | intersection(toindices(b), toindices(obj)), shifted_objs, frozenset())
    O = fill(O, ONE, inner_border)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over objects:** Iterates over each object in the grid.
2. **Shift and intersect:** For each object, it creates four shifted versions (up, down, left, right) using `shift`. It then finds the `intersection` of each shifted object with the original object. The union of these intersections represents the `inner_border`.
3. **Fill border cells:** It fills the `inner_border` cells with `ONE`. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same goal, leveraging various DSL functions and logic. Each version effectively identifies and fills the inner border cells of objects in the input grid.
