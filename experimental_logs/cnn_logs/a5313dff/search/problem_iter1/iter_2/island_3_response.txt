## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the outer boundary of each foreground object in the grid and filling its direct, non-diagonal, neighboring cells with the value `1`. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

- The input grid has a single foreground object formed by the digit `2`. 
- The output grid retains the original object but adds a border of `1`s around it. 
- The border only touches cells directly adjacent to the object (up, down, left, right), not diagonally.

**Input_1:**

- Similar to Input_0, the transformation adds a `1` border around each `2` object.
- Notably, the border is added even when objects are close to the grid boundary.

**Input_2:**

- This input showcases multiple objects of different sizes and positions.
- The transformation consistently applies the `1` border to all foreground objects without merging them.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return underfill(I,
                   ONE,
                   mapply(lambda obj: 
                          merge(apply(dneighbors,
                                      toindices(obj))) - toindices(obj),
                          objects(I, T, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Identifies all foreground objects in the grid `I`.
2. **`mapply(..., objects(I, T, F, T))`**: Applies the inner lambda function to each object and merges the results.
3. **`lambda obj: ...`**:  This lambda function processes each object individually.
4. **`toindices(obj)`**: Gets the indices of cells belonging to the object.
5. **`apply(dneighbors, toindices(obj))`**: Finds the direct neighbors of each object cell.
6. **`merge(...) - toindices(obj)`**: Merges all neighbor indices and removes the original object indices, leaving only the bordering cells.
7. **`underfill(I, ONE, ...)`**: Fills the identified bordering cells in the original grid `I` with the value `1`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return underfill(I,
                   ONE,
                   reduce(lambda acc, obj: acc | (delta(toindices(obj)) &
                                                merge(apply(dneighbors,
                                                          toindices(obj)))),
                          objects(I, T, F, T),
                          set()))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Identifies all foreground objects in the grid `I`.
2. **`reduce(..., objects(I, T, F, T), set())`**: Iterates through each object and accumulates the indices to fill in an initially empty set.
3. **`lambda acc, obj: acc | ...`**:  This lambda function processes each object and updates the accumulator set (`acc`).
4. **`delta(toindices(obj))`**: Finds the indices within the object's bounding box but not part of the object.
5. **`merge(apply(dneighbors, toindices(obj)))`**: Finds all direct neighbors of the object.
6. **`... & ...`**: Calculates the intersection between the object's direct neighbors and the cells within its bounding box but not part of it.
7. **`acc | ...`**:  Adds the resulting indices to the accumulator set.
8. **`underfill(I, ONE, ...)`**: Fills the collected indices in the original grid `I` with the value `1`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  border = set()
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    obj_indices = toindices(obj)
    for i, j in obj_indices:
      for di, dj in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:
        neighbor = (i + di, j + dj)
        if neighbor not in obj_indices and neighbor in backdrop(obj_indices):
          border.add(neighbor)
  return underfill(I, ONE, frozenset(border))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`border = set()`**: Initializes an empty set to store border cell indices.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):`**: Iterates through each foreground object.
3. **`obj_indices = toindices(obj)`**:  Gets the indices of the object's cells.
4. **`for i, j in obj_indices:`**:  Iterates through each cell in the object.
5. **`for di, dj in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:`**:  Iterates through direct neighbor directions.
6. **`neighbor = (i + di, j + dj)`**: Calculates the neighbor's index.
7. **`if neighbor not in obj_indices and neighbor in backdrop(obj_indices):`**: Checks if the neighbor is not part of the object and lies within the object's bounding box.
8. **`border.add(neighbor)`**: Adds the valid neighbor index to the `border` set.
9. **`return underfill(I, ONE, frozenset(border))`**: Fills the identified border cells in the original grid `I` with the value `1`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return underfill(I, ONE, 
                  reduce(lambda acc, obj: acc | (outbox(toindices(obj)) &
                                               backdrop(toindices(obj)) - 
                                               toindices(obj)),
                          objects(I, T, F, T),
                          set()))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Identifies all foreground objects.
2. **`reduce(..., objects(...), set())`**:  Applies a lambda function to each object and accumulates results in a set.
3. **`lambda acc, obj: acc | ...`**:  This lambda function processes each object and updates the accumulator set (`acc`).
4. **`outbox(toindices(obj))`**:  Gets the indices of the cells forming the outer boundary of the object.
5. **`backdrop(toindices(obj))`**: Gets the indices within the bounding box of the object.
6. **`... & ... - toindices(obj)`**:  Finds the intersection between the outbox and backdrop, then removes the object's own indices. This results in the direct neighboring cells outside the object.
7. **`acc | ...`**: Adds the resulting indices to the accumulator set.
8. **`underfill(I, ONE, ...)`**: Fills the collected indices in the original grid `I` with the value `1`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if (i > 0 and (i - 1, j) not in toindices(obj)):
        O = fill(O, ONE, {(i - 1, j)})
      if (i < len(I) - 1 and (i + 1, j) not in toindices(obj)):
        O = fill(O, ONE, {(i + 1, j)})
      if (j > 0 and (i, j - 1) not in toindices(obj)):
        O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j - 1)})
      if (j < len(I[0]) - 1 and (i, j + 1) not in toindices(obj)):
        O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`**:  Creates a copy of the input grid.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):`**: Iterates through each foreground object.
3. **`for i, j in toindices(obj):`**: Iterates through each cell in the object.
4. **`if (i > 0 and (i - 1, j) not in toindices(obj)):`**:  Checks for a valid upper neighbor outside the object.
5. **`O = fill(O, ONE, {(i - 1, j)})`**:  Fills the upper neighbor with `1` if found.
6. **(Similar checks and fills for lower, left, and right neighbors)**
7. **`return O`**:  Returns the modified grid with filled borders.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. Each version utilizes distinct logic and function combinations, showcasing diverse coding styles within the DSL's capabilities.
