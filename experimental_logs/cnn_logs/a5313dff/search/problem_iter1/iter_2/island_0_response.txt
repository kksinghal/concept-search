## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on identifying the inner border of objects within the grid and changing those cells to the value '1'. Let's break down each input-output example:

**Input_0:**
* The '2' object has its entire inner border replaced with '1's.

**Input_1:**
* Both '2' objects (the large one and the small one) have their inner borders replaced with '1's.

**Input_2:**
* Similar to previous examples, all '2' objects have their inner borders changed to '1's.

Essentially, the transformation finds cells within an object that are adjacent to the background (or another object) and modifies their values. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, leveraging functions from the provided DSL (`dsl.py`) to achieve the desired transformation:


### Program Version 1: Using `inbox` and `difference`

```python
def solve_00d62c1b(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
      border = difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))
      O = fill(O, ONE, border)
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** The code iterates through each object in the input grid `I`.
2. **Calculate inner border:**  For each object, the `inbox` function identifies the indices within the object's bounding box, excluding the outermost layer. `difference` then removes the actual object's indices from this inbox, leaving only the inner border indices.
3. **Fill inner border:** The `fill` function then changes the values at the identified inner border indices to '1' in the output grid `O`.


### Program Version 2: Using `delta` and direct neighbors

```python
def solve_00d62c1b(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        border = delta(toindices(obj))
        inner_border = mfilter(border, lambda x: len(intersection(dneighbors(x), toindices(obj))) == 4)
        O = fill(O, ONE, inner_border)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find object borders:** This version first calculates the `delta` for each object, representing the cells surrounding it.
2. **Filter for inner border:** It then filters the `delta` to only keep cells that have all four direct neighbors (`dneighbors`) as part of the object. This ensures we're only modifying the inner border. 
3. **Fill the inner border:** Finally, it fills the identified inner border cells with '1'.


### Program Version 3: Exploiting object connectivity

```python
def solve_00d62c1b(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        inner_border = set()
        for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
            for (ni, nj) in dneighbors((i, j)):
                if (0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and (I[ni][nj], (ni, nj)) not in obj):
                    inner_border.add((i, j))
                    break
        O = fill(O, ONE, inner_border)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate within objects:** This version iterates through each cell of an object.
2. **Check for background neighbors:** For every cell, it checks its direct neighbors. If a neighbor doesn't belong to the object, the current cell is marked as part of the inner border.
3. **Fill the inner border:** The identified inner border cells are then filled with '1's.


### Program Version 4: Leveraging `outbox` and neighbor count

```python
def solve_00d62c1b(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    outer_border = outbox(toindices(obj))
    inner_border = mfilter(outer_border, lambda x: len(intersection(dneighbors(x), toindices(obj))) >= 1)
    O = fill(O, ONE, inner_border)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify potential border cells:** This version utilizes the `outbox` function to identify cells immediately surrounding the object.
2. **Filter for inner border:** It then filters these potential border cells, keeping only those that have at least one direct neighbor belonging to the object, effectively identifying the inner border. 
3. **Fill the border:** Finally, the identified inner border cells are filled with '1's. 


### Program Version 5: Using `backdrop` and neighbor checks

```python
def solve_00d62c1b(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    backdrop_indices = backdrop(toindices(obj))
    inner_border = set()
    for (i, j) in backdrop_indices:
        if (0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0]) and (I[i][j], (i, j)) in obj and 
            any((ni, nj) not in toindices(obj) for (ni, nj) in dneighbors((i, j)))):
          inner_border.add((i, j)) 
    O = fill(O, ONE, inner_border)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Obtain object backdrop:** This version begins by identifying the backdrop indices of an object using `backdrop`.
2. **Iterate and check neighbors:** It then iterates through each cell in the backdrop. If a cell is part of the object and has at least one direct neighbor not belonging to the object, it's identified as part of the inner border.
3. **Fill the inner border:** Finally, it fills the identified inner border cells with the value '1'.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the same data transformation using various combinations of DSL functions and logic. Each version offers a unique perspective on solving the problem while adhering to the constraints of the provided DSL.
