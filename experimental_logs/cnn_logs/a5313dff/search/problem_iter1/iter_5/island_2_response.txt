## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation identifies the outline of each object in the grid, excluding the background. The outline is then filled with the value "1" while preserving the original object.

**Input 0:**

* A single object (color '2') is present. 
* Its outline is filled with '1'.

**Input 1:**

* Two objects (color '2') are present.
* The outline of each object is filled with '1'.

**Input 2:**

* Multiple objects (color '2') are present.
* The outline of each object is filled with '1'.

## Program & Explanation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    outline = mfilter(delta(toindices(obj)), lambda cell: 1 <= size(intersection(neighbors(cell), toindices(obj))) <= 3)
    O = underfill(O, ONE, outline)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** The output grid `O` is initialized with the input grid `I`.
2. **Object Iteration:** The program iterates through each object (`obj`) in the input grid, excluding the background (`objects(I, T, T, T)`).
3. **Outline Identification:** For each object, the code identifies its outline:
    * `delta(toindices(obj))`:  Calculates the difference between the object's bounding box and the object itself, representing potential outline cells.
    * `mfilter(...)`: Filters the potential outline cells (`cell`) to keep only those that have between 1 and 3 neighbors belonging to the object.
4. **Outline Filling:**  The `underfill` function fills the identified outline (`outline`) with the value '1' (`ONE`) only if the cell originally contains the background color.
5. **Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    outline = difference(box(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj)) 
    O = underfill(O, ONE, outline)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization & Iteration:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Outline Identification:** 
    * `box(toindices(obj))`:  Calculates the complete bounding box of the object.
    * `difference(...)`: Subtracts the object's indices from its bounding box, leaving only the outline.
3. **Outline Filling & Output:**  Similar to version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    outline = mfilter(neighbors(toindices(obj)), lambda c: index(I, c) == mostcolor(I))
    O = underfill(O, ONE, outline)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** The output grid `O` is initialized as a canvas filled with the background color of the input.
2. **Object Iteration:** Similar to previous versions.
3. **Object Painting:**  The current object is painted onto the canvas `O`.
4. **Outline Identification:**
    * `neighbors(toindices(obj))`: Finds all neighboring cells of the object.
    * `mfilter(...)`: Filters for neighboring cells where the corresponding cell in the input grid `I` contains the background color.
5. **Outline Filling & Output:** Similar to previous versions.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    border_cells = mapply(neighbors, toindices(obj))
    outline = difference(border_cells, toindices(obj))
    O = underfill(O, ONE, outline)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization & Iteration:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Outline Identification:**
    * `mapply(neighbors, toindices(obj))`: Applies the `neighbors` function to each cell index of the object and merges the results, effectively finding all neighboring cells.
    * `difference(...)`: Subtracts the object's indices from the set of neighboring cells, resulting in the outline.
3. **Outline Filling & Output:** Similar to previous versions.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    shifted_objects = (shift(obj, d) for d in (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT))
    outline = reduce(combine, (intersection(toindices(obj), toindices(s)) for s in shifted_objects))
    O = underfill(O, ONE, outline)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization & Iteration:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Outline Identification:**
    * `shifted_objects`:  Creates four shifted versions of the object, each moved one cell in a cardinal direction.
    * `reduce(combine, ...)`:  Iteratively combines the intersection of the original object's indices with each shifted object's indices. This finds cells belonging to the original object that are adjacent to empty space in at least one direction.
3. **Outline Filling & Output:** Similar to previous versions.
