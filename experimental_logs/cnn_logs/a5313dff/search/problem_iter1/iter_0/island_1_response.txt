## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation replaces cells within and directly surrounding an object with the value `1`. Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

- The input has a single object formed by the digit `2`.
- The output replaces the cells of the object and the directly adjacent cells with `1`.

**Input_1:**

- The input has a single object formed by the digit `2`.
- The output replaces the cells of the object and the directly adjacent cells with `1`. 

**Input_2:**

- The input has a single object formed by the digit `2`.
- The output replaces the cells of the object and the directly adjacent cells with `1`.


## Program Versions & Explanations:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve_ef135b50(I):
    return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(ONE, backdrop(toindices(obj))), objects(I, T, T, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the input grid (`I`) regardless of color, connectivity, or background.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: recolor(ONE, backdrop(toindices(obj))), ...)`:** For each identified object:
    - **`toindices(obj)`:** Extracts the indices of the object's cells.
    - **`backdrop(...)`:**  Gets the indices within the bounding box of the object, including its directly adjacent cells.
    - **`recolor(ONE, ...)`:**  Creates a new object with the value `1` at the extracted indices.
3. **`merge(...)`:**  Merges all the recoloured objects into a single set of cells.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged set of cells onto the original input grid, effectively replacing the original object and its surrounding cells with `1`.


**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve_ef135b50(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  modified_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(ONE, delta(toindices(obj)) | toindices(obj)), objs)
  return paint(I, merge(modified_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **`mapply(lambda obj: ..., objs)`:** Applies the lambda function to each object.
    - **`toindices(obj)`:** Gets the indices of the object.
    - **`delta(...)`:** Finds indices surrounding the object.
    - **`... | toindices(obj)`:** Combines indices within and around the object.
    - **`recolor(ONE, ...)`:**  Colors these indices with `1`.
3. **`merge(...)`:** Combines the modified objects.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Draws the combined objects onto the input grid.


**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve_ef135b50(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: toobject(outbox(toindices(obj)), replace(I, color(obj), ONE)), objects(I, T, T, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: ..., ...)`:** Applies the lambda function to each object.
    - **`color(obj)`:**  Gets the color of the current object.
    - **`replace(I, ..., ONE)`:**  Replaces all instances of the object's color with `1` in the grid.
    - **`toindices(obj)`:**  Extracts the object's indices.
    - **`outbox(...)`:**  Finds indices forming the outer boundary of the object.
    - **`toobject(..., ...)`:**  Creates a new object with `1` at the outer boundary indices.
3. **`merge(...)`:**  Combines the modified objects.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Draws the combined objects onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve_ef135b50(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
    return paint(I, merge(mapply(lambda obj: recolor(1, backdrop(toindices(obj)) - toindices(obj)), objs))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **`mapply(lambda obj: ..., objs)`:**  Applies the lambda function to each object.
    - **`toindices(obj)`:** Extracts the indices of the object.
    - **`backdrop(...)`:** Gets indices within the object's bounding box.
    - **`... - toindices(obj)`:**  Removes the original object's indices, leaving just the surrounding cells.
    - **`recolor(1, ...)`:** Colors the remaining indices with `1`.
3. **`merge(...)`:**  Combines the modified objects.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Draws the combined objects onto the input grid.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve_ef135b50(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj:  recolor(ONE,
                                                  (backdrop(toindices(obj)) -
                                                  toindices(obj))),
                                                  objects(I, T, T, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: ..., ...)`:** Applies the lambda function to each object:
    - **`toindices(obj)`:**  Extracts the object's indices.
    - **`backdrop(...)`:**  Gets indices within the bounding box of the object.
    - **`... - toindices(obj)`:** Subtracts the object's indices, leaving only the surrounding cells.
    - **`recolor(ONE, ...)`:**  Creates a new object with `1` at the surrounding cell indices.
3. **`merge(...)`:**  Combines all the modified objects.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Draws the combined objects onto the original input grid.
