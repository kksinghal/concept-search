## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying connected components of the digit '2' and filling the cells directly surrounding each component with the digit '1'. 

**In simpler terms:**  Imagine the '2's as shapes on a grid.  We want to draw a border of '1's around each shape, without letting the borders of different shapes touch.

Let's break it down for each example:

**Input 0:** 
* There's one connected component of '2's.
* The output fills the cells directly above, below, left, and right of this shape with '1's. 

**Input 1:** 
*  Again, there's a single connected '2' component. 
*  The border of '1's is placed around it, leaving empty cells untouched.

**Input 2:**
* This time, we have two separate '2' components. 
* Each component gets its own '1' border, and the borders don't touch each other.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct code versions in the given DSL, inspired by the provided Program_A and incorporating elements from general image processing techniques:

**Program Version 1:** (Inspired by morphological dilation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = partition(I)  # Partition the grid into objects
  twos = colorfilter(objs, 2) # Select objects made of '2'
  dilated_twos = mapply(lambda obj: toobject(mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj)), I), twos) # Dilate each '2' object by 1 cell
  border = difference(toindices(dilated_twos), toindices(twos))  # Find the border (difference between dilated and original)
  O = fill(I, 1, border)  # Fill the border with '1's
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition:** Divide the grid into separate objects based on cell values.
2. **Color Filter:** Isolate the objects consisting only of the digit '2'.
3. **Dilation:**  For each '2' object:
    *  Get its indices.
    *  For each index, find its direct neighbors.
    *  Convert those neighbor indices back to objects within the grid. 
    *  This effectively expands each '2' object by one cell in all directions.
4. **Border Calculation:** Find the difference between the dilated '2' objects and the original '2' objects. This difference represents the desired border.
5. **Fill:** Fill the cells at the border indices with '1's.

**Program Version 2:** (Iterative Flood Fill approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    visited = set()
    
    def flood_fill(i, j):
        if (i, j) in visited or not (0 <= i < h and 0 <= j < w) or I[i][j] != 2:
            return
        visited.add((i, j))
        for ni, nj in dneighbors((i, j)):
            if (ni, nj) not in visited and 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and I[ni][nj] == 0:
                I[ni][nj] = 1 
            flood_fill(ni, nj)  

    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if I[i][j] == 2:
                flood_fill(i, j)
    
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Store grid dimensions and create a `visited` set to track processed cells.
2. **Flood Fill Function (`flood_fill`)**: 
   -  Takes cell coordinates `(i, j)` as input.
   -  Base Cases: Return if the cell is out of bounds, already visited, or not part of a '2' component.
   -  Mark the current cell as visited.
   -  Iterate through direct neighbors:
     -  If the neighbor is valid (in bounds, unvisited, and empty), fill it with '1'.
     -  Recursively call `flood_fill` on this neighbor.
3. **Main Loop:** Iterate through the grid. If a '2' is encountered, initiate `flood_fill` from that cell to fill surrounding empty cells with '1's.


**Program Version 3:** (Using connected components labeling)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    labeled_grid = label_connected_components(I, 2)  # Label connected components of '2's
    O = fill_borders(labeled_grid)  # Fill borders around labeled components with '1'
    return O

def label_connected_components(grid, target_value):
    # (Implementation of a connected component labeling algorithm - can use DFS/BFS)
    # ... (Code to label each connected component of 'target_value' with a unique ID) 
    return labeled_grid 

def fill_borders(labeled_grid): 
    # (Iterate through the labeled grid)
    # ... (For each cell, check if it's adjacent to a different label - if so, fill with '1')
    return filled_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Connected Component Labeling:**  This version uses a standard image processing technique called "connected component labeling". It assigns a unique ID to each connected component of '2's in the grid.
2. **Border Filling:** After labeling, the code iterates through the grid. If a cell is adjacent to another cell with a different label (meaning it's at the border of a component), it gets filled with a '1'.

**Program Version 4:** (Set operations on object indices)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Extract all objects from the grid
  twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)  # Filter for objects consisting of '2's
  expanded_indices =  mapply(lambda obj: toindices(toobject(mapply(neighbors, toindices(obj)), I)), twos) # Get indices of objects expanded by one
  border_indices = difference(expanded_indices, toindices(twos))  # Find the border indices
  O = fill(I, 1, border_indices)  # Fill the border indices with '1's
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** Identify all connected components (objects) in the grid.
2. **Filtering '2' Objects:** Isolate the objects consisting only of the digit '2'.
3. **Expansion:** Expand the indices of each '2' object to include their immediate neighbors.
4. **Border Identification:**  Subtract the original '2' object indices from the expanded indices, resulting in the border.
5. **Filling:**  Fill the border indices with '1's on the input grid. 

**Program Version 5:** (Line drawing approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = partition(I) 
    twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)
    for obj in twos:
        for i, j in toindices(obj):
            for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:
                ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] == 0:
                    I[ni][nj] = 1
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition and Filter:**  Same as in previous versions.
2. **Iterate and Draw:** Iterate through each cell of '2' objects. 
   - For each '2' cell, examine its four direct neighbors (up, down, left, right).
   - If a neighbor is within the grid bounds and contains a '0', replace the '0' with a '1', effectively "drawing" the border.

These are just five possible approaches. You can explore many more variations and optimizations using the provided DSL and the principles outlined in these solutions.
