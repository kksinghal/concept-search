## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently applies the following rule:

**For each object (connected region of the same digit), change the color of the cells bordering the object's interior to 1.**

Let's break down how this applies to each example:

* **Input_0:** The single '2' object has a hollow interior. All bordering cells of this interior are changed to '1'.
* **Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0, the interior borders of the '2' objects are changed to '1'. Note how the exterior border remains untouched.
* **Input_2:** This example reinforces the pattern. Interior borders become '1', while exterior borders and isolated '2's remain unchanged.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_00d62c1b(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify objects, excluding background
    inner_borders = mapply(lambda obj: difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj)), objs) 
    O = underfill(I, ONE, inner_borders) # Fill interior border cells with '1'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts objects from the input grid (`I`), treating connected same-value cells as one object and excluding the background.
2. **Find Inner Borders:** For each object, `difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))` calculates the difference between the object's inbox (the rectangle inside the object's outer boundary) and the object itself. This identifies the inner border cells.
3. **Fill Inner Borders:** `underfill(I, ONE, inner_borders)` fills the identified inner border cells with the value '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_00d62c1b(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    modified_grid = I
    for obj in objs:
      inner_border = difference(box(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))
      modified_grid = underfill(modified_grid, ONE, inner_border)
    return modified_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1, it extracts objects from the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate and Modify:** It iterates through each object and calculates its inner border using `difference(box(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))`. It then directly modifies the input grid (`modified_grid`) by filling these borders with '1' using `underfill`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_00d62c1b(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    inner_border = frozenset()
    for obj in objs:
        for cell in toindices(obj):
            for neighbor in dneighbors(cell):
                if neighbor not in toindices(obj) and index(I, neighbor) == mostcolor(I):
                    inner_border = inner_border.union({neighbor})
    O = underfill(I, ONE, inner_border)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same object identification logic as previous versions.
2. **Direct Neighbor Check:** It iterates through each cell of each object. For every cell, it checks its direct neighbors (`dneighbors`). If a neighbor doesn't belong to the object and has the background color (`mostcolor(I)`), it's considered an inner border cell.
3. **Fill Inner Borders:** The identified inner border cells are then filled with '1' using `underfill`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_00d62c1b(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(1, len(I)-1):
        for j in range(1, len(I[0])-1):
            if I[i][j] == mostcolor(I) and (I[i-1][j] != mostcolor(I) or I[i+1][j] != mostcolor(I) or I[i][j-1] != mostcolor(I) or I[i][j+1] != mostcolor(I)):
                O = fill(O, ONE, {(i,j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** It iterates through each cell of the grid, excluding the outer border.
2. **Direct Neighbor Check (Simplified):** For each cell, it checks if it's a background color and has at least one non-background neighbor. If true, it's considered an inner border cell.
3. **Fill Inner Borders:** The identified inner border cells are filled with '1'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_00d62c1b(I):
    return paint(I, recolor(ONE, mapply(
        lambda obj: difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj)),
        objects(I, T, F, T)
    )))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extracts objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Calculate Inner Borders:** Calculates the inner borders of each object using the `inbox` and `difference` functions.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** Recolors the inner borders to '1' using `recolor` and then paints them back onto the original grid using `paint`.



These five versions provide diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing different aspects and functions available in the provided DSL.
