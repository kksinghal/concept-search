## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '2' and then filling the cells directly surrounding those objects with the digit '1'. The original '2' objects remain unchanged. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** The single '2' object is surrounded by '0's.  The program correctly identifies the surrounding '0's and replaces them with '1's.

**Input_1:** This input features multiple '2' objects. The program successfully identifies the surrounding cells for each object and fills them with '1's, demonstrating its ability to handle multiple objects. 

**Input_2:** Similar to Input_1, this input contains multiple '2' objects, but with a more complex arrangement. The program again correctly identifies the surrounding cells, highlighting its robustness in different scenarios.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = partition(I)  # Partition grid into objects based on color
  twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)  # Filter for objects with color 2
  surrounding_indices = mapply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), twos)
  O = fill(I, 1, surrounding_indices)  # Fill the surrounding indices with 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = partition(I)`:** Partitions the input grid `I` into separate objects based on color. 
2. **`twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)`:**  Filters the objects to keep only those composed of the digit '2'.
3. **`surrounding_indices = mapply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), twos)`:** For each '2' object, this line first extracts its indices using `toindices` and then calculates the 'delta', which represents the surrounding cells, using the `delta` function. Finally, `mapply` applies this process to all '2' objects and merges the results.
4. **`O = fill(I, 1, surrounding_indices)`:**  Fills the `surrounding_indices` within the original grid `I` with the value '1', generating the output grid `O`.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  twos = ofcolor(I, 2)  # Get indices of all '2' cells
  shifted = mpapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0] + i, loc[1] + j) for i, j in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]}, twos)
  valid = sfilter(shifted, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 0)
  O = fill(I, 1, valid) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`twos = ofcolor(I, 2)`:**  Finds the indices of all cells containing the digit '2' in the input grid `I`.
2. **`shifted = mpapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0] + i, loc[1] + j) for i, j in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]}, twos)`:** Generates a set of indices by shifting each '2' cell's location one step in all four directions (up, down, left, right).
3. **`valid = sfilter(shifted, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 0)`:** Filters the `shifted` indices to keep only those within the grid boundaries and containing the value '0' in the original grid.
4. **`O = fill(I, 1, valid)`:** Fills the cells at the `valid` indices in the original grid `I` with '1', producing the output grid `O`.


## Program Version 3:
**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)  # Extract connected objects
  twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)  # Filter objects of color 2
  dilated_indices = mapply(lambda obj: backdrop(toindices(obj)), twos)  # Bounding boxes of 2s
  filtered_cells = sfilter(dilated_indices, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 0)
  O = fill(I, 1, filtered_cells)  # Fill with 1s
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, True, False, False)`:** Identifies all connected objects in the grid, treating diagonally adjacent cells as separate objects.
2. **`twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)`:** Filters the objects, keeping only those composed entirely of the digit '2'.
3. **`dilated_indices = mapply(lambda obj: backdrop(toindices(obj)), twos)`:** For each '2' object, it calculates the indices of its bounding box using `backdrop` after extracting the object's indices with `toindices`. 
4. **`filtered_cells = sfilter(dilated_indices, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 0)`:** Filters the bounding box indices, keeping only valid cells within the grid boundaries and containing the value '0'.
5. **`O = fill(I, 1, filtered_cells)`:**  Replaces the values at the `filtered_cells` indices in the original grid `I` with '1' to produce the output grid `O`. 


## Program Version 4:
**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = [[I[i][j] for j in range(w)] for i in range(h)]
  for i in range(h):
      for j in range(w):
          if I[i][j] == 2:
              for di, dj in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
                  ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                  if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and I[ni][nj] == 0:
                      O[ni][nj] = 1
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h, w = len(I), len(I[0])`:**  Gets the height and width of the input grid `I`.
2. **`O = [[I[i][j] for j in range(w)] for i in range(h)]`:** Creates a copy of the input grid `I` and stores it in `O`.
3. **`for i in range(h):`** and **`for j in range(w):`:**  Iterates over each cell in the grid.
4. **`if I[i][j] == 2:`:**  Checks if the current cell contains the value '2'.
5. **`for di, dj in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:`:** Iterates through the four neighboring directions (up, down, left, right).
6. **`ni, nj = i + di, j + dj`:** Calculates the row and column indices of the neighboring cell.
7. **`if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and I[ni][nj] == 0:`:**  Checks if the neighbor is within the grid boundaries and contains the value '0'.
8. **`O[ni][nj] = 1`:**  If the condition holds, it changes the value of the neighboring cell in the copy `O` to '1'.
9. **`return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)`:** Finally, it returns the modified copy `O` as a tuple of tuples.


## Program Version 5:
**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grids = [shift(asobject(I), d) for d in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]] 
  merged = shifted_grids[0]
  for shifted_grid in shifted_grids[1:]:
      merged |= shifted_grid
  filtered_cells = sfilter(merged, lambda cell: cell[0] == 0 and any(index(I, (cell[1][0] + i, cell[1][1] + j)) == 2 for i, j in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]))
  O = fill(I, 1, mapply(lambda x: x[1], filtered_cells)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_grids = [shift(asobject(I), d) for d in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]]`:**  Creates four shifted versions of the input grid `I` as objects, each shifted by one cell in each direction.
2. **`merged = shifted_grids[0]`** and **`for shifted_grid in shifted_grids[1:]: merged |= shifted_grid`**:  Combines the shifted grids into a single object `merged` using set union.
3. **`filtered_cells = sfilter(merged, lambda cell: cell[0] == 0 and any(index(I, (cell[1][0] + i, cell[1][1] + j)) == 2 for i, j in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]))`:** Filters the cells in the `merged` object, keeping only cells with value '0' that have at least one neighbor in the original grid `I` with the value '2'.
4. **`O = fill(I, 1, mapply(lambda x: x[1], filtered_cells))`:** Fills the corresponding cells in the original grid `I` with '1' using the indices extracted from the `filtered_cells`.
5. **`return O`**: Returns the modified grid `O`.
