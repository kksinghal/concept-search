## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on identifying the "interior" cells of objects within the grid and recoloring them to '1'. An interior cell is defined as a cell that is part of an object and is surrounded by other object cells both horizontally and vertically. 

**Input 0:** The single object has its interior filled with '1's, leaving a hollow shape.
**Input 1:**  Similar to Input 0, the larger object's interior is filled.
**Input 2:** The transformation is applied to all objects in the grid, each having their interiors filled independently.


## Program Version 1

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_interior(obj, idx):
    return both(
        any(add(idx, d) in toindices(obj) for d in ((0, 1), (0, -1))),
        any(add(idx, d) in toindices(obj) for d in ((1, 0), (-1, 0)))
    )
  def fill_interior(obj):
    return recolor(ONE, sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda idx: is_interior(obj, idx)))
  return paint(I, merge(mapply(fill_interior, objects(I, T, T, T))))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`is_interior(obj, idx)`:** This function checks if a given index `idx` within an object `obj` is an interior cell. It verifies if there are object cells both horizontally and vertically adjacent to the given index.
2. **`fill_interior(obj)`:** This function takes an object `obj` and recolors its interior cells to '1'. It first uses `toindices` to get the indices of the object. Then, it filters these indices using `sfilter` and the `is_interior` function to select only the interior indices. Finally, it uses `recolor` to change the color of these indices to '1'.
3. **Main Function:** The main function utilizes `objects(I, T, T, T)` to identify all objects in the input grid `I`. Then, it applies the `fill_interior` function to each object using `mapply`. Finally, it merges all modified objects using `merge` and paints them onto the input grid using `paint`, resulting in the final output grid.


## Program Version 2

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def fill_interior(obj):
    return recolor(ONE, difference(toindices(obj), box(toindices(obj))))
  return paint(I, merge(mapply(fill_interior, objects(I, T, T, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_interior(obj)`:**  This function identifies the interior indices of an object by finding the difference between all indices of the object (`toindices(obj)`) and the indices forming the object's bounding box (`box(toindices(obj))`). It then recolors these interior indices to '1'.
2. **Main Function:** The main function remains similar to Version 1, using `objects`, `mapply`, `merge`, and `paint` to apply the `fill_interior` function to all objects in the input grid and generate the final output.


## Program Version 3

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def fill_interior(obj):
    return toobject(difference(toindices(obj), box(toindices(obj))), fill(I, ONE, toindices(obj)))
  return paint(I, merge(mapply(fill_interior, objects(I, T, T, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_interior(obj)`:**  This version leverages `toobject` to directly create the modified object. It first fills the entire object with '1's using `fill`. Then, it uses `difference` and `box` (similar to Version 2) to find the interior indices. Finally, it uses `toobject` to combine the interior indices with the filled grid, effectively creating a new object with the interior filled and the original outline intact.
2. **Main Function:**  Similar to previous versions, it uses `objects`, `mapply`, `merge`, and `paint` to apply the `fill_interior` function to all objects and generate the output grid. 


## Program Version 4 

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_exterior(obj, idx):
    return any(not(0 <= add(idx, d)[0] < len(I) and 0 <= add(idx, d)[1] < len(I[0]) or add(idx, d) in toindices(obj)) for d in ((0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)))
  def fill_interior(obj):
    return recolor(ONE, sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda idx: not is_exterior(obj, idx)))
  return paint(I, merge(mapply(fill_interior, objects(I, T, T, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_exterior(obj, idx)`:**  This function checks if an index `idx` is on the exterior of the object `obj`. It iterates through the four adjacent directions and checks if any adjacent cell is either out of bounds or not part of the object. 
2. **`fill_interior(obj)`:** It utilizes `sfilter` and `is_exterior` to select only the indices which are not exterior (meaning they are interior) and recolors them to '1' using `recolor`.
3. **Main Function:** The main function utilizes the same approach as previous versions using `objects`, `mapply`, `merge`, and `paint` to achieve the final transformation.


## Program Version 5

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def fill_interior(obj):
        return recolor(ONE, sfilter(backdrop(toindices(obj)), lambda idx: index(I, idx) != ZERO and all(0 <= add(idx, d)[0] < len(I) and 0 <= add(idx, d)[1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, add(idx, d)) != ZERO for d in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)])))
    return paint(I, merge(mapply(fill_interior, objects(I, T, T, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_interior(obj)`:**  This version focuses on identifying cells within the object's backdrop that are non-zero and completely surrounded by other non-zero cells. 
2. **Main Function:** The main function remains consistent with previous versions, utilizing familiar functions like `objects`, `mapply`, `merge`, and `paint` to achieve the final transformation. 

These five versions provide different approaches to solve the given transformation problem using the provided DSL functions. Each version utilizes distinct logic and function combinations, showcasing the versatility of the DSL and offering diverse solutions for the same problem.
