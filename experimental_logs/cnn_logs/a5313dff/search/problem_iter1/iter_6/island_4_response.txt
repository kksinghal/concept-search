## Transformation Analysis:

The task is to identify and mark the cells immediately surrounding objects of the value '2' within the input grid. The surrounding cells are only marked if they initially contain the value '0'.

**Input_0:**

- Objects with value '2' are identified.
- Cells directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to these objects and containing '0' are changed to '1'.

**Input_1:**

- Similar to Input_0, but the '2' objects are in different configurations.

**Input_2:**

- Same logic applied as in Input_0 and Input_1, demonstrating the generalizability of the transformation.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = partition(I)  # Partition the grid into objects based on color
  twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)  # Filter for objects with color 2
  surrounding_indices = mfilter(  # Find valid surrounding indices
      mapply(
          lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), twos  # Get the delta (outline) of each '2' object
      ),
      lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, loc) == 0,  # Filter for valid indices within the grid and having value 0
  )
  O = fill(I, 1, surrounding_indices)  # Fill the surrounding indices with 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition and Filter:** Identify objects of '2' using `partition` and `colorfilter`.
2. **Find Surrounding Cells:** Use `delta` to get the outline of each '2' object. 
3. **Filter Valid Cells:** Ensure the surrounding cells are within the grid bounds and contain '0' using `mfilter` and `index`.
4. **Fill with '1':** Mark the valid surrounding cells with '1' using `fill`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  twos = ofcolor(I, 2)  # Get indices of all '2' cells
  shifted = mpapply(add, twos, [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)])  # Generate shifted indices in all four directions
  valid = sfilter(shifted, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, loc) == 0)  # Filter for valid indices and '0' values
  O = fill(I, 1, valid)  # Fill valid cells with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '2' Cells:** Directly locate cells containing '2' using `ofcolor`.
2. **Shift Indices:** Generate adjacent cell indices by shifting the original indices in four directions.
3. **Filter Valid Cells:** Ensure shifted indices are within grid bounds and contain '0'.
4. **Fill with '1':**  Mark the filtered cells with '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)  # Extract all connected objects
  twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)  # Filter for objects of color '2'
  dilated_indices = mapply(
      lambda obj: backdrop(toindices(obj)), twos  # Get indices of the bounding box for each '2' object 
  )
  filtered_cells = mfilter(
      dilated_indices, lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0
  )  # Filter for cells that were originally 0 within the bounding boxes
  O = fill(I, 1, filtered_cells)  # Fill the filtered cells with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify connected objects using `objects`.
2. **Filter '2' Objects:** Isolate objects with the value '2'.
3. **Bounding Box Indices:** Obtain indices within the bounding box of each '2' object using `backdrop`.
4. **Filter Original '0' Cells:** Isolate cells within the bounding boxes that initially held '0'.
5. **Fill with '1':** Mark the filtered cells with '1'. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grids = [
      shift(asobject(I), d) for d in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]  # Create 4 shifted versions of the grid as objects
  ]
  merged = shifted_grids[0]
  for shifted_grid in shifted_grids[1:]:
      merged = paint(merged, shifted_grid)  # Combine all shifted grids, overwriting with later grids
  filtered_cells = sfilter(
      merged, lambda cell: cell[0] == 0 and index(I, cell[1]) == 2
  )  # Find cells originally '0' now adjacent to '2'
  O = fill(I, 1, mapply(lambda x: x[1], filtered_cells))  # Fill corresponding cells in the original grid with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shifted Grids:** Create four copies of the input grid, each shifted one unit in a cardinal direction.
2. **Merge Grids:**  Combine the shifted grids, prioritizing values from grids shifted later.
3. **Identify Modified Cells:** Locate cells originally containing '0' that are now adjacent to '2' in the merged grid.
4. **Fill with '1':** Mark the corresponding cells in the original grid with '1'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = partition(I)  # Partition into objects
    twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)  # Filter for '2' objects
    surrounding = []
    for obj in twos:
        for _, (i, j) in obj:  # Iterate through cells in each '2' object
            for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:  # Check adjacent cells
                ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] == 0:
                    surrounding.append((ni, nj))  # Add valid surrounding cells to the list
    O = fill(I, 1, surrounding)  # Fill the surrounding cells with '1'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '2' Objects:** Find connected regions of '2's using `partition` and `colorfilter`.
2. **Iterate and Check:** Loop through each cell within each '2' object and examine its four adjacent neighbors.
3. **Validate and Collect:** If a neighboring cell is within grid boundaries and contains '0', add its indices to a list.
4. **Fill with '1':**  Mark the collected surrounding cells with '1' using `fill`.

These five versions offer different approaches to solving the problem, each leveraging various DSL functions and logic.
