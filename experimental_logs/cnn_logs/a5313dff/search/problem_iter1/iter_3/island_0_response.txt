## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation identifies the "outer border" of each object (connected group of non-zero digits) in the input grid. The outer border consists of cells directly outside the object that are adjacent to at least one object cell. Then, it fills these outer border cells with the value '1'.

**Example:**

Input:

```
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0
0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0
0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0
0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0
0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0
```

Output:

```
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0
0 0 2 1 1 1 2 0
0 0 2 1 2 1 2 0
0 0 2 1 1 1 2 0
0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 
```

Here, the cells surrounding the '2's, which are not part of the '2' object itself, are filled with '1's.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    outer_border = outbox(toindices(obj))
    inner_border = mfilter(outer_border, lambda x: len(intersection(dneighbors(x), toindices(obj))) > 0)
    O = fill(O, ONE, inner_border)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** The code iterates through each object (connected component of non-zero values) in the input grid `I`.
2. **Identify Outer Border:**  For each object, it calculates the `outer_border` using the `outbox` function.
3. **Filter Inner Border:** It then filters the `outer_border` to keep only cells adjacent to the object using `mfilter`, `intersection`, and `dneighbors`. This gives us the `inner_border`.
4. **Fill Inner Border:** Finally, it fills the `inner_border` cells in the output grid `O` with the value '1' using the `fill` function.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = fill(O, ONE, difference(outbox(toindices(obj)), delta(toindices(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** The code iterates through each object in the input grid `I`.
2. **Calculate Inner Border:** For each object, it calculates the `inner_border` by finding the difference between the `outbox` and `delta` of the object. The `delta` function returns cells within the bounding box of the object but not part of the object itself.
3. **Fill Inner Border:** It directly fills the `inner_border` cells in the output grid `O` with the value '1' using the `fill` function.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    border_cells = set()
    for cell in toindices(obj):
      border_cells.update(dneighbors(cell) - toindices(obj))
    O = fill(O, ONE, frozenset(border_cells))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** The code iterates through each object in the input grid `I`.
2. **Find Border Cells:** For each cell within an object, it finds its direct neighbors (`dneighbors`) and removes any cells that are also part of the object. This gives us a set of `border_cells`.
3. **Fill Border Cells:** Finally, it fills the identified `border_cells` in the output grid `O` with the value '1' using the `fill` function.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) 
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    expanded_obj = mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj))
    border = difference(expanded_obj, toindices(obj))
    O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, border))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:**  The code creates an empty canvas `O` of the same size as the input grid `I` and fills it with '0's. 
2. **Iterate through Objects:** It then iterates through each object in the input grid `I`.
3. **Find Border Cells:**  For each object, it expands the object by one cell in all directions using `mapply` and `dneighbors`. It then subtracts the original object from this expanded version, resulting in the `border` cells.
4. **Paint Border:** Finally, it paints the `border` cells with the value '1' onto the canvas `O` using the `paint` and `recolor` functions.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(1, len(I) - 1):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == ZERO and any(I[x][y] != ZERO for x, y in dneighbors((i, j))):
        O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** This version iterates directly through each cell of the input grid `I`, except for the border cells.
2. **Check for Border Condition:** For each cell, it checks if it's a '0' and if any of its direct neighbors are non-zero (part of an object).
3. **Fill Border Cell:** If the condition is met, it fills that cell in the output grid `O` with the value '1' using the `fill` function. 

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation using various DSL functions and logic, demonstrating diversity in solution generation.
