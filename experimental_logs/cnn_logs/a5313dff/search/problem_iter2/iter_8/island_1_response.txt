## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation shifts all objects in the input grid to the right, aligning their rightmost edge with the right edge of the grid. The original object shapes and relative positions are preserved.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The single object (composed of digits '1' and '2') is shifted rightward until its rightmost edge aligns with the grid's right edge.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* Each object (digits '1' and '2') is individually shifted rightward. The empty space between objects is preserved.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

*  Similar to Input_1, each object is shifted rightward, maintaining the spacing and relative positions.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
                 frozenset(shift(obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1))
                           for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:**  Identifies all distinct objects in the input grid (`I`).
2. **`frozenset(shift(obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1)) for obj in ...)`:** For each object:
    *  `rightmost(obj)`: Determines the column index of the object's rightmost cell.
    * `width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1`: Calculates the required rightward shift to align the object with the grid's right edge.
    * `shift(obj, (0, ...))`: Shifts the object horizontally.
3. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates an empty canvas with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid.
4. **`paint(..., ...)`:**  Paints the shifted objects onto the empty canvas.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    shifted_objs = frozenset()
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
        shifted_objs = shifted_objs | {shift(obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1))}
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), shifted_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

* This version uses a loop instead of a set comprehension to calculate and collect shifted objects, making the code slightly more verbose. 

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
                 mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1)), 
                        objects(I, True, False, True)))
```

**Explanation:**

* This version utilizes the `mapply` function for a more compact representation of applying the shifting operation to each object.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def shift_right(obj):
      return shift(obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1))
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), apply(shift_right, objects(I, True, False, True)))
```

**Explanation:**

*  This version defines a helper function `shift_right` for readability, separating the shifting logic from the main function.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  return paint(I,
               frozenset(recolor(color(obj), shift(toindices(obj), (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1)))
                         for obj in objs))
```

**Explanation:**

* This version leverages `recolor` and `toindices` for a slightly different approach to shifting objects while preserving their colors.


**Note:** 

*  These versions are designed to handle grids with multiple objects.
*  The background color of the output grid is set to the most frequent color in the input grid using `mostcolor(I)`.

These five versions offer diverse implementations for the rightward object shifting transformation, utilizing different DSL functions and programming constructs.
