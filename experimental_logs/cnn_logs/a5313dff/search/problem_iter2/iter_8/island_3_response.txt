## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on shifting specific objects to the left, effectively "aligning" them to the left edge of the grid. The objects targeted for shifting seem to be determined by their spatial relationship with the object composed of the digit '1'. Here's a breakdown:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* No change observed. This implies that either no object composed of '1' exists, or the spatial relationship required for the transformation is not met.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The object primarily made of the digit '2' is shifted left until its left edge aligns with the left edge of the object composed of the digit '1'. 

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* Similar to Input_1, the object predominantly composed of '2' is shifted left to align with the object made of '1'. 

## Program Generation:

Based on the analysis, the transformation involves these steps:

1. Identify the object composed of the digit '1'.
2. Identify the object composed of the digit '2'.
3. Determine the shift offset required to align the left edges of both objects.
4. Shift the object composed of '2' by the calculated offset.

Here are five distinct program versions leveraging the DSL functions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj1 = next((obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, False) if color(obj) == 1), frozenset()) 
  obj2 = next((obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, False) if color(obj) == 2), frozenset())
  offset = (uppermost(obj1) - uppermost(obj2), leftmost(obj1) - leftmost(obj2))
  shifted_obj2 = shift(obj2, offset)
  O = paint(cover(I, obj2), shifted_obj2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `obj1` and `obj2` are found using `objects` and filtering by `color`.
2. **Calculate Offset:** The difference in the upper-left corner coordinates of `obj1` and `obj2` determines the shift.
3. **Shift and Paint:** `obj2` is shifted using `shift`, the original `obj2` is erased using `cover`, and the shifted object is painted back onto the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj1 = next((obj for obj in partition(I) if color(obj) == 1), frozenset())
  obj2 = next((obj for obj in partition(I) if color(obj) == 2), frozenset())
  j_shift = leftmost(obj1) - leftmost(obj2)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), shift(obj2, (0, j_shift)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1, but using `partition` for object identification.
2. **Calculate Shift:** Only the horizontal shift (`j_shift`) is calculated.
3. **Shift and Paint:** A new canvas is created with the background color. The shifted `obj2` is directly painted onto this canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices1 = ofcolor(I, 1)
  indices2 = ofcolor(I, 2)
  shift_amount = min(j1 - j2 for i1, j1 in indices1 for i2, j2 in indices2 if i1 == i2)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), shift(recolor(2, indices2), (0, shift_amount)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Indices:** `ofcolor` is used to directly obtain the indices of cells containing '1' and '2'.
2. **Calculate Shift:** The minimum horizontal distance between '1' and '2' on the same row is calculated.
3. **Shift and Paint:** A new canvas is created. `indices2` is converted to an object using `recolor`, shifted, and painted.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj1 = argmax(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  obj2 = argmax(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  offset = subtract(ulcorner(obj1), ulcorner(obj2))
  O = paint(cover(I, obj2), shift(obj2, offset))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Utilizes `argmax` with a custom lambda function to find the desired objects.
2. **Calculate Offset:** Directly uses `subtract` for offset calculation.
3. **Shift and Paint:** Same as previous versions - shift, cover, and paint.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj1 = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  obj2 = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  j_diff = leftmost(obj1) - leftmost(obj2)
  shifted_obj2 = frozenset((v, (i, j + j_diff)) for v, (i, j) in obj2)
  O = paint(cover(I, obj2), shifted_obj2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Employs `extract` with a lambda function for object identification.
2. **Calculate Shift:** Only horizontal shift is calculated.
3. **Manual Shift:** `shifted_obj2` is generated by directly modifying the column indices of cells in `obj2`. 
4. **Paint:** Similar to other versions, the original is covered and the shifted object is painted.

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation using different DSL function combinations and logic. Each version accomplishes the same output, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
