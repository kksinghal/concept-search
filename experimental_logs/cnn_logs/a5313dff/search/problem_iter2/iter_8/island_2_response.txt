## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying distinct objects (groups of connected non-background digits) within the input grid and shifting them to the right edge of the grid while maintaining their relative vertical positions. The background color is preserved.

**Input 0:** 
* A single object (digit 2) is shifted to the right edge. 
* The smaller object (digit 1) within remains in its relative position within the larger object.

**Input 1:**
* Three objects (formed by digits 2, 1, and a combination of 1 & 2) are identified.
* Each object is independently shifted to the right edge. 

**Input 2:**
* Similar to Input 1, multiple objects are identified and shifted to the right edge.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions utilizing different DSL functions to achieve the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  shifted_objs = initset(toobject(frozenset(), I)) 
  for obj in objs:
    max_j = 0
    for other_obj in objs:
      if hmatching(obj, other_obj):
        max_j = max(max_j, rightmost(other_obj))
    shifted_objs = insert(shift(toobject(toindices(obj), I), (0, width(I) - max_j - width(obj))), shifted_objs)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(shifted_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `fgpartition(I)` identifies objects based on connected non-background cells.
2. **Iterate & Calculate Shift:** For each object:
   - Determine the rightmost column (`max_j`) of any object horizontally aligned with it.
   - Calculate the shift distance as `width(I) - max_j - width(obj)`. 
3. **Shift & Collect:** Shift the object horizontally using `shift()` and add it to `shifted_objs`.
4. **Paint on Canvas:** Create a blank canvas (`canvas()`) and paint the shifted objects using `paint()`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Similar to Version 1.
2. **Create Canvas & Paint:** Create a canvas and iteratively paint each object.
3. **Direct Shift Calculation:** The shift distance for each object is calculated directly within `shift()` as `width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    column = tuple(I[i][j] for i in range(height(I)))
    if any(c != mostcolor(I) for c in column):
      O = paint(O, shift(toobject(crop(I, (0, j), (height(I), 1)), I), (0, width(O) - j - 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Columns:** Iterates through columns from left to right.
2. **Check for Non-Background:**  If a column contains non-background colors, it extracts the column as an object.
3. **Shift & Paint:**  Shifts the object to the right edge and paints it on the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return hconcat(canvas(mostcolor(I), (height(I), width(I) - width(compress(I)))), compress(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Compress:** `compress(I)` removes all-background rows and columns, effectively shifting objects to the left edge.
2. **Reconstruct with Canvas:** Concatenates the compressed grid with a blank canvas of appropriate size to position objects at the right edge.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(
      apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1)), objs)
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Apply Shift:** Uses `apply()` to apply a lambda function that calculates the shift distance for each object and shifts it accordingly.
3. **Paint & Merge:** Paints the shifted objects on a canvas. 


These are just a few examples, and many other valid solutions might exist within the DSL's capabilities. By analyzing the provided programs and understanding the core transformation logic, you can explore different function combinations and approaches to develop creative and efficient solutions.
