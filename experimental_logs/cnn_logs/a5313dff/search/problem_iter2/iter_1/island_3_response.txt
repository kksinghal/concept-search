## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects formed by the digit '1' and aims to:

* **Isolate the rightmost '1' cell:** For each row, only the rightmost occurrence of '1' remains, while others are replaced with the background color.
* **Maintain other object structures:**  All other digits and their relative positions remain unchanged.

**Input_0:** The rightmost '1' in each row of the inner rectangle is kept, the rest are replaced by '2'.

**Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the rightmost '1's are preserved. Notice how the transformation doesn't affect the '2's surrounding them.

**Input_2:**  The pattern continues; the rightmost '1' in every row is isolated, even within the larger '1' objects.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL functions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = tuple(
    tuple(
      branch(
        both(v == 1, j == rightmost(sfilter(asindices(r), lambda x: I[x[0]][x[1]] == 1))),
        1,
        branch(v==1, mostcommon(r), v)
      )
      for j, v in enumerate(r)
    )
    for i, r in enumerate(I)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows and cells:** The nested loops iterate through each row `r` and cell value `v` in the input grid `I`.
2. **Identify rightmost '1':**  
    - `sfilter(asindices(r), lambda x: I[x[0]][x[1]] == 1)` filters the indices of the current row to keep only those with the value '1'.
    - `rightmost(...)` finds the column index `j` of the rightmost '1' in that row.
3. **Conditional replacement:** 
    - `both(v == 1, ...)` checks if the current cell is '1' and if its column index `j` matches the rightmost '1' index. 
    - If both conditions are true, the cell keeps the value '1'.
    - Otherwise `branch(v==1, mostcommon(r), v)` replaces the '1' with background color, identified by `mostcommon(r)`,  leaving other digits unchanged.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = tuple(
    tuple(
      branch(
        contained(
          (i, j),
          mpapply(
            lambda x, y: (x, rightmost(sfilter(asindices(I[x]), lambda z: I[z[0]][z[1]] == 1))),
            interval(0, len(I), 1),
            repeat(1, len(I))
          )
        ),
        1,
        branch(v==1, mostcommon(I[i]), v)
      )
      for j, v in enumerate(r)
    )
    for i, r in enumerate(I)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Pre-calculate rightmost '1' indices:**
    -  `mpapply(...)` generates a set of tuples `(row_index, rightmost_1_column_index)` for all rows in the grid.
2. **Iterate and check for membership:**
    - The nested loops iterate through each cell, and `contained((i,j), ...)` checks if the cell's index belongs to the pre-calculated set of rightmost '1' indices.
3. **Conditional replacement:** Similar to Version 1, it replaces the cell with '1' if it's the rightmost '1' in its row, otherwise replaces '1' with background color and retains other cell values.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = paint(
    I,
    mapply(
      compose(
        lambda x: {(1, x)},
        lambda x: (x, rightmost(sfilter(asindices(I[x]), lambda y: I[y[0]][y[1]] == 1)))
      ),
      interval(0, len(I), 1)
    )
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Generate object representing rightmost '1's:**
    - `mapply(...)` iterates over row indices and constructs a set of objects, each containing a single cell representing the rightmost '1' in its respective row.
2. **Paint onto the original grid:**
    - `paint(I, ...)` overlays the generated object onto the input grid `I`, effectively keeping only the rightmost '1's and implicitly replacing others with the background color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = tuple(
      tuple(
          branch(
              both(v == 1, j == max(sfilter(interval(0, len(r), 1), lambda x: r[x] == 1), default = -1)),
              1,
              branch(v==1, mostcommon(r), v)
          ) for j, v in enumerate(r)
      ) for i, r in enumerate(I)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and find rightmost '1':**
    - Nested loops iterate through cells, and `max(sfilter(interval(0, len(r), 1), lambda x: r[x] == 1), default = -1)` finds the highest column index `j` containing '1' in the current row.
2. **Conditional replacement:**  If the current cell is '1' and its column index matches the rightmost '1', it remains unchanged. Otherwise, it's replaced following the same logic as previous versions.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i, r in enumerate(I):
        rightmost_one = max([j for j, v in enumerate(r) if v == 1], default=None)
        if rightmost_one is not None:
            O = tuple(
                tuple(
                    1 if j == rightmost_one and v==1 else branch(v==1, mostcommon(O[i]), v) for j, v in enumerate(row)
                ) if i_ == i else row for i_, row in enumerate(O)
            )
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** Iterates through each row in the grid.
2. **Find rightmost '1':**  `rightmost_one = max([j for j, v in enumerate(r) if v == 1], default=None)`  finds the column index of the rightmost '1' in the current row. 
3. **Modify the grid:** 
    - If a rightmost '1' is found, it modifies the corresponding row in a new grid `O` to keep only that '1' and replace others with the background color, while other digits remain the same.


These five versions showcase distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL. Each version leverages different function combinations and logic flow, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
