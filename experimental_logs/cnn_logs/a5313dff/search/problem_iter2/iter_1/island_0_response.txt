## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the rightmost object in the input grid and shifting it to the right edge of the grid. The object is moved so that its rightmost cell aligns with the rightmost column of the grid. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input 0:** The rightmost object is the '2' shape. It is shifted one cell to the right to align with the grid's right edge.
* **Input 1:** The rightmost object is the column of '2's. This column is shifted three cells to the right.
* **Input 2:** The rightmost object is the complex shape formed by '2's in the top-right portion of the grid. This object is shifted two cells to the right.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  rightmost_obj = argmax(objects(I, False, False, False), compose(rightmost, toindices))
  shift_amount = width(I) - rightmost(rightmost_obj) - 1
  O = paint(cover(I, rightmost_obj), shift(rightmost_obj, (0, shift_amount)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the rightmost object:** 
   - `objects(I, False, False, False)` identifies all objects in the grid.
   - `compose(rightmost, toindices)` creates a function that finds the rightmost column index of a given object.
   - `argmax(...)` applies this function to each object and returns the object with the highest rightmost column index.
2. **Calculate the shift amount:**
   -  `width(I)` gets the grid's width.
   - `rightmost(rightmost_obj)` gets the rightmost column index of the rightmost object.
   - `shift_amount` is calculated to align the object's right edge with the grid's right edge.
3. **Shift and paint the object:**
   - `cover(I, rightmost_obj)` removes the original rightmost object from the grid.
   - `shift(rightmost_obj, (0, shift_amount))` shifts the object to the right.
   - `paint(...)` paints the shifted object onto the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, False)
  rightmost_obj =  extract(objs, lambda obj: rightmost(obj) == valmax(objs, rightmost))
  return paint(cover(I, rightmost_obj), shift(rightmost_obj, (0, width(I) - width(rightmost_obj) - 1))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the rightmost object:**
   - Similar to version 1, but uses `extract` and `valmax` to find the object with the maximum `rightmost` value.
2. **Shift and paint (same as version 1):**
   - Uses the same logic as version 1 for shifting and painting the object.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  def rightmost_edge(obj):
    return rightmost(toindices(obj))
  rightmost_obj = argmax(objects(I, False, False, False), rightmost_edge)
  O = paint(cover(I, rightmost_obj), shift(rightmost_obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost_edge(rightmost_obj) - 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define a helper function:**
   - `rightmost_edge(obj)` calculates the rightmost column index of an object.
2. **Identify the rightmost object:**
   - Uses the helper function within `argmax` for clarity.
3. **Shift and paint (same as previous versions):**
   -  Reuses the shifting and painting logic.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  shifted_objs = [(shift(obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1)), obj) for obj in objects(I, False, False, False)]
  rightmost_obj = argmax(shifted_objs, lambda x: rightmost(x[0]))[1]
  return paint(cover(I, rightmost_obj), shift(rightmost_obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost(rightmost_obj) - 1)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate shifted positions:**
    - Creates a list `shifted_objs` containing tuples of (shifted object, original object) for all objects.
2. **Find the originally rightmost object:**
    - Uses `argmax` to find the shifted object with the highest `rightmost` value and extracts the corresponding original object.
3. **Shift and paint (same as previous versions):**
    -  Uses the same logic as before.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  def right_aligned_obj(obj):
    return shift(obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1))
  objs = objects(I, False, False, False)
  rightmost_shifted_obj = argmax(apply(right_aligned_obj, objs), rightmost)
  return paint(I, rightmost_shifted_obj)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define a helper function:**
    - `right_aligned_obj(obj)` shifts an object to align its right edge with the grid's right edge.
2. **Find the right-aligned object with the highest `rightmost` value:**
    - Applies the helper function to all objects.
    - Uses `argmax` to find the right-aligned object with the highest `rightmost` value.
3. **Paint the object:**
    - Directly paints the right-aligned object onto the original grid.



These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to identifying and shifting the rightmost object, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. Each version achieves the same transformation logic while utilizing distinct combinations of DSL functions.
