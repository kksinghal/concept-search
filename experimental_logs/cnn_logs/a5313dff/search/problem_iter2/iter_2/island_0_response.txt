## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to separate objects from the rightmost edge of the grid, effectively removing any "gaps" between them and the edge. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**  No change, as the only object is already touching the right edge.

**Input_1 - Output_1:** The two objects (one primarily consisting of '2's, the other of '1's) are shifted rightward. The '2' object moves two positions, filling the gap, while the '1' object moves one position.

**Input_2 - Output_2:** Similar to Input_1, objects are shifted rightward to eliminate gaps between them and the right edge. The '2' object moves three positions, and the '1' object moves two.


## Program Versions & Explanations:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, False, False, False), key=rightmost, reverse=True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    shift_amount = (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1)
    O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, shift_amount))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Finds all objects in the grid using `objects(I, False, False, False)`.
2. **Sort by Rightmost:** Sorts the objects based on their rightmost column (`rightmost`) in descending order to move the rightmost objects first.
3. **Iterate and Shift:** Iterates through each object:
   - Calculates the required rightward shift to move the object to the edge.
   - Uses `cover` to erase the object from its current position.
   - Uses `shift` to move the object rightward.
   - Uses `paint` to draw the shifted object onto the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)-1, -1, -1):
    column = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(height(I)))
    if len(toobject(column, I)) > 0 and index(I, (0, j)) == mostcolor(I):
      obj = extract(objects(I, False, False, False), lambda o: rightmost(o) == j)
      O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (0, 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Columns Right-to-Left:** Iterates through each column of the grid from right to left.
2. **Check for Object and Gap:** For each column, checks:
   - If the column contains any object cells.
   - If the top cell of the column is the background color (indicating a gap).
3. **Shift Object:** If both conditions are met, it finds the object in that column and shifts it one position to the right.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, False)
  gaps = frozenset((i, j) for j in range(width(I)) for i in range(height(I)) 
                   if index(I, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I) and len(toobject(hfrontier((i,j)), I)) > 1)
  while len(gaps) > 0:
    O = I
    for gap in gaps:
      i, j = gap
      if j < width(I) - 1 and index(I, (i, j + 1)) != mostcolor(I):
        obj = extract(objs, lambda o: (i, j + 1) in toindices(o))
        O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (0, 1)))
    I = O
    gaps = frozenset((i, j) for j in range(width(I)) for i in range(height(I)) 
                     if index(I, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I) and len(toobject(hfrontier((i,j)), I)) > 1)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Gaps:** Finds all objects and identifies "gaps" â€“ background cells with an adjacent object cell to the right.
2. **Iterate and Shift:**  Iterates as long as gaps exist:
   - For each gap, if there's an object to its right, it shifts the object one position rightward.
   - Re-evaluates gaps after each iteration to account for shifted objects.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted = I
  for i in range(width(I)):
    shifted = shift(asobject(shifted), (0, 1))
    shifted = paint(cover(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), asindices(I)), shifted)
  return shifted
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Shift and Paint:** Iteratively shifts all objects one position to the right and repaints them onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, False):
    if rightmost(obj) < width(I) - 1:
      O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (0, width(I) - 1 - rightmost(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects with Gaps:** Finds all objects and checks if their rightmost point is less than the grid's right edge (indicating a gap).
2. **Shift to Edge:** If a gap exists, the object is shifted to align its rightmost point with the grid's right edge.
