## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves identifying objects (connected regions of non-background color) and shifting them to the right until their rightmost point aligns with the right edge of the grid. 

**Input_0:** The object is already aligned to the right, so the output is identical to the input.

**Input_1:** The objects are shifted to the right until their rightmost points touch the right edge of the grid. Notice how the background color (0) fills the spaces left by the shifted objects.

**Input_2:** Similar to Input_1, the objects are right-aligned, with the background color filling the newly empty spaces.


## Program Version 1

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  shifted_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    rightmost_col = rightmost(obj)
    shift_amount = len(I[0]) - rightmost_col - 1
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, (0, shift_amount))
    shifted_objs = shifted_objs | {shifted_obj}
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), shifted_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` finds all connected components (objects) within the input grid `I`.
2. **Calculate Shift Amount:** For each object `obj`, `rightmost(obj)` finds the rightmost column index. The difference between the grid width (`len(I[0])`) and this value (minus 1 to account for zero-based indexing) gives the required shift amount.
3. **Shift Objects:** `shift(obj, (0, shift_amount))` moves each object to the right by the calculated amount.
4. **Paint Objects onto a Blank Canvas:** A new canvas of the same size and background color as the input grid is created using `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`. The shifted objects are then painted onto this canvas using `paint`. 

## Program Version 2

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      v if j >= len(r) - max(rightmost(obj) for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)) - 1 else mostcolor(I)
      for j, v in enumerate(r)
    )
    for i, r in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Maximum Rightmost Column:** `max(rightmost(obj) for obj in objects(I, True, False, True))` determines the rightmost column index among all objects in the grid.
2. **Conditional Filling:** The code iterates through each cell of the input grid. If the cell's column index (`j`) is greater than or equal to the calculated threshold (`len(r) - max_rightmost_col - 1`), the original cell value is kept. Otherwise, the cell is filled with the background color (`mostcolor(I)`). This effectively shifts all objects to the right edge.

## Program Version 3

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, len(I[0]) - rightmost(obj) - 1)), objs)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), shifted_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions, objects are identified using `objects(I, True, False, True)`.
2. **Calculate and Apply Shift:** `mapply` applies a lambda function to each object in `objs`. The lambda function calculates the shift amount (same logic as before) and uses `shift` to move the object.
3. **Paint on Canvas:**  The shifted objects are painted onto a blank canvas with the same background color and dimensions as the input grid.

## Program Version 4

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return hmirror(
    tuple(
      tuple(
        v if j < sum(1 for v in r if v != mostcolor(I)) else mostcolor(I)
        for j, v in enumerate(r)
      )
      for r in hmirror(I)
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Horizontal Mirroring:** `hmirror(I)` mirrors the input grid horizontally.
2. **Left Alignment:** The code within the nested loops now aligns the objects to the **left** edge instead of the right (similar to the logic in Program_B).
3. **Second Mirroring:** Applying `hmirror` again to the result reverses the initial mirroring, effectively aligning the objects to the **right** edge.


## Program Version 5

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  return paint(
    canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
    merge(
      apply(
        lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, len(I[0]) - rightmost(obj) - 1)),
        objs
      )
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Uses `objects` to identify objects within the input grid.
2. **Calculate Shift and Shift Objects:** `apply` applies a lambda function (which calculates the shift amount and shifts the object) to each object in `objs`.
3. **Merge Shifted Objects:** `merge` combines the shifted objects into a single set of cells.
4. **Paint on Canvas:**  Paints the merged, shifted objects onto a blank canvas.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same grid transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL. Each version leverages a distinct combination of functions and logic, highlighting the diverse solutions possible within this framework.
