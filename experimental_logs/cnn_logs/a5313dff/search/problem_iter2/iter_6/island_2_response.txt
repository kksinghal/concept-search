## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation shifts each object to the right, pushing it against the right edge of the grid or the next object. The background color (most common color) fills the space left by the objects. 

**Input 0:** The single object is already against the right edge, so no change.

**Input 1:**  Each object is shifted to the right until it hits the edge or another object. Notice how the object shapes are preserved.

**Input 2:** Similar to Input 1, objects are right-aligned, showcasing the consistent nature of the transformation.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create a canvas filled with the background color
  for obj in sorted(fgpartition(I), key=lambda x: uppermost(x)): # Iterate through objects from top to bottom
    w = width(obj) 
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, width(I) - w - leftmost(obj)))) # Shift object to the right edge
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Create Canvas:** `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates a grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
2.  **Iterate and Shift:** 
    *   `fgpartition(I)` separates the input into objects, excluding the background.
    *   `sorted(..., key=lambda x: uppermost(x))` processes objects from top to bottom.
    *   For each `obj`: 
        *   `shift(obj, (0, width(I) - w - leftmost(obj)))` calculates the shift to align the object to the right edge and moves it accordingly.
3.  **Paint and Return:** `paint(O, ...)` paints the shifted object onto the canvas. Finally, the canvas (`O`) is returned.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I # Start with the input grid
  for obj in sorted(fgpartition(I), key=lambda x: leftmost(x), reverse=True): # Iterate objects from right to left
    w = width(obj)
    O = cover(O, obj) # Remove the object from its current position
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, width(I) - w - leftmost(obj)))) # Shift and repaint the object
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Iterate from Right to Left:** 
    *   `sorted(fgpartition(I), key=lambda x: leftmost(x), reverse=True)` processes objects from right to left.
2.  **Cover, Shift, and Repaint:** For each object, it's first removed from the grid using `cover`. Then, the object is shifted to the rightmost position and repainted using `paint`.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  shifted_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    right_limit = width(I)
    for other_obj in objs - {obj}:
      if hmatching(obj, other_obj) and leftmost(other_obj) > rightmost(obj) and leftmost(other_obj) < right_limit:
        right_limit = leftmost(other_obj)
    shifted_objs = insert(shift(obj, (0, right_limit - width(obj) - leftmost(obj))), shifted_objs)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), shifted_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Find Objects and Right Limits:** It iterates through each object and determines its rightmost position by considering other objects on the same row.
2.  **Shift and Paint:**  Objects are then shifted to their calculated positions and painted onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    row = tuple(v for v in I[i])
    non_zeros = tuple(v for v in row if v != mostcommon(row))
    new_row = (mostcommon(row),) * (len(row) - len(non_zeros)) + non_zeros 
    O = paint(O, toobject(crop(canvas(0, (1, len(new_row))), (0, 0), (1, len(new_row))), new_row), I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Iterate by Row:** It iterates through each row of the input grid.
2.  **Extract and Reposition Non-Background Values:** For each row, it extracts the values that are not the background color and creates a new row with these values right-aligned.
3.  **Paint New Row:**  The new row is then painted onto the output grid.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    j = width(I) - 1
    while j >= 0:
      if row[j] != mostcolor(I):
        O = paint(O, {(row[j], (i, j))})
        j -= 1
        while j >= 0 and row[j] != mostcolor(I):
          j -= 1 
      else:
        j -= 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Iterate from Right to Left:** It uses nested loops to iterate through the grid from right to left within each row. 
2.  **Paint Non-Background Cells:** It identifies and paints non-background cells directly onto a canvas initialized with the background color. 


These are just five possible solutions, and many other valid programs could achieve the same transformation. Each version uses a different combination of DSL functions, offering varying levels of efficiency and readability.
