## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation removes the rightmost object of the color '1' from each row of the input grid. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:** 
The input grid has no '1's, so the output remains identical.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**
- Row 0: The rightmost '1' is removed, shifting the '2' to the left.
- Row 2: The rightmost '1' is removed.
- Row 4, 5, 6:  The rightmost '1' is removed, shifting the '2' to the left.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**
- Row 1, 3, 5: The rightmost '1' is removed, shifting the '2' to the left.
- Row 9:  The rightmost '1' is removed.
- Row 10, 11: The rightmost '1' is removed, shifting the '2' to the left.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct programs to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)  # Get all objects
  one_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1)  # Filter for objects of color 1
  rightmost_one_objs = {argmax(sfilter(one_objs, lambda obj: uppermost(obj) == i), lambda obj: rightmost(obj)) for i in range(height(I))} - {None}  # Find the rightmost object in each row
  indices_to_remove = merge(apply(toindices, rightmost_one_objs))  # Get indices of cells to remove
  O = fill(I, 0, indices_to_remove)  # Fill the cells with 0
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** We use `objects` to obtain all connected objects in the grid.
2. **Filter by color:**  We use `colorfilter` to select only objects with color '1'.
3. **Find rightmost objects:**  For each row, we find the rightmost object of color '1' by using `argmax` with a custom function that prioritizes objects based on their rightmost column index (`rightmost`).
4. **Get cell indices:** We extract the indices of all cells within these rightmost objects using `toindices` and merge them using `merge`.
5. **Fill with background:** Finally, we use `fill` to replace the values at the identified indices with '0', effectively removing the rightmost '1' objects from each row.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):  # Iterate through rows
    row_objs = sfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: uppermost(obj) == i and 1 in palette(obj)) # Get objects in the current row that contain 1
    if row_objs:  # Check if there are any objects with 1 in the current row
      rightmost_obj = argmax(row_objs, lambda obj: rightmost(obj))  # Find the rightmost object
      O = fill(O, 0, toindices(rightmost_obj))  # Remove the rightmost object by filling with 0
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** The program iterates through each row of the grid.
2. **Filter objects in each row:** For each row, it identifies objects that contain the color '1' using `sfilter`, `palette` and `uppermost`.
3. **Find and remove rightmost object:** If any such objects exist, it finds the rightmost one using `argmax` and `rightmost` and removes it by filling its indices with '0' using `fill`.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = tuple(
    tuple(0 if v == 1 and (i, j) == max(((i, j) for j, v in enumerate(r) if v == 1), default=(None, None)) else v for j, v in enumerate(r)) 
    for i, r in enumerate(I)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Nested loops:** This version uses nested loops to iterate over each cell in the grid.
2. **Conditional replacement:** For each cell, it checks if the value is '1' and if it is the rightmost occurrence of '1' in that row. If both conditions are met, the cell is replaced with a '0'. Otherwise, the original value is kept.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = tuple(
        tuple(
            branch(
                both(v == 1, j == rightmost(sfilter(asindices(r), lambda x: index(I, x) == 1))),
                0,
                v
            )
            for j, v in enumerate(r)
        )
        for i, r in enumerate(I)
    )
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** It iterates over each cell and checks if the cell value is 1 and if the column index is equal to the rightmost column index of any cell with value 1 in that row.
2. **Branch for Replacement:**  If both conditions are met, it replaces the cell value with 0 using the `branch` function; otherwise, it retains the original cell value.


**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 1):
    rightmost_loc = argmax(toindices(obj), lambda x: x[1])
    if rightmost_loc:
      O = fill(O, 0, {rightmost_loc})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through '1' objects:** This program directly iterates through objects of color '1' obtained using `colorfilter` and `objects`.
2. **Find and remove rightmost cell:** For each object, it finds the rightmost cell using `argmax` on its indices and removes it by filling it with '0' using `fill`. 

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
