## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be pushing all non-background objects to the right side of the grid while maintaining their relative vertical positions. Here's a breakdown for each example:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** 
- No change as the single object is already at the rightmost position.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- The two objects (formed by '1's and '2's) are moved to the right. 
- The '2' object, being the rightmost one originally, dictates the final position of both.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
- Similar to Input_1, objects are shifted right.
- Notice the object with value '1' at the bottom is also shifted right, leaving a trail of the background color.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I) 
  shifted_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    max_j = width(I) - 1
    for other_obj in objs:
      if hmatching(obj, other_obj):
        max_j = max(max_j, rightmost(other_obj))
    shifted_objs = insert(shift(obj, (0, max_j - rightmost(obj))), shifted_objs)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), shifted_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:**  Divides the grid into objects based on color, excluding the background.
2. **`shifted_objs = frozenset()`:** Initializes an empty set to store shifted objects.
3. **Looping through objects:** Iterates through each object in `objs`.
4. **Finding the rightmost position:** 
    -  `max_j` is initialized to the grid's right edge.
    -  For each object, it checks for horizontal overlap with other objects. 
    -  If they overlap,  `max_j` is updated to the rightmost position of the overlapping objects.
5. **Shifting the object:** Calculates the shift amount to align the object's right edge with `max_j` and shifts the object accordingly.
6. **Painting the shifted object:** The shifted object is painted onto a blank canvas of the original grid's size and filled with the background color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)-1, -1, -1):
    column = tuple(I[i][j] for i in range(height(I)))
    if any(c != mostcolor(I) for c in column):
      O = paint(O, shift(toobject(crop(I, (0, j), (height(I), 1))), (0, width(O) - j - 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates a blank canvas with the background color.
2. **Iterating through columns (right to left):** Loops through each column of the input grid from right to left.
3. **Checking for non-background colors:** If the column contains any color other than the background, it's considered an object column.
4. **Extracting and shifting the object column:** The object column is extracted, converted to an object, and shifted to the rightmost available position on the canvas.
5. **Painting onto the canvas:** The shifted object column is painted onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = sorted(fgpartition(I), key=lambda obj: leftmost(obj))
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  current_j = width(I)
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, current_j - width(obj) - leftmost(obj))))
    current_j = min(current_j - width(obj), leftmost(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = sorted(fgpartition(I), key=lambda obj: leftmost(obj))`:** Extracts objects and sorts them based on their leftmost column position.
2. **`O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates a blank canvas with the background color.
3. **`current_j = width(I)`:** Initializes the starting position for painting objects on the canvas.
4. **Iterating through sorted objects:** 
   - For each object:
     -  Calculates the shift amount to place the object's right edge at `current_j`.
     -  Paints the shifted object onto the canvas.
     -  Updates `current_j` to the new rightmost position available for the next object.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(shift(obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1)) for obj in objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:**  Divides the grid into objects based on color, excluding the background.
2. **Shifting each object:**  
   -  `shift(obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1))`: Calculates the shift amount to align each object's right edge with the grid's right edge and shifts the object accordingly.
3. **Merging shifted objects:** 
   - `merge(...)`: Combines all the shifted objects into a single set.
4. **Painting the merged objects:**
   -  `paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), ...)`: Paints the merged set of objects onto a blank canvas of the original grid's size and filled with the background color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def shift_right(obj):
    return shift(obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), mapply(shift_right, fgpartition(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def shift_right(obj): ...`:** Defines a helper function `shift_right` to shift an object to the right edge of the grid.
2. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Divides the grid into objects based on color, excluding the background.
3. **`mapply(shift_right, ...)`:** Applies the `shift_right` function to each object in the `objs` set and merges the results.
4. **`paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), ...)`:** Paints the merged set of shifted objects onto a blank canvas.

These five programs showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation. You can choose the one that seems most intuitive or efficient for your needs. Remember that these are just a starting point, and further optimization might be possible depending on the specific constraints and context of your task.
