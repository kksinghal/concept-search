## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation removes the rightmost object of each color, where "object" is defined as a contiguous group of cells with the same value. 

**Input_0:** The rightmost object of color '1' and the rightmost object of color '2' are removed.

**Input_1:** The rightmost objects of colors '1' and '2' are removed.

**Input_2:** The rightmost objects of colors '1' and '2' are removed.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  rightmost_objs = apply(lambda v: argmax(colorfilter(objs, v), lambda obj: rightmost(obj)), palette(I))
  return paint(cover(I, merge(apply(toindices, rightmost_objs))), merge(rightmost_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all contiguous objects in the grid.
2. **Find Rightmost Objects:** For each color in the palette, it finds the object with the highest `rightmost` index using `argmax`.
3. **Remove and Repaint:** It covers the `rightmost_objs` with the background color using `cover` and then repaints them using `paint` to ensure correct color representation.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: toobject(difference(toindices(obj), {lrcorner(obj)}), I), objects(I, T, T, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Remove Rightmost Cell:** For each object, it finds the lower-right corner using `lrcorner` and removes it from the object's indices.
3. **Repaint:** It uses `toobject` to get the object with the rightmost cell removed and repaints it onto the original grid. This effectively removes the rightmost cells of each object. 

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    new_obj = frozenset((color(obj), index) for index in difference(toindices(obj), {lrcorner(obj)}))
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, new_obj)
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Blank Canvas:** A new grid filled with the background color is created using `canvas`.
2. **Iterate and Modify Objects:**  It iterates through each object, removes the rightmost cell (lower right corner) and paints the modified object onto the new grid.
3. **Return Modified Grid:** The new grid with the rightmost cells of each object removed is returned.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  modified_objs = set()
  for value in palette(I):
    filtered_objs = colorfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), value)
    if filtered_objs:
      rightmost_obj = argmax(filtered_objs, lambda obj: rightmost(obj))
      modified_objs.update(frozenset(obj for obj in filtered_objs if obj != rightmost_obj))
    else:
      modified_objs.update(filtered_objs)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(modified_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize & Filter:**  A set `modified_objs` is initialized. It iterates through each color in the palette and filters objects of that color.
2. **Identify & Remove Rightmost:** If objects of the current color exist, the rightmost object is identified and removed. Remaining objects are added to `modified_objs`.
3. **Paint to Canvas:** The remaining objects in `modified_objs` are painted onto a new canvas filled with the background color, effectively removing the rightmost objects of each color.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  def remove_rightmost_cell(obj):
    return toobject(difference(toindices(obj), {lrcorner(obj)}), I)

  return paint(I, merge(apply(remove_rightmost_cell, objects(I, T, T, T)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Helper Function:** A helper function `remove_rightmost_cell` is defined to encapsulate the logic of removing the rightmost cell from an object.
2. **Apply and Repaint:**  The `remove_rightmost_cell` function is applied to all objects in the grid using `apply`. The resulting modified objects are then merged and repainted onto the original grid.
