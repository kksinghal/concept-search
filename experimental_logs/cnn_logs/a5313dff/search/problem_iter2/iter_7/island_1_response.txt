## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation shifts each object (defined as connected components of the same digit) to the right, aligning its rightmost edge with the right edge of the grid. 

**Input_0:** The object is already aligned to the right, so no change.

**Input_1:** Each object (digits 1 and 2) is shifted right to align with the grid's right edge.

**Input_2:** Similar to Input_1, each object is shifted right to align with the grid's right edge.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  shifted_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    rightmost_col = rightmost(obj)
    shift_amount = width(I) - rightmost_col - 1
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, (0, shift_amount))
    shifted_objs = shifted_objs | {shifted_obj}
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), shifted_objs) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies connected components of the same digit (objects) excluding the background.
2. **Calculate Shift:** For each object, `rightmost(obj)` finds the rightmost column index. `shift_amount` calculates the required shift to align the object's right edge with the grid's right edge.
3. **Shift Objects:**  `shift(obj, (0, shift_amount))` shifts the object horizontally.
4. **Create Shifted Set:** Shifted objects are added to `shifted_objs`.
5. **Paint to Canvas:** A blank canvas is created with the background color using `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`. Shifted objects are painted onto this canvas using `paint`.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
               frozenset(shift(obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1)) 
                         for obj in objs))
```

**Explanation:**

This version condenses the logic into a single line using a set comprehension. It directly calculates the shift amount within the `shift` function and paints the shifted objects to the canvas.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), 
                 mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1)), 
                       objects(I, True, False, True)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses `mapply` to apply the shifting logic to each object extracted from the input grid. It then paints the resulting set of shifted objects onto a blank canvas. 


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
                 frozenset(toobject(shift(toindices(obj), (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1)), I) 
                           for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version first converts objects to indices using `toindices`, then shifts these indices, and finally converts them back to objects using `toobject` before painting them onto the canvas.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1)))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version iteratively paints each shifted object onto a new grid initialized with the background color. This approach avoids creating a separate set for shifted objects.
