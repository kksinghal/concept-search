## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves shifting all objects (groups of connected non-zero digits) to the left of the grid, removing any empty columns that result from the shift. Objects retain their shape, size, and color during the transformation.

**Input 0:** No change is observed as the single object is already located at the leftmost position.

**Input 1:**  The central object is shifted to the leftmost position, eliminating the empty columns on its left.

**Input 2:** Similar to Input 1, all objects are shifted leftwards until they touch the left edge of the grid. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  shifted_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, -leftmost(obj))), objs)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(shifted_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We use `objects(I, T, T, T)` to identify all connected components (objects) in the grid `I`.
2. **Calculate Shift:** For each object `obj`, we determine the shift amount by using `-leftmost(obj)`, essentially measuring the distance from the left edge.
3. **Shift Objects:** We use `shift(obj, (0, -leftmost(obj)))` to shift each object leftwards by the calculated amount. 
4. **Paint on Canvas:**  A new canvas of the same size as the input grid is created using `canvas(0, shape(I))`, filled with zeros. Then, all shifted objects are painted onto this canvas using `paint` and `merge`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return rot270(compress(rot90(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Rotate Grid:** We first rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise using `rot90(I)`, bringing the objects to the top.
2. **Compress:** Using `compress`, we remove all empty rows from the top of the rotated grid.
3. **Rotate Back:** Finally, we rotate the grid back to its original orientation using `rot270`, resulting in the desired left-aligned output.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  min_left = min(leftmost(obj) for obj in objects(I, T, T, T))
  return crop(I, (0, min_left), (height(I), width(I) - min_left))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Minimum Left:** We determine the minimum leftmost position among all objects using `min(leftmost(obj) for obj in objects(I, T, T, T))`.
2. **Crop Grid:** We use `crop` to directly extract a subgrid starting from the `(0, min_left)` coordinate and extending to the right edge of the original grid, effectively removing the empty columns.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(0, (height(I), sum(1 for col in zip(*I) if any(col)))), merge(objects(I, T, T, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate New Width:** We first calculate the new width of the grid after compression by counting the number of non-empty columns using `sum(1 for col in zip(*I) if any(col))`.
2. **Create Canvas:** A new canvas with the calculated width and the original height is created using `canvas`.
3. **Paint Objects:** All objects from the original grid are directly painted onto the new canvas, as their relative positions remain unchanged.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(v for v in r if v != 0) + tuple(0 for _ in range(len(r) - len(tuple(v for v in r if v != 0)))) for r in I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes list comprehension to achieve the transformation without explicitly using DSL functions related to objects:

1. **Iterate through Rows:** The code iterates through each row `r` in the input grid `I`.
2. **Filter Non-Zero Values:** For each row, it creates a new tuple containing only the non-zero values `(v for v in r if v != 0)`.
3. **Append Zeros:** It then appends zeros to the new tuple to match the original row length. 
4. **Construct New Grid:** This process is repeated for all rows, generating the final compressed grid.

These five versions showcase distinct approaches to solve the same transformation task, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
