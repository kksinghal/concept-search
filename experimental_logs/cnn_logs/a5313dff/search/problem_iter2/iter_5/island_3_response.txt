## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation removes the object of color "1" from the grid and shifts all other objects one cell to the left. 

**Input 0:** The object "1" is removed. All other cells remain in the same position.

**Input 1:** The object "1" is removed. The remaining objects ("2") are shifted one cell to the left.

**Input 2:**  The object "1" is removed. The remaining objects ("2") are shifted one cell to the left.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  This version identifies the object with color 1, removes it, and then shifts all objects left.
  """
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  target_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  shifted_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (-1, 0)) if obj != target_obj else frozenset() for obj in objs)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), shifted_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, True, False, False)` identifies all connected objects in the grid.
2. **Find target object:** `extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)` finds the object with color "1".
3. **Shift objects:** `shifted_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (-1, 0)) if obj != target_obj else frozenset() for obj in objs)` shifts all objects except the target object one cell to the left. The target object is replaced with an empty set.
4. **Paint to canvas:**  `O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), shifted_objs)` creates a new canvas filled with the background color and paints the shifted objects onto it.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  This version iterates through the grid and shifts cells left if they are not color 1.
  """
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w - 1, 0, -1):
      if I[i][j] != 1:
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j - 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create canvas:** `O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))` creates a canvas filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate and shift:** The code iterates through the grid from right to left. If a cell is not color "1", it paints the cell's value one position to the left on the output canvas.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  This version uses replace to change color 1 to background and then shifts the grid.
  """
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  I = replace(I, 1, bg)
  shifted_grid = tuple(tuple(row[1:]) + (bg,) for row in I)
  return shifted_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Replace target color:** `I = replace(I, 1, bg)` replaces all instances of color "1" with the background color.
2. **Shift grid:** `shifted_grid = tuple(tuple(row[1:]) + (bg,) for row in I)` shifts each row of the grid one cell to the left, filling the last position with the background color.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  This version uses map and lambda functions to achieve the transformation.
  """
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  shifted_grid = tuple(map(lambda row: tuple(x for x in row[1:] if x != 1) + (bg,), I))
  return shifted_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get background:** `bg = mostcolor(I)` stores the background color.
2. **Shift and filter:** `shifted_grid = tuple(map(lambda row: tuple(x for x in row[1:] if x != 1) + (bg,), I))` uses a lambda function to process each row. It takes all elements from the second position onwards, filtering out any "1" values, and adds the background color at the end. 

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  This version uses functional programming techniques to compose the transformation.
  """
  remove_one = rbind(remove, 1)
  shift_left = rbind(add, (-1, 0))
  transform = compose(lambda objs: paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), objs), 
                       compose(lambda objs: frozenset(shift_left(obj) for obj in objs if color(obj) != 1), 
                               compose(remove_one, objects)))
  return transform(I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define helper functions:** `remove_one` and `shift_left` are defined as partially applied functions for removing "1" and shifting left, respectively.
2. **Compose transformation:** `transform` combines the individual steps of:
   -  `objects`: Identifying objects.
   -  `remove_one`: Removing the object with color 1.
   -  `shift_left`: Shifting the remaining objects.
   -  `paint`: Painting the shifted objects onto a new canvas.
3. **Apply transformation:** `transform(I)` applies the composed transformation to the input grid.

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and expressive power of the DSL.
