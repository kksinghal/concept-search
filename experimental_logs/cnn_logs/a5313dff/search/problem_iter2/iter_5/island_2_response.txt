## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation removes the rightmost "object" from each row, where an "object" is defined as a contiguous sequence of non-zero digits.

**Input_0:** The rightmost 2 in each row is removed.

**Input_1:** The isolated '1's and rightmost '2's are removed from each row.

**Input_2:**  The rightmost "block" of connected 1s and 2s is removed from each row. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    obj_start = None
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i,j)) != 0 and obj_start is None:
        obj_start = j
      elif index(I, (i,j)) == 0 and obj_start is not None:
        O = paint(O, toobject(crop(I, (i, obj_start), (1, j - obj_start)), I))
        obj_start = None
    if obj_start is not None:
      O = paint(O, toobject(crop(I, (i, obj_start), (1, width(I) - obj_start)), I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialize Output:** Creates an empty canvas 'O' with the same dimensions as the input 'I'.
2. **Iterate Rows:** Loops through each row 'i' of the input grid.
3. **Find Objects:**  Identifies contiguous sequences of non-zero values in each row and paints them to the output grid 'O', excluding the rightmost object.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)-1, -1, -1):
      if index(I,(i,j)) != 0:
        O = paint(O, recolor(0, {(i,j)}))
        break 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialize Output:** Starts with the output 'O' as a copy of the input grid 'I'.
2. **Reverse Iteration:**  Iterates through each row from right to left.
3. **Find and Remove:** Upon encountering the first non-zero value (rightmost object), it recolors that cell to 0, effectively removing the rightmost object.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True):
    rightmost_cell = argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1])
    O = paint(O, recolor(0, {rightmost_cell[1]}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Uses the 'objects' function to identify all contiguous objects in the grid.
2. **Find Rightmost Cell:** For each object, it finds the cell with the highest column index (rightmost cell).
3. **Remove Cell:** Recolors the rightmost cell of each object to 0, effectively removing the rightmost part of each object.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    j = width(I) - 1
    while j >= 0 and index(I, (i, j)) == 0:
      j -= 1
    if j >= 0:
      O = paint(O, recolor(0, {(i, j)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate Rows:** Iterates through rows of the grid.
2. **Find Rightmost Non-Zero:** For each row, finds the rightmost non-zero cell.
3. **Remove Cell:**  Recolors the identified non-zero cell to 0, removing the rightmost part of the object.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(0 if k == len(r) - 1 and v != 0 else v for k, v in enumerate(r)) for r in I) 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **One-liner:** Uses a concise list comprehension to modify the input grid.
2. **Conditional Removal:**  For each row, it checks if the current element is the last element (k == len(r) - 1) and if it's non-zero. If both conditions are true, it replaces the element with 0; otherwise, keeps the original element. This effectively removes the rightmost non-zero element from each row.
