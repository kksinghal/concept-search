## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to remove any "protrusions" from the right side of objects in the grid. An object is considered to have a protrusion if it extends further to the right than any other cell with the same color in its row. 

**Input 0:** No change is required as there are no protrusions.

**Input 1:** The rightmost column of the main object (color 2) is removed, as is the rightmost cell of the object in the top row (color 1).

**Input 2:**  The rightmost column of the main object (color 2), and the rightmost columns of the small objects (color 1) are removed.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, False)
  for obj in objs:
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
      row_indices = {(i,j) for j in range(len(row)) if (i,j) in toindices(obj)}
      if row_indices:
        max_j = rightmost(row_indices)
        I = fill(I, mostcolor(I), {(i, max_j)})
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, False, False, False)` identifies all distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate through Objects and Rows:** The program iterates through each object and each row of the grid.
3. **Find Rightmost Cell in Row:** For each row intersecting an object, it determines the rightmost cell belonging to that object.
4. **Remove Protrusion:** The rightmost cell is filled with the background color (`mostcolor(I)`) to effectively remove the protrusion.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j in range(len(row)-1, 0, -1):
      if row[j] != mostcolor(I) and row[j-1] != row[j]:
        O = fill(O, mostcolor(O), {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Rows and Cells:** The program iterates through each row and cell of the grid from right to left.
2. **Identify Protrusions:** It checks if a cell is not background color and differs from its left neighbor. This identifies a potential protrusion.
3. **Remove Protrusion:** If identified as a protrusion, the cell is filled with the background color to remove it.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, False):
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      left_j = max({k for k in range(j) if (i,k) in toindices(obj)}, default=j)
      if j == left_j:
        O = paint(O, {(color(obj),(i,j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:**  `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates a blank grid filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate through Objects and Cells:**  The code iterates through each object and its constituent cells.
3. **Find Leftmost Cell in Row:** For every cell, it finds the leftmost cell with the same color in that row.
4. **Rebuild Object Without Protrusions:** If a cell is the leftmost of its color in its row, it's painted onto the canvas, effectively reconstructing the object without protrusions.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    rightmost_color = {v: max([j for j in range(width(I)) if I[i][j] == v] or [-1]) for v in set(I[i])}
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if j > rightmost_color[I[i][j]]:
        O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Precalculate Rightmost Positions:** For each row, it calculates the rightmost position of each color.
2. **Iterate and Remove Protrusions:**  It iterates through the grid, and if a cell is located beyond the precalculated rightmost position for its color, it's filled with the background color. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, False)
  for obj in objs:
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      if j > max({k for k in range(width(I)) if (i,k) in toindices(obj) and k <= j}):
        I = fill(I, mostcolor(I), {(i,j)})
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to other versions, it first identifies all distinct objects.
2. **Iterate and Compare:** For each cell within an object, it checks if its column index ('j') is greater than the maximum column index of any cell with the same color in the same row to its left.
3. **Remove Protrusion:** If the condition is met, the cell represents a protrusion and is filled with the background color.
