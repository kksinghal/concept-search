## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific objects based on their unique color and moving them to the right edge of the grid. The objects retain their shape and orientation during the move. The background color fills the space vacated by the objects. Let's break down each example:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 
No transformation is needed as the object with unique color (1) is already at the right edge.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
The object with unique color (1) is moved to the right edge. The space it occupied is filled with the background color (0). 

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
Two objects with unique colors (1 and then 1 again) are moved to the right edge, each filling the space next to the previous object.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**
```python
def solve_25d487eb(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Get unique color objects
  target = (0, width(I)-1) # Define the target location on the right edge
  for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(objs, key=lambda obj: -uppermost(obj))):
    shift_amount = subtract(target, urcorner(obj))  # Calculate shift amount
    I = paint(cover(I, obj), shift(obj, shift_amount))  # Move the object
    target = (target[0] + height(obj), target[1]) # Update target for next object
  return I
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Identify unique objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` finds objects with a single color, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate and move:** The code iterates through each object, calculates the required shift to the right edge, and then moves the object using `paint` and `cover`.
3. **Dynamic target:**  The target location is updated after each object move to ensure the next object is placed correctly. 

**Program Version 2:**
```python
def solve_25d487eb(I):
    for v in palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}: # Loop through unique colors
        obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda o: color(o) == v) # Get object with color v
        shift_amount = (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1) # Calculate rightward shift
        I = paint(cover(I, obj), shift(obj, shift_amount))  # Move object to the right edge
    return I
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through colors:** It iterates through each unique color in the grid (excluding background).
2. **Extract object:**  `extract` finds the object with the current color.
3. **Calculate and move:** Similar to Version 1, it calculates the shift amount and moves the object to the right edge.

**Program Version 3:**
```python
def solve_25d487eb(I):
  O = I  # Create output grid copy
  for obj in sorted(objects(I, True, False, True), key=lambda obj: -uppermost(obj)): # Loop through unique objects
    w = width(obj)  # Get object width
    O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (0, width(I) - w - leftmost(obj)))) # Move and paint to output
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Output grid copy:**  It creates a copy of the input grid to store the output.
2. **Iterate and shift:** It iterates through unique objects and calculates the shift needed to position the object's right edge against the grid's right edge.
3. **Paint and cover:**  It uses `paint` and `cover` to move the object in the output grid.

**Program Version 4:**
```python
def solve_25d487eb(I):
    for value in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:  # Iterate through unique colors
        obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, value), I) # Find the object with the current color
        shift_amount = (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1) # Calculate the shift amount
        I = paint(cover(I, obj), shift(obj, shift_amount)) # Move the object to the right edge
    return I
```
**Explanation:** 
This version is similar to Version 2 but uses `toobject` and `ofcolor` to identify the object instead of `extract`.

**Program Version 5:**
```python
def solve_25d487eb(I):
    moved_objs = []
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
        moved_objs.append(shift(obj, (0, width(I)-rightmost(obj)-1)))
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(moved_objs))
```
**Explanation:** 
1. **Calculate new positions:** It iterates through the objects, calculates their new positions on the right edge, and stores the shifted objects.
2. **Create blank canvas:**  It creates a blank canvas filled with the background color.
3. **Paint and return:**  It paints all the shifted objects onto the blank canvas and returns the result.

These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformation using the provided DSL. Each version uses a different combination of functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL and the possibility for multiple solutions.
