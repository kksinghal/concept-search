## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation shifts all non-background objects to the right edge of the grid, maintaining their original vertical positions and relative horizontal spacing. 

**Input_0:** The single non-background object (the '1' and '2' shape) is shifted to the right edge.

**Input_1:** Each of the non-background objects is independently shifted right until it touches the right edge.

**Input_2:**  Similar to Input_1, all non-background objects are aligned with the right edge.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  shifted_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    rightmost_col = rightmost(toindices(obj))
    shift_amount = len(I[0]) - 1 - rightmost_col
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, (0, shift_amount))
    shifted_objs = shifted_objs | {shifted_obj}
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), shifted_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies all non-background objects in the grid.
2. **Calculate Shift:** For each object, calculate the required horizontal shift to align its right edge with the grid's right edge.
3. **Shift Object:** Shift the object rightward by the calculated amount.
4. **Combine Shifted Objects:**  Create a new set containing all the shifted objects.
5. **Paint on Canvas:**  Paint the shifted objects onto a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input grid.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(0 if j < len(r) - sum(1 for v in r if v != mostcolor(I)) else v for j, v in enumerate(r))
      for i, r in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly manipulates the grid rows instead of working with objects:

1. **Iterate through Rows:** Iterate through each row of the input grid.
2. **Calculate Shift:** For each row, determine the number of non-background cells. This number determines the starting column for non-background cells in the output.
3. **Shift Row:** Fill the beginning of each row with the background color up to the calculated starting column. Then, copy the remaining cells from the input row.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
      frozenset({(v, (i, len(I[0]) - 1 - j)) for obj in objs for v, (i, j) in normalize(obj)})
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version normalizes each object to the origin before shifting:

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies all non-background objects.
2. **Normalize and Shift:** For each object:
   - `normalize(obj)` shifts it to the origin (top-left corner).
   - The inner list comprehension then repositions each cell of the normalized object to the right edge of the grid.
3. **Paint on Canvas:**  Paint the repositioned cells onto a blank canvas.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(v for j, v in enumerate(r) if j >= len(r) - max(len(sfilter(r, lambda x: x != mostcolor(I))) for r in I)) 
    for r in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version finds the maximum width of non-background cells across all rows and uses it for shifting:

1. **Find Max Width:** `max(len(sfilter(r, lambda x: x != mostcolor(I))) for r in I)` finds the maximum number of consecutive non-background cells in any row.
2. **Shift Rows:** For each row, determine the starting column by subtracting the maximum width from the row length.  Fill the row with the background color up to the starting column, then copy the remaining cells. 

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  w = len(I[0])
  return tuple(
    tuple(branch(any(v != mostcolor(I) for v in r), v, mostcolor(I)) for j in range(w - sum(1 for v in r if v != mostcolor(I)))) +
    tuple(v for v in r if v != mostcolor(I))
    for r in I
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through rows and reconstructs them by first adding background cells and then appending the non-background cells from the original row.

1. **Calculate Background Cells:** For each row, determine the number of background cells needed to fill the space before non-background cells.
2. **Reconstruct Row:** Create a new row by:
   - Adding background cells equal to the calculated number.
   - Appending the non-background cells from the original row.

These programs demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, using various combinations of DSL functions. Each version offers a unique perspective on manipulating grid data within the constraints of the DSL.
