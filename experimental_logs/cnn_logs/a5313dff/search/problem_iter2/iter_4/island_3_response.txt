## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves removing the object with the color '1' from the input grid and then shifting any remaining objects of color other than the background color one position to the left.  Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:** 

- The object with color '1' is removed.
- Since there are no other objects besides the background and the removed object, the grid remains the same.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**

- The object with color '1' is removed.
- The remaining object of color '2' is shifted one position to the left.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**

- The object with color '1' is removed.
- The remaining object of color '2' is shifted one position to the left.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  This version removes the object '1' and then shifts all other objects left.
  """
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  shifted_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (-1, 0)) if color(obj) != bg and color(obj) != 1 else obj for obj in objs)
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), shifted_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects and background:** 
    - `objs = objects(I, True, False, False)`: Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
    - `bg = mostcolor(I)`: Determines the background color.
2. **Shift non-background objects left:**
    - `shifted_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (-1, 0)) if color(obj) != bg and color(obj) != 1 else obj for obj in objs)`:  Iterates through each object, shifting it one position left only if its color is not the background color and not 1.
3. **Construct the output grid:**
    - `O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), shifted_objs)`: Creates a blank canvas with the background color and the same shape as the input, then paints the shifted objects onto it. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  This version utilizes map and filter to process objects.
  """
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  non_bg_objs = sfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) != bg and color(obj) != 1)
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (-1, 0)), non_bg_objs)
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), shifted_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background and non-background objects:**
    - Similar to version 1, we identify the background color.
    - `non_bg_objs = sfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) != bg and color(obj) != 1)`:  Filters the objects to retain only those that are not the background color and not 1.
2. **Shift objects:**
    - `shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (-1, 0)), non_bg_objs)`: Applies a left shift to each non-background object using `mapply`.
3. **Create output grid:**
    - Similar to version 1, a blank canvas is created and painted with the shifted objects.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  This version directly manipulates grid indices instead of using object representation.
  """
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(bg, (h,w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w-1):
      if I[i][j+1] != bg and I[i][j+1] != 1:
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j+1], (i,j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct grid manipulation:** This version iterates directly over the grid indices.
2. **Shifting logic:** If a cell is not the background color and not 1, its value is painted one position to the left in the output grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    """
    This version uses list comprehension for a more compact representation.
    """
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    shifted_grid = tuple(
        tuple(
            I[i][j + 1] if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] != bg and I[i][j + 1] != 1 else bg 
            for j in range(len(I[0]))
        )
        for i in range(len(I))
    )
    return shifted_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **List comprehension:** This version uses nested list comprehension to achieve the shifting logic concisely.
2. **Inline conditionals:** The conditionals for checking background color and color '1' are directly incorporated within the list comprehension.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    """
    This version utilizes hconcat and crop to achieve the shifting effect.
    """
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    trimmed_grid = crop(I, (0,1), (len(I), len(I[0])-1))
    O = hconcat(trimmed_grid, canvas(bg, (len(I), 1)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Cropping and concatenation:** This version crops the input grid to remove the rightmost column and then concatenates a column of the background color to the left side, effectively achieving the shift.


These five versions offer different approaches to the same problem, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL. Each version accomplishes the same goal of removing the object of color '1' and shifting the remaining objects leftward, but they employ distinct logic and function combinations.
