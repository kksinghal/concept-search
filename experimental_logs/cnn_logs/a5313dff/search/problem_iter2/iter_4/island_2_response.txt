## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on isolating the rightmost column of each non-background object and shifting it one position to the right.

**Input_0 to Output_0:** No change, as the rightmost columns of the objects are already at the grid's edge.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  The rightmost columns of both the "1" object and the "2" object are shifted one position to the right. 

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The rightmost columns of all three objects ("1", "2" inside, and "2" outline) are shifted one position to the right.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)  # Partition into objects without background
  shifted_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    rightmost_col = frozenset({(v, (i, rightmost(obj))) for v, (i, j) in obj}) # Identify rightmost column
    shifted_col = shift(rightmost_col, (0, 1)) # Shift right
    shifted_objs.add(obj - rightmost_col | shifted_col) # Combine original and shifted column
  O = paint(I, merge(shifted_objs)) # Paint shifted objects onto original grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Isolate Objects:**  We partition the input grid into individual objects excluding the background using `fgpartition(I)`.
2. **Find Rightmost Column:**  For each object, we identify its rightmost column using `rightmost(obj)` and create a new object containing only those cells.
3. **Shift Right:** The rightmost column object is shifted one position to the right using `shift(rightmost_col, (0, 1))`.
4. **Recombine and Paint:** The original object without its rightmost column is combined with the shifted column. This merged object is then painted onto the original grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if j == rightmost(obj):  # If cell is in the rightmost column of the object
        O = paint(O, {(index(I, (i, j)), (i, j + 1))}) # Paint the cell one position to the right
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Objects and Cells:** This version iterates through each cell of each foreground object.
2. **Rightmost Column Check:** For each cell, it checks if the cell's column index (`j`) matches the object's rightmost column index (`rightmost(obj)`).
3. **Paint Shifted Cell:** If a cell belongs to the rightmost column, its value is painted one position to the right on the grid.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    shifted_objs = mfilter(
        fgpartition(I),
        lambda obj: paint(I, shift(obj, (0, width(obj) - rightmost(obj))))  # Shift object based on its width
    )
    O = paint(I, shifted_objs)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Iteration and Shifting:** This version iterates over foreground objects and attempts to shift each object based on its width and rightmost column position.
2. **Conditional Painting:** The shifted object is conditionally painted onto the original grid if the shift operation doesn't result in an error (e.g., moving beyond the grid boundaries).

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    right_edge = maximum(set(j for _, (i, j) in obj)) # Get the rightmost column index
    O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j + (j == right_edge))) for v, (i, j) in obj}) # Conditionally shift cells right
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Rightmost Column:** This version finds the rightmost column index (`right_edge`) for each object.
2. **Conditional Shifting:** It then iterates through each cell in the object and conditionally adds 1 to the column index (`j`) if the cell belongs to the rightmost column, effectively shifting it right.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if j < width(I) - 1 and index(I, (i, j)) != 0 and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0: # Check for right edge of object
        O = paint(O, {(index(I, (i, j)), (i, j + 1))}) # Shift the cell one position to the right
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** This version iterates through every cell in the grid, checking if it's a non-background cell adjacent to the background cell on its right.
2. **Shift Right:** If a cell meets the condition, it's shifted one position to the right. This effectively moves the rightmost column of each object one step right.


These versions demonstrate a variety of approaches using different DSL functions and logic to achieve the same goal. Each version offers a unique perspective on solving the transformation task.
