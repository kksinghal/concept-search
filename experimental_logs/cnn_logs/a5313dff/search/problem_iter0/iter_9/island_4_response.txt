## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify the immediate external boundary of each object in the grid and fill those boundary cells with the value '1'. However, the filling should only occur if the boundary cell originally contains the background color (most common color).

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

**Input 0:** 
- The central '2' object expands outwards, with '1's filling the surrounding '0's.

**Input 1:**
-  Similarly, each '2' object expands to create a '1' border. Note how the '1' border is only created where the background color '0' exists.

**Input 2:**
- This input reinforces the observation, demonstrating that the transformation affects all objects regardless of their shape or position.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Create a blank canvas with the background color
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T): # Iterate over each object
    O = paint(O, obj) # Paint the object onto the canvas
    for cell in toindices(obj): # For each cell in the object
      for n in dneighbors(cell): # For each direct neighbor of the cell
        if n not in toindices(obj): # If the neighbor is not part of the object
          O = underfill(O, ONE, {n}) # Underfill the neighbor with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
2. Iterates through each object in the input.
3. Paints the current object onto the blank canvas.
4. Iterates through each cell of the object.
5. For each neighboring cell, it checks if the neighbor belongs to the object.
6. If the neighbor is not part of the object, it underfills the neighbor with '1'.
7. This process ensures that only the direct external boundary cells are filled.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I # Start with the input grid
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T): # Iterate over each object
    neighbors_to_fill = difference(mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj)), toindices(obj)) 
    O = underfill(O, ONE, neighbors_to_fill) # Underfill the identified neighbors with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. Starts with the input grid.
2. Iterates through each object.
3. Finds all the direct neighbors of all cells within the object.
4. Removes the object's cells from the neighbors set, resulting in a set of only boundary cells.
5. Underfills the identified boundary cells with '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I 
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = underfill(O, ONE, mapply(rbind(difference, toindices(obj)), apply(dneighbors, toindices(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. Similar to version 2, but utilizes function composition for conciseness.
2. 'rbind' fixes the second argument of 'difference' to the current object's indices.
3. Applies 'dneighbors' to each cell of the object and then uses the modified 'difference' to find boundary cells.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fill_indices = set()
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    for cell in toindices(obj):
      for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]: # Directly hardcode directions
        neighbor = (cell[0] + dx, cell[1] + dy)
        if neighbor not in toindices(obj):
          fill_indices.add(neighbor)
  return underfill(I, ONE, frozenset(fill_indices))
```

**Explanation:**
1. This version directly hardcodes the four directional neighbors to check for boundary cells.
2. It collects all boundary cells in a set and then performs a single 'underfill' operation at the end.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), I), ONE)
```

**Explanation:**
1. Creates a blank canvas filled with the background color and paints the input onto it. 
2. Performs a 'cellwise' comparison between the original input and the painted canvas.
3. If the cells match (meaning the cell was originally background), it keeps the original value; otherwise, it fills with '1'. 

This approach cleverly utilizes the 'cellwise' function to achieve the desired boundary filling.


These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to solve the given transformation problem using the provided DSL. Each leverages different function combinations and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressive power of the DSL.
