## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid, excluding the background (most frequent color), and drawing a "border" around them with the digit '1'. The border is created within the object's bounding box, effectively outlining the object one cell inwards from its outer edge. 

**Examples:**

* **Input_0:** The single '2' object is outlined with '1's.
* **Input_1:** Both '2' objects are outlined. Note the border follows the object's shape.
* **Input_2:**  All '2' objects are outlined, demonstrating the transformation's ability to handle multiple objects.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" achieving the desired transformation:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, mpapply(lambda a, b: (ONE, a), mfilter(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), objects(I, T, F, T)), mfilter(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts objects (connected components) from the input grid (`I`), considering only directly adjacent cells (not diagonal), and excluding the background.
2. **`mfilter(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), ...)`:** Filters the objects, keeping only those with a non-empty delta (the difference between the object's bounding box and the object itself, representing the potential border).
3. **`mpapply(lambda a, b: (ONE, a), ...)`:**  Iterates through the filtered objects and their deltas, generating a new object where each cell in the delta is assigned the value '1'.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the generated border objects onto the original input grid.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(ONE, difference(backdrop(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))), objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Extracts objects from the input grid, similar to Version 1.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: ..., ...)`:** Applies a function to each extracted object.
3. **`recolor(ONE, ...)`:** Recolors the result of the inner operation to '1'.
4. **`difference(backdrop(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))`:** Calculates the difference between the object's bounding box (`backdrop`) and the object's indices, effectively creating the border.
5. **`merge(...)`:** Merges all the border objects into a single object.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the merged border object onto the original input grid.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: toobject(sfilter(lambda loc: any(n in toindices(obj) for n in neighbors(loc)), delta(toindices(obj))), I), objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts objects, as in previous versions.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: ..., ...)`:** Applies a function to each object.
3. **`delta(toindices(obj))`:** Gets the potential border cells around the object.
4. **`sfilter(lambda loc: ..., ...)`:** Filters the border cells, keeping only those adjacent to the object itself.
5. **`toobject(..., I)`:** Converts the filtered border indices into an object, using the colors from the input grid.
6. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the border objects.
7. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the borders onto the input grid.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(ONE, frozenset((i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1) if (i == uppermost(obj) or i == lowermost(obj) or j == leftmost(obj) or j == rightmost(obj)))), objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts objects from the grid.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: ..., ...)`:** Applies a function to each object.
3. **`recolor(ONE, ...)`:** Recolors the inner result to '1'.
4. **`frozenset((i, j) for ... if ...)`:**  Generates a set of indices representing the border by iterating through the bounding box and selecting cells at the edges.
5. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the border objects.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the merged borders onto the input grid.

### Program Version 5: 

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, mfilter(lambda obj: recolor(ONE, difference(box(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))), objects(I, T, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies and extracts objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **`mfilter(lambda obj: ..., ...)`:**  Applies a function to each extracted object and merges the results. 
3. **`recolor(ONE, ...)`:** Recolors the output of the inner function to '1'.
4. **`difference(box(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))`:**  Calculates the difference between the bounding box (`box`) of the object's indices and the object itself, effectively identifying the border cells.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Overlays the generated border onto the original input grid.

## Conclusion:

These five program versions showcase different approaches to achieving the desired border-drawing transformation using the provided DSL. They demonstrate the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL, allowing for diverse solutions to the given problem.
