## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying connected components (objects) of the digit '2' in the input grid and changing the color of the cells directly adjacent to these components to '1'. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**
- The central 2x4 and 4x2 rectangles of '2's are the objects.
- The '0's directly above, below, left, and right of these rectangles are changed to '1'.

**Input_1:**
-  There are three objects: the top 1x2 rectangle, the central plus shape, and the bottom 1x2 rectangle.
- The '0's directly adjacent to these objects are changed to '1's.

**Input_2:**
- This input has multiple objects of '2's forming a pattern.
-  Again, the '0's directly adjacent to these objects are changed to '1's.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Extract connected components of any digit
  twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)  # Filter objects to get only those containing '2'
  indices = mapply(toindices, twos) # Get indices of all '2' objects
  neighbors = mapply(dneighbors, indices) # Find direct neighbors of all '2' indices
  filtered_neighbors = difference(neighbors, indices) # Exclude indices of '2' themselves
  O = fill(I, 1, filtered_neighbors)  # Fill the neighbor indices with '1'
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all connected components in the grid, regardless of the digit.
2. **Filter for '2's:** `colorfilter(objs, 2)` selects only the objects composed of the digit '2'.
3. **Get object indices:** `mapply(toindices, twos)` extracts the indices of cells belonging to the '2' objects.
4. **Find direct neighbors:** `mapply(dneighbors, indices)` determines the indices of cells directly adjacent to the '2' objects.
5. **Remove object indices:**  `difference(neighbors, indices)` filters out the indices of the '2' objects themselves, leaving only the surrounding cells.
6. **Fill with '1's:** `fill(I, 1, filtered_neighbors)` replaces the values at the filtered neighbor indices with '1' in the input grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = partition(I)  # Partition grid into objects based on same value
  twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)  # Filter for objects of '2's
  surrounding = mapply(delta, twos)  # Get indices surrounding each '2' object 
  O = fill(I, 1, surrounding)  # Fill surrounding indices with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition by value:** `partition(I)` divides the grid into objects where each object contains cells of the same value.
2. **Filter for '2' objects:** `colorfilter(objs, 2)` selects the objects composed of the digit '2'.
3. **Get surrounding indices:**  `mapply(delta, twos)` computes the indices surrounding each '2' object using the `delta` function.
4. **Fill with '1's:** `fill(I, 1, surrounding)` fills the surrounding indices with '1' in the input grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  modified = I
  for i in range(1, len(I) - 1):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == 2:  # Check for '2'
        for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]:  # Direct neighbor offsets
          if I[i+di][j+dj] == 0: # Check if neighbor is '0'
            modified = fill(modified, 1, {(i+di, j+dj)}) # Change '0' to '1'
  return modified
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through inner grid:** The code iterates through each cell of the grid, excluding the border cells.
2. **Check for '2':**  If a cell contains '2', it iterates through its direct neighbors using offsets.
3. **Modify neighbors:** If a neighbor cell contains '0', it's replaced with '1' in the `modified` grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract connected components without background
    twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)  # Filter for objects of '2's
    dilated = mapply(lambda obj: toindices(obj) | mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj)), twos) # Dilate '2' objects by one cell
    eroded = mapply(lambda obj: difference(toindices(obj), mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj))), dilated) # Erode dilated objects to get surrounding
    O = fill(I, 1, merge(eroded)) # Fill eroded indices with '1'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract foreground objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts connected components, excluding the background.
2. **Filter for '2' objects:** `colorfilter(objs, 2)` selects objects composed of '2'.
3. **Dilate objects:**  `mapply(...)` dilates each '2' object by including its direct neighbors.
4. **Erode dilated objects:**  `mapply(...)` erodes the dilated objects by removing the original object indices, leaving the surrounding cells.
5. **Fill with '1's:**  `fill(I, 1, merge(eroded))` fills the eroded indices with '1'.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    indices = ofcolor(I, 2)  # Get all indices of '2's
    shifted_up = shift(indices, (-1, 0)) 
    shifted_down = shift(indices, (1, 0))
    shifted_left = shift(indices, (0, -1))
    shifted_right = shift(indices, (0, 1))
    combined_shifts = shifted_up | shifted_down | shifted_left | shifted_right
    filtered_neighbors = difference(combined_shifts, indices) # Exclude indices of '2' themselves
    O = fill(I, 1, filtered_neighbors) # Fill the neighbor indices with '1'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get indices of '2's:**  `ofcolor(I, 2)` finds all indices of cells containing '2'.
2. **Shift indices:** The indices are shifted up, down, left, and right individually.
3. **Combine shifts:**  The shifted indices are combined into a single set.
4. **Remove original indices:** `difference(combined_shifts, indices)` removes the original indices of '2', leaving only the surrounding indices.
5. **Fill with '1's:** `fill(I, 1, filtered_neighbors)` fills the remaining indices with '1'.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformation using various DSL functions and logic. Each version highlights the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for solving spatial reasoning tasks.
