## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '2' within the input grid and then drawing a border of '1's around these objects. The border is drawn within the object's bounding box, leaving the original '2's intact. 

**Example:**

Input:

```
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0
0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0
0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0
0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0
0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 
```

Output:

```
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0
0 0 2 1 1 1 2 0
0 0 2 1 2 1 2 0
0 0 2 1 1 1 2 0
0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 
```

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Identify objects formed by 2, including diagonals, without background.
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T)
  # Filter for objects with color 2.
  x2 = colorfilter(x1, TWO)
  # Get indices of each object.
  x3 = mapply(toindices, x2)
  # Find the bounding box of each object. 
  x4 = mapply(backdrop, x3)
  # Remove the object's indices from its bounding box.
  x5 = mapply(lambda p: difference(p[0], p[1]), pair(x4, x3)) 
  # Combine all border indices.
  x6 = merge(x5)
  # Fill the border indices with 1s.
  O = fill(I, ONE, x6)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all connected components of '2's.
2. **Filter by color:** `colorfilter(x1, TWO)` isolates objects made of '2's.
3. **Extract indices:** `mapply(toindices, x2)` gets indices of each '2' object.
4. **Find bounding boxes:**  `mapply(backdrop, x3)` computes bounding boxes for each object.
5. **Calculate difference:** `mapply(lambda p: difference(p[0], p[1]), pair(x4, x3))` finds the difference between each bounding box and the corresponding object, resulting in the border indices.
6. **Merge indices:** `merge(x5)` combines all border indices.
7. **Fill with 1s:** `fill(I, ONE, x6)` fills the identified border indices with '1's.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Identify objects formed by 2, including diagonals, without background.
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T)
  # Filter for objects with color 2.
  x2 = colorfilter(x1, TWO)
  # Directly apply delta to each object and merge results.
  x3 = mapply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), x2)
  # Combine all border indices.
  x4 = merge(x3)
  # Fill the border indices with 1s.
  O = fill(I, ONE, x4)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Filter by color:** Similar to Version 1.
3. **Calculate delta directly:** `mapply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), x2)` directly applies the `delta` function to each object's indices to obtain the border indices.
4. **Merge indices:** Similar to Version 1.
5. **Fill with 1s:** Similar to Version 1.

**Program Version 3:** (Inspired by Program_A)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Partition the grid based on color, excluding background.
  x1 = fgpartition(I)
  # Select the partition corresponding to the color 2.
  x2 = extract(x1, lambda x: color(x) == TWO)
  # Get the indices of the cells within the selected partition.
  x3 = toindices(x2) 
  # Find the bounding box of the partition.
  x4 = backdrop(x3)
  # Remove the object's indices from its bounding box.
  x5 = difference(x4, x3)
  # Fill the border indices with 1.
  O = fill(I, ONE, x5) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition by color:** `fgpartition(I)` divides the grid into objects based on color, excluding background.
2. **Select target object:** `extract(x1, lambda x: color(x) == TWO)` finds the object composed of '2's.
3. **Extract object indices:** `toindices(x2)` retrieves indices of the target object.
4. **Find bounding box:** `backdrop(x3)` determines the bounding box of the object.
5. **Calculate difference:** `difference(x4, x3)` identifies the border indices by removing object indices from its bounding box.
6. **Fill with 1s:** `fill(I, ONE, x5)` fills the border indices with '1's.

**Program Version 4:** (Inspired by Program_B, but without upscaling)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find connected components, including diagonals, without background.
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T)
  # Filter for objects with color 2.
  x2 = colorfilter(x1, TWO)
  # Apply the 'delta' function to each object and merge results.
  x3 = mapply(delta, mapply(toindices, x2))
  # Fill the identified indices with 1.
  O = fill(I, ONE, x3)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Filter by color:** Similar to previous versions.
3. **Apply delta and merge:** `mapply(delta, mapply(toindices, x2))` efficiently applies the `delta` function to each object's indices and merges the results to obtain all border indices.
4. **Fill with 1s:** Similar to previous versions.

**Program Version 5:** (Using a different approach with `inbox` and `outbox`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Identify objects formed by 2, including diagonals, without background.
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T)
  # Filter for objects with color 2.
  x2 = colorfilter(x1, TWO)
  # Find the 'inbox' of each 2-colored object and merge the results.
  x3 = mapply(inbox, x2)
  # Combine all the indices from the 'inbox' operation.
  x4 = merge(x3)
  # Find the 'outbox' of each 2-colored object and merge the results.
  x5 = mapply(outbox, x2)
  # Combine all the indices from the 'outbox' operation.
  x6 = merge(x5)
  # Combine the 'inbox' and 'outbox' indices.
  x7 = combine(x4, x6)
  # Fill the combined indices with 1.
  O = fill(I, ONE, x7)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Filter by color:** Similar to previous versions.
3. **Find inboxes:** `mapply(inbox, x2)` calculates the inner border (inbox) of each object.
4. **Merge inboxes:** `merge(x3)` combines all inbox indices.
5. **Find outboxes:** `mapply(outbox, x2)` calculates the outer border (outbox) of each object.
6. **Merge outboxes:** `merge(x5)` combines all outbox indices.
7. **Combine borders:**  `combine(x4, x6)` merges inbox and outbox indices to get all border indices. 
8. **Fill with 1s:** `fill(I, ONE, x7)` fills the combined border indices with '1's.
