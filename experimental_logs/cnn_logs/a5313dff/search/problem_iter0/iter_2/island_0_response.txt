## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying cells within the input grid that are adjacent (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally) to objects comprised of the digit '2', but are not part of the '2' object themselves. These identified cells are then filled with the digit '1'.  

**Let's break it down step by step:**

1. **Identify '2' objects:** Locate all connected groups of '2' cells within the grid.
2. **Find adjacent cells:** For each '2' object, determine the cells that are directly above, below, to the left, or right of the object's boundary.
3. **Exclude object cells:** From the set of adjacent cells, remove any cells that are already part of the '2' object itself.
4. **Filter for '0' cells:** Further refine the selection to include only those adjacent cells that contain the digit '0'.
5. **Fill with '1':** Change the value of all remaining selected cells from '0' to '1'. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions that implement the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  twos_obj = extract(objects(I, False, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2) # Extract the object containing '2' cells.
  target_indices = intersection(delta(toindices(twos_obj)), ofcolor(I, 0))  # Identify '0' cells adjacent to the '2' object.
  O = fill(I, 1, target_indices) # Fill target cells with '1'.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `twos_obj = extract(objects(I, False, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)`: This line identifies the object made of '2's on the grid.
2.  `target_indices = intersection(delta(toindices(twos_obj)), ofcolor(I, 0))`:  This line finds the indices of cells that are adjacent to the '2' object and contain the value '0'.
3. `O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)`: This line fills the identified target cells with the value '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, False, False, False)
    twos_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2) 
    shifted_objs = apply(lambda d: shift(twos_obj, d), ((1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1))) # Shift '2' object in all four directions
    adjacent_cells =  mapply(toindices, shifted_objs) # Get indices of shifted objects
    target_indices = intersection(adjacent_cells, ofcolor(I, 0)) - toindices(twos_obj) # Find common '0' indices, excluding those within the '2' object
    O = fill(I, 1, target_indices) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects and '2' object:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Shift and find adjacent cells:** Shift the '2' object in all four directions (up, down, left, right) and collect the indices of cells in those shifted objects. This effectively identifies cells directly adjacent to the original '2' object.
3. **Identify target cells:** Find the intersection between the adjacent cells and the cells containing '0' ('0' cells adjacent to the '2' object). Then, subtract the indices of the original '2' object to ensure only external cells are selected.
4. **Fill with '1':** Same as version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    twos_indices = ofcolor(I, 2) # Get indices of all '2' cells
    neighboring_indices = mapply(dneighbors, twos_indices) # Get all directly neighboring indices
    target_indices = intersection(neighboring_indices, ofcolor(I, 0)) - twos_indices # Filter for '0' cells not part of the '2' object
    O = fill(I, 1, target_indices) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get '2' cell indices:**  Directly obtain the indices of all cells containing '2'.
2. **Find neighboring indices:** Calculate the directly adjacent neighbors for each '2' cell index.
3. **Identify target cells:** Similar to version 2, find the '0' cells adjacent to the '2' object by intersecting neighboring indices with indices of '0' cells and excluding original '2' cell indices.
4. **Fill with '1':** Same as version 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    twos_obj = extract(objects(I, False, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
    border = toindices(twos_obj) # Get indices of the '2' object
    target_indices = set()
    for i, j in border:
        for di, dj in ((1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)): # Iterate through adjacent directions
            new_i, new_j = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= new_i < len(I) and 0 <= new_j < len(I[0]) and I[new_i][new_j] == 0: # Check bounds and value
                target_indices.add((new_i, new_j))
    O = fill(I, 1, frozenset(target_indices))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '2' object:** Same as version 1.
2. **Iterate through border:**  Get the indices of the '2' object and iterate through each cell on the border.
3. **Check adjacent cells:** For each border cell, examine its four adjacent neighbors. If an adjacent cell is within the grid bounds and contains a '0', add its index to the target set. 
4. **Fill with '1':** Same as version 1.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I # Initialize output grid
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 0 and any(I[i+di][j+dj] == 2 for di, dj in ((1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)) if 0 <= i+di < len(I) and 0 <= j+dj < len(I[0])):
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i,j)}) # Modify output grid directly
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through grid:** Directly iterate through each cell of the input grid.
2. **Check for adjacent '2':** For each cell containing '0', check if any of its adjacent neighbors contain '2', ensuring to stay within grid bounds.
3. **Fill with '1' if condition met:** If an adjacent '2' is found, change the current cell's value to '1' directly in the output grid.

These five code versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation in the DSL. Each version leverages different function combinations and logic flow, demonstrating the flexibility and versatility of the provided DSL.
