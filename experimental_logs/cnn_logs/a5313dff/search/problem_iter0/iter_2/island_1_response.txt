## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation identifies objects formed by the digit '2' and fills the cells directly surrounding these objects with the digit '1'. The original '2' objects remain unchanged.

**Input_0:** A single '2' object exists. The transformation fills the cells directly above, below, left, and right of the object with '1's.

**Input_1:** Two '2' objects exist. The transformation applies independently to each object, filling their surrounding cells with '1's.

**Input_2:** Multiple '2' objects, some connected diagonally. Again, the transformation treats each object independently and fills its immediate surroundings with '1's, regardless of diagonal connections.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:


### Program Version 1:
**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract connected components without background
  twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)  # Filter for objects of '2's
  dilated = mapply(lambda obj: toindices(obj) | mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj)), twos)  # Dilate '2' objects by including direct neighbors
  eroded = mapply(lambda obj: difference(obj, toindices(twos)), dilated) # Remove the original object's indices from dilated set
  O = fill(I, 1, merge(eroded)) # Fill the remaining indices (surrounding cells) with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** Identify all connected components of '2's without considering the background.
2. **Filter for '2's:** Isolate objects consisting only of the digit '2'.
3. **Dilate objects:** Expand each '2' object by one cell in all directions (up, down, left, right).
4. **Erode objects:** Remove the original '2' object cells from the dilated set, leaving only the surrounding cells.
5. **Fill with '1's:**  Fill the remaining indices (representing the surrounding cells) with the digit '1'.


### Program Version 2:
**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)  # Partition the grid into objects without considering the background.
  twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)  # Select objects consisting only of the digit '2'.
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: mapply(lambda d: shift(obj, d), (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)), twos) # Generate shifted copies of each object in four directions
  surrounding = mapply(lambda obj: difference(toindices(obj), asindices(I)), shifted_objs)  # Isolate indices surrounding '2' objects
  O = fill(I, 1, merge(surrounding)) # Fill the surrounding indices with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition without background:** Divide the grid into objects based on connected components, excluding the background.
2. **Filter for '2's:** Select objects made up entirely of the digit '2'.
3. **Shift objects:** Create four copies of each '2' object, shifted one cell up, down, left, and right, respectively.
4. **Identify surrounding cells:** Find indices present in the shifted objects but not in the original grid (representing cells surrounding '2' objects).
5. **Fill with '1's:** Fill the identified surrounding cells with the digit '1'.


### Program Version 3:
**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Extract connected components, excluding the background.
  twos = colorfilter(objs, 2) # Select objects made up solely of '2's.
  surrounding = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda idx: any(adjacent(initset(idx), obj) for obj in twos)) # Find indices adjacent to any '2' object.
  O = fill(I, 1, surrounding)  # Fill adjacent indices with '1'.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** Identify connected components, ignoring the background.
2. **Filter for '2's:** Select objects consisting only of the digit '2'.
3. **Find adjacent cells:** Iterate through all grid indices, checking if each index is adjacent to any '2' object.
4. **Fill with '1's:** Fill the identified adjacent cells with the digit '1'.


### Program Version 4:
**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  twos = ofcolor(I, 2)  # Find indices of all '2's in the grid.
  surrounding = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda idx: any(manhattan(initset(idx), initset(two_idx)) == 1 for two_idx in twos)) # Identify indices with Manhattan distance 1 to any '2'.
  O = fill(I, 1, surrounding)  # Fill these indices with '1'.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '2' indices:** Locate all indices containing the digit '2'.
2. **Find cells with Manhattan distance 1:** Iterate through grid indices, marking those with a Manhattan distance of 1 to any '2' index.
3. **Fill with '1's:** Fill the identified indices (surrounding cells) with '1'.


### Program Version 5:
**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  modified_grid = canvas(1, shape(I))  # Create a grid filled with '1's, having the same dimensions as the input.
  twos = ofcolor(I, 2)  # Find indices of all '2's in the input grid.
  O = paint(modified_grid, recolor(2, twos))  # Paint '2's onto the new grid at their corresponding locations from the input.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create '1' filled grid:** Generate a new grid of the same size as the input, initially filled with '1's.
2. **Find '2' indices:**  Identify the indices of all '2's in the input grid.
3. **Paint '2's:** Overlay the '2's onto the new grid at their corresponding positions from the input, effectively surrounding the '2' objects with '1's.


These five programs demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation. Each version utilizes distinct DSL function combinations and logic, showcasing the flexibility and versatility of the provided DSL for solving this spatial reasoning task.
