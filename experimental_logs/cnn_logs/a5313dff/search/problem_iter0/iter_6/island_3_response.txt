## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects formed by the digit '2' and aims to draw an inner border within these objects using the digit '1'. Here's a breakdown:

**Input_0:**

- Identifies the single object formed by '2's.
- Draws an inner border within the object using '1's, leaving the outermost layer of '2's intact. 

**Input_1:**

- Identifies multiple objects formed by '2's.
- Applies the same inner border logic to each object individually.

**Input_2:**

- Applies the same inner border logic to a larger grid with more objects of varying sizes and positions.

Essentially, the transformation creates a "hollow" version of each '2'-object, preserving its shape and size. 

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Find objects of 2s, including diagonals, without background.
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T)
  # 2. Filter for objects with color 2.
  x2 = colorfilter(x1, TWO)
  # 3. Get the indices of each object.
  x3 = mapply(toindices, x2)
  # 4. Find the bounding box of each object.
  x4 = mapply(backdrop, x3)
  # 5. Shrink the bounding box to get the inner border indices.
  x5 = mapply(lambda box: box - difference(box, shift(box, (-1, -1))), x4)
  # 6. Intersect the inner border with the object indices.
  x6 = mapply(intersection, pair(x5, x3))
  # 7. Fill the inner border with 1s.
  O = fill(I, ONE, merge(x6))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identifies all '2'-objects.
2. Isolates the '2'-objects.
3. Extracts indices of each object.
4. Determines the bounding box for each object.
5. Shrinks the bounding box by one unit from each side to get the inner border.
6. Finds the intersection between the inner border and the object to ensure only inner cells are selected.
7. Fills the identified inner border cells with '1's.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Find objects of 2s, including diagonals, without background.
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T)
  # 2. Filter objects for those with color 2.
  x2 = colorfilter(x1, TWO)
  # 3. Get indices of each object.
  x3 = mapply(toindices, x2)
  # 4. For each object, find its neighboring cells.
  x4 = mapply(lambda indices: frozenset((ni, nj) for i, j in indices for ni, nj in dneighbors((i,j))), x3)
  # 5. Intersect neighbors with the object to get potential border cells.
  x5 = mapply(intersection, pair(x4, x3))
  # 6. Remove cells with only '2' neighbors, leaving the inner border.
  x6 = sfilter(x5, lambda loc: any(I[ni][nj] != TWO for ni, nj in dneighbors(loc)), I)
  # 7. Fill the inner border indices with 1s.
  O = fill(I, ONE, merge(x6))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identifies all '2'-objects.
2. Filters for '2'-objects.
3. Extracts indices of each object.
4. Finds all directly neighboring cells for each object.
5. Identifies potential border cells by intersecting with the object itself.
6. Removes cells that only have '2' as neighbors, leaving the true inner border.
7. Fills the inner border with '1's.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Find the indices of all 2s in the input.
  x1 = ofcolor(I, TWO)
  # 2. For each 2, get its neighboring indices.
  x2 = mapply(dneighbors, x1)
  # 3. Filter for 2s that have at least one non-2 neighbor.
  x3 = sfilter(x1, lambda loc: any(I[i][j] != TWO for i, j in x2), I)
  # 4. Fill the identified inner border indices with 1s.
  O = fill(I, ONE, x3)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Locates all indices containing '2'.
2. For each '2', finds the indices of its direct neighbors.
3. Filters for '2's that have at least one neighbor not equal to '2', representing the inner border.
4. Fills the identified inner border indices with '1's.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Upscale the grid by a factor of 2.
  x1 = upscale(I, 2)
  # 2. Find the objects in the upscaled grid.
  x2 = objects(x1, T, T, T)
  # 3. Filter for objects with color 2.
  x3 = colorfilter(x2, TWO)
  # 4. Get the indices for each object.
  x4 = mapply(toindices, x3)
  # 5. Shrink each object's bounding box by 1 from each side to get the inner border. 
  x5 = mapply(lambda idx:  backdrop(idx)-difference(backdrop(idx),shift(backdrop(idx), (-1, -1))), x4)
  # 6. Find the intersection of the inner border and the object indices.
  x6 = mapply(intersection, pair(x5, x4))
  # 7. Fill the inner border with 1s in the upscaled grid.
  x7 = fill(x1, ONE, merge(x6))
  # 8. Downscale the grid to its original size.
  O = downscale(x7, 2)
  return O

```
**Explanation:**

1. Upscales the grid to make the inner border more distinct.
2. Identifies all objects in the upscaled grid.
3. Filters for objects with color '2'.
4. Extracts indices of each object.
5. Shrinks each object's bounding box by one unit from each side to get the inner border in the upscaled grid.
6. Ensures only the inner border cells within the object are selected.
7. Fills the inner border cells with '1's in the upscaled grid.
8. Downscales the grid back to its original size, preserving the inner border.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Find objects of 2s, including diagonals, without background.
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T)
  # 2. Filter for objects with color 2.
  x2 = colorfilter(x1, TWO)
  # 3. Get the indices of each object.
  x3 = mapply(toindices, x2)
  # 4. For each object, find cells within its bounding box.
  x4 = mapply(lambda indices: backdrop(indices) - delta(indices), x3)
  # 5. Shrink the bounding box from all sides to get the inner bounding box.
  x5 = mapply(lambda box: frozenset((i,j) for i in range(uppermost(box)+1, lowermost(box)) for j in range(leftmost(box)+1, rightmost(box))), x4)
  # 6. Intersect the inner bounding box with the object indices to get the inner border.
  x6 = mapply(lambda p: intersection(p[0], p[1]), pair(x5, x3))
  # 7. Fill the inner border with 1s.
  O = fill(I, ONE, merge(x6))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identifies all '2'-objects.
2. Isolates the '2'-objects.
3. Extracts indices of each object.
4. Determines the cells within the bounding box of each object, excluding the border cells.
5. Iterates through the bounding box coordinates, shrinking it from all sides to get the inner bounding box.
6. Finds the intersection between the inner bounding box and the object to get the inner border cells.
7. Fills the identified inner border cells with '1's.

These five programs provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
