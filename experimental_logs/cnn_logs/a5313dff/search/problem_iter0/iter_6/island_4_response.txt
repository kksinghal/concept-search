## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applies a "border padding" to each object in the input grid. However, this padding is selective and only occurs if the border cell is adjacent to the object horizontally or vertically, not diagonally.

**Example:**

In Input_1, the '2' object has padding on its left, right, and bottom sides. However, the top side does not receive padding because the cells above the object are not directly above but diagonally adjacent.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL provided in `dsl.py`:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    padded_obj = mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0]-1, loc[1]), (loc[0]+1, loc[1]), (loc[0], loc[1]-1), (loc[0], loc[1]+1)}, toindices(obj)) 
    O = underfill(O, ONE, intersection(padded_obj, delta(toindices(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** The code iterates over each object in the input grid `I`.
2. **Generate potential padding:** For each cell in the object, it identifies the four cells directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) using `mapply` and `lambda` function.
3. **Find valid padding cells:** It uses `intersection` to find the common elements between the potential padding cells (`padded_obj`) and the delta of the object (`delta(toindices(obj))`). The delta represents the cells surrounding the object that are not part of the object itself. This ensures that only bordering cells are considered for padding.
4. **Apply padding:** Finally, it uses `underfill` to fill the valid padding cells with '1' on the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    for cell in toindices(obj):
      for direction in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
        neighbor = add(cell, direction)
        if neighbor in delta(toindices(obj)):
          O = fill(O, ONE, {neighbor})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects and cells:** The code iterates over each object and then each cell within that object.
2. **Check direct neighbors:** For each cell, it checks the four direct neighbors by iterating through a list of direction vectors.
3. **Conditional padding:** If a neighbor cell belongs to the delta of the object (meaning it's a bordering cell), it is filled with '1' using `fill`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    O = underfill(O, ONE, difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create empty canvas:** It creates an output grid `O` filled with '0' using `canvas`.
2. **Paint objects:** It iterates over the objects in the input grid `I` and paints them onto the canvas `O` using `paint`.
3. **Apply border padding:** For each object, it identifies the cells within its inbox that are not part of the object itself using `difference`. These cells represent the border. Then, it fills these border cells with '1' using `underfill`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    padded_obj = mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0]-1, loc[1]), (loc[0]+1, loc[1]), (loc[0], loc[1]-1), (loc[0], loc[1]+1)}, toindices(obj)) 
    for loc in padded_obj:
      if index(I, loc) == mostcommon(I) and adjacent(frozenset({loc}), toindices(obj)):
        O = fill(O, ONE, {loc})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects and padded cells:** Similar to version 1, it iterates through objects and calculates potential padding cells (`padded_obj`).
2. **Check for background and adjacency:** For each potential padding cell, it checks if it has the background color (most common color in the grid) using `index` and `mostcommon`. It also checks if the cell is directly adjacent to the object using `adjacent`.
3. **Conditional filling:** If both conditions are met, the cell is filled with '1' on the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(1, height(I)-1):
    for j in range(1, width(I)-1):
      if I[i][j] == mostcommon(I) and any(I[x][y] != mostcommon(I) for x, y in [(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)]):
        O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through grid cells:**  This version iterates through all the cells in the grid except the border cells.
2. **Check for background and adjacent object:** For each cell, it checks if it's a background cell (`mostcommon(I)`). It then checks if any of its direct neighbors are not background cells, implying adjacency to an object.
3. **Conditional filling:** If both conditions are met, the cell is filled with '1' on the output grid `O`.

These are five different approaches to achieve the desired transformation. Each program leverages different DSL functions and logic, demonstrating the flexibility of the provided DSL.
