## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same color) within the input grid and drawing a border around them, using the color '1'.  Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input 0:** 
- A single object formed by the digit '2'.
- Output has a '1' border surrounding this object.

**Input 1:** 
- Two objects: A '2' shaped object and a vertical line of '2's.
- Output has a '1' border surrounding both objects.

**Input 2:**
- Two objects: A 'C' shaped object formed by '2's and a horizontal line of '2's.
- Output has a '1' border surrounding both objects.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, mfilter(lambda obj: recolor(ONE, delta(toindices(obj))), objects(I, T, T, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`**: Identifies all connected objects in the grid `I`.  
2. **`lambda obj: recolor(ONE, delta(toindices(obj)))`**:  For each object:
    - **`toindices(obj)`**: Gets the indices of cells belonging to the object.
    - **`delta(...)`**:  Finds the indices forming the border around the object.
    - **`recolor(ONE, ...)`**: Colors these border indices with '1'.
3. **`mfilter(...)`**: Applies the recoloring to all objects and merges the results.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`**: Paints the borders onto the original grid `I`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(ONE, outbox(obj) - toindices(obj)), objects(I, T, T, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`**: Identifies all connected objects in the grid.
2. **`lambda obj: recolor(ONE, outbox(obj) - toindices(obj))`**: For each object:
    - **`outbox(obj)`**: Gets indices surrounding the object, including the object's own indices.
    - **`... - toindices(obj)`**:  Subtracts the object's indices, leaving only the surrounding border indices.
    - **`recolor(ONE, ...)`**:  Colors the border indices with '1'.
3. **`apply(...)`**: Applies the recoloring to all objects.
4. **`merge(...)`**: Merges the results into a single set of indices.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`**: Paints the '1' border onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, mapply(lambda obj: recolor(ONE, box(toindices(obj))), objects(I, T, T, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`**: Finds all connected objects in the grid.
2. **`lambda obj: recolor(ONE, box(toindices(obj)))`**:  For each object:
    - **`toindices(obj)`**: Extracts the object's cell indices.
    - **`box(...)`**: Calculates the indices forming the bounding box around the object.
    - **`recolor(ONE, ...)`**: Colors the bounding box indices with '1'.
3. **`mapply(...)`**: Applies the recoloring to all objects and merges the results into a single set of indices.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`**: Paints the '1' border onto the original grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, box(toindices(obj))))
    O = paint(O, toobject(toindices(obj), I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`**: Creates a blank canvas `O` of the same size as input `I` filled with '0'.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, T, T)`**: Iterates over each connected object in `I`.
3. **`O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, box(toindices(obj))))`**:  Draws the border:
    - **`toindices(obj)`**: Gets the object's cell indices.
    - **`box(...)`**:  Gets indices forming the object's bounding box.
    - **`recolor(ONE, ...)`**: Colors the bounding box indices with '1'.
    - **`paint(O, ...)`**:  Paints the '1' border onto the canvas `O`.
4. **`O = paint(O, toobject(toindices(obj), I))`**:  Draws the object itself:
    - **`toobject(toindices(obj), I)`**:  Recreates the object on the canvas using its original indices and colors from `I`.
    - **`paint(O, ...)`**:  Paints the object onto the canvas `O`.
5. **`return O`**: Returns the modified canvas as the final output.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  borders = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(ONE, delta(toindices(obj))), objs)
  return paint(I, borders)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, T, T)`**:  Identifies all objects in the grid and stores them in `objs`.
2. **`borders = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(ONE, delta(toindices(obj))), objs)`**: Calculates borders:
    - **`lambda obj: ...`**:  Defines a function to process each object.
    - **`recolor(ONE, delta(toindices(obj)))`**:  Finds the object's border indices and colors them with '1'.
    - **`mapply(..., objs)`**: Applies the border calculation to all objects and merges the results into `borders`.
3. **`return paint(I, borders)`**: Paints the calculated borders onto the original grid `I`.

These program versions demonstrate various approaches to achieve the same outcome, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
