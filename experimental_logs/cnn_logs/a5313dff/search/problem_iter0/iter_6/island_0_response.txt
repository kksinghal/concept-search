## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying objects formed by the digit '2' and then filling the interior cells of these objects with the digit '1'. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

- The input contains a single '2' object.
- The output fills the interior "hole" of this object with '1's.

**Input_1:**

- The input contains two '2' objects.
- The output fills the interior "holes" of both objects with '1's.

**Input_2:**

- The input contains several '2' objects of varying sizes and shapes.
- The output fills the interior "holes" of all '2' objects with '1's.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    twos_obj = extract(objects(I, False, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
    target_indices = intersection(inbox(toindices(twos_obj)), ofcolor(I, 0))
    O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '2' Objects:** `objects(I, False, False, False)` finds all objects in the input grid `I`. `extract(..., lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)` selects the object with color '2'.
2. **Find Interior Cells:** `inbox(toindices(twos_obj))` gets the indices of cells within the bounding box of the '2' object, excluding the object's boundary.
3. **Filter for '0' Cells:**  `intersection(..., ofcolor(I, 0))` keeps only the indices that originally contained '0's.
4. **Fill with '1's:** `fill(I, 1, ...)` fills the selected indices with '1's.


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, False)
  twos = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  target_cells = difference(inbox(toindices(twos)), toindices(twos))
  O = fill(I, 1, intersection(target_cells, ofcolor(I, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and '2' Object:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Find Interior Cells (Alternative):** `difference(inbox(...), toindices(twos))`  explicitly removes the indices of the '2' object from its bounding box to obtain only the interior cells.
3. **Filter and Fill:** Similar to steps 3 and 4 of version 1.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  two_obj = extract(objects(I, False, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  shifted_indices = mapply(lambda loc: dneighbors(loc), toindices(two_obj))
  target_indices = intersection(shifted_indices, ofcolor(I, 0))
  O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '2' Object:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Find Potential Interior Cells:**  `mapply(lambda loc: dneighbors(loc), toindices(two_obj))` finds all direct neighbors of each cell in the '2' object. This captures potential interior cells but might include exterior cells as well.
3. **Filter and Fill:**  Similar to steps 3 and 4 of version 1.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    twos = extract(objects(I, False, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
    filled = paint(canvas(1, shape(I)), twos)
    O = cellwise(I, filled, 0)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '2' Object:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Create Filled Canvas:**  `paint(canvas(1, shape(I)), twos)` creates a new grid filled with '1's and paints the '2' object onto it.
3. **Merge with Input:** `cellwise(I, filled, 0)` combines the input grid with the filled canvas, keeping '1's only where they overlap with the original '0's in the input.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    object_2 = extract(objects(I, False, False, False), lambda x: color(x) == 2)
    all_indices = asindices(I)
    interior = difference(
        all_indices,
        mapply(lambda loc: dneighbors(loc), toindices(object_2))
    )
    target = intersection(interior, ofcolor(I, 0))
    O = fill(I, 1, target)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '2' Object:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Find Exterior Cells:** `mapply(lambda loc: dneighbors(loc), toindices(object_2))`  identifies all the direct neighbors of the '2' object, effectively capturing the exterior boundary and surrounding cells.
3. **Invert to Find Interior:**  `difference(all_indices, ...)` subtracts the exterior cells from all indices, leaving only the interior cells.
4. **Filter and Fill:** Similar to steps 3 and 4 of version 1.
