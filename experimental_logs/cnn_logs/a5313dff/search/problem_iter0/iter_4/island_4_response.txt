## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects in the input grid and filling the inner empty spaces of these objects and their immediate outer surroundings. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**
- The input has a single object formed by the digit '2'. 
- The output fills the inner empty spaces of this object with the digit '1'.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**
- The input has two objects formed by the digit '2'.
- The output fills the inner empty spaces of both objects with the digit '1'.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**
- The input has several objects formed by the digit '2'.
- The output fills the inner empty spaces of all objects with the digit '1', also extending the fill one cell outwards from the object boundary in certain areas.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct program versions for the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    inner = difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))
    outer = difference(neighbors(inner), inner)
    O = underfill(O, ONE, inner | outer)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through Objects:** It iterates through each object in the input grid `I`.
2. **Identify Inner and Outer Spaces:** For each object, it identifies its inner empty spaces (`inner`) and the cells immediately surrounding the object (`outer`).
3. **Fill Spaces:** It fills both `inner` and `outer` spaces with the digit '1' using the `underfill` function, ensuring only background cells are modified.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    halo = mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj))
    fillable = difference(halo, toindices(obj))
    O = underfill(O, ONE, fillable)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through Objects:** It iterates through each object in the input grid `I`.
2. **Create Object Halo:** For each object, it generates a "halo" of cells immediately surrounding it using `mapply` and `dneighbors`.
3. **Isolate Fillable Cells:** It identifies the fillable cells by subtracting the object's cells from the halo.
4. **Fill Cells:** It fills the `fillable` cells with the digit '1' using `underfill`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = fill(I, ONE, frozenset())
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    O = underfill(O, ONE,  inbox(toindices(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialize Output:** It creates a new grid `O` filled with '1's.
2. **Iterate and Paint Objects:** It iterates through objects in the input grid, painting them onto the new grid `O`.
3. **Fill Inner Spaces:** For each object, it fills the cells within its bounding box (`inbox`) using `underfill`, effectively filling the inner spaces.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    shifted_objs = mapply(lambda d: shift(obj, d), [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)])
    combined_obj = obj | shifted_objs 
    O = underfill(O, ONE, difference(inbox(toindices(combined_obj)), toindices(combined_obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through Objects:** It iterates through each object in the input grid.
2. **Create Shifted Objects:** For each object, it generates four shifted versions (up, down, left, right) using `mapply` and `shift`.
3. **Combine Objects:** It combines the original object with its shifted versions.
4. **Fill Inner Spaces:** It identifies the inner spaces of this combined object and fills them with '1' using `underfill`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    border = difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))
    extended_border = mapply(neighbors, border)
    O = underfill(O, ONE, extended_border)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through Objects:** It iterates through each object in the input grid.
2. **Identify Border and Extension:** For each object, it identifies its border cells and creates an extended border by finding all neighbors of the border cells.
3. **Fill Extended Border:** It fills the cells within the extended border with '1' using `underfill`.


These five program versions demonstrate different approaches and function combinations within the DSL to achieve the desired transformation. Each version offers a unique perspective on solving the problem while adhering to the DSL's constraints.
