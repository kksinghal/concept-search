## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the objects formed by the digit '2' in the input grids. The goal is to identify the cells directly surrounding these '2' objects and change their values to '1'. 

**Example Breakdown:**

- **Input_0:** The '2's form a single object. The transformation changes the '0's directly above, below, and to the sides of this object into '1's. 
- **Input_1 & Input_2:**  The principle remains the same. Each connected group of '2's is treated as an individual object. The '0's directly bordering these objects are changed to '1's. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct programs that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  twos = ofcolor(I, 2) # Get indices of all '2's
  surrounding = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda idx: any(manhattan(initset(idx), initset(two_idx)) == 1 for two_idx in twos)) # Get indices adjacent to '2's
  O = fill(I, 1, surrounding)  # Fill adjacent indices with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`twos = ofcolor(I, 2)`:**  Identifies the indices of all cells containing the value '2'.
2. **`surrounding = mfilter(...)`:**  Iterates through all indices of the grid and selects those that are exactly one Manhattan distance away from any '2' index.
3. **`O = fill(I, 1, surrounding)`:** Fills the selected surrounding indices with the value '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract connected components without background
  twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)  # Filter for objects of '2's
  dilated = mapply(lambda obj: toindices(obj) | mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj)), twos)  # Dilate '2' objects by one cell
  edges = difference(merge(dilated), merge(mapply(toindices, twos)))  # Isolate the edges (difference between dilated and original)
  O = fill(I, 1, edges)  # Fill the edges with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts connected components from the grid, excluding the background color.
2. **`twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)`:** Filters the objects to keep only those composed of '2's.
3. **`dilated = mapply(...)`:** Dilates each '2' object by one cell, effectively including the surrounding cells.
4. **`edges = difference(...)`:**  Subtracts the original '2' object indices from the dilated indices, leaving only the surrounding cells.
5. **`O = fill(I, 1, edges)`:** Fills the identified edge cells with '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)  # Partition into objects (no background)
  twos = colorfilter(objs, 2) # Get '2' objects
  surrounding = mfilter(lambda obj: difference(mapply(lambda d: toindices(shift(obj, d)), [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]), asindices(I)), twos)  # Find surrounding cells outside grid
  O = fill(I, 1, merge(surrounding)) # Fill surrounding with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:** Partitions the grid into objects, excluding the background.
2. **`twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)`:** Extracts objects made of '2's.
3. **`surrounding = mfilter(...)`:**  For each '2' object, it shifts the object in all four directions and finds the indices of shifted cells that fall outside the grid boundaries.
4. **`O = fill(I, 1, merge(surrounding))`:** Fills the identified surrounding cells with '1'.

**Program Version 4:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  twos = ofcolor(I, 2)  # Find all '2' indices
  shifted_twos = mpapply(lambda idx, d: add(idx, d), twos, [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)])  # Shift '2' indices in all four directions
  surrounding = difference(shifted_twos, twos)  # Keep only the shifted indices that are not part of the original '2' objects
  O = fill(I, 1, surrounding)  # Fill the surrounding cells with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`twos = ofcolor(I, 2)`:**  Finds the indices of all '2' cells.
2. **`shifted_twos = mpapply(...)`:** Creates four shifted versions of the '2' indices, each moved one step in a cardinal direction.
3. **`surrounding = difference(...)`:**  Removes the original '2' indices from the combined shifted indices, leaving only the surrounding cells.
4. **`O = fill(I, 1, surrounding)`:** Fills the surrounding cells with '1'. 


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract connected components without background
  twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)  # Filter for objects of '2's
  surrounding = mfilter(lambda obj: toindices(obj) | delta(toindices(obj)), twos)  # Get object indices and their surrounding delta (bounding box difference)
  O = fill(I, 1, surrounding)  # Fill the combined surrounding indices with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Extracts the connected components from the grid, excluding the background.
2. **`twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)`:** Filters the objects, keeping only those composed of '2's.
3. **`surrounding = mfilter(...)`:** For each '2' object, it finds its indices and calculates the delta, which represents the surrounding cells within the object's bounding box.
4. **`O = fill(I, 1, surrounding)`:** Fills the combined surrounding indices with '1'.

These five programs offer different approaches to achieve the same transformation. Experiment with them and analyze their strengths and weaknesses to gain a deeper understanding of the DSL.
