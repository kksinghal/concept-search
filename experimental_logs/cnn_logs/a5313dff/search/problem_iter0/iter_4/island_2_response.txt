## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the "inbox" of each object in the input grid and filling it with the value `1`, while preserving the original object. The "inbox" is defined as the area enclosed by the outermost cells of the object, excluding those outermost cells themselves.

**Example:**

Consider the following object:

```
2 2 2
2 0 2
2 2 2
```

Its "inbox" would be:

```
0 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 0 
```

Let's analyze how this transformation applies to each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** The inbox of the single object is filled with `1`s.

**Input_1:** The inbox of each of the two objects is filled with `1`s.

**Input_2:** Similar to the previous examples, the inbox of every object is filled with `1`s.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, mfilter(lambda obj: recolor(ONE, inbox(obj) - toindices(obj)), objects(I, T, T, T))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Identifies all distinct objects within the input grid `I`.
2. **`lambda obj: recolor(ONE, inbox(obj) - toindices(obj))`:**  For each object:
    -  **`inbox(obj)`:** Determines the object's inbox indices.
    -  **`toindices(obj)`:**  Retrieves the indices of the object itself.
    -  **`inbox(obj) - toindices(obj)`:** Calculates the difference, resulting in indices within the inbox but not part of the object.
    -  **`recolor(ONE, ...)`:**  Colors these indices with the value `1`.
3. **`mfilter(..., objects(I, T, T, T))`:** Applies the lambda function to each object and merges the results into a single set of colored cells.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the colored cells onto the original input grid `I`, producing the output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(ONE, delta(toindices(obj))), objects(I, T, T, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the `delta` function to simplify the inbox calculation. 

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Identifies all objects.
2. **`lambda obj: recolor(ONE, delta(toindices(obj)))`:** For each object:
    -  **`delta(toindices(obj))`:** Directly retrieves the indices within the object's bounding box but not part of the object, effectively representing the inbox.
    -  **`recolor(ONE, ...)`:** Colors these indices with `1`.
3. **`apply(..., objects(I, T, T, T))`:** Applies the lambda function to each object.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Combines the results into a single set.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the result onto the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
        O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, inbox(obj) - toindices(obj)))
        O = paint(O, toobject(toindices(obj), I))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iteratively constructs the output grid `O`.

1. **`O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`:** Creates an empty canvas `O` of the same size as input `I`.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Iterates through each object in the input.
3. **`O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, inbox(obj) - toindices(obj)))`:**  Calculates and paints the object's inbox onto `O` (similar to Version 1).
4. **`O = paint(O, toobject(toindices(obj), I))`:** Paints the original object from `I` onto `O`, preserving the object itself.
5. **`return O`:** Returns the fully constructed output grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(ONE, inbox(obj)), objects(I, T, T, T)))), I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a double painting approach.

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Identifies all objects.
2. **`lambda obj: recolor(ONE, inbox(obj))`:** Colors the entire inbox of each object with `1`, including the object's cells.
3. **`apply(..., objects(I, T, T, T))`:** Applies the lambda function to each object.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Combines the results.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the colored inboxes onto the input grid `I`. 
6. **`paint(..., I)`:** Paints the original input `I` onto the result of the previous step, effectively overwriting the object cells and restoring their original values.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
    inboxes = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(ONE, inbox(obj) - toindices(obj)), objs)
    return paint(I, inboxes)
```

**Explanation:**

This version separates the object and inbox calculations for clarity.

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Stores all objects in the variable `objs`.
2. **`inboxes = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(ONE, inbox(obj) - toindices(obj)), objs)`:** 
    -  Calculates the inbox for each object (similar to Version 1).
    -  Uses `mapply` to apply the lambda function and merge the results into the `inboxes` variable.
3. **`return paint(I, inboxes)`:** Paints the combined inboxes onto the input grid.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressive power of the provided DSL. Each version uses distinct logic or DSL function combinations, ensuring diversity in solutions.
