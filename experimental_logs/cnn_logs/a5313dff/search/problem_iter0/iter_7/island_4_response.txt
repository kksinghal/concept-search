## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the grid (excluding the background color) and then filling in the cells directly adjacent to these objects with the value "1". This effectively creates a one-cell thick border around each object.

**Example:**

Input:

```
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0
0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0
0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0
0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0
0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 
```

Output:

```
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0
0 0 2 1 1 1 2 0
0 0 2 1 2 1 2 0
0 0 2 1 1 1 2 0
0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0
```

Here, the cells adjacent to the '2' objects are filled with '1's, forming a border.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    padded_obj = mapply(lambda loc: frozenset({(loc[0]-1, loc[1]), (loc[0]+1, loc[1]), (loc[0], loc[1]-1), (loc[0], loc[1]+1)}), toindices(obj))
    O = underfill(O, ONE, intersection(padded_obj, delta(toindices(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** The code iterates through each object in the input grid `I` using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Generate padded object:** For each object, it finds the adjacent cells using `mapply` and `lambda` function to create a set of possible border cells (`padded_obj`). 
3. **Find valid border cells:**  It calculates the intersection of `padded_obj` and the delta of the object's indices (`delta(toindices(obj))`). This ensures that only empty cells adjacent to the object are selected.
4. **Fill border cells:**  Finally, it fills the selected border cells with the value "1" using `underfill`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    for cell in toindices(obj):
      for n in dneighbors(cell):
        if index(I, n) == mostcommon(I):
          O = fill(O, ONE, {n})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects and their cells:** The code iterates through each object and then each cell within that object.
2. **Check neighbor cells:** For every cell in the object, it examines its direct neighbors using `dneighbors`.
3. **Fill if background:** If a neighbor cell has the background color (`mostcommon(I)`), it's filled with "1" using `fill`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    O = underfill(O, ONE, mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create empty canvas:**  The code initializes an output grid `O` with the background color and the same shape as the input.
2. **Paint objects onto canvas:** It iterates through the objects in the input and paints them onto the output canvas.
3. **Fill borders:** For each object, it directly fills the neighboring cells on the canvas with "1" using `underfill` and `mapply(dneighbors,...)`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    border = difference(
      mapply(lambda loc: frozenset(dneighbors(loc)), toindices(obj)),
      toindices(obj)
    )
    O = underfill(O, ONE, border)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** Iterates through each object in the grid.
2. **Calculate border:** For each object, it determines its border cells by finding the difference between the set of all neighbor cells (`mapply(dneighbors,...)`) and the object's own cells.
3. **Fill border cells:**  Fills the identified border cells with "1" using `underfill`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = fill(O, ONE, intersection(delta(toindices(obj)), mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:**  Iterates through each object in the input grid.
2. **Identify border cells:** Finds the intersection between the delta of the object's indices (`delta(toindices(obj))` - essentially the surrounding cells) and the set of all neighbor cells of the object (`mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj))`). This intersection gives the exact border cells.
3. **Fill border cells:**  Fills the identified border cells with the value "1" using `fill`.
