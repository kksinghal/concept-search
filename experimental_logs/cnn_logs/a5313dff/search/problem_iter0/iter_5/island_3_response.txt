## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '2' and drawing a '1' border within those objects, effectively outlining the inner perimeter. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:** 
- A single object formed by '2's.
- The output replaces the inner '2's of the object with '1's, creating the inner border.

**Input_1 - Output_1:** 
- Two objects formed by '2's.
- Similar to Input_0, the output replaces the inner '2's of each object with '1's to create inner borders.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**
- Multiple '2' objects, some with holes.
- Again, the transformation outlines the inner perimeter of each '2' object with '1's, leaving the holes untouched.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Find objects of 2s, including diagonals, without background.
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T)
  # 2. Filter for objects with color 2.
  x2 = colorfilter(x1, TWO)
  # 3. Get the indices of each object.
  x3 = mapply(toindices, x2)
  # 4. For each object, find the indices of cells within its bounding box.
  x4 = mapply(lambda indices: backdrop(indices) - delta(indices), x3)
  # 5. Intersect those indices with the original object indices to get the inner border.
  x5 = mapply(intersection, pair(x4, x3))
  # 6. Fill the inner border with 1s.
  O = fill(I, ONE, merge(x5))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identify all objects formed by '2', excluding the background.
2. Isolate objects consisting only of the color '2'.
3. Extract the indices of cells belonging to each object.
4. For each object, determine the indices within its bounding box, excluding the border itself.
5. Find the common indices between the object and its inner bounding box - these constitute the inner border.
6. Replace the values at the inner border indices with '1's in the input grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Find objects of 2s, including diagonals, without background.
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T)
  # 2. Filter for objects with color 2.
  x2 = colorfilter(x1, TWO)
  # 3. Get the indices of each object.
  x3 = mapply(toindices, x2)
  # 4. For each object, find cells adjacent to it.
  x4 = mapply(lambda indices: frozenset((ni, nj) for i, j in indices for ni, nj in neighbors((i, j))), x3)
  # 5. Remove cells that are part of the object itself, leaving only the inner border.
  x5 = mapply(difference, pair(x4, x3))
  # 6. Fill the inner border with 1s.
  O = fill(I, ONE, merge(x5))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identify all '2' objects, excluding the background.
2. Isolate objects consisting only of the color '2'.
3. Extract the indices of cells within each object.
4. Determine adjacent cells for each object.
5. Remove cells belonging to the object, leaving only those adjacent and within the object - the inner border.
6. Fill the inner border cells with '1's.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Find objects of 2s, including diagonals, without background.
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T)
  # 2. Filter for objects with color 2.
  x2 = colorfilter(x1, TWO)
  # 3. Get the indices of each object.
  x3 = mapply(toindices, x2)
  # 4. Find the bounding box for each object.
  x4 = mapply(backdrop, x3)
  # 5. Shrink the bounding box from all sides to get the inner bounding box.
  x5 = mapply(lambda box: frozenset((i,j) for i in range(uppermost(box)+1, lowermost(box)) for j in range(leftmost(box)+1, rightmost(box))), x4)
  # 6. Intersect the inner bounding box with the object indices to get the inner border.
  x6 = mapply(lambda p: intersection(p[0], p[1]), pair(x5, x3))
  # 7. Fill the inner border with 1s.
  O = fill(I, ONE, merge(x6))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identify all '2' objects, excluding the background.
2. Filter for objects solely composed of '2'.
3. Extract the indices of cells within each object.
4. Determine the bounding box for each object.
5. Create an inner bounding box by shrinking the original bounding box by one unit on each side.
6. Identify the common indices between the inner bounding box and the object â€“ this gives us the inner border.
7. Fill the inner border cells with '1's in the input grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Find objects of 2s, including diagonals, without background.
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T)
  # 2. Filter objects for those with color 2.
  x2 = colorfilter(x1, TWO)
  # 3. Get indices of each object.
  x3 = mapply(toindices, x2)
  # 4. Shift each object by one unit in all four directions.
  x4 = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset(shift(obj, d) for d in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]), x3)
  # 5. Intersect the original object indices with their shifted versions.
  x5 = mapply(lambda p: intersection(p[0], merge(p[1])), pair(x3, x4))
  # 6.  Subtract the intersection from the original object indices to get the inner border.
  x6 = mapply(lambda p: difference(p[0], p[1]), pair(x3, x5))
  # 7. Fill the inner border indices with 1s.
  O = fill(I, ONE, merge(x6))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identify all objects composed of '2's, excluding the background.
2. Keep only the objects that consist solely of the color '2'.
3. Extract the cell indices belonging to each object.
4. Create shifted versions of each object, moving them one unit in all four cardinal directions.
5. Find the common indices between the original object and its shifted versions.
6. Subtract the intersecting indices from the original object indices - this isolates the inner border.
7. Replace the values at the inner border indices with '1's.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Find the indices of all 2s in the input grid.
  x1 = ofcolor(I, TWO)
  # 2. For each 2, check if it has a non-2 neighbor.
  x2 = frozenset((i, j) for i, j in x1 if any(I[ni][nj] != TWO for ni, nj in neighbors((i, j))))
  # 3. Fill the identified inner border indices with 1s.
  O = fill(I, ONE, x2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identify all cells in the input grid that contain the value '2'.
2. Iterate through these cells, checking if any of their neighbors have a value different from '2'. If so, this cell is part of the inner border.
3. Replace the values at the identified inner border indices with '1's in the input grid.

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing flexibility in utilizing the provided DSL functions.
