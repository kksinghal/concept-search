## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to **identify the surrounding cells of all objects with value '2' and fill those surrounding cells with '1'**. The surrounding cells are determined based on direct adjacency (not diagonal).

**Example:**

Input:

```
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0
0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0
0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0
0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0
0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0
```

Output:

```
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0
0 0 2 1 1 1 2 0
0 0 2 1 2 1 2 0
0 0 2 1 1 1 2 0
0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0
```

## Program Versions:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  twos = ofcolor(I, 2) # Get indices of cells with '2'
  surrounding = mapply(dneighbors, twos) # Get indices of all direct neighbors of '2's
  filtered_surrounding = difference(surrounding, twos) # Remove original '2' indices
  O = fill(I, 1, filtered_surrounding) # Fill surrounding cells with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`twos = ofcolor(I, 2)`:**  Identifies and stores the indices of all cells in the input grid `I` containing the value '2'.
2. **`surrounding = mapply(dneighbors, twos)`:**  Applies the `dneighbors` function to each index in `twos`, generating a set of directly adjacent neighbors for each '2' cell and merges them into a single set.
3. **`filtered_surrounding = difference(surrounding, twos)`:** Removes the original '2' indices from the `surrounding` set, leaving only the indices of the surrounding cells.
4. **`O = fill(I, 1, filtered_surrounding)`:** Fills the cells at the indices present in `filtered_surrounding` with the value '1' in a copy of the input grid `I`, generating the output grid `O`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Extract connected components without background
    twos = colorfilter(objs, 2) # Filter for objects of '2's
    surrounding =  difference(mapply(lambda obj: mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj)), twos), mapply(toindices, twos))
    O = fill(I, 1, surrounding)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, True, False, True)`:**  Extracts connected components (objects) from the input grid `I` without considering the background.
2. **`twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)`:** Filters the extracted objects to keep only those consisting of the value '2'.
3. **`surrounding = difference(...)`:** Calculates the surrounding cells by finding the difference between the set of neighbor indices for all '2' objects and the indices of the '2' objects themselves.
4. **`O = fill(I, 1, surrounding)`:**  Fills the cells at the `surrounding` indices with the value '1' in a copy of the input grid `I`, generating the output grid `O`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  twos = ofcolor(I, 2) # Get indices of cells with '2'
  shifted_twos = mpapply(lambda idx, d: add(idx, d), twos, [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]) # Shift '2' indices in all four directions
  surrounding = difference(shifted_twos, asindices(I)) # Keep only the shifted indices that are outside the grid
  O = fill(I, 1, surrounding) # Fill the surrounding cells with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`twos = ofcolor(I, 2)`:**  Identifies the indices of all '2's in the input grid.
2. **`shifted_twos = mpapply(...)`:** Generates a set of indices by shifting each '2' index one step in all four cardinal directions.
3. **`surrounding = difference(...)`:**  Identifies indices within the shifted set that fall outside the grid boundaries.
4. **`O = fill(I, 1, surrounding)`:** Fills the cells at those out-of-bounds indices with '1' in a copy of the input grid, effectively marking the surrounding cells. 

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract connected components without background
    twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)  # Filter for objects of '2's
    surrounding = mfilter(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), twos)  # Extract the delta (surrounding cells) for each '2' object
    O = fill(I, 1, merge(surrounding))  # Fill the surrounding cells with '1'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts connected components, excluding the background.
2. **`twos = colorfilter(objs, 2)`:**  Filters for objects consisting only of '2'.
3. **`surrounding = mfilter(...)`:**  Applies the `delta` function to each object's indices, identifying surrounding cells, and merges them into a single set.
4. **`O = fill(I, 1, merge(surrounding))`:**  Fills the identified surrounding cells with '1'.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    twos = ofcolor(I, 2)  # Get indices of cells with '2'
    surrounding = mfilter(lambda idx: dneighbors(idx) - initset(idx), twos) # Get direct neighbors for each '2' and remove the '2' itself
    O = fill(I, 1, surrounding)  # Fill the surrounding cells with '1'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`twos = ofcolor(I, 2)`:**  Identifies the indices of all '2' cells.
2. **`surrounding = mfilter(...)`:** Iterates over each '2' index and calculates its direct neighbors using `dneighbors`. It then removes the original '2' index from the neighbor set and merges all results.
3. **`O = fill(I, 1, surrounding)`:** Fills the cells at these neighbor indices with '1' in a copy of the input grid, effectively highlighting the cells surrounding the '2's. 

These five versions showcase different approaches to solving the problem using various combinations of DSL functions, achieving the desired transformation while adhering to the constraints of the provided DSL.
