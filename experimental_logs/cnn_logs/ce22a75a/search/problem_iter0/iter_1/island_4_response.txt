## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (clusters of the same digit different from the background) and moving them to a corner of the grid. The destination corner appears to be determined by the object's initial position relative to the center of the grid. 

**Input 0:** The '5' objects are moved to the top-left corner if initially located in the top-left quadrant, and to the bottom-right corner if initially located in the bottom-right quadrant.

**Input 1:**  The pattern from Input 0 continues.  The additional '5' in the bottom row causes the object originally in the bottom-right corner to merge with it, forming a larger object in the bottom-right corner. 


## Program Version 1

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  center_point = divide(shape(I), 2)
  transformed_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    obj_center = center(obj)
    if obj_center[0] < center_point[0] and obj_center[1] < center_point[1]:
      target_corner = ulcorner(I)
    else:
      target_corner = lrcorner(I)
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, subtract(target_corner, ulcorner(obj)))
    transformed_objs.add(shifted_obj)
  O = paint(canvas(1, shape(I)), merge(transformed_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Find Grid Center:** Calculate the center point of the grid.
3. **Iterate and Move:** For each object, determine its destination corner based on its position relative to the grid center. Then, shift the object to that corner.
4. **Paint Objects:** Create a canvas filled with '1's and paint the transformed objects onto it.


## Program Version 2

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  transformed_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    obj_center = center(obj)
    h, w = halve(shape(I))
    destination = (0, 0) if obj_center[0] < h and obj_center[1] < w else (h, w)
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, subtract(destination, ulcorner(obj)))
    transformed_objs.add(shifted_obj)
  O = paint(canvas(1, shape(I)), merge(transformed_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects in the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Calculate Destination:** For each object, determine the destination corner based on its position relative to the grid's horizontal and vertical halves.
3. **Shift Objects:** Shift each object to its calculated destination corner.
4. **Paint Objects:** Create a new grid filled with '1's and paint the transformed objects onto it.

## Program Version 3

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    h, w = halve(shape(I))
    quadrant_map = {(i, j): (0, 0) if i < h and j < w else (h, w) 
                     for i in range(h * 2) for j in range(w * 2)}
    O = canvas(1, shape(I))
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
      for j, val in enumerate(row):
          if val != mostcommon(I):
              O = paint(O, { (val, quadrant_map[(i, j)]) })
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Quadrant Map:** Pre-compute a dictionary mapping each cell's coordinates to its destination corner.
2. **Iterate and Paint:** Iterate through the grid, and for each non-background cell, paint a single-cell object with the same color at its corresponding destination corner on a new canvas filled with '1's.


## Program Version 4

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    h, w = divide(shape(I), 2)
    top_left_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: center(obj)[0] < h and center(obj)[1] < w)
    bottom_right_objs = difference(objs, top_left_objs)
    shifted_top_left = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, subtract((0, 0), ulcorner(obj))), top_left_objs)
    shifted_bottom_right = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, subtract((h, w), ulcorner(obj))), bottom_right_objs)
    O = paint(canvas(1, shape(I)), merge((shifted_top_left, shifted_bottom_right)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects & Calculate Halves:**  Identify all objects and determine the grid's half dimensions.
2. **Filter Objects:** Separate objects into those belonging to the top-left and bottom-right quadrants.
3. **Shift Objects:** Shift objects in each group to their respective corners.
4. **Paint Objects:** Create a new canvas filled with '1's and paint the shifted objects onto it.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    h, w = halve(shape(I))
    move_to_corner = lambda obj, corner: shift(obj, subtract(corner, ulcorner(obj)))
    transformed_objs = mapply(lambda obj: move_to_corner(obj, (0, 0)) if center(obj)[0] < h and center(obj)[1] < w else move_to_corner(obj, (h, w)), objs)
    O = paint(canvas(1, shape(I)), merge(transformed_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects & Calculate Halves:** Identify all objects and calculate the grid's half dimensions.
2. **Define Move Function:**  Create a function `move_to_corner` to shift an object to a specific corner.
3. **Transform Objects:**  Use `mapply` to apply a lambda function that conditionally moves each object to its corresponding corner based on its center's location.
4. **Paint Objects:** Create a new canvas filled with '1's and paint the transformed objects onto it.
