## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes all non-background objects in the input grid and moves them to the opposite corner along the diagonal. The size and shape of the object are preserved during the transformation.

**Example:**

- **Input_0:** The single '5' object in the top left corner is moved to the bottom right corner.
- **Input_1:**  All '5' objects are moved from their original positions to the bottom right corner, merging into a single object.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = toobject(extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: size(o) > 1), I) 
  g_w = width(I)
  g_h = height(I)
  o_w = width(obj)
  o_h = height(obj)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, (g_h, g_w)), shift(obj, (g_h - o_h, g_w - o_w))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Object:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all non-background objects. `extract(..., lambda o: size(o) > 1)` selects the object with size greater than one (avoiding potential errors if the background is identified as an object). `toobject(...)` converts the selected object from indices to an object representation.
2. **Calculate Dimensions:**  `width(I)` and `height(I)` retrieve the input grid dimensions.  `width(obj)` and `height(obj)` get the object dimensions.
3. **Create Canvas and Shift:** `canvas(ZERO, (g_h, g_w))` creates an empty canvas of the same size as the input, filled with zeros. `shift(obj, (g_h - o_h, g_w - o_w))` moves the object to the bottom right corner by calculating the appropriate offset.
4. **Paint and Return:** `paint(...)` paints the shifted object onto the canvas, resulting in the transformed output grid.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_indices = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: size(o) > 1) 
  corner = lrcorner(I)
  offset = subtract(corner, shape(obj_indices))
  shifted_indices = shift(obj_indices, offset)
  O = fill(I, ONE, shifted_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Object Indices:** Similar to Version 1, we extract the indices of the non-background object.
2. **Find Corner and Calculate Offset:** `lrcorner(I)` finds the bottom right corner of the input grid. `shape(obj_indices)` returns the object's height and width. `subtract(...)` calculates the offset required to move the object's top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.
3. **Shift Indices:** `shift(obj_indices, offset)` applies the calculated offset to the object's indices.
4. **Fill and Return:** `fill(I, ONE, shifted_indices)` fills the input grid with '1' at the shifted object indices, producing the output.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = toobject(extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: size(o) > 1), I)
  flipped_obj = cmirror(obj) 
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), flipped_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Object:** Extract the non-background object as in Version 1.
2. **Mirror Object:**  `cmirror(obj)` mirrors the object along the counter-diagonal. This effectively moves the object to the opposite corner.
3. **Create Canvas and Paint:** Create a blank canvas and paint the mirrored object onto it.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: size(o) > 1) 
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if (i, j) in obj:
        O = paint(O, {(ONE, (height(I) - i - 1, width(I) - j - 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Object Indices:** Extract the indices of the non-background object.
2. **Iterate and Paint:**  Iterate through each cell of the input grid. If the cell is part of the object, paint a '1' at its mirrored position on the output grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_indices = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: size(o) > 1) 
  new_indices = frozenset(((height(I) - i - 1, width(I) - j - 1) for i, j in obj_indices))
  O = fill(I, ZERO, obj_indices)
  O = fill(O, ONE, new_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Object Indices:** Extract the indices of the non-background object.
2. **Calculate Mirrored Indices:** Calculate the mirrored indices for each cell in the object.
3. **Fill and Return:**  Fill the original object positions with '0' on the output grid. Then, fill the calculated mirrored indices with '1', effectively moving the object to the opposite corner.
