## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes all non-zero pixels in the input grid and moves them to a specific quadrant in the output grid while changing their color to 1. The target quadrant depends on the original location of the pixel:

* **Top Left Quadrant:** Pixels originally located in the top left quadrant of the input grid stay in the top left quadrant of the output grid.
* **Other Quadrants:**  Pixels originally located in any other quadrant (top right, bottom left, bottom right) are moved to the bottom right quadrant of the output grid. 

Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

* The '5's in the top left quadrant remain in the top left quadrant and become '1's.
* The '5's in the other quadrants are moved to the bottom right quadrant and become '1's.

**Input_1:**

*  Similar to Input_0, the '5's are moved based on their original quadrant and recolored to '1's. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = halve(shape(I))
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  top_left_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: uppermost(obj) < h and leftmost(obj) < w)
  other_objs = difference(objs, top_left_objs)
  moved_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (h * (uppermost(obj) >= h), w * (leftmost(obj) >= w))), other_objs)
  recolored_objs = combine(top_left_objs, moved_objs)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), recolor(1, merge(recolored_objs)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate Half Dimensions:** `h, w = halve(shape(I))` gets half the height and width of the input grid.
2. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` finds all non-background objects in the input.
3. **Separate Objects:**  `top_left_objs` filters objects starting in the top left quadrant. `other_objs` gets the remaining objects.
4. **Move Objects:** `moved_objs` shifts objects not in the top-left to the bottom right based on their original quadrant.
5. **Combine Objects:** `recolored_objs` merges the top-left objects with the moved objects.
6. **Paint to Canvas:** A new canvas is created with the background color, and the transformed objects are painted onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = halve(shape(I))
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != mostcommon(I):
        target_i, target_j = (i, j) if i < h and j < w else (i + h * (i >= h), j + w * (j >= w))
        O = paint(O, {(1, (target_i, target_j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates an empty canvas with the background color.
2. **Iterate through Pixels:** Loops through each cell in the input grid.
3. **Check for Non-Background:**  If a pixel isn't background, determine its target location.
4. **Calculate Target Location:**  Pixels in the top left stay the same; others are shifted to the bottom right.
5. **Paint Pixel:** Paints the pixel onto the canvas at its calculated target location.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = halve(shape(I))
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for (val, (i, j)) in asobject(I):
    if val != mostcommon(I):
      target_i = i if i < h else h + i - h * (i >= h)
      target_j = j if j < w else w + j - w * (j >= w)
      O = paint(O, {(1, (target_i, target_j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and Iteration:** Similar to version 2, initializes a canvas and iterates through the input grid represented as an object.
2. **Target Calculation:**  Calculates target coordinates using a slightly different logic with conditional expressions.
3. **Paint:** Paints the non-background pixels onto the output canvas.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = halve(shape(I))
  objs = partition(I) - {frozenset({(mostcommon(I), (i, j)) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0]))})} 
  moved_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (h * (uppermost(obj) >= h), w * (leftmost(obj) >= w))), objs)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), recolor(1, merge(moved_objs)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition and Remove Background:** Partitions the input grid into objects and removes the background object.
2. **Shift Objects:**  Shifts each object based on its starting quadrant.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** Recolors the shifted objects to 1 and paints them onto a new canvas. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = halve(shape(I))
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(h * 2):
    for j in range(w * 2):
      if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I):
        O = paint(O, {(1, ((i, j) if i < h and j < w else (h + i % h, w + j % w)))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas and Iteration:** Similar to version 2, initializes a canvas and iterates through all cell indices.
2. **Inline Target Calculation:** Calculates the target location directly within the paint function call using a conditional expression.
3. **Paint:**  Paints non-background pixels at their calculated locations on the canvas.


These programs demonstrate five different approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
