## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in these examples involves identifying each object (defined as connected components of the same digit, excluding the background) and replacing it with a 3x3 square of the same digit centered on the original object. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 
- Each isolated '5' in the input is replaced by a 3x3 square of '1's in the output, centered at the original '5's location.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- Similar to the previous transformation, each '5' is replaced by a 3x3 square of '1's. 
- Notice how the overlapping squares merge seamlessly.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Find all objects, excluding the background.
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((1, (i, j)) for i in range(uppermost(obj)-1, lowermost(obj)+2) for j in range(leftmost(obj)-1, rightmost(obj)+2)), objs)  # Expand each object into a 3x3 area centered around it.
  O = paint(fill(I, 0, asindices(I)), 1, merge(expanded_objs))  # Fill the grid with 0s and paint the expanded objects with 1s.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies all the objects in the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **`expanded_objs = ...`:** For each object, it creates a new object representing a 3x3 square centered on the original object's bounding box. It does this by iterating through the rows and columns surrounding the object's boundaries.
3. **`O = paint(fill(I, 0, asindices(I)), 1, merge(expanded_objs))`:** This part first fills the entire grid with '0's. Then, it paints the '1's over the expanded objects onto the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset(shift(obj, (di, dj)) for di in range(-1, 2) for dj in range(-1, 2)), objs) # Generate shifted versions of each object
  O = paint(fill(I, 0, asindices(I)), 1, merge(mapply(lambda obj: recolor(1, toindices(obj)), shifted_objs)))  # Paint 1s onto the shifted objects
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies the objects, excluding the background.
2. **`shifted_objs = ...`:** Generates eight shifted versions of each object, representing all adjacent positions including diagonals.
3. **`O = paint(fill(I, 0, asindices(I)), 1, merge(mapply(lambda obj: recolor(1, toindices(obj)), shifted_objs)))`:** 
    - Fills the grid with '0's. 
    - Recolors the shifted objects to '1'.
    - Paints the recolored objects onto the grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  boxes = mapply(lambda obj: backdrop(frozenset({(0, add(c, (1,1))) for c in corners(obj)})), objs)  # Create a bounding box around each object, expanded by 1 unit on each side.
  O = fill(I, 1, merge(boxes))  # Fill the expanded bounding boxes with 1s.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies the objects in the grid.
2. **`boxes = ...`:**  
    - `corners(obj)`: Finds the corner indices of each object's bounding box.
    - `add(c, (1,1))`: Shifts the corner indices outwards by 1 unit.
    - `backdrop(...)`: Creates a set of indices representing the expanded bounding box.
3. **`O = fill(I, 1, merge(boxes))`:**  Fills all the expanded bounding boxes with '1's.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    expanded_objs =  mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((1, (i,j)) for i in range(uppermost(obj)-1, lowermost(obj)+2) for j in range(leftmost(obj)-1, rightmost(obj)+2)), objs) # Create a set of 3x3 objects directly
    O = paint(fill(I, 0, asindices(I)), 1, merge(expanded_objs)) # Paint these 3x3 objects onto a blank grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identify the objects in the grid.
2. **`expanded_objs = ...`**: 
    - Directly generates a set of 3x3 objects, each with color '1'. 
    - Uses the `uppermost`, `lowermost`, `leftmost`, and `rightmost` functions to determine the boundaries of the 3x3 area around each object.
3. **`O = paint(fill(I, 0, asindices(I)), 1, merge(expanded_objs))`:**  
    - Fills the grid with '0's.
    - Paints the '1's from the `expanded_objs` onto the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  surroundings = mapply(lambda obj:  frozenset((1, (i + di, j + dj)) for di in range(-1, 2) for dj in range(-1, 2) for (v, (i, j)) in obj), objs) # Calculate surrounding cells
  O = paint(fill(I, 0, asindices(I)), 1, merge(surroundings))  # Paint surrounding cells onto the grid
  return O

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies the objects in the grid.
2. **`surroundings = ...`:** For each object:
    - Iterates through all its cells.
    - For each cell, it calculates the indices of its eight surrounding cells (including diagonals) by adding offsets `di` and `dj`.
    - It creates a new set of cells with color '1' at those surrounding positions.
3. **`O = paint(fill(I, 0, asindices(I)), 1, merge(surroundings))`:** 
    - Fills the entire grid with '0's.
    - Merges all the surrounding cells from different objects.
    - Paints the '1's from the merged set onto the grid.
