## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (groups of connected, same-valued digits) in the input grid and drawing a filled 3x3 square around each object. The value within the square seems to be always '1', regardless of the object's original value.

**Example:**

Input:

```
0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Output:

```
0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1
```

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify objects in the grid
    shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset(shift(obj, (di, dj)) for di in range(-1, 2) for dj in range(-1, 2)), objs)  # Create 9 shifted copies of each object (including original)
    O = fill(I, 1, merge(mapply(toindices, shifted_objs)))  # Fill areas covered by shifted objects with 1
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We first identify all distinct objects in the input grid using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Create Shifted Copies:** For each object, we generate eight shifted copies, along with the original, resulting in nine versions of the object, each shifted one unit in all directions.
3. **Fill Surrounding Area:** We merge the indices of all shifted objects. Finally, we use `fill` to fill the area covered by these indices with the value '1', effectively drawing a 3x3 filled square around each original object.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    surroundings = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((i + di, j + dj) for di in range(-1, 2) for dj in range(-1, 2) for (v, (i, j)) in obj), objs)  # Calculate surrounding indices for each object
    O = fill(I, 1, merge(surroundings))  # Fill the surrounding areas with 1s
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1, we begin by identifying the objects within the grid.
2. **Calculate Surrounding Indices:** For each object, we iterate over its cells and calculate the indices of the eight surrounding cells plus the cell itself, forming a 3x3 square.
3. **Fill Squares:** We merge all surrounding indices and use `fill` to paint them with '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  boxes = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj) - 1, lowermost(obj) + 2) for j in range(leftmost(obj) - 1, rightmost(obj) + 2)), objs) # Find indices of 3x3 boxes around each object
  O = fill(I, 1, merge(boxes)) # Fill those boxes with 1s
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We start by identifying the objects within the grid.
2. **Find 3x3 Boxes:**  For each object, we calculate the indices of a 3x3 box surrounding it using `uppermost`, `lowermost`, `leftmost`, and `rightmost` functions to determine the boundaries.
3. **Fill Boxes:** We merge all box indices and use `fill` to paint them with '1'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expanded_indices = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj) - 1, lowermost(obj) + 2) for j in range(leftmost(obj) - 1, rightmost(obj) + 2)), objs)  # Calculate indices for 3x3 squares
  O = fill(I, 1, merge(expanded_indices))  # Fill the squares with 1s
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions, we begin by identifying the objects.
2. **Calculate 3x3 Square Indices:** We calculate the indices for a 3x3 square around each object by determining the top-left and bottom-right corners based on the object's boundaries.
3. **Fill Squares:** We merge all the calculated indices and use `fill` to paint a '1' on each. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify all objects in the grid
  squares = mapply(lambda obj: backdrop(shift(frozenset({(0, (1, 1))}), centerofmass(obj))), objs)  # Create 3x3 squares centered on each object
  O = fill(I, 1, merge(squares))  # Fill the squares with 1s
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We start by identifying all distinct objects in the input grid using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Create 3x3 Squares:**  For each object, we: 
    * Calculate its center of mass using `centerofmass(obj)`.
    * Create a single-cell object at (1,1) and shift it to the object's center of mass. 
    * Use `backdrop` to generate indices for a 3x3 square surrounding the shifted cell, effectively creating a 3x3 square around each original object.
3. **Fill Squares:**  We merge all square indices and use `fill` to paint them with '1'.
