## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in both input-output pairs involves identifying objects (clusters of the same digit different from the background) and drawing a 3x3 filled square centered at the center of mass of each object.

**Input_0:**

- **Input:** Three '5's scattered across the grid with '0' as background.
- **Output:**  A 3x3 square of '1's is centered on the location of each '5' in the input grid.

**Input_1:**

- **Input:** Four '5's with '0' as background.
- **Output:** Each '5' in the input has a corresponding 3x3 square of '1's centered at its location.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions for the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify all objects in the input grid.
  squares = mapply(lambda obj: backdrop(shift(canvas((1,), (3, 3)), subtract(centerofmass(obj), (1, 1)))), objs)  # Create 3x3 squares centered at each object's center of mass.
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(squares))  # Paint the squares onto a blank canvas of the input's shape.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, T)` finds all connected components (objects) in the input grid `I`.
2. **Create Squares:** For each object, we:
   - Calculate its center of mass using `centerofmass(obj)`.
   - Create a 3x3 square of '1's using `canvas((1,), (3, 3))`.
   - Shift the square to center it at the object's center of mass using `shift()` and `subtract()`.
   - Get the indices of the shifted square using `backdrop()`.
3. **Paint Squares:**
   - Create a blank canvas of the same size as the input using `canvas(0, shape(I))`.
   - Combine all square indices using `merge()`.
   - Paint the combined indices with '1' onto the canvas using `paint()`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def fill_square(obj):  # Function to fill a square around an object
    center = centerofmass(obj)
    square = backdrop(shift(canvas((1,), (3,3)), subtract(center, (1,1))))  # Create 3x3 square at object's center
    return square
  
  filled_areas = mfilter(fill_square, objects(I, T, F, T)) # Apply fill_square to all objects and merge results
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), filled_areas)  # Paint merged areas onto a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_square` Function:** Takes an object as input and returns a set of indices representing a 3x3 square centered at the object's center of mass.
2. **`mfilter` for Square Filling:** 
    -  `objects(I, T, F, T)` retrieves all objects from the input grid.
    - `mfilter` applies the `fill_square` function to each object and merges the resulting sets of indices into `filled_areas`.
3. **Painting on Canvas:**  Similar to Version 1, we create a blank canvas and paint the `filled_areas` onto it.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  filled_indices = set()
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        if manhattan((i, j), toindices(obj)) <= 1:  # Check if cell is within 1 manhattan distance from any object cell
          filled_indices.update(backdrop(shift(canvas((1,), (3,3)), subtract((i, j), (1, 1)))))  # Fill 3x3 square around the cell
          break # Move to the next cell after filling
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), frozenset(filled_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** This version iterates through each cell of the input grid.
2. **Check Manhattan Distance:** For each cell, it calculates the Manhattan distance to each cell of every object in the grid.
3. **Fill Square:** If a cell is found to be within a Manhattan distance of 1 or less from any cell of an object, a 3x3 square centered at that cell is added to `filled_indices`.
4. **Paint Filled Indices:** Finally, the collected `filled_indices` are painted onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def square_indices(obj):  # Function to calculate indices of a 3x3 square around an object's center
    i, j = centerofmass(obj)
    return frozenset({(i-1, j-1), (i-1, j), (i-1, j+1),
            (i, j-1), (i, j), (i, j+1),
            (i+1, j-1), (i+1, j), (i+1, j+1)})
  
  filled_areas = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(1, square_indices(obj)), objects(I, T, F, T)) # Create object representations of squares
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(filled_areas))  # Paint squares onto canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`square_indices` Function:** Calculates and returns the indices of a 3x3 square centered at the input object's center of mass.
2. **`mapply` for Square Creation:** Applies `square_indices` to each object and recolors the resulting indices with '1' using `recolor`. This effectively creates object representations of the squares.
3. **Painting:** Similar to previous versions, the squares are painted onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  def expand_object(obj):
    return backdrop(shift(canvas((1,), (3,3)), subtract(centerofmass(obj), (1,1))))
  
  expanded_objs = apply(expand_object, objs)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(expanded_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`expand_object` Function:** Takes an object as input and calculates the backdrop (indices) of a 3x3 square centered at the object's center of mass.
2. **Apply to Objects:** The `apply` function iterates through each object identified by `objects(I, T, F, T)` and applies the `expand_object` function.
3. **Merge and Paint:**  The indices of all expanded objects are merged, and these merged indices are painted onto a blank canvas to generate the final output.


## Code Extraction:

To easily extract the "Program_to_be_generated" code, simply copy the code within the code blocks provided for each version. 

Remember to paste the code into a Python environment with the DSL functions defined (from "dsl.py") to be able to execute them.
