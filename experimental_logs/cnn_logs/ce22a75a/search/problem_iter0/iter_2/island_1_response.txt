## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by non-zero digits and then drawing a filled square of '1's with the same dimensions as the object, but positioned in the opposite corner of the grid.

* **Input_0:** 
    * There are two objects formed by the digit '5'.
    * For each object, a 3x3 square of '1's is drawn in the opposite corner.
* **Input_1:**
    * There are three objects formed by the digit '5'.
    * Similar to Input_0, corresponding 3x3 squares of '1's are drawn in the opposite corner.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Identify objects
  output = canvas(0, shape(I))  # Create empty canvas
  for obj in objs:
    corner = ulcorner(obj) if ulcorner(obj) == (0,0) else lrcorner(obj)  # Identify top-left or bottom-right corner
    opposite_corner = (len(I) - corner[0] - height(obj), len(I[0]) - corner[1] - width(obj))  # Calculate opposite corner
    square = product(interval(0, height(obj)), interval(0, width(obj)))  # Generate indices for a square
    shifted_square = shift(square, opposite_corner)  # Shift square to the opposite corner
    output = paint(output, recolor(1, shifted_square))  # Paint the square onto the output
  return output 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` extracts objects formed by connected non-zero digits.
2. **Create empty canvas:** `canvas(0, shape(I))` generates an empty grid of the same size as the input.
3. **Iterate through objects:**  The code iterates through each identified object.
4. **Identify corner:** `ulcorner(obj) if ulcorner(obj) == (0,0) else lrcorner(obj)` determines if the object's corner is at the top-left or bottom-right.
5. **Calculate opposite corner:**  `opposite_corner` is calculated based on the object's corner and dimensions.
6. **Generate square indices:**  `product(interval(0, height(obj)), interval(0, width(obj)))` generates indices for a square matching the object's dimensions.
7. **Shift square:** `shift(square, opposite_corner)` moves the square to the calculated opposite corner.
8. **Paint square:** `output = paint(output, recolor(1, shifted_square))` paints the shifted square onto the output grid with '1's.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), 
               merge([recolor(1, shift(product(interval(0, height(obj)), interval(0, width(obj))), 
                                            (len(I) - lrcorner(obj)[0], len(I[0]) - lrcorner(obj)[1]))) 
                      for obj in objs]))
```

**Explanation:**

This version condenses the logic into a single line using list comprehension and `merge` function. It identifies objects, creates a canvas, and then for each object:

1. Generates a square of indices matching the object's dimensions.
2. Shifts the square to the opposite corner based on the object's lower-right corner.
3. Recolors the square with '1's.
4. Merges all the recolored squares onto the canvas using `merge`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != 0:
        O = fill(O, 1, shift(product(interval(0, height(objects(I, True, False, True)[0])),
                                      interval(0, width(objects(I, True, False, True)[0]))),
                              (len(I) - i - height(objects(I, True, False, True)[0]), 
                               len(I[0]) - j - width(objects(I, True, False, True)[0]))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each cell of the input grid. If a non-zero value is encountered, it:

1. Identifies the first object's dimensions (assuming all objects have the same dimensions).
2. Generates a square of indices based on those dimensions.
3. Shifts the square to the opposite corner relative to the current cell's position.
4. Fills the shifted square on the output canvas with '1's.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), 
               recolor(1, 
                       merge([shift(product(interval(0, height(obj)), interval(0, width(obj))), 
                                       (len(I) - lrcorner(obj)[0], len(I[0]) - lrcorner(obj)[1]))
                              for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)])))
```

**Explanation:**

This version combines several operations into a single line. It:

1. Creates a blank canvas.
2. Identifies objects in the input.
3. For each object, generates a square, shifts it to the opposite corner, and recolors it with '1's.
4. Merges all these recolored squares and paints them onto the canvas.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
        O = underfill(O, 1, shift(product(interval(0, height(obj)), interval(0, width(obj))),
                                     (len(I) - lrcorner(obj)[0], len(I[0]) - lrcorner(obj)[1])))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes `underfill` to simplify the process:

1. Creates a blank canvas.
2. Identifies objects in the input.
3. For each object, generates a square of indices and shifts it to the opposite corner.
4. Uses `underfill` to fill the shifted square with '1's only where the canvas is still blank (value 0). 

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic constructs.
