## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grid can be described as:

1. **Identify the objects:** Each connected group of non-zero digits forms an object.
2. **Enclose each object in a 3x3 box:** Regardless of the object's shape or size, it's enclosed in a 3x3 square.
3. **Fill the box with '1':**  All cells within the 3x3 box are assigned the value '1'. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify objects, excluding background
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset(shift(obj, d) for d in ((-1,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1), (0,-1), (0,1), (1,-1), (1,0), (1,1))), objs)
  O = paint(fill(I, 1, merge(mapply(toindices, objs))), 0, merge(shifted_objs)) # Paint 0s around the objects
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all connected components of non-zero values, excluding the background.
2. **Shift objects and get indices:** For each object, we shift it in all eight directions and collect the indices of the shifted objects.
3. **Fill with '1' and paint surroundings with '0':**  We fill the original grid with '1' and then paint '0' on the shifted object indices to create the 3x3 boxes.


**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  boxes = mapply(lambda obj: backdrop(frozenset({(0, add(c, (1, 1))) for c in corners(obj)})), objs) # Calculate the bounding box for each object
  O = fill(I, 1, merge(boxes))  # Fill the bounding boxes with 1s
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Same as version 1.
2. **Calculate bounding boxes:**  For each object, we determine its corners. Then we shift the corners diagonally by (1,1) to get the corners of the 3x3 box. Finally, we calculate the backdrop (all indices within the box).
3. **Fill with '1':** We fill the original grid with '1' at the indices of the calculated boxes.


**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((1, (i, j)) for i in range(uppermost(obj)-1, lowermost(obj)+2) for j in range(leftmost(obj)-1, rightmost(obj)+2)), objs) # Generate 3x3 objects directly
  O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))  # Paint the expanded objects onto the original grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Same as version 1.
2. **Generate 3x3 objects:** For each object, we directly generate a new object with value '1' representing its 3x3 bounding box. 
3. **Paint the objects:** We paint the newly generated 3x3 objects onto the original grid.


**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  boxes = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj) - 1, lowermost(obj) + 2) for j in range(leftmost(obj) - 1, rightmost(obj) + 2)), objs)
  O = fill(I, 1, merge(boxes))  # Fill the boxes with 1s
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Same as version 1.
2. **Calculate bounding boxes:** Similar to version 2, we determine the top-left and bottom-right corners of the 3x3 box based on the object's boundaries. We then generate all indices within these boundaries.
3. **Fill with '1':**  We fill the grid with '1' at the calculated box indices.


**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  
  surroundings = mfilter(lambda obj:  frozenset((1, (i,j)) for di in range(-1,2) for dj in range(-1,2) for (v,(i,j)) in obj), objs) # Calculate all surrounding cells for each object
  O = paint(I, surroundings)  # Paint the surrounding cells onto the original grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Same as version 1.
2. **Calculate surrounding cells:**  We iterate through each object and for each cell in the object, we generate all its surrounding cells (including itself) with value '1'.
3. **Paint the cells:** We paint the generated surrounding cells onto the original grid.
