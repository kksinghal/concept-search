## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected areas of the same color) in the input grid and replacing them with a 3x3 square of the value '1', centered on the original object's center of mass. The background color (0) remains unchanged.

**Example:**

Input:
```
0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
```

Output:
```
0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
```

## Program Versions:

### Program Version 1: 

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  centers = mapply(centerofmass, objs)
  squares = mapply(lambda c: backdrop(shift(canvas((1,), (3,3)), subtract(c, (1,1)))), centers)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(squares))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Calculate Centers:** `centers = mapply(centerofmass, objs)` calculates the center of mass for each object.
3. **Create Squares:**  For each center `c`, a 3x3 square of '1's is created (`canvas((1,), (3,3))`), shifted to be centered at `c` (using `subtract(c, (1,1))` for the shift), and its backdrop is taken to represent the square's indices. This process is applied to all centers using `mapply`.
4. **Paint Squares:** A canvas of 0s the size of the input is created (`canvas(0, shape(I))`). All squares are merged (`merge(squares)`) and painted onto the canvas (`paint`). 
5. **Return Output:** The painted canvas `O` is returned as the final output.


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  filled_areas = mapply(lambda obj: backdrop(shift(canvas((1,), (3, 3)), subtract(centerofmass(obj), (1, 1)))), objs)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(filled_areas))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Create Filled Areas:**  For each `obj` in `objs`, its center of mass is calculated, and a 3x3 square is created, shifted, and its backdrop taken (similar to Version 1). This directly generates the indices to be filled, forming `filled_areas`.
3. **Paint and Return:** Identical to steps 4 and 5 in Version 1.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def fill_around(obj):
    c = centerofmass(obj)
    return backdrop(shift(canvas((1,), (3, 3)), subtract(c, (1, 1))))
  
  filled_areas = mfilter(fill_around, objects(I, T, F, T))
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), filled_areas)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Helper Function:** `fill_around(obj)` encapsulates the logic of calculating the center of mass and generating the indices for the 3x3 square around it.
2. **Identify Objects and Fill:** `mfilter` applies the `fill_around` function to each object identified by `objects(I, T, F, T)`, directly creating the `filled_areas`.
3. **Paint and Return:** Identical to steps 4 and 5 in Version 1.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  filled_indices = set()
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if any(manhattan((i, j), toindices(obj)) <= 1 for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)):
        filled_indices.update(backdrop(shift(canvas((1,), (3,3)), subtract((i, j), (1, 1)))))
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), frozenset(filled_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** The code iterates through every cell `(i, j)` of the input grid `I`.
2. **Check for Nearby Objects:** For each cell, it checks if any object's center of mass is within a Manhattan distance of 1.
3. **Fill If Near:** If an object is near, it generates the indices for a 3x3 square centered at `(i, j)` and adds them to `filled_indices`.
4. **Paint and Return:** Similar to previous versions, it paints the `filled_indices` onto a canvas and returns the result.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def square_indices(obj):
    i, j = centerofmass(obj)
    return {(i-1, j-1), (i-1, j), (i-1, j+1),
            (i, j-1), (i, j), (i, j+1),
            (i+1, j-1), (i+1, j), (i+1, j+1)}
  
  filled_areas = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(1, square_indices(obj)), objects(I, T, F, T))
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(filled_areas))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Helper Function:** `square_indices(obj)` calculates the indices of a 3x3 square directly from the object's center of mass, simplifying the process.
2. **Generate Filled Areas:**  `mapply` applies `square_indices` to each object and recolors the resulting indices to '1'.
3. **Paint and Return:** Similar to previous versions, it paints the `filled_areas` onto a canvas and returns the result.


## Conclusion:

These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the same transformation using the provided DSL. They showcase different combinations of functions and logic, ranging from concise and efficient solutions to more explicit and step-by-step implementations.
