## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by connected cells of the same color (excluding the background color 0) and then moving these objects to the top-left or bottom-left corner of the grid, depending on their original position. 

* **Top-Left Movement:** If the object's center of mass is located in the top half of the grid, it's moved to the top-left corner.
* **Bottom-Left Movement:** If the object's center of mass is located in the bottom half of the grid, it's moved to the bottom-left corner.

The objects retain their shape, size, and color during the transformation. The background remains unchanged.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    com = centerofmass(obj)
    target = (0, 0) if com[0] < len(I) // 2 else (len(I) - height(obj), 0)
    O = move(O, obj, subtract(target, ulcorner(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies all connected objects in the input grid `I`, considering only directly adjacent cells and excluding the background color.
2. **Iterate & Move:** The program iterates through each identified object `obj`.
3. **Determine Target:**  `centerofmass(obj)` calculates the object's center. Based on its vertical position, the target location `target` is set to either the top-left or bottom-left corner.
4. **Move Object:**  `move(O, obj, subtract(target, ulcorner(obj)))` moves the object to the `target` by calculating the required offset from its current upper-left corner. 
5. **Update Grid:** The grid `O` is updated after each object movement.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != 0:
        obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda x: (i, j) in toindices(x))
        com = centerofmass(obj)
        target = (0, 0) if com[0] < len(I) // 2 else (len(I) - height(obj), 0)
        O = move(O, obj, subtract(target, ulcorner(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version takes a different approach by iterating through each cell of the grid instead of identifying objects upfront.

1. **Iterate Cells:** The program iterates through each cell `(i, j)` with a value `val` not equal to the background color (0).
2. **Extract Object:** `extract(...)` finds the object containing the current cell `(i, j)`.
3. **Determine Target & Move:** Similar to version 1, the object's center of mass is used to determine the target location, and the object is moved accordingly.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs_top = sfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: centerofmass(obj)[0] < len(I) // 2)
  objs_bottom = sfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: centerofmass(obj)[0] >= len(I) // 2)
  O = I
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs_top):
    O = move(O, obj, subtract((0, i * width(obj)), ulcorner(obj)))
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs_bottom):
    O = move(O, obj, subtract((len(I) - height(obj), i * width(obj)), ulcorner(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on separating the objects based on their target location before moving them.

1. **Separate Objects:** `objs_top` and `objs_bottom` store objects that need to be moved to the top-left and bottom-left corners, respectively.
2. **Move Top Objects:**  The program iterates through `objs_top`, moving each object to the top-left corner with an offset based on its position in the set.
3. **Move Bottom Objects:** Similar to step 2, objects in `objs_bottom` are moved to the bottom-left corner.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, True, False, True), key=lambda obj: centerofmass(obj)[0])
  O = I
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    target = (0, 0) if i < len(objs) // 2 else (len(I) - height(obj), 0)
    O = move(O, obj, subtract(target, ulcorner(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes sorting to simplify object placement.

1. **Sort Objects:**  `sorted(objects(...), key=lambda obj: centerofmass(obj)[0])` sorts the identified objects based on the vertical position of their center of mass.
2. **Iterate & Move:** The program iterates through the sorted `objs`, determining the target location based on the object's index `i`. This ensures objects in the first half of the sorted list go to the top-left and the rest to the bottom-left.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    com = centerofmass(obj)
    target = (0, 0) if com[0] < len(I) // 2 else (len(I) - height(obj), 0)
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, subtract(target, ulcorner(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly constructs the output grid by painting objects at their target locations.

1. **Create Empty Canvas:**  `canvas(0, shape(I))` creates an empty grid `O` with the same dimensions as the input.
2. **Iterate & Paint:**  The program iterates through each object in the input, calculates its target location, and directly paints it onto the canvas `O` at the calculated position.
