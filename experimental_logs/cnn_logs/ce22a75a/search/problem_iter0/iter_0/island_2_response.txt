## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking objects defined by a single color and expanding them upwards and downwards to create solid rectangular blocks. The background color remains unchanged.

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The single '5' cells are expanded vertically to form 3x3 blocks of '1's, while the '0' background remains the same. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the previous example, the '5' cells are expanded vertically to form 3x3 blocks. However, if two blocks are adjacent in the vertical direction, they merge into a single larger block.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for o in obj:
    upper = uppermost(o)
    lower = lowermost(o)
    left = leftmost(o)
    right = rightmost(o)
    for i in range(upper, lower + 1):
      O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j) for j in range(left, right + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects in the input grid `I`. 
2. **Iterate and Expand:**  The code iterates through each identified object `o`.
3. **Determine Boundaries:** It finds the topmost (`upper`), bottommost (`lower`), leftmost (`left`), and rightmost (`right`) coordinates of the object.
4. **Fill Rectangle:** It then fills a rectangle defined by these boundaries with the value '1' in the output grid `O`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expanded_indices = merge(apply(lambda o: frozenset((i, j) for i in range(uppermost(o), lowermost(o) + 1) for j in range(leftmost(o), rightmost(o) + 1)), objs))
  O = fill(I, 1, expanded_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1, it identifies objects in the grid.
2. **Calculate Expanded Indices:** It uses `apply` to generate a set of indices for each object representing the expanded rectangle. 
3. **Merge and Fill:**  These index sets are merged using `merge` and the output grid `O` is filled with '1' at those indices.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  vlines = objects(I, T, F, F)
  expanded_objs = apply(lambda vl: frozenset((1, (i, vl[0][1][1])) for i in range(uppermost(vl), lowermost(vl) + 1)), vlines)
  O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Vertical Lines:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies vertical lines in the input (objects are considered connected only vertically).
2. **Expand Vertically:** It expands each vertical line into a rectangle with the color '1'.
3. **Paint:** The expanded objects are painted onto the output grid using `paint`.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
        start_i = None
        for i in range(len(I)):
            if I[i][j] != 0:
                if start_i is None:
                    start_i = i
            else:
                if start_i is not None:
                    O = fill(O, 1, {(k, j) for k in range(start_i, i)})
                    start_i = None
        if start_i is not None:
            O = fill(O, 1, {(k, j) for k in range(start_i, len(I))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate by Column:** It iterates through each column `j` of the input grid.
2. **Track Non-Zero Runs:** For each column, it tracks the starting row index (`start_i`) of consecutive non-zero values.
3. **Fill When Zero Encountered:** When a zero is encountered, it fills the rectangle from the previous non-zero run to the current row with '1' in the output grid.
4. **Handle Last Run:** It handles the case where the last row has non-zero values. 

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    for j in range(width(I)):
        current_color = 0
        start_row = 0
        for i in range(height(I)):
            if I[i][j] != current_color:
                if current_color != 0:
                    O = fill(O, 1, {(row, j) for row in range(start_row, i)})
                start_row = i
                current_color = I[i][j]
        if current_color != 0:
            O = fill(O, 1, {(row, j) for row in range(start_row, height(I))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates an empty canvas `O` with the same size as input `I`.
2. **Iterate by Column:** Iterates through columns of `I`.
3. **Track Color Changes:** Tracks the current color being processed and the starting row of a color block.
4. **Fill on Color Change:** When a color change is detected, fills a rectangle in `O` from the previous starting row to the current row with '1' if the previous color was not background (0).
5. **Handle Final Block:** Fills the last block of the column if the color is not background.

These are just a few examples. You can create many other variations by combining different DSL functions and approaches!
