## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all three examples seems to follow the same logic:

**Logic:** For each non-background color in the input grid:
1. Identify the object formed by connected cells of that color.
2. Extend the object horizontally until it either reaches a grid border or another object. 

Let's illustrate this with an example:

**Input_0:**
```
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0
0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
```

* **Color 1:** The object is extended rightward until it hits the right grid border.
* **Color 3:** The object is extended rightward until it hits the object of color 1.
* **Color 6:** The objects are extended rightward until they hit the right grid border.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" that implement the described transformation:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  for value in palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}:
    obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, value), I)
    right_edge = rightmost(obj)
    for j in range(right_edge + 1, width(I)):
      frontier = {(i, j) for i in range(height(I))}
      if len(intersection(toindices(obj), frontier)) > 0 and len(intersection(ofcolor(I, value), frontier)) == 0:
        break
      I = underfill(I, value, {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)})
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Colors:** Loop through each unique color in the input grid (excluding the background color).
2. **Identify Object:** Get the object formed by cells of the current color.
3. **Horizontal Scan:** For each column from the right edge of the object to the right grid border:
   - Define a vertical "frontier" line at the current column.
   - Check if the frontier intersects the object and doesn't overlap with existing cells of the same color.
   - If both conditions are met, stop the extension.
   - Otherwise, fill the cells in the current column from the object's top to bottom with the current color.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(I)):
      extension = {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)}
      if any(index(I, (i, j)) != mostcommon(I) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)):
        break
      I = paint(I, recolor(color(obj), extension))
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Objects:** Loop through each object (excluding the background) in the input grid.
2. **Horizontal Extension:** For each column from the right edge of the object to the right grid border:
   - Define a vertical "extension" line at the current column.
   - Check if any cell in the extension is not background. 
   - If any cell is not background, stop the extension.
   - Otherwise, paint the extension line with the object's color.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  for value in palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}:
    obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, value), I)
    extension = connect((uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1), (lowermost(obj), width(I) - 1))
    collision = extract(extension, lambda loc: index(I, loc) != mostcommon(I))
    if collision:
      I = underfill(I, value, difference(extension, shoot(collision, RIGHT)))
    else:
      I = underfill(I, value, extension)
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Colors:** Loop through each unique color (excluding background).
2. **Identify Object and Extension:** Get the object and define a horizontal line extending from its right edge to the grid border.
3. **Collision Detection:** Find the first non-background cell ("collision") in the extension line.
4. **Conditional Fill:**
   - If a collision exists, fill the extension line up to (excluding) the collision with the current color.
   - Otherwise, fill the entire extension line.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    collision_point = next(((i, j) for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(I)) 
                             for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) 
                             if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcommon(I)), None)
    if collision_point:
      I = underfill(I, color(obj), 
                    {(i, j) for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, collision_point[1]) 
                     for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)})
    else:
      I = underfill(I, color(obj), 
                    {(i, j) for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(I)) 
                     for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)})
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Objects:** Loop through each object (excluding the background).
2. **Find Collision:** Find the first non-background cell ("collision") within the rectangular area to the right of the object.
3. **Conditional Fill:**
   - If a collision is found, fill the rectangular area up to the collision column.
   - Otherwise, fill the entire rectangular area to the right of the object.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  for value in palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}:
    obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, value), I)
    for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(I)):
      column = {(i, j) for i in range(height(I))}
      if any(index(I, cell) == value for cell in column):
        break
      if any(index(I, cell) != mostcommon(I) for cell in column):
        break
      I = underfill(I, value, column)
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Colors:** Loop through each unique color (excluding background).
2. **Identify Object:** Get the object of the current color.
3. **Column-wise Scan:**  For each column from the object's right edge to the grid border:
   - Check if the column contains any cell of the current color or any non-background color.
   - If either condition is met, stop the extension.
   - Otherwise, fill the entire column with the current color.


These five programs demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation, utilizing different DSL functions and logic. They exemplify the potential for creative problem-solving and code diversity within the provided DSL.
