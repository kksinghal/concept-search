## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all the examples involves identifying objects of a certain color and extending them horizontally until they encounter an object of a different color. 

Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** Objects with color '1' are extended to the right. For example, the single '1' at (3,8) in the input extends rightwards in the output to become a row of '1's until encountering the '6' at (3,9).

**Pair 1:** Objects with color '7' are extended to the right. Notice how the '7's at (2,3) and (2,4) in the input extend right to become a longer object of '7's, stopping before the '3's in the output.

**Pair 2:** Objects with color '1' are extended to the right. This is similar to Pair 0 but with a simpler input structure.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each using a different approach:

**Program Version 1:**

**Code:**

```python
def solve_version1(I):
  objs = partition(I)  # Partition the grid into objects
  target_color = 1  # Define the color to extend
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, target_color) # Get objects of the target color
  for obj in target_objs:
    i, j = rightmost(obj), rightmost(toindices(obj)) # Get the rightmost point of the object
    while j < width(I) - 1 and index(I, (i, j+1)) == 0: # Extend right while encountering 0s
      obj = insert((target_color, (i, j+1)), obj) # Add the extended cell to the object
      j += 1
  O = paint(I, merge(objs)) # Paint all the objects back onto the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition:** The grid is divided into individual objects based on color.
2. **Target Identification:**  We identify the objects we want to extend, those with `target_color`.
3. **Extension:** For each target object:
    - We find its rightmost point.
    - We extend it cell by cell to the right as long as we encounter '0's and haven't reached the grid edge.
4. **Painting:** Finally, we combine all the modified objects and paint them back onto the grid.


**Program Version 2:**

**Code:**

```python
def solve_version2(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Initialize output grid with background color
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] == 1: # If cell color is 1
        O = fill(O, 1, connect((i,j), (i, width(I)-1))) # Fill horizontally from current position to the right edge with 1
        break # Move to the next row
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** We create an output grid filled with the background color of the input grid.
2. **Row-wise Iteration:** We iterate through each row of the input grid.
3. **Color Detection and Filling:** For each row, if we find a '1', we fill the output grid horizontally from that position to the right edge with '1's and then move to the next row.


**Program Version 3:**

**Code:**

```python
def solve_version3(I):
  objs = partition(I)
  target_color = 1
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == target_color:
      right_limit = rightmost(obj)  
      for i in range(leftmost(obj), right_limit + 1):  
        j = right_limit + 1 
        while j < width(I) and index(I, (i, j)) == 0:  
          obj = insert((target_color, (i, j)), obj)
          j += 1
  return paint(I, merge(objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Partitioning:** Similar to Version 1, we divide the grid into objects based on color.
2. **Target Color Handling:** We iterate through each object, and if it matches the `target_color`, we proceed with the extension.
3. **Horizontal Extension:**  For each row within the object's bounding box, starting from the object's rightmost column, we extend rightward, filling with the `target_color` as long as we encounter '0's. 


**Program Version 4:**

**Code:**

```python
def solve_version4(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)-1):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j+1] == 0: # If we find a '1' followed by a '0'
        O = fill(O, 1, connect((i,j), (i, width(I)-1))) # Fill horizontally from the '1' to the right edge with '1's
        break # Move to the next row
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Grid Modification:** This version directly modifies the input grid `I`.
2. **Sequential Search and Fill:** We iterate through each cell, checking if the current cell is '1' and the next cell to the right is '0'. If true, we fill horizontally from the current '1' to the right edge with '1's and move to the next row.


**Program Version 5:**

**Code:**

```python
def solve_version5(I):
  for j in range(width(I)-1):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        k = j + 1
        while k < width(I) and I[i][k] == 0:
          I = fill(I, 1, {(i, k)})
          k += 1
        break
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Column-wise Iteration:** This version iterates through the grid column by column.
2. **Extension Logic:** For each column, it searches for a '1'. Upon finding one, it extends it rightward by changing subsequent '0's to '1's until it encounters a non-zero value. 

These five programs provide diverse solutions to the given transformation, each highlighting different aspects of the DSL and offering varying levels of efficiency and complexity. Remember to choose the version that best suits your specific needs and constraints.
