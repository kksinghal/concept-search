## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to extend objects horizontally towards the right, until they hit another object or the edge of the grid.  Let's break it down by input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
* The '1' object at (4,3) extends rightwards, filling the space until the '1' object at (9,0). 
* The '6' objects at (8,1), (7,6) and (6,7) extend rightwards to the edge of the grid.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
* The '7' object at (3,2) extends rightwards to reach the '3' object.
* The '8' objects at (6,2) and (8,2) extend rightwards until the edge of the grid.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
* The '1' objects at (2,1), (3,0), (4,0) and (5,0) each extend rightwards until they hit either another '1' object or the grid edge.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions for the program, each with an explanation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I) # Get all objects excluding background
  for obj in objs:
    direction = (0, 1) # Define direction as rightwards
    start = rightmost(obj) # Start extending from the rightmost point of the object
    path = shoot((uppermost(obj), start), direction) # Create a path extending rightwards
    I = underfill(I, color(obj), intersection(path, backdrop(obj))) # Fill the path with object's color within its bounding box
  return I
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:**  The code first identifies all objects in the input grid using `fgpartition(I)`.
2. **Extend Rightwards:** For each object, it defines the direction of extension as rightwards `(0, 1)` and finds the rightmost point of the object using `rightmost(obj)`.
3. **Create Path:** A path is created extending rightwards from the object's rightmost point using `shoot()`.
4. **Fill Path:** The path is then filled with the object's color, but only within the object's bounding box, ensuring it doesn't overflow into other objects.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])-1):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and I[i][j+1] == mostcolor(I): # Check for object edge
        I = fill(I, I[i][j], {(i, k) for k in range(j+1, len(I[0]))}) # Fill rightwards from edge
  return I
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate and Identify Edges:** The code iterates through each cell in the grid. It identifies the right edge of an object by checking if the current cell is not the background color and the cell to the right is the background color.
2. **Fill Rightwards:** Once an edge is found, the code fills the background color cells to the right with the object's color until it reaches the grid's edge. 

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for j in range(len(I[0])-1, 0, -1): # Iterate through columns from right to left
    for i in range(len(I)): 
      if I[i][j] == mostcolor(I) and I[i][j-1] != mostcolor(I): # Find the left edge of an object
        I = fill(I, I[i][j-1], {(i, k) for k in range(j, len(I[0]))}) # Fill rightwards from the edge
  return I
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Right-to-Left Iteration:** This version iterates through the grid columns from right to left.
2. **Identify and Extend:** It identifies the left edge of an object and then fills rightward from that edge to the end of the grid. This approach ensures that already extended objects are considered when extending subsequent objects.


**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = sorted(fgpartition(I), key=lambda obj: leftmost(obj)) # Sort objects by their leftmost point
  for obj in objs:
    I = underfill(I, color(obj), {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj)+1) for j in range(leftmost(obj), len(I[0]))}) # Fill rightwards within object's vertical bounds
  return I
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Sort Objects:** It first sorts the objects based on their leftmost point to ensure correct extension even with overlapping objects.
2. **Fill within Bounds:** For each object, it fills the background color cells to the right, within the object's vertical bounds, ensuring the extension stays within the object's top and bottom rows.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    right_edge = max(j for _, (i, j) in obj) # Find the rightmost column of the object
    for _, (i, j) in obj:
      if j == right_edge: # If a cell is on the right edge
        I = underfill(I, color(obj), {(i, k) for k in range(j+1, len(I[0]))}) # Extend rightwards from that cell
  return I
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Right Edge:**  For each object, the code first determines its rightmost column.
2. **Extend from Edge Cells:** It then iterates through the object's cells. If a cell belongs to the rightmost column, it extends rightwards from that cell to the grid's edge.

Each of these program versions offers a distinct approach to achieving the observed transformation.
