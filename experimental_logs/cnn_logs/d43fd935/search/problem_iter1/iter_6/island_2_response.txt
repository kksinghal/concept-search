## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to extend horizontally the objects in the grid to the right, until they encounter another object or the grid boundary. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The '1' at (0,0) doesn't extend as it hits the grid boundary. The '1' at (9,4) extends right to the grid boundary. The '3's at (3,2) and (4,2) extend right until they hit the '1'. The '6's extend right, but some hit the grid boundary, and some hit other '6's. 
* **Input_1:** Similar extensions occur -  '7's and '8's extend rightward until encountering the grid boundary or another object. Notably, the '7' at (2,3) extends to meet the '3's, and the '8's extending from (0,6) and (2,9) merge.
* **Input_2:**  The '1's and '3's extend rightward, encountering either the grid boundary or other pre-existing objects.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions for the "Program_to_be_generated", each with a detailed explanation:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
      for k in range(j + 1, width(I)):
        if index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I):
          O = fill(O, v, {(i, k)})
        else:
          break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** `O = I` initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** `for obj in fgpartition(I)` iterates through each object (excluding the background) in the input grid.
3. **Iterate through Cells:** `for (v, (i, j)) in obj` iterates through each cell within the current object, where `v` is the value (color) and `(i, j)` is the location.
4. **Extend Right:**  `for k in range(j + 1, width(I))` iterates through column indices to the right of the current cell.
5. **Fill Condition:** `if index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I)` checks if the current cell in the loop is the background color. If true, it's filled with the object color (`v`) using `O = fill(O, v, {(i, k)})`.
6. **Stop Extension:** `else: break` stops the inner loop (extension) when another object or grid boundary is encountered.


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  filled = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      k = j + 1
      while k < width(I) and (i, k) not in filled and index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I):
        filled.add((i, k))
        k += 1
      O = fill(I, v, {(i, l) for l in range(j + 1, k)})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  It gets objects and initializes an empty set `filled` to keep track of filled cells.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each object in the grid.
3. **Cell Iteration:** Iterates through each cell of an object.
4. **Rightward Check:** It checks if the next cell to the right is within the grid bounds, not already filled, and has the background color.
5. **Fill and Update:** If the conditions hold, it marks the cell as filled and continues to the right.
6. **Fill Object:** After finding the extent of the object, it fills the cells with the object's color. 


### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in sorted(fgpartition(I), key=lambda obj: -rightmost(obj)):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      for k in range(j + 1, width(I)):
        if index(O, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I):
          O = fill(O, v, {(i, k)})
        else:
          break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** Creates an empty canvas `O` of the same size as the input grid `I`, filled with the background color.
2. **Sort Objects:** Sorts objects based on their rightmost point in descending order.
3. **Iterate and Paint:** It iterates through the sorted objects, painting each object onto the canvas.
4. **Extend Right:** Similar to previous versions, it extends each cell of the object to the right until it hits another object or the boundary.
5. **Return Output:** Returns the modified canvas `O` as the final output.


### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Initializes output `O` as the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through Cells:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid (except the last column).
3. **Check and Fill:** If a cell is not background and its right neighbor is background, fill the neighbor with the current cell's color. 
4. **Return Output:** Returns the modified grid `O`.


### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    current_color = mostcolor(I)
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        current_color = index(I, (i, j))
      O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Initializes output `O` as the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through Rows:** Iterates through each row.
3. **Track Color:**  Keeps track of the current non-background color encountered in the row.
4. **Fill and Update:** Fills the current cell with the tracked color. If a new non-background color is found, it updates the `current_color`. 
5. **Return Output:** Returns the modified grid `O`.



These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation, using different function combinations and logic.
