## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) and extending them horizontally or vertically until they hit another object or the edge of the grid. The direction of extension seems to be determined by the object's initial orientation: horizontal objects extend horizontally, and vertical objects extend vertically.

**Input 0:**

* The '1' objects at (0,0) and (9,4) remain unchanged.
* The '3' object extends horizontally to the right.
* The '6' objects extend vertically downwards.

**Input 1:**

* The '7' objects at (0,1) and (9,6) remain unchanged.
* The '3' object extends horizontally to the right.
* The '7' objects at (2,3) and (9,9) extend vertically downwards.
* The '8' objects extend horizontally to the right.

**Input 2:**

* The '3' object remains unchanged.
* All '1' objects extend vertically downwards.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  new_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    direction = (0, 1) if width(obj) > height(obj) else (1, 0)
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, direction)
    while not any(vmatching(shifted_obj, other_obj) for other_obj in objs | new_objs) and not bordering(shifted_obj, I):
      obj = shifted_obj
      shifted_obj = shift(obj, direction)
    new_objs.add(obj)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(new_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects in the input grid using `objects` function.
2. **Determine Extension Direction:** For each object, determine the extension direction based on its width and height.
3. **Extend Object:** Shift the object in the determined direction until it encounters another object or the grid border.
4. **Paint Objects:** Create a blank canvas and paint the extended objects onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(1, max(height(I), width(I))):
      if hline(obj) or (width(obj) > height(obj)):
        offset = (0, i)
      else:
        offset = (i, 0)
      shifted_obj = shift(obj, offset)
      if any(len(intersection(toindices(shifted_obj), toindices(other_obj))) > 0 for other_obj in objs) or bordering(shifted_obj, I):
        break
      O = paint(cover(O, shifted_obj), shifted_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects in the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** Iterate through potential extensions for each object, checking for collisions with other objects or the grid border.
3. **Paint on Existing Grid:** Paint the extended object onto the existing grid if no collision is detected.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        direction = (1, 0) if any(I[k][j] == I[i][j] for k in range(i)) else (0, 1)
        new_i, new_j = i, j
        while 0 <= new_i < height(I) and 0 <= new_j < width(I) and I[new_i][new_j] != mostcolor(I):
          new_i += direction[0]
          new_j += direction[1]
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (k, j)) for k in range(i, new_i)}) if direction[0] == 1 else paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, k)) for k in range(j, new_j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Blank Canvas:** Create a blank canvas with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid.
2. **Iterate through Cells:** Iterate through each cell in the input grid.
3. **Determine Extension Direction:** Determine the direction of extension based on the presence of the same color in the same row or column.
4. **Extend and Paint:** Extend the current color in the determined direction until it encounters a non-background color and paint the extension onto the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    h, w = shape(obj)
    if h > w:
      start_j = leftmost(obj)
      for j in range(start_j + w, width(I)):
        if index(I, (uppermost(obj), j)) != mostcolor(I):
          break
        O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, j)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)})
    else:
      start_i = uppermost(obj)
      for i in range(start_i + h, height(I)):
        if index(I, (i, leftmost(obj))) != mostcolor(I):
          break
        O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, j)) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects in the input grid.
2. **Determine Extension Direction:** Determine whether to extend horizontally or vertically based on the object's shape.
3. **Extend and Paint:** Extend the object in the determined direction, painting each extension onto the grid until encountering a non-background color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        if any(I[k][j] == I[i][j] for k in range(i)):
          for new_i in range(i + 1, height(I)):
            if I[new_i][j] != mostcolor(I):
              break
            O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (new_i, j))})
        else:
          for new_j in range(j + 1, width(I)):
            if I[i][new_j] != mostcolor(I):
              break
            O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, new_j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:** Iterate through each cell in the input grid.
2. **Check for Same Color Vertically:** If the current cell color is found above it in the same column, extend downwards.
3. **Check for Same Color Horizontally:** If the current cell color is not found above it but is found to its left in the same row, extend rightwards.
4. **Extend and Paint:** Extend the color in the determined direction, painting each cell until encountering a non-background color.


These five versions offer different approaches to the same problem, utilizing various DSL functions and logic to achieve the desired transformation with a similarity distance score of 0.
