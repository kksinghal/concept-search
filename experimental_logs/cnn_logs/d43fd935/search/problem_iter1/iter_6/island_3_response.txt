## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on extending objects horizontally towards the right until they connect with another object of the same color. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**
* The '1' object at (0,0) doesn't extend as there's no other '1' object to its right.
* The '6' objects at (1,8), (6,7), (7,6), (8,5) don't extend as they are not connected to any other '6' object on their left. 
* The '3' object at (3,2) extends rightwards to connect with the '1' object at (3,8), filling the cells in between.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**
* The '8' object at (2,9) doesn't extend as it is not connected to any other '8' object on its left.
* Similar to Input_0, the '7' objects at (0,1), (9,6), (8,1), (7,5) and '8' objects at (5,1), (6,8)  don't extend.
* The '3' object at (2,5) extends rightwards to connect with the '8' object at (2,8), filling the cells in between.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**
* The '1' objects at (1,4), (2,1), (5,9) and '3' objects at (6,4) don't extend as they are not connected to any other object of same color on their left. 
* The '1' object at (9,1) extends upwards to connect with the '1' object at (1,4), filling the cells in between.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I 
  for c in palette(I):  # Iterate over each color
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):  # Iterate over columns from left to right
      for i in range(height(I)):  # Iterate over rows
        if I[i][j] == c and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I):  # Check for object and background
          connected = False
          for k in range(j, -1, -1):  # Check for connection to the left
            if I[i][k] == c:
              connected = True
              break
          if connected:
            O = fill(O, c, {(i, j + 1)})  # Fill if connected
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over Colors:**  The code loops through each unique color in the input grid.
2. **Column-wise Scan:** For each color, it scans the grid column by column from left to right.
3. **Identify Extension Point:** If a cell contains the current color and the cell to its right is the background color, it proceeds to the next step.
4. **Check Left Connection:** It checks if the current cell is connected to another cell of the same color to its left.
5. **Fill:** If a left connection exists, the cell to the right is filled with the current color, effectively extending the object.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):  # Iterate over objects
    c = color(obj)
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I):  # Check for right edge and background
        connected = False
        for k in range(j, -1, -1):
          if (i, k) in toindices(obj):
            connected = True
            break
        if connected:
          O = fill(O, c, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over Objects:**  The code iterates through each object in the input grid.
2. **Check Right Edge and Background:** For each object cell, it checks if it's not on the right edge and if the cell to its right is the background.
3. **Check Left Connection (Within Object):** It checks if the current cell is connected to another cell of the same object to its left.
4. **Fill:** If connected, the cell to the right is filled with the object's color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
      c = I[i][j]
      if c != mostcolor(I) and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I):
        left_connected = any(I[i][k] == c for k in range(j))  # Efficient left connection check
        if left_connected:
          O = fill(O, c, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over Cells:** It iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check Color and Background:** It checks if the current cell is not the background color and its right neighbor is.
3. **Efficient Left Connection:** It efficiently checks if there's a cell with the same color to the left in the same row using `any`.
4. **Fill:** If connected, the cell to the right is filled.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Initialize output with background color
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    c = color(obj)
    rightmost_col = rightmost(obj)
    if rightmost_col < width(I) - 1:  # Check if the object touches the right edge
      O = paint(O, obj)  # If not, paint the object as is
    else:  
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, -1)))  # If yes, shift the object one position left and paint
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Background Canvas:** Initializes the output grid with the background color.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each object in the input grid.
3. **Right Edge Check:**  Checks if the object's rightmost point touches the grid's right edge.
4. **Paint or Shift and Paint:** If the object doesn't touch the right edge, it paints it directly onto the output canvas. Otherwise, it shifts the object one position to the left and then paints it, achieving the desired extension effect.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    current_color = None
    filling = False
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        current_color = I[i][j]
        filling = True
      elif filling and I[i][j] == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
      else:
        filling = False
        current_color = None
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Row-wise Iteration:** Iterates through each row of the input grid.
2. **Color Tracking:** Keeps track of the current object color and whether it's currently being extended.
3. **Object Detection:** When a non-background color is encountered, it's marked as the current color, and filling is set to True.
4. **Extension:** If filling is True and the current cell is the background, it's filled with the current color, extending the object.
5. **Reset:** If a different color or the end of an object is reached, filling is set to False, and the current color is reset.


These five program versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
