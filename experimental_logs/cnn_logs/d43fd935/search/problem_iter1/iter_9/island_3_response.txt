## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending specific objects within the grid horizontally towards the right. However, this extension is not arbitrary and depends on the relative positioning of other objects of the same color. Let's break down the specific rules based on the input-output pairs:

**General Rule:**

- Identify objects that have the same color and are on the same row.
- The object on the left should extend rightward towards the object on the right, but only until it touches. The right object does not move. 

**Specific Examples:**

* **Input_0:** The '1' object at (3,8) extends rightward to touch the '1' at (0,0). Similarly, the '6' at (7,6) extends to touch the '6' at (8,2).
* **Input_1:** The '7' object at (2,4) extends to reach the '7' at (9,6). The other '7' objects remain unchanged because there are no other '7' objects on the same row to their right. 
* **Input_2:** The '1' objects at (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) each extend rightward to connect with the '1' object at (5,9).

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  for obj1 in objs:
    for obj2 in objs:
      if color(obj1) == color(obj2) and obj1 != obj2 and hmatching(obj1, obj2):
        if leftmost(obj1) < leftmost(obj2):
          direction = (0, 1)
          while not adjacent(obj1, obj2):
            obj1 = shift(obj1, direction)
          grid = paint(cover(grid, obj1), obj1)
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The code first identifies all objects in the grid using `objects` function with `univalued=True` to group cells with the same value.
2. **Pairwise Comparison:** It iterates through each pair of objects (`obj1`, `obj2`).
3. **Horizontal Matching & Extension:** If the objects have the same color, are different objects, and share a common row (`hmatching`), the object on the left (`leftmost`) extends rightward (`direction = (0,1)`) using `shift` until it's adjacent to the object on the right.
4. **Grid Update:** The original object is removed (`cover`), and the extended object is painted back onto the grid (`paint`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(grid):
  for i in range(len(grid)):
    for j in range(len(grid[0])-1):
      current_color = grid[i][j]
      if current_color != mostcolor(grid):
        for k in range(j+1, len(grid[0])):
          if grid[i][k] == current_color:
            grid = fill(grid, current_color, connect((i,j),(i,k-1)))
            break
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Extend:** This program directly iterates through each cell of the grid. If a cell is not the background color, it scans rightward for another cell of the same color on the same row.
2. **Connect and Fill:** If a matching color is found, the `connect` function creates a line of indices between the current cell and the matching cell (excluding the matching cell).  The `fill` function then colors this line with the `current_color`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w - 1):
      if grid[i][j] != mostcolor(grid):
        right_indices = {(i, k) for k in range(j + 1, w)}
        for k in range(j + 1, w):
          if grid[i][k] == grid[i][j]:
            grid = fill(grid, grid[i][j], {(i, x) for x in range(j + 1, k)})
            break
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Right Indices:** This version pre-computes the indices to the right of the current cell for efficiency.
2. **Color Matching and Filling:** Similar to version 2, it iterates and extends objects rightward if a matching color is found on the same row.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)
  for obj in objs:
    right_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda x: color(x) == color(obj) and hmatching(x, obj) and leftmost(x) > leftmost(obj))
    if right_objs:
      closest = min(right_objs, key=lambda x: leftmost(x))
      grid = paint(grid, recolor(color(obj), connect(lrcorner(obj), (lrcorner(obj)[0], leftmost(closest)-1))))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object-Oriented Approach:** This version leverages the `objects` function and adopts a more object-oriented approach.
2. **Find Right Objects:** It identifies objects of the same color that share a row and are located to the right of the current object. 
3. **Closest Object and Connection:** It determines the closest object on the right and connects the right edge of the current object to the left edge of the closest object using `connect` and `recolor`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(grid):
  for y in range(len(grid)):
    last_seen = {}  # Store the last seen column index for each color
    for x in range(len(grid[0])):
      current_color = grid[y][x]
      if current_color != mostcolor(grid):
        if current_color in last_seen and last_seen[current_color] < x - 1:
          grid = fill(grid, current_color, connect((y, last_seen[current_color] + 1), (y, x - 1)))
        last_seen[current_color] = x
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Last Seen Dictionary:** This version uses a dictionary `last_seen` to keep track of the last encountered column index for each color on a given row. 
2. **Efficient Filling:**  It iterates through the grid, updating `last_seen`. If a color is encountered again on the same row and there's a gap since its last occurrence, it fills the gap using `connect` and `fill`.

These five program versions provide distinct approaches and DSL function combinations to achieve the desired transformation. Remember that these are just a few examples, and other valid solutions might exist!
