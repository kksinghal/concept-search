## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects horizontally towards the right edge of the grid, stopping just before encountering a non-background cell. 

**Input 0:** 
* The '3' object extends rightward, filling the background cells until it reaches the '1'.
* The '6' objects remain unchanged as they are already touching the right edge.
* The '1' objects remain unchanged as they are already touching the right edge.

**Input 1:**
* The top-most '8' object extends rightward, filling the background cells until it reaches the existing '8's.
* The '7' objects remain unchanged as they are already touching the right edge.
* The '3' object extends rightward, merging with the existing '8's.

**Input 2:**
* The '1' objects extend rightward until encountering another '1' or the grid edge.
* The '3' object remains unchanged as it is already touching the right edge. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  for obj in fgpartition(I):  # Iterate over foreground objects
    if rightmost(obj) != width(I) - 1:  # If the object doesn't touch the right edge
      extension = connect((uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1), (lowermost(obj), width(I) - 1))  # Line from object's right edge to the grid's right edge
      I = underfill(I, color(obj), extension)  # Extend the object by filling the line
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** The code iterates over all foreground objects in the grid.
2. **Check Right Edge:** For each object, it checks if it touches the right edge of the grid.
3. **Create Extension:** If it doesn't touch the right edge, it calculates a line (extension) from the object's rightmost point to the grid's right edge.
4. **Fill Extension:** The code then fills this extension with the object's color, effectively extending it rightward.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  for value in palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}:  # Iterate over foreground colors
    obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, value), I)  # Get the object of the current color
    while rightmost(obj) != width(I) - 1:  # Loop until the object reaches the right edge
      I = underfill(I, value, {(lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)})  # Extend the object one cell to the right
      obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, value), I)  # Update the object
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through colors:** The code iterates through each foreground color in the grid.
2. **Get Object:**  For each color, it retrieves the corresponding object.
3. **Extend Rightward:** It repeatedly extends the object one cell to the right until it reaches the grid's right edge.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
  for i in range(height(I)):  # Iterate through rows
    for j in range(width(I) - 2, -1, -1):  # Iterate through columns from right to left
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcommon(I) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == mostcommon(I):  # If a foreground cell is found followed by a background cell
        I = fill(I, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, j + 1)})  # Fill the background cell with the foreground color
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** The code iterates through each cell in the grid from right to left.
2. **Check for Extension:** It checks if the current cell is a foreground cell followed by a background cell.
3. **Extend Color:** If the condition is met, it fills the background cell with the foreground color, effectively extending the object.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
  for obj in fgpartition(I):  # Iterate over foreground objects
    target_column = width(I) - 1  # Target column is the rightmost column
    for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(I)):
      if index(I, (center(obj)[0], j)) != mostcommon(I):
        target_column = j - 1  # Find the first non-background cell and stop before it
        break
    I = underfill(I, color(obj), connect((center(obj)[0], rightmost(obj) + 1), (center(obj)[0], target_column)))  # Extend object to the target column
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** The code iterates through each foreground object.
2. **Find Target Column:** It finds the target column to extend to by iterating from the object's right edge towards the grid's right edge, stopping before encountering a non-background cell.
3. **Extend Object:**  It then extends the object horizontally to the target column.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    right_edge = shoot((uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1), RIGHT) # Create a line representing the right edge of the object
    collision = intersection(right_edge, toindices(toobject(ofcolor(I, other(palette(I), mostcommon(I))), I)))  # Check for collisions with other objects
    I = underfill(I, color(obj), difference(right_edge, collision))  # Fill the right edge, excluding collision points
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** The code iterates through each foreground object.
2. **Project Right Edge:** It creates a line representing the potential rightward extension of the object.
3. **Detect Collisions:** It checks for collisions between this projected line and any other foreground object.
4. **Extend and Avoid Collisions:** It fills the projected line with the object's color, excluding any collision points to avoid merging with other objects.


These are five distinct program versions that achieve the desired transformation, each using different logic and DSL functions. Each version provides a unique approach to solve the problem, ensuring diversity in the solutions.
