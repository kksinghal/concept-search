## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** For each object, the transformation identifies the horizontally adjacent background cells. These cells are then filled with the color of the object. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the first transformation, this one also focuses on horizontally adjacent background cells. However, in this case, the filling extends to the rightmost edge of the grid, even if the object doesn't reach the edge.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**  This transformation appears to be the identity transformation, meaning the output grid is identical to the input grid.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, each with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I  
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      for k in range(j + 1, len(I[0])):
        if index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I):
          O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, k)})
        else:
          break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialize Output:** Starts by assuming the output `O` is initially the same as the input `I`.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Iterates through each object (excluding background) in the input grid using `fgpartition(I)`.
3. **Iterate Object Cells:** For each cell `(i, j)` belonging to the current object, it iterates horizontally to the right.
4. **Fill Background:** If a cell to the right is background (`mostcolor(I)`), it fills that cell in the output `O` with the object's color (`color(obj)`) using `fill`. 
5. **Stop at Non-Background:**  The filling stops when it encounters a non-background cell, preventing filling beyond other objects.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, j))})
      for k in range(j + 1, len(I[0])):
        if k >= leftmost_j:
          O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, k)})
        else:
          break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates an empty canvas `O` of the same size and background color as the input `I`.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Iterates through each object in the input.
3. **Track Leftmost:** Stores the column index of the leftmost cell of the current object in `leftmost_j`.
4. **Paint and Fill:**  For each cell in the object:
   -  Paints the cell directly onto the canvas.
   -  Fills horizontally to the right, but only from the `leftmost_j` onwards, ensuring it doesn't fill over itself if the object isn't a single horizontal line.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      row_obj = {(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if i == i}
      if len(row_obj) > 0:
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, k) for k in range(leftmost(row_obj), len(I[0]))})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialize Output:** Starts with output `O` equal to input `I`.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Iterates through objects in the input.
3. **Iterate Rows:** For each row `i` in the grid:
   -  `row_obj`: Creates a subset of the object containing only cells in the current row.
   -  If the row has any object cells (`len(row_obj) > 0`):
     -  It fills the output `O` from the leftmost object cell in that row (`leftmost(row_obj)`) to the end of the row with the object's color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    indices = toindices(obj)
    min_j, max_j = leftmost(indices), rightmost(indices)
    for i in range(uppermost(indices), lowermost(indices) + 1):
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j) for j in range(min_j, len(I[0])) if (i, j) not in indices})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialize and Find Extremes:**  Starts with `O` as `I`. For each object, it finds the minimum and maximum column indices (`min_j`, `max_j`).
2. **Iterate Rows in Object:** Iterates over rows from the top to bottom of the object.
3. **Selective Fill:** For each row, it fills the output with the object's color but only in the range from `min_j` to the end of the grid **and** only if the cell is not already part of the object (`(i, j) not in indices`). This ensures it fills horizontally without overwriting existing object cells. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
      obj_in_row = {(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if i == i}
      if len(obj_in_row) > 0:
        j = 0
        while j < len(row):
          if (row[j], (i, j)) in obj_in_row:
            j += 1
          elif row[j] == mostcolor(I):
            O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j)})
            j += 1
          else:
            break 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialization and Iteration:** Similar to previous versions, it initializes `O` and iterates through objects and rows.
2. **Object Presence Check:**  `obj_in_row` checks if the current row contains cells from the current object.
3. **In-Row Traversal:** If the object is present in the row, it traverses the row cell by cell using a `while` loop.
4. **Conditional Filling:**
   -  If the cell belongs to the object, it simply moves to the next cell (`j += 1`).
   -  If the cell is background, it fills it with the object's color and moves to the next cell.
   -  If the cell belongs to a different object, it breaks the loop, preventing filling beyond other objects.
