## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending the color of each foreground object horizontally towards the nearest background cell in the same row.

**Input 0:**

* The '3' object extends rightward to connect with the '1' object. 
* The single '6's extend to the left and right to connect with the background.

**Input 1:**

* The '7' objects extend rightward to connect with the '8' objects.
* The '8' objects extend leftward to connect with the '7' and '3' objects.

**Input 2:**

* The vertical '1' object remains unchanged as there are no background cells on its row.
* The '3' object remains unchanged for the same reason.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using different DSL function combinations:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    obj_row = uppermost(obj)
    obj_cols = {j for i, j in toindices(obj) if i == obj_row}
    bg_cols = {j for i, j in ofcolor(I, mostcommon(I)) if i == obj_row}
    if bg_cols:
      for col in obj_cols:
        closest_bg = min(bg_cols, key=lambda j: abs(j - col))
        fill_range = range(min(col, closest_bg) + (col != closest_bg), max(col, closest_bg))
        I = underfill(I, color(obj), {(obj_row, j) for j in fill_range})
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:**  For each foreground object (`fgpartition(I)`), find its row (`uppermost(obj)`).
2. **Find object and background columns:** Identify the column indices of the object and background cells in that row.
3. **Find closest background:** For each object column, find the closest background column.
4. **Fill horizontally:** Fill the cells between the object column and the closest background column (excluding the object and background cells themselves).


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    row = uppermost(obj)
    left_edge = leftmost(obj)
    right_edge = rightmost(obj)
    for j in range(left_edge, right_edge + 1):
      if (row, j) in toindices(obj):
        continue
      left_bg = next((j for j in range(j, -1, -1) if (row, j) in ofcolor(I, mostcommon(I))), None)
      right_bg = next((j for j in range(j, len(I[0])) if (row, j) in ofcolor(I, mostcommon(I))), None)
      if left_bg is not None or right_bg is not None:
        I = underfill(I, color(obj), {(row, j)})
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Find object edges:** Identify the leftmost and rightmost columns of the object.
3. **Iterate within object boundaries:** Check each cell within the object's horizontal span.
4. **Search for background:** For each cell, search left and right for the nearest background cell.
5. **Fill if background found:** If a background cell is found in either direction, fill the current cell with the object's color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    obj_indices = toindices(obj)
    row = uppermost(obj)
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if (row, j) not in obj_indices:
        left_obj = next(((row, k) for k in range(j, -1, -1) if (row, k) in obj_indices), None)
        right_obj = next(((row, k) for k in range(j, len(I[0])) if (row, k) in obj_indices), None)
        if left_obj is not None and right_obj is not None:
          I = underfill(I, color(obj), {(row, j)})
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Iterate through each column in the row:**  Check every column in the row of the current object.
3. **Check for object presence on both sides:** Determine if the current column has object cells to both its left and right.
4. **Fill if object found on both sides:** If object cells are found on both sides, fill the current cell with the object's color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    row = uppermost(obj)
    fill_cols = set()
    for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1):
      if (row, j) in toindices(obj):
        fill_cols.add(j)
      elif fill_cols:
        I = underfill(I, color(obj), {(row, j)})
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Track object columns:** While iterating through the object's horizontal span, keep track of encountered object columns.
3. **Fill until next object column:**  Fill cells with the object's color until the next object column is reached.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    obj_row = uppermost(obj)
    left_bound = leftmost(obj)
    right_bound = rightmost(obj)
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if left_bound <= j <= right_bound and (obj_row, j) not in toindices(obj):
        I = underfill(I, color(obj), {(obj_row, j)})
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Determine object boundaries:** Identify the leftmost and rightmost column of the object.
3. **Iterate through each column:** Check every column in the grid.
4. **Fill if within object bounds and background:** If the current column is within the object's horizontal boundaries and is a background cell, fill it with the object's color.


These five versions utilize various logic and DSL function combinations to achieve the same transformation, ensuring diversity in the proposed solutions. Each version effectively extends the color of foreground objects horizontally towards the nearest background cell in the same row, replicating the observed pattern in the provided input-output pairs.
