## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying objects (connected components of the same digit) and extending them horizontally to the right until they hit another object or the edge of the grid.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
* The '1' objects are extended rightwards. The top one hits the edge, the bottom one hits the '6' object.
* The '6' objects are extended rightwards, each hitting either another '6' object or the edge.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
* The '7' and '8' objects at the top are extended rightwards to the edge.
* The central '7' object is extended rightwards to meet the '3' object.
* The '8' objects in the middle are extended rightwards to the edge.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
*  All '1' objects are extended rightwards to either another '1' object or the edge of the grid.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions for the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False) # Get all objects
  filled_grid = I
  for obj in objs:
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
    rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
    for j in range(leftmost_j, width(I)):
      shifted_obj = shift(obj, (0, j - leftmost_j))
      if any(index(I, (i, j)) != 0 for v, (i, j) in shifted_obj):
        break
      filled_grid = paint(filled_grid, shifted_obj)
  return filled_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, False)` identifies all connected components (objects) in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** For each object:
   - Find its leftmost and rightmost column indices.
   - Iterate through columns from the leftmost to the grid's right edge.
   - Shift the object rightwards.
   - Check for collisions: If the shifted object overlaps with any non-zero cell, stop extending.
   - If no collision, paint the shifted object onto the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
      if I[i][j] != 0 and I[i][j + 1] == 0:
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], connect((i, j), (i, width(I) - 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Cells:** Loop through each cell in the grid.
2. **Extend Rightwards:** If a cell is non-zero and its right neighbor is zero, extend the digit rightwards:
   - Use `connect` to create a line from the current cell's index to the right edge of the grid.
   - Fill this line with the current cell's digit using `fill`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  for j in range(width(I) - 1):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if I[i][j] != 0 and I[i][j + 1] == 0:
        obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: (i, j) in toindices(obj))
        O = paint(I, shift(obj, (0, 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Columns:** Loop through each column of the grid.
2. **Find Extendable Cells:** For each cell, if it's non-zero and its right neighbor is zero:
   - Find the object this cell belongs to using `objects` and `extract`.
   - Shift the entire object one position to the right.
   - Paint the shifted object onto the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    min_j = leftmost(obj)
    max_j = next((j for j in range(min_j + 1, width(I)) if any(i in {i for i, k in ofcolor(I, index(I, (i, j)))} for i, k in toindices(obj))), width(I))
    O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), product(range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1), range(min_j, max_j))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Create an empty canvas of the same size as the input.
2. **Process Objects:** Iterate through each object:
   - Find the leftmost column (`min_j`).
   - Determine the rightmost column (`max_j`) by finding the next column with a colliding object or the grid's edge.
   - Fill a rectangular region on the canvas from `min_j` to `max_j` with the object's color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val != 0 and j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 0:
                collision_point = next((k for k in range(j + 2, width(I)) if I[i][k] != 0), width(I))
                O = fill(O, val, frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j + 1, collision_point)))
    return O

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Fill:** Loop through each cell in the grid.
2. **Identify Extendable Cells:** If a cell has a non-zero value and its right neighbor is 0:
   - Determine the collision point (the next non-zero cell or the grid's edge).
   - Fill the cells between the current cell and the collision point with the current cell's value.


These are five distinct ways to achieve the described grid transformation. Each program uses different logic and DSL function combinations, showcasing diverse solution approaches.
