## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) and extending them horizontally or vertically until they hit another object or the edge of the grid. The direction of extension seems to be determined by the object's initial orientation: horizontal objects extend horizontally, and vertical objects extend vertically. 

**Input 0:** 
* The single '1' objects extend horizontally.
* The '6' objects at the edges remain unchanged. 
* The '3x3' object remains unchanged.

**Input 1:**
* The horizontal lines of '7's extend horizontally.
* The vertical lines of '8's extend vertically.
* The '3x3' object remains unchanged.

**Input 2:**
* The vertical lines of '1's extend vertically.
* The '3x3' object remains unchanged.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code using the provided DSL, each with an explanation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_version1(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False) # Get all objects
  filled = I
  for obj in objs:
    if hline(obj) or vline(obj): # Check if object is a line
      bbox = backdrop(obj)  # Get bounding box
      fill_value = color(obj) # Get the object's color
      filled = fill(filled, fill_value, bbox) # Fill the bounding box
  O = filled
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, False)` identifies all connected regions of the same digit in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** It iterates through each object. If an object is a horizontal or vertical line (`hline(obj)` or `vline(obj)`), it calculates the object's bounding box (`backdrop(obj)`) and fills it with the object's color (`fill(filled, fill_value, bbox)`).
3. **Output:** The modified grid with extended objects is returned.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_version2(I):
  objs = partition(I) # Partition the grid into objects
  extended_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    if hline(obj):
      extension = backdrop(obj)
    elif vline(obj):
      extension = backdrop(obj)
    else:
      extension = toindices(obj) 
    extended_objs.add(recolor(color(obj), extension)) # Recolor the extension
  O = paint(I, merge(extended_objs)) # Paint extended objects onto the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition:** `partition(I)` divides the grid into separate objects based on color.
2. **Determine Extension:** For each object, it checks if it's a horizontal or vertical line and calculates the extension area (bounding box). For non-line objects, the extension is just the object itself.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** The extension area is then recolored (`recolor()`) with the object's color and painted onto a copy of the original grid (`paint()`).
4. **Output:** The modified grid is returned.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_version3(I):
  painted = I
  for value in palette(I):
    obj = frozenset((value, (i, j)) for i, r in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(r) if v == value)
    if hline(obj):
        painted = fill(painted, value, backdrop(obj))
    elif vline(obj):
        painted = fill(painted, value, backdrop(obj))
  O = painted
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Colors:** This version iterates through each unique color (`palette(I)`) in the grid.
2. **Find Object and Extend:**  For each color, it extracts the corresponding object and checks if it's a line. If so, it fills the object's bounding box with the current color.
3. **Output:** The modified grid is returned.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_version4(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  new_grid = [[I[i][j] for j in range(w)] for i in range(h)] 
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I): # Ignore background color
        if i > 0 and I[i-1][j] == I[i][j]: # Extend vertically upwards
          new_grid[i][j] = I[i-1][j]
        if j > 0 and I[i][j-1] == I[i][j]: # Extend horizontally leftwards
          new_grid[i][j] = I[i][j-1]
  O = tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create New Grid:** Creates a new grid, initially a copy of the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** Iterates through each cell, excluding cells with the background color. It checks adjacent cells (up and left) and extends the object if it finds a matching color. 
3. **Output:** Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_version5(I):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    output = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))  # Canvas filled with background color
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
                obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: (i, j) in toindices(obj))
                if hline(obj) or vline(obj):
                    output = paint(output, recolor(I[i][j], backdrop(obj)))
                else:
                    output = paint(output, {(I[i][j], (i, j))})
    O = output
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Background Canvas:** Creates a canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate and Paint:** Iterates through the input grid. For each non-background cell, it extracts the object containing that cell. If the object is a line, it paints the bounding box onto the canvas. Otherwise, it paints just the single cell.
3. **Output:** Returns the canvas as the output grid.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to solving the problem using different combinations of DSL functions, showcasing diverse logic and code structures.
