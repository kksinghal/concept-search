## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending a specific object in the input grid horizontally until it reaches another object of a different color. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:** The object with color '1' located at the top right corner of the grid is extended horizontally to the right until it reaches the object with color '6'. 

**Input_1 - Output_1:** The object with color '7' located at the middle left edge of the grid is extended horizontally to the right until it reaches the object with color '3'. The object with color '8' located at the middle right edge is extended horizontally to the left until it reaches the object with color '3'.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**  No transformation is applied as there is no object that can be extended horizontally to reach another object of a different color.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve_f1cefba8(I):
    objs = objects(I, F, F, T)  # Extract all foreground objects
    for obj in objs:
        for direction in [LEFT, RIGHT]:  # Check for extension in both directions
            shifted_obj = shift(obj, direction)
            while not intersection(toindices(shifted_obj), asindices(I) - toindices(obj)):
                # Extend the object until it hits another object
                shifted_obj = shift(shifted_obj, direction)
            # Recolor the extended portion
            I = underfill(I, color(obj), toindices(shifted_obj)) 
    O = I
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Foreground Objects:**  `objects(I, F, F, T)` extracts all foreground objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** The code iterates through each extracted object (`obj`) and both horizontal directions (`LEFT` and `RIGHT`).
3. **Collision Detection:** `intersection(toindices(shifted_obj), asindices(I) - toindices(obj))` checks if the shifted object collides with other objects.
4. **Extension and Recoloring:**  The object is iteratively shifted and extended until a collision is detected. `underfill` fills the extended area with the object's color.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve_f1cefba8(I):
    for value in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}: # Iterate through each color
        obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, value), I)
        for d in [LEFT, RIGHT]:
            frontier = toindices(obj)
            while True:
                next_frontier = shift(frontier, d)
                if not intersection(next_frontier, asindices(I)) or any(index(I, loc) != mostcolor(I) for loc in next_frontier):
                    break
                frontier = next_frontier
            I = underfill(I, value, frontier)
    O = I
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Colors:**  The code iterates through each unique color in the grid except the background color.
2. **Identify Object and Frontier:** For each color, it identifies the corresponding object and its initial frontier.
3. **Expand Frontier:** It expands the frontier in each horizontal direction until it hits another object or the grid border.
4. **Recolor Extension:** `underfill` fills the extended area (the final frontier) with the object's color.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve_f1cefba8(I):
    O = I
    for x in range(len(I[0])):
        for y in range(len(I)):
            if I[y][x] != mostcolor(I):
                current_color = I[y][x]
                for d in [1, -1]:
                    nx = x + d
                    while 0 <= nx < len(I[0]) and I[y][nx] == mostcolor(I):
                        O = fill(O, current_color, {(y, nx)})
                        nx += d
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Cells:** The code iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Identify Non-Background Cells:** It checks if a cell is not part of the background.
3. **Horizontal Extension:** For each non-background cell, it extends horizontally in both directions until it encounters a non-background color or the edge of the grid.
4. **Fill Extension:** `fill` is used to color the extended cells with the starting cell's color.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve_f1cefba8(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I) 
    for obj in objs:
        ul = ulcorner(obj)
        lr = lrcorner(obj)
        if ul[0] == lr[0]:  # Check if object is on a single row
            left_extension = {(ul[0], j) for j in range(0, ul[1])}
            right_extension = {(lr[0], j) for j in range(lr[1] + 1, len(I[0]))}
            I = underfill(I, color(obj), left_extension)
            I = underfill(I, color(obj), right_extension)
    O = I
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition Foreground:**  `fgpartition(I)` separates the input grid into objects excluding the background.
2. **Identify Single-Row Objects:** For each object, it determines if it lies completely within a single row by comparing the row indices of its upper-left and lower-right corners.
3. **Horizontal Extension:** If the object occupies a single row, it extends it to the left and right edges of the grid using pre-calculated extension sets.
4. **Fill Extensions:** `underfill` colors the extended areas with the object's color.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve_f1cefba8(I):
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I):
                current_color = I[i][j]
                # Extend left
                k = j - 1
                while k >= 0 and I[i][k] == mostcommon(I):
                    I = fill(I, current_color, {(i, k)})
                    k -= 1
                # Extend right
                k = j + 1
                while k < len(I[0]) and I[i][k] == mostcommon(I):
                    I = fill(I, current_color, {(i, k)})
                    k += 1
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Identify:** The code iterates through each cell and checks if it's not the background color.
2. **Extend Left and Right:** For each non-background cell, it extends to the left and right by filling cells with the object's color until encountering a non-background color or the edge.

These are five distinct programs, each using different logic and function combinations from the DSL to achieve the desired grid transformation.
