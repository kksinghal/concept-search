## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation logic involves extending objects horizontally towards other objects of the same color. This extension stops when another object or the grid boundary is reached.

**Input 0:**

* The '3' object extends rightward to connect with the single '1' cell.
* The '6' objects extend rightward to connect with other '6' cells.

**Input 1:**

* The top-right '8' object extends leftward to connect with other '8' cells.
*  The '7' objects extend rightward to connect with other '7' cells.
*  The '3' object extends rightward to connect with the rightmost '8' cell.

**Input 2:**

* The '1' objects extend downward to connect with other '1' cells.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Get objects without background
  for obj in objs:
    for direction in [(0, 1)]:  # Extend rightward
      shifted_obj = shift(obj, direction)
      while not intersection(toindices(shifted_obj), toindices(objs - {obj})) and \
            not bordering(shifted_obj, I):  # Stop at other objects or border
        obj = combine(obj, shifted_obj)  # Extend object
        shifted_obj = shift(obj, direction)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(objs))  # Paint objects back onto canvas
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** Extract objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Iterative Extension:** Iterate through each object and extend it rightward one cell at a time.
3. **Collision Check:** Check if the extended object intersects with another object or touches the grid boundary.
4. **Object Merging:** If no collision occurs, merge the extended portion with the original object.
5. **Grid Reconstruction:**  After extending all objects, paint them onto a blank canvas of the original grid's size.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        k = j + 1
        while k < len(I[0]) and I[i][k] == mostcolor(I):
          O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, k)})
          k += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Rows:** Loop through each row of the input grid.
2. **Identify Objects:** For each cell in a row, check if it belongs to an object (different from the background color).
3. **Extend Rightward:** If an object cell is found, iterate through the cells to its right.
4. **Fill Background:** If a background cell is encountered, fill it with the object's color, effectively extending the object.
5. **Stop at Object or Boundary:** Continue filling until another object cell or the grid boundary is reached.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  new_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    rightmost_col = rightmost(obj)
    for other_obj in objs - {obj}:
      if color(obj) == color(other_obj) and hmatching(obj, other_obj):
        connection_line = connect((uppermost(obj), rightmost_col), (uppermost(obj), leftmost(other_obj)))
        obj = combine(obj, recolor(color(obj), intersection(connection_line, asindices(I))))
    new_objs.add(obj)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(new_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:** Extract all objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Matching Objects:** For each object, find other objects of the same color that share a common row.
3. **Connection Line:** Draw a horizontal line connecting the rightmost point of the current object to the leftmost point of the matching object.
4. **Object Extension:** Fill the connection line with the object's color, effectively extending the object until it reaches the other object.
5. **Grid Reconstruction:** After processing all objects, paint the modified objects onto a blank canvas of the original grid's size.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(height(I)):
      row_segment = {(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if i == uppermost(obj)}
      if len(row_segment) > 0:
        start_j = leftmost(row_segment)
        end_j = rightmost(row_segment)
        for j in range(start_j, end_j):
          if I[i][j] == mostcolor(I):
            O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** Identify and store all objects in the input grid except the background.
2. **Row Iteration:**  Loop through each row of the input grid.
3. **Object Segment:** For each object, extract the portion of the object present in the current row.
4. **Horizontal Filling:** If an object segment exists in the row, identify its leftmost and rightmost points. Fill all background cells within these points with the object's color.
5. **Grid Update:** Update the output grid with the filled cells, effectively extending the object horizontally.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for i in range(len(I)):
    current_color = None
    fill_start = None
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and current_color is None:
        current_color = I[i][j]
        fill_start = j
      elif I[i][j] == mostcolor(I) and current_color is not None:
        I = fill(I, current_color, {(i, j)})
      elif I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and I[i][j] != current_color:
        current_color = None
        fill_start = None
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Row-wise Processing:** Iterate through each row of the input grid.
2. **Track Object Color:** While traversing a row, keep track of the current object color encountered.
3. **Mark Fill Start:** Store the column index where an object starts.
4. **Fill Background:** If a background cell is found after an object has started, fill it with the tracked object color.
5. **Reset Tracking:** If a different object or the grid boundary is encountered, reset the object color and fill start marker.
