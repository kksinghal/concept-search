## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on extending non-background objects horizontally in both directions (left and right) until they encounter another non-background object or the grid edge. 

* **Input 0:**  The '1' objects at the top and bottom are extended rightward until hitting the '6' object. The '3' object extends rightward to meet the '1' object (which was already extended). Similarly, the '6' objects extend leftward.
* **Input 1:** The '7' and '8' objects extend to their respective sides until hitting other objects. Note how the top '8' object extends rightward to meet the rightmost '8' object.
* **Input 2:**  The '1' and '3' objects remain unchanged as they are already touching other objects or the grid edges.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions for "Program_to_be_generated":

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):
    for d in [LEFT, RIGHT]:
      extension = shift(obj, d)
      while not intersection(toindices(extension), asindices(I) - toindices(obj)):
        extension = shift(extension, d)
      I = underfill(I, color(obj), toindices(extension))
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** We use `objects(I, F, F, T)` to get each non-background object in the input grid `I`.
2. **Extend in both directions:** For each object, we iterate through `[LEFT, RIGHT]` to handle both directions.
3. **Extend until collision:** The `while` loop extends the object by shifting it (`shift`) in the current direction `d` until it collides with any other object or grid edge. Collision is detected by checking for an intersection (`intersection`) between the extended object indices and the indices of other objects in the grid.
4. **Fill the extension:**  We use `underfill` to fill the extended area with the object's color, ensuring we don't overwrite existing non-background cells. 
5. **Update the grid:** The modified grid `I` is updated within the loop to reflect the extensions.
6. **Return the output:** The final modified grid is assigned to `O` and returned.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    left_edge = hfrontier((uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)-1))
    right_edge = hfrontier((uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj)+1))
    left_extension = intersection(left_edge, asindices(I))
    right_extension = intersection(right_edge, asindices(I))
    I = underfill(I, color(obj), left_extension)
    I = underfill(I, color(obj), right_extension)
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1, we identify all foreground objects.
2. **Define Extension Boundaries:** For each object, we define its left and right extension boundaries using `hfrontier`.
3. **Find Extension Points:** We then find the actual grid cells that are part of the extension by taking an intersection (`intersection`) of the boundaries with all grid indices (`asindices(I)`). 
4. **Fill Extensions:** Finally, we use `underfill` to fill the determined extension points with the corresponding object's color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  for x in range(width(I)):
    I = apply(lambda row: extend_row(row, x), I)
  O = I
  return O

def extend_row(row, x):
  if x == 0 or x == len(row) - 1:
    return row
  left_val = row[x-1]
  right_val = row[x+1]
  if row[x] == 0 and (left_val != 0 or right_val != 0):
    return row[:x] + (left_val if left_val != 0 else right_val,) + row[x+1:]
  return row
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Columns:** This version iterates through each column of the grid `I` using `width(I)`.
2. **Extend Rows:** For each column index `x`, it applies the `extend_row` function to each row of the grid using `apply`.
3. **Row Extension Logic:** The `extend_row` function checks if a cell at index `x` is empty (`row[x] == 0`) and has a non-empty neighbor to its left or right. If yes, it fills the cell with the neighbor's value; otherwise, keeps the cell unchanged.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      for d in [LEFT, RIGHT]:
        k = 1
        while (i, j + k * d[1]) in asindices(I) and I[i][j + k * d[1]] == 0:
          I = fill(I, color(obj), {(i, j + k * d[1])})
          k += 1
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Extend:** This version iterates through each cell (`i, j`) of each object and extends it horizontally in both directions (`d`) as long as it encounters empty cells (`I[i][j + k * d[1]] == 0`) within the grid boundaries.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  for i in range(height(I)):
    I = tuple(tuple(extend_line(row)) for row in vsplit(I, height(I)))
  O = I
  return O

def extend_line(line):
  new_line = list(line)
  for i in range(1, len(line) - 1):
    if new_line[i] == 0 and (new_line[i - 1] != 0 or new_line[i + 1] != 0):
      new_line[i] = new_line[i - 1] if new_line[i - 1] != 0 else new_line[i + 1]
  return tuple(new_line)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Split into Rows and Extend:** This version splits the grid into individual rows using `vsplit` and applies the `extend_line` function to each row.
2. **Line Extension Logic:** The `extend_line` function uses a similar logic to `extend_row` in Program Version 3 but operates on a single line (row) at a time. 

**Note:** These are just five possible solutions. There can be other creative and efficient ways to implement the described transformation using the provided DSL.
