## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on extending objects horizontally to the right, stopping only when encountering another object or the grid border.  Here's a breakdown for each example:

**Input 0:**

* The '1' objects remain unchanged as they are already touching the grid border.
* The '3' object extends rightward, incorporating the '1' to its right. 
* The '6' objects remain unchanged as they are either touching another object or the grid border.

**Input 1:**

* The '7' objects remain unchanged as they are either touching another object or the grid border.
* The '3' object extends rightward, incorporating the '8' to its right.
* The '8' objects on the right edge remain unchanged as they are touching the border.

**Input 2:**

* All '1' objects extend rightward until reaching another '1' or the grid border.
* The '3' object remains unchanged as it is already touching another '3'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def extend_right(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects excluding background
  extended_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    extended_obj = obj  # Initialize the extended object
    for j in range(leftmost(obj), width(I)):  # Iterate through columns from object's leftmost point
      right_edge = {(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in extended_obj if j == rightmost(extended_obj)}  # Find the rightmost cells
      if any(index(I, (i, j + 1)) != mostcolor(I) for v, (i, j) in right_edge):  # Check if any cell to the right is not background
        break  # Stop extending if an object or border is encountered
      extended_obj = extended_obj | {(index(I, (i, j + 1)), (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in right_edge}  # Extend the object
    extended_objs.add(extended_obj)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(extended_objs))  # Paint the extended objects on a blank canvas
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Identify all objects in the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** Loop through each object. For every column from the object's leftmost point to the grid's right edge, check if the adjacent cell to the right is background. If it is, add that cell to the object. 
3. **Stop at Obstacles:**  The extension halts if a non-background cell is encountered, signifying another object or the grid border.
4. **Paint and Return:**  Finally, paint all extended objects onto a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def extend_right(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):  # If the cell is not background
        left_color = index(I, (i, j))  # Store the current cell color
        for k in range(j, width(I)):  # Iterate rightward from the current cell
          if index(I, (i, k)) != mostcolor(I):  # If a non-background cell is encountered
            left_color = index(I, (i, k))  # Update the color to be painted 
          O = fill(O, left_color, {(i, k)})  # Paint the cell with the stored color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Blank Canvas:**  Begin with a blank canvas of the same dimensions and background color as the input.
2. **Iterate and Paint:**  Traverse the input grid row by row, cell by cell. 
3. **Non-Background Action:** If a non-background cell is encountered, store its color. Then, iterate rightward, painting each cell with the stored color until reaching the grid border.  
4. **Color Update:** If another non-background cell is found during the rightward iteration, update the stored color to the new cell's color and continue painting.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def extend_right(I):
  return vconcat(*[tuple(extend_row(row) for row in hsplit(I, 1))] ) # Process each row individually and reassemble

def extend_row(row):
  output_row = list(row)  # Create a modifiable list from the row
  current_color = 0
  for j in range(len(row)):
    if row[j] != mostcommon(row):  # If the current cell is not background
      current_color = row[j]  # Update the current color
    output_row[j] = current_color  # Paint the current cell
  return tuple(output_row)  # Convert back to a tuple
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Split and Process:** Split the input grid into individual rows and process each row with the `extend_row` function.
2. **Row Extension:** In `extend_row`, iterate through each cell. If it's not a background cell, update the 'current_color'. Otherwise, paint the cell with the 'current_color'.
3. **Reassemble:** Combine the processed rows back into a grid. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def extend_right(I):
  O = I  # Start with the input grid
  for j in range(width(I) - 1):  # Iterate through columns, excluding the last one
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I) and index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):  # If the current cell is colored and the next cell is background
        O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, j + 1)})  # Paint the next cell with the current cell's color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Compare:**  Loop through the grid column by column. For each cell, check if it's a non-background cell and its right neighbor is a background cell.
2. **Fill Rightward:** If the condition is met, paint the right neighbor cell with the current cell's color. 
3. **Iterative Extension:**  This process repeats, effectively extending objects one cell to the right in each iteration until they encounter an obstacle or the grid border.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def extend_right(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create an empty grid
  for obj in objs:
    min_j = leftmost(obj)  # Find the leftmost column of the object
    max_j = rightmost(obj)  # Find the rightmost column of the object
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):  # Iterate through the rows where the object is present
      for j in range(min_j, max_j + 1): 
        if (i, j) in toindices(obj) or j > max_j:
          new_grid = fill(new_grid, color(obj), {(i, j)})  # Fill from leftmost to rightmost, and beyond
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:**  Identify all distinct objects in the input grid.
2. **Blank Canvas:** Create an empty grid with the same dimensions and background color as the input.
3. **Iterate and Extend:**  For each object, find its bounding box (leftmost, rightmost, topmost, bottommost points).  
4. **Fill and Overwrite:** Fill the new grid with the object's color, starting from the object's leftmost column and continuing to its rightmost column and beyond, effectively extending it until the grid edge.

These five program versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the rightward extension transformation. Each employs a different combination of DSL functions, showcasing the flexibility and power of the provided language.
