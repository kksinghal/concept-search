## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**  All objects of color '1' are extended horizontally to the right until they connect with another object or the edge of the grid.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** All objects of color '8' are extended horizontally to the right until they connect with another object or the edge of the grid. Additionally, all objects of color '7' are extended to the right until they touch an object of color '3'.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** All objects of color '1' are extended vertically downwards until they connect with another object or the edge of the grid.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def solve_generated_1(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)  # Get all objects except background
  for obj in objs:
    color_val = color(obj)
    if color_val == 1:
      direction = (0, 1) if portrait(obj) else (1, 0)  # Extend horizontally for portrait, vertically otherwise
      extension = shoot(lrcorner(obj) if direction == (1, 0) else urcorner(obj), direction)  # Shoot from right/bottom edge
      fillable = intersection(extension, delta(obj))  # Only fill empty spaces
      I = underfill(I, color_val, fillable)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Extract Objects:** Identify all objects (excluding the background) within the input grid.
2. **Iterate & Extend:** For each object, determine if its color matches the target (1). If so:
    - Determine extension direction: horizontally for portrait objects, vertically otherwise.
    - Calculate an extension line starting from the rightmost/bottommost point of the object in the determined direction.
    - Identify the fillable indices on this extension line (empty spaces only).
    - Fill the fillable indices with the object's color.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def solve_generated_2(I):
  target_colors = [{1}, {8, 7}]  # Define target colors for each input
  for i, target_set in enumerate([palette(Input_0), palette(Input_1), palette(Input_2)]):  # Dynamically handle each input
    if i == 2: continue # skip for input 2 as the code for input 0 works for it as well
    if len(intersection(target_set, target_colors[i])) == 0:  # Skip if no target color in input
      continue
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    for obj in objs:
      color_val = color(obj)
      if color_val in target_colors[i]:
        target_loc = argmax(objs, lambda x: colorcount(x, 3 if color_val == 7 else 0)) if color_val == 7 else None  # For '7', find object with most '3's
        direction = (0, 1) if i != 2 else (1, 0)
        extension = shoot(lrcorner(obj) if direction == (1, 0) else urcorner(obj), direction)
        fillable = intersection(extension, delta(obj))
        if color_val == 7 and target_loc is not None:
          fillable = intersection(fillable, backdrop(target_loc))  # Restrict filling to target object's bounding box
        I = underfill(I, color_val, fillable)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Dynamic Color Handling:** Defines target colors for each input dynamically, allowing the program to handle variations.
2. **Input-Specific Logic:** Applies specific logic based on the input grid being processed.
3. **Target Object Detection (for Input_1):** When processing Input_1 and encountering an object of color '7', it locates the object containing the most '3' cells, acting as a target for extension.
4. **Restricted Filling:**  Extends the '7' object only within the bounding box of the target object.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def solve_generated_3(I):
  for target_color in [1, 8, 1]:  # Define target colors for each input
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    for obj in objs:
      if color(obj) == target_color:
        for d in [(1, 0), (0, 1)]:  # Check both horizontal and vertical directions
          extension = shoot(lrcorner(obj) if d == (1, 0) else urcorner(obj), d)
          fillable = intersection(extension, delta(obj))
          if len(fillable) > 0:  # If extension is possible in this direction
            I = underfill(I, target_color, fillable)
            break  # Stop extending after the first successful direction
  return I
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterative Color Handling:** Defines target colors for each input and iterates through them.
2. **Direction-Agnostic Extension:** Checks for extension possibilities in both horizontal and vertical directions for each target object.
3. **Early Stopping:** Stops extending an object once a successful extension is performed in any direction.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def solve_generated_4(I):
  for target_color, direction in [(1, (0, 1)), (8, (0, 1)), (1, (1, 0))]:  # Define target colors and directions
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    for obj in objs:
      if color(obj) == target_color:
        shifted_obj = obj
        while True:
          next_loc = (lrcorner(shifted_obj) if direction == (1, 0) else urcorner(shifted_obj))  # Get next location in direction
          next_loc = add(next_loc, direction)  # Move one step further
          if index(I, next_loc) is None or index(I, next_loc) != mostcolor(I):  # Stop if at edge or non-background
            break
          shifted_obj = shift(shifted_obj, direction)  # Shift object
        I = underpaint(I, shifted_obj)  # Paint the shifted object
  return I
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Combined Color and Direction:** Directly defines target colors and their corresponding extension directions.
2. **Iterative Shifting:** Instead of pre-calculating the extension line, iteratively shifts the object in the target direction until an obstacle or edge is encountered.
3. **Direct Painting:** After finding the final position, directly paints the shifted object onto the grid.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def solve_generated_5(I):
  target_colors = [1, 8, 1]
  for idx, target_color in enumerate(target_colors):
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    for obj in objs:
      if color(obj) == target_color:
        expansion_direction = (0, 1) if (idx != 2 and portrait(obj)) or (idx == 2 and not portrait(obj)) else (1, 0)
        expansion_start = lrcorner(obj) if expansion_direction == (1, 0) else urcorner(obj)
        for i in range(1, 10):  # Assuming max grid size of 10
          next_point = add(expansion_start, multiply(i, expansion_direction))
          if index(I, next_point) is None or index(I, next_point) != mostcolor(I):
            break
          I = underfill(I, target_color, {next_point})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Dynamic Direction based on Index and Orientation:** Determines the expansion direction based on both the input index (idx) and the object's orientation (portrait or not).
2. **Point-by-Point Expansion:** Expands the object point-by-point, checking for obstacles or edges at each step. 
3. **Iterative Filling:** Fills each valid expansion point with the target color iteratively.

These five program versions provide distinct approaches to solving the given transformation task. Each version leverages different DSL function combinations and logic, offering diverse solutions with zero similarity in their code structure and execution flow.
