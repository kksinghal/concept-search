## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects (groups of the same digit) along a straight line towards the nearest background cell (digit '0'). 

**Input_0:** The '1' and '6' objects extend horizontally to the right until they reach a background cell.

**Input_1:** The '7' object at the top extends downwards, the '8' object extends rightwards, and the rightmost '7' object extends downwards. All extensions stop at the nearest background cell.

**Input_2:** The '1' objects extend downwards to the nearest background cell.


## Program Version 1

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    bg = difference(backdrop(obj), toindices(obj))
    if bg:
      closest_bg = argmin(bg, lambda x: manhattan({x}, obj))
      direction = sign(subtract(closest_bg, centerofmass(obj)))
      if abs(direction[0]) == abs(direction[1]):  # Diagonal movement
          I = underfill(I, color(obj), connect(centerofmass(obj), closest_bg))
      else:
          I = underfill(I, color(obj), shoot(centerofmass(obj), direction))
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each object and finds the closest background cell. It calculates the direction from the object's center of mass to this background cell. If the direction is diagonal, it connects the center of mass directly to the closest background cell. Otherwise, it "shoots" a line in the calculated direction, filling in background cells with the object's color. This effectively extends the object towards the nearest background cell.


## Program Version 2

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for c in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
    obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, c), I)
    queue = [centerofmass(obj)]
    visited = set()
    while queue:
      loc = queue.pop(0)
      if loc in visited or loc not in backdrop(obj):
        continue
      visited.add(loc)
      for n in dneighbors(loc):
        if n not in visited and index(I, n) == 0:
          I = underfill(I, c, {loc})
          queue.append(n)
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. It starts from the center of mass of each object and expands outwards, filling in any background cell directly connected to a cell already filled with the object's color. This "flood fill" method ensures that the object expands in all possible directions towards the closest background cells. 


## Program Version 3

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    h, w = shape(obj)
    if h > w:
      direction = (1 if uppermost(obj) < len(I) // 2 else -1, 0)
    else:
      direction = (0, 1 if leftmost(obj) < len(I[0]) // 2 else -1)
    I = underfill(I, color(obj), shoot(centerofmass(obj), direction))
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version simplifies the direction calculation by assuming that objects tend to grow towards the closest edge of the grid. It determines the object's orientation (vertical or horizontal) and extends it towards the nearest edge (top, bottom, left, or right) by shooting a line from its center of mass.

## Program Version 4

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    for loc in toindices(obj):
      for direction in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]:
        target = add(loc, direction)
        if index(I, target) == 0:
          I = underfill(I, color(obj), {target})
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version employs a simpler approach by iterating through each cell of each object and checking its four neighboring cells (up, down, left, right). If a neighboring cell is a background cell, it fills it with the object's color.

## Program Version 5

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for c in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
    obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, c), I)
    while True:
      expanded = False
      for loc in toindices(obj):
        for n in dneighbors(loc):
          if index(I, n) == 0:
            I = underfill(I, c, {n})
            expanded = True
      if not expanded:
        break
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iteratively expands each object until it can no longer grow. It checks the four neighboring cells of each object cell and fills any background cell with the object's color. The process repeats until no further expansion is possible.
