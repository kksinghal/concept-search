## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to follow these rules:

**General Rule:** For each unique digit (color) in the input grid, all occurrences of that digit are collapsed onto a single column. The column chosen seems to be determined by the leftmost occurrence of the digit.

**Specific Examples:**

* **Input 0:** 
    * The '1's are collapsed to the first column (leftmost '1' position).
    * The '3's are collapsed to the third column.
    * The '6's are collapsed to the sixth column. 

* **Input 1:**
    * The '7's are collapsed to the first and second columns (due to the presence of '7' in both).
    * The '8's are collapsed to the seventh and eighth columns.
    * The '3's are collapsed to the third and fourth columns. 

* **Input 2:**
    * The '1's are collapsed to the first and second columns.
    * The '3's are collapsed to the third and fourth columns.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:


### Program Version 1:
**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Initialize output grid with background color
  for c in palette(I):  # Iterate over colors in the input
    locs = ofcolor(I, c) # Get indices of all cells with the current color
    j = minimum(locs, lambda x: x[1]) # Find the column index of the leftmost occurrence
    O = fill(O, c, {(i, j) for i in range(height(I))}) # Fill the entire column with the color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty output grid (`O`) of the same size as the input (`I`), filled with the most frequent color (background) from the input.
2. **Color Iteration:**  Iterates through each unique color (`c`) present in the input grid.
3. **Find Leftmost Column:**  For each color, determines the leftmost column index (`j`) where it appears.
4. **Fill Column:**  Fills the entire column `j` in the output grid with the current color `c`.

### Program Version 2:
**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = []  # Initialize empty output grid
  for j in range(width(I)):  # Iterate over columns
    col = tuple(I[i][j] for i in range(height(I))) # Extract current column
    if any(c != mostcolor(I) for c in col):  # Check if column contains non-background colors
      O.append(tuple(mostcommon(col) for _ in range(height(I)))) # Fill output column with most common color in the input column
    else:
      O.append(tuple(mostcolor(I) for _ in range(height(I)))) # Fill with background color
  return rot270(tuple(O)) # Rotate to correct orientation
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty list `O` to store the output grid.
2. **Column Iteration:** Iterates through each column (`j`) of the input grid.
3. **Extract & Analyze Column:** Extracts the entire column from the input and checks if it contains any non-background colors.
4. **Fill Output Column:** 
   * If the column contains non-background colors, it fills the corresponding column in `O` with the most frequent color from the input column.
   * Otherwise, it fills the column with the background color.
5. **Rotation:** Rotates the constructed grid by 270 degrees counter-clockwise (`rot270`) to achieve the correct final orientation.

### Program Version 3:
**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    j = leftmost(obj)  # Column index for collapsing
    O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j) for i in range(height(I))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization & Background:** Similar to Version 1, it initializes an output grid filled with the background color.
2. **Object-Based Processing:** Uses `fgpartition` to directly extract objects (connected components of the same color) from the input, excluding the background.
3. **Leftmost Column & Fill:** For each object, it identifies the leftmost column index (`j`) and fills the entire column `j` in the output with the object's color.

---

### Program Version 4:
**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = dmirror(tuple(  # Start with diagonal mirroring for column-wise processing
    tuple(row[min(j for j, v in enumerate(row) if v != mostcolor(I))].color(obj) for i in range(height(I)))  # Find leftmost non-background color and use its column
    if any(v != mostcolor(I) for v in row)  # Check for non-background colors
    else tuple(mostcolor(I) for _ in range(height(I)))  # Fill with background if no other color
    for row in dmirror(I)  # Iterate over mirrored input for column-based processing
  ))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Diagonal Mirroring:** Uses `dmirror` to process columns as rows, simplifying the logic for finding the leftmost occurrence of a color.
2. **Leftmost Non-Background:** For each row (representing a column in the original grid), it finds the leftmost non-background color. 
3. **Fill with Leftmost Color:** If non-background colors exist, it fills the entire output column with the leftmost color found. Otherwise, it uses the background color.
4. **Reverse Mirroring:**  Finally, it applies `dmirror` again to revert the grid to its original orientation.

---

### Program Version 5:
**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(k, j) for k in range(height(I))})
        break # Move to the next column once a non-background color is found
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to previous versions, it starts with an output grid filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate and Find:** It iterates through each cell in the input grid (column by column).
3. **First Non-Background and Fill:** Upon finding the first non-background color in a column, it fills the entire corresponding column in the output grid with that color and then stops processing the current column using `break`. This ensures that only the leftmost color in each column is used.


These versions demonstrate diverse approaches to solve the problem using different DSL functions and logic, offering a range of potential solutions. Each version provides a different perspective on how to process the input grid and achieve the desired transformation.
