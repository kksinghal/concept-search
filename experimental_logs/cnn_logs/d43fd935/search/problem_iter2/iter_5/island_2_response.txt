## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all examples follows a simple rule: **For each object in the input, remove the rightmost column and add it as a new row to the bottom of the object.**  Let's analyze each example:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
- The '1' object loses its right column and gains a row of '1' at the bottom.
- The '3' object loses its right column and gains a row of '3' at the bottom.
- Each segment of the '6' object loses its right element and gains a '6' at the bottom. 

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- The '7' objects and the '8' objects follow the same pattern of losing the rightmost column and gaining a row at the bottom.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
- All objects, including the single-cell objects, follow the same transformation rule.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions that achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve_39e1d7f9(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  
  O = I  
  for obj in objs:
    for j in range(rightmost(obj), leftmost(obj), -1): 
      obj_temp = shift(obj, (1, 0))
      O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i+1, j-1)) for v, (i, k) in obj_temp if k == j})
      obj = {(v, (i, k)) for v, (i, k) in obj if k != j}
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies all the objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through Objects and Columns:**  The program iterates through each object and its columns from right to left.
3. **Shift and Paint:** For every column, the shifted object `obj_temp` is created. This is used to paint the new row by taking the rightmost element of each row in the original object and shifting it one step down.
4. **Remove Original Column:** The original column is removed from the object. 
5. **Update Output:** The canvas `O` is updated with the modified object.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve_39e1d7f9(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) 
  for j in range(width(I)):
    column = {(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, k) in asobject(I) if k == j} 
    shifted_column = shift(column, (1, -j)) 
    O = paint(O, shifted_column)  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Create Empty Canvas:**  `O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates an empty canvas 'O' of the same size and background color as the input.
2. **Iterate through Columns:** The program iterates through each column of the input.
3. **Extract and Shift Column:** `column = {(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, k) in asobject(I) if k == j}` extracts the current column. `shifted_column = shift(column, (1, -j))` shifts it one row down and to the leftmost position.
4. **Paint to Canvas:** `O = paint(O, shifted_column)` paints the shifted column onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve_39e1d7f9(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(height(I) - 1):
        for j in range(width(I)):
            if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
                if index(I, (i + 1, j)) == mostcolor(I):
                    O = paint(O, {(index(I, (i, j)), (i + 1, j))})
                    O = paint(O, {(mostcolor(I), (i, j))}) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through Grid:** The program iterates through each cell in the grid (except the last row).
2. **Check for Object and Empty Space:** If a cell belongs to an object (not the background color) and the cell below it is empty (background color), it proceeds.
3. **Move Pixel Down:** The color of the current cell is painted one row down, effectively moving the pixel.
4. **Clear Original Pixel:** The original cell is then filled with the background color.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve_39e1d7f9(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objs:
        w = width(obj)
        for i in range(height(obj)):
            row = {(color(obj), (i, j)) for j in range(w)} 
            shifted_row = shift(row, (i + 1, -w + 1)) 
            O = paint(O, shifted_row) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1, the program starts by identifying all objects.
2. **Create Empty Canvas:** An empty canvas is created.
3. **Iterate and Shift Rows:**  For each object, the code iterates through its rows, shifts each row to the bottom of the object, and paints it onto the canvas. 

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve_39e1d7f9(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(height(obj)):
      rightmost_cell = {(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j == rightmost(obj)} 
      O = paint(cover(O, rightmost_cell), shift(rightmost_cell, (1, -width(obj) + 1))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Objects are identified.
2. **Iterate and Move Rightmost Cells:** For each object, the program iterates through its rows, identifies the rightmost cell in each row, covers it on the canvas, and then paints it at the bottom of the object.
