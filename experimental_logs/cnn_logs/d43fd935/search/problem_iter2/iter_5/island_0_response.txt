## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on preserving the **rightmost cell of each connected object (excluding the background)** in the input grid. All other cells are replaced with the background color. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- The rightmost '1's in each connected component are kept, the rest are replaced by '0's.
- The rightmost '3's in the 3x3 square are kept, the rest are replaced by '0's.
- The rightmost '6's in each connected component are kept, the rest are replaced by '0's.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- The logic applied is the same as in the previous example. The rightmost cell of each connected component, excluding the background, is preserved.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

- Again, the same logic is applied.  Notice how even though the '1' object spans across the grid, only its rightmost instances in each row are kept.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas with the background color
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):  # Iterate over each object
    for i in range(height(obj)):
      for j in range(width(obj)-1, -1, -1):
        if (i + uppermost(obj), j + leftmost(obj)) in toindices(obj):
          O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i + uppermost(obj), j + leftmost(obj)))})
          break  # Move to the next row after finding the rightmost cell
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))`: Creates a blank grid filled with the background color and having the same dimensions as the input.
2. `for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)`: Iterates over each connected object in the input grid, excluding the background.
3. The nested loop iterates through each row of the object from right to left.
4. `(i + uppermost(obj), j + leftmost(obj)) in toindices(obj)`: Checks if the current cell belongs to the object.
5. `paint(O, {(color(obj), (i + uppermost(obj), j + leftmost(obj)))})`: Paints the rightmost cell of the object on the output grid.
6. `break`:  Stops searching for the rightmost cell in the current row and moves to the next.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  rightmost_cells = mapply(lambda obj: {(color(obj), (i, max(j for _, (x, j) in obj if x == i))) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)}, objs)
  O = paint(cover(I, asindices(I)), merge(rightmost_cells))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, T, F, T)`: Extracts all connected objects from the input grid (excluding background).
2. `mapply(lambda obj: ... , objs)`:  Applies a lambda function to each object to extract the rightmost cells.
3. The lambda function `(color(obj), (i, max(j for _, (x, j) in obj if x == i))) ...` finds the rightmost cell for each row 'i' of an object using list comprehension.
4. `merge(rightmost_cells)`: Merges all the rightmost cells into a single set.
5. `paint(cover(I, asindices(I)), ...)`: Clears the input grid and paints the extracted rightmost cells onto it.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)-1, -1, -1):
      if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I):
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))})
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))`: Creates a blank grid filled with the background color and having the same dimensions as the input.
2. The code then iterates through each row of the input grid from bottom to top (`for i in range(height(I)-1, -1, -1)`).
3. Within each row, it iterates through the columns from right to left (`for j in range(width(I)-1, -1, -1)`).
4. If it encounters a cell that's not the background color (`if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I)`), it paints that cell onto the output grid at the same location and then breaks the inner loop using `break` to move onto the next row.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract connected objects (without background)
    rightmost_cells = set()  # Initialize an empty set to store rightmost cells
    for obj in objs:  # Iterate through each object
        for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):  # Iterate through rows of each object
            rightmost_j = max(j for _, (x, j) in obj if x == i)  # Find the rightmost column index for the current row
            rightmost_cells.add((color(obj), (i, rightmost_j)))  # Add the rightmost cell to the set
    O = paint(cover(I, asindices(I)), frozenset(rightmost_cells))  # Paint the rightmost cells onto a blank grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, T, F, T)`: Extracts all the connected objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
2. `rightmost_cells = set()`: Initializes an empty set to store the rightmost cells we find.
3. The code then iterates through each object using `for obj in objs:`.
4. For each object, it iterates through its rows using `for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):`
5. `rightmost_j = max(j for _, (x, j) in obj if x == i)`: This line finds the column index (`j`) of the rightmost cell for the current row (`i`) in the current object (`obj`).
6. `rightmost_cells.add((color(obj), (i, rightmost_j)))`: This line adds a tuple containing the color of the object and the coordinates of the rightmost cell to the `rightmost_cells` set.
7. `O = paint(cover(I, asindices(I)), frozenset(rightmost_cells))`: This line first creates a blank grid by covering the input grid with the background color (`cover(I, asindices(I))`). Then, it paints the `rightmost_cells` onto this blank grid, resulting in the desired output.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):  # Iterate through objects
        for i in range(height(I)):  # Iterate through rows
            for j in range(width(I) - 1, -1, -1):  # Iterate through columns from right to left
                if (i, j) in toindices(obj):  # Check if cell belongs to the object
                    O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, j))})  # Paint the rightmost cell onto the canvas
                    break  # Stop at the first encountered cell (rightmost)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))`: Create an empty canvas with the same shape as the input, filled with the background color.
2. `for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):`: Loop through each connected component (object) in the input, excluding the background.
3. `for i in range(height(I)):`: Loop through each row of the input.
4. `for j in range(width(I) - 1, -1, -1):`: Loop through each column in the current row from right to left. 
5. `if (i, j) in toindices(obj):`: Check if the current cell (i, j) belongs to the current object.
6. `O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, j))})`: If the cell belongs to the object, paint it onto the canvas at the same position (i, j) with the color of the object.
7. `break`: Exit the inner loop (column loop) as soon as a cell belonging to the current object is found and painted. This ensures that only the rightmost cell of each object on each row is painted.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same goal, utilizing various DSL functions and logic structures, showcasing diverse code-generation capabilities.
