## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation keeps only the right-most cell of each object in the grid, effectively outlining the right border of each object. 

**Example Breakdown:**

Let's analyze how this works with Input_0 and Output_0:

* **Input_0:**  Contains objects formed by digits '1', '3', and '6', with '0' as the background.
* **Output_0:** Only the rightmost cells of each object are kept, the rest are replaced by '0'. 

For instance, the top-left '1 1' object in Input_0 becomes a single '1 0' in Output_0.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct code versions to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Identify all objects in the grid.
  rightmost_cells = frozenset((color(obj), urcorner(obj)) for obj in objs)  # Find the rightmost cell (color, index) for each object.
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), rightmost_cells)  # Create a blank canvas and paint the rightmost cells onto it.
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all distinct objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Find Rightmost Cells:** `urcorner(obj)` finds the upper-right corner index of each object, which represents the rightmost cell in this case. `color(obj)` retrieves the object's color (digit). These are combined into a set of (color, index) tuples.
3. **Paint Rightmost Cells:**  A blank canvas of the same size as the input grid is created using `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`. Then, the rightmost cells are painted onto this canvas using their color and index.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))  # Start with a blank canvas.
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):  # Iterate over each object.
    rightmost_index = urcorner(obj)  # Find the index of the rightmost cell.
    O = paint(O, {(color(obj), rightmost_index)})  # Paint the rightmost cell onto the canvas.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Blank Canvas:** Begins with a canvas filled with zeros.
2. **Iterate and Paint:**  Iterates through each object, finds its rightmost cell's index, and paints it directly onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(ZERO, (h, w))  # Create an empty grid of the same size.
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w - 1, -1, -1):  # Iterate through columns from right to left.
      if I[i][j] != ZERO:  # If a non-zero cell is found, 
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))})  # paint it onto the output grid 
        break  # and move to the next row.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate from Right:** This version directly iterates through the grid from right to left, painting the first non-zero cell encountered in each row onto the output grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I)-1, 0, -1):
            if I[i][j] != 0:
                O = fill(O, 0, frozenset({(i, k) for k in range(j)}) )
                break
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Fill:** This version iterates through the grid from right to left and fills all cells before a non-zero cell with zero.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        _, (i, j) =  extract(obj, lambda cell: cell[1] == urcorner(obj))
        O = fill(O, 0, frozenset({(i, k) for k in range(j)}) )
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Rightmost Cell:** This version first identifies the rightmost cell within each object and then utilizes the fill function to set all cells to the left of this rightmost cell to zero.


These five versions provide diverse approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing different function combinations and logic flows within the provided DSL.
