## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

**For each unique digit (excluding the background color) in the grid:**

1. **Identify the top-left most cell** containing that digit.
2. **Shift** all instances of that digit towards the top-left most cell. This shifting happens horizontally for digits in the same row as the top-left most cell and vertically for digits in the same column. 
3. **Maintain the relative order** of the shifted digits.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for v in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:  
    target_loc = (uppermost(ofcolor(I, v)), leftmost(ofcolor(I, v)))
    for i, j in ofcolor(I, v):
      if i == target_loc[0]:
        I = fill(I, v, {(i, k) for k in range(j, target_loc[1], -1)})
      elif j == target_loc[1]:
        I = fill(I, v, {(k, j) for k in range(i, target_loc[0], -1)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through each unique color (value)** in the grid, excluding the background color.
2. **Find the top-left most cell (target_loc)** of each color using `uppermost` and `leftmost` on the indices of that color.
3. **Iterate through each cell** containing that color.
4. **If the cell is in the same row** as `target_loc`, shift the color horizontally towards `target_loc` by filling the cells between the current cell and `target_loc` with the same color.
5. **If the cell is in the same column** as `target_loc`, shift the color vertically towards `target_loc` in a similar manner.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in partition(I):
    if color(obj) != mostcolor(I):
      ti, tj = ulcorner(obj)
      for _, (i, j) in sorted(obj, key=lambda x: (x[1][0], x[1][1])):
        if i == ti:
          I = fill(I, color(obj), connect((i, j), (i, tj)))
        if j == tj:
          I = fill(I, color(obj), connect((i, j), (ti, j)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition the grid into objects** based on color.
2. **Iterate through each object** except the background.
3. **Find the top-left corner** of the object.
4. **Iterate through each cell** of the object in ascending order of row and column indices.
5. **Connect the current cell** to the top-left corner using the same color, effectively shifting the color horizontally or vertically.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for v in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
    indices = ofcolor(I, v)
    target = ulcorner(indices)
    shifted_indices = {(i, j - (j - target[1])) if i == target[0] else (i - (i - target[0]), j) for i, j in indices}
    I = fill(I, mostcolor(I), indices)
    I = fill(I, v, shifted_indices)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through each unique color** in the grid, excluding the background color.
2. **Get the indices of all cells** with the current color.
3. **Find the top-left corner (target)** of these indices.
4. **Calculate the shifted indices** by moving each cell either horizontally or vertically towards the `target` based on their relative position.
5. **Clear the original positions** of the color in the grid.
6. **Fill the `shifted_indices`** with the current color.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    target_i, target_j = ulcorner(obj)
    new_obj = set()
    for _, (i, j) in obj:
      new_j = target_j if i == target_i else j
      new_i = target_i if j == target_j else i
      new_obj.add((color(obj), (new_i, new_j)))
    I = paint(cover(I, obj), frozenset(new_obj))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition the grid into foreground objects**.
2. **Iterate through each object**.
3. **Find the top-left corner** of the object.
4. **Create a new object** by shifting each cell's position towards the top-left corner based on its row and column relative to the corner.
5. **Cover the original object** with the background color.
6. **Paint the new object** onto the grid.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for v in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
    min_i = min(i for i, j in ofcolor(I, v))
    min_j = min(j for i, j in ofcolor(I, v))
    for i, j in ofcolor(I, v):
      if i == min_i:
        I = fill(I, v, {(i, k) for k in range(j, min_j - 1, -1)})
      else:
        I = fill(I, v, {(k, j) for k in range(i, min_i - 1, -1)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through each unique color** in the grid except the background.
2. **Find the minimum row index (min_i) and minimum column index (min_j)** for that color, representing the top-left most cell.
3. **Iterate through each cell** of that color.
4. **If the cell is in the same row (min_i)**, fill horizontally towards the left until reaching `min_j`.
5. **Otherwise**, fill vertically upwards until reaching `min_i`.


These five programs offer distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation using different combinations of DSL functions and logic. They highlight the flexibility of the DSL and the possibility of achieving the desired outcome through various means.
