## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids to achieve the outputs can be described as **"shifting all objects to the left and removing overlapping cells, except the leftmost cell of each object"**. This means:

* **Shifting:** All objects in the grid are moved as far to the left as possible.
* **Overlapping Removal:** If multiple cells of the same object occupy the same column after the shift, only the topmost cell is retained.

Let's analyze this for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
* The '1' objects are shifted to the leftmost column.
* The '6' objects are shifted left, and only the leftmost cell of each '6' object remains.
* The '3' object is shifted left, and the overlapping cells are removed, leaving a single column of '3's. 

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
* Similar shifting and overlapping removal are applied to all objects ('7', '8', and '3'). Notice how the single '7' at the bottom right corner is now isolated in its own column.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
* The same logic applies to this example as well. The '1' objects are combined into a single column, and overlapping cells of the '3' object are removed.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" that achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Extract objects
  for obj in objs:
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj) # Find leftmost column index of the object
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if j > leftmost_j: # For every column other than the leftmost 
        I = fill(I, mostcolor(I), {(i, j)}) # Remove overlapping cells
    I = paint(I, shift(obj, (-j, -leftmost_j))) # Shift object to the left
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** Extract all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** Loop through each object `obj`.
3. **Find Leftmost Column:**  Determine the column index (`leftmost_j`) of the leftmost cell in the object.
4. **Remove Overlapping Cells:**  Iterate through the object's cells. If a cell's column index `j` is greater than `leftmost_j`, replace that cell with the background color using `fill`.
5. **Shift Left:** Shift the entire object leftwards by `leftmost_j` units using `shift` and repaint it on the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for j in range(width(I)-1, 0, -1): # Iterate through columns from right to left
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I): # If cell is not background
        k = j
        while k > 0 and I[i][k-1] == mostcolor(I): # Find the farthest left position
          k -= 1
        if k != j:
          I = paint(I, {(I[i][j], (i, k))}) # Move the cell to the leftmost available position
          I = fill(I, mostcolor(I), {(i, j)}) # Remove cell from original position
  return I 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Columns:**  Loop through each column of the grid from right to left.
2. **Find Non-Background Cells:** Within each column, check if a cell is not the background color.
3. **Shift Left:** If a non-background cell is found, find the farthest available position to its left in the same row. Move the cell to that position and replace the original cell with the background color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in fgpartition(I): # Iterate through foreground objects
    leftmost_cell = argmin(toindices(obj), lambda x: x[1])  # Find the leftmost cell
    target_column = vfrontier(leftmost_cell) # Create a vertical line at the leftmost cell's column
    I = underfill(I, color(obj), target_column)  # Fill the target column with object's color
    I = cover(I, difference(toindices(obj), target_column))  # Remove other cells of the object
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Foreground Objects:** Iterate through each foreground object in the grid.
2. **Find Leftmost Cell:** Identify the leftmost cell of the current object.
3. **Create Target Column:** Create a vertical line (`target_column`) at the column index of the leftmost cell.
4. **Fill Target Column:** Fill the `target_column` with the object's color using `underfill`.
5. **Remove Other Cells:** Remove all other cells of the object except those in the `target_column`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create a new empty grid filled with background color
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):  # Extract objects
    min_j = leftmost(obj) # Get the leftmost column index of the object
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(v, (i, j - min_j))}) # Paint the object onto the new grid, shifted to the left
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Grid:** Generate a new empty grid of the same size as the input grid, filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Loop through each object in the input grid.
3. **Determine Leftmost Shift:** Find the leftmost column index (`min_j`) of the current object.
4. **Paint Shifted Objects:**  For each cell in the object, paint it onto the new grid at a shifted position (original column index minus `min_j`).


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for i in range(height(I)):
    row = I[i]
    new_row = []
    current_color = None  # Keep track of the current object color
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if row[j] != mostcolor(I) and row[j] != current_color: # If new object encountered
        new_row.append(row[j]) 
        current_color = row[j] # Update current color
      else:
        new_row.append(mostcolor(I))  # Fill with background color
    I = paint(I, {(v, (i, j)) for j, v in enumerate(new_row)}) # Update the row in the grid
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Rows:**  Loop through each row of the grid.
2. **Track Object Color:** Maintain a variable `current_color` to keep track of the currently processed object's color within each row. 
3. **Process Cells:**  For each cell in a row:
    - If the cell is not background and its color is different from `current_color`, append it to the `new_row` and update `current_color`.
    - Otherwise, append the background color to the `new_row`.
4. **Update Grid:** After processing each row, paint the `new_row` onto the corresponding row in the grid.

These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation, utilizing different DSL functions and logic. Each version ensures that objects are shifted left, and only the leftmost cell of each object remains in a column after removing overlapping cells.
