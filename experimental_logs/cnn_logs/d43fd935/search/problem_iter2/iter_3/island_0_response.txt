## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves **keeping only the rightmost cell of each horizontally connected object**. All other cells of the object are replaced by the background color (most common color in the grid).

**Input_0:**

- Objects: Two '1' objects, two '6' objects, one '3' object.
- Transformation: 
    - The rightmost '1' in each object is kept, the rest are replaced by '0'.
    - The rightmost '6' in each object is kept, the rest are replaced by '0'.
    - The rightmost '3' in the object is kept, the rest are replaced by '0'.

**Input_1:**

- Objects: Three '7' objects, two '8' objects, one '3' object.
- Transformation:  
    - The rightmost '7' in each object is kept, the rest are replaced by '0'.
    - The rightmost '8' in each object is kept, the rest are replaced by '0'.
    - The rightmost '3' in the object is kept, the rest are replaced by '0'.

**Input_2:**

- Objects: Four '1' objects, one '3' object.
- Transformation:  
    - The rightmost '1' in each object is kept, the rest are replaced by '0'.
    - The rightmost '3' in the object is kept, the rest are replaced by '0'.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract connected objects (without background)
  rightmost_cells = mapply(lambda obj: {(color(obj), urcorner(obj))}, objs)  # Get rightmost cell of each object
  covered_grid = cover(I, asindices(I))  # Create a blank grid with background color
  O = paint(covered_grid, rightmost_cells)  # Paint the rightmost cells onto the blank grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies all connected objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **`mapply(lambda obj: {(color(obj), urcorner(obj))}, objs)`:** Iterates through each object and extracts its color and the index of its upper-right corner (rightmost cell).
3. **`cover(I, asindices(I))`:** Creates a new grid filled with the background color, effectively erasing the original content.
4. **`paint(covered_grid, rightmost_cells)`:** Paints the extracted rightmost cells onto the blank grid, achieving the desired transformation.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I  # Start with the input grid
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])-1, 0, -1): # Iterate through each row from right to left
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and I[i][j-1] == I[i][j]:  # Check if cell is part of an object and not the rightmost one
        O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(i, j)})  # Replace the cell with background color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid as a copy of the input.
2. **Iterate through each row from right to left:** This ensures that we process the objects from right to left.
3. **`if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and I[i][j-1] == I[i][j]`:** This condition identifies cells that are part of a connected object but are not the rightmost cell.
4. **`O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(i, j)})`:**  Fills the identified cell with the background color, effectively removing it from the object while preserving the rightmost cell.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract connected objects
  rightmost_indices = mapply(urcorner, objs) # Find rightmost indices of all objects
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if (i,j) not in rightmost_indices and I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(i, j)}) # Fill all cells except the rightmost of each object with background color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies connected objects in the input grid.
2. **`mapply(urcorner, objs)`:**  Extracts the upper-right corner (rightmost cell) index of each object.
3. **Iterate through the grid:** Loops through each cell in the grid.
4. **`if (i,j) not in rightmost_indices and I[i][j] != mostcolor(I)`:** This condition identifies cells that are not the rightmost cell of any object and do not belong to the background.
5. **`O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(i, j)})`:**  Replaces the identified cells with the background color, keeping only the rightmost cells of each object.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))  # Create an empty canvas filled with background color
  for i in range(h):
    last_seen = None
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):  # If the current cell is not background
        last_seen = (i, j)  # Update the last seen cell
    if last_seen:
      O = paint(O, {(I[last_seen[0]][last_seen[1]], last_seen)})  # Paint the last seen cell onto the canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))`:** Creates an empty grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate through rows:** Loops through each row of the input grid.
3. **`last_seen = None`:** Resets the `last_seen` variable for each new row. 
4. **`if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I)`:** Checks if the current cell is not background. 
5. **`last_seen = (i, j)`:**  Updates the `last_seen` variable with the current cell's index if it's not background.
6. **`if last_seen:`:** If a non-background cell was found in the row, paint it on the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    current_color = None
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and I[i][j] != current_color:
        current_color = I[i][j]  # Update current color if a new object is encountered
      elif I[i][j] == current_color:
        O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(i, j)}) # Replace with background color if it's part of the same object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:**  Initializes the output grid as a copy of the input.
2. **Iterate through rows:** Loops through each row of the input grid.
3. **`current_color = None`:** Resets the `current_color` variable for each new row.
4. **`if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and I[i][j] != current_color`:**  Checks if the current cell is a new object (not background and different from the `current_color`). 
5. **`current_color = I[i][j]`:** If a new object is found, update the `current_color`.
6. **`elif I[i][j] == current_color`:** If the current cell belongs to the same object as the previous cell, replace it with the background color. 


These five versions represent significantly different approaches to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL. Each version leverages different combinations of functions and logic, showcasing the versatility of the DSL and the creativity involved in solving visual reasoning problems.
