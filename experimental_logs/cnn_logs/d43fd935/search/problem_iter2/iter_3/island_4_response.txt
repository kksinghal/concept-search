## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on retaining the leftmost cell of each distinct object (connected group of same-colored cells) in the input grid while replacing the rest of the object's cells with the background color. This effectively "compresses" each object to its leftmost column.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- The '1' objects are compressed to their leftmost columns, leaving only the leftmost '1' in each object.
- The '3' and '6' objects undergo the same compression, retaining only the leftmost '3' and '6' in their respective objects.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- The transformation consistently applies to all objects ('7', '8', and '3') by preserving only their leftmost columns.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

-  The compression is evident again for all objects, with the '1' objects now appearing as single vertical lines due to their original shape. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:** (Inspired by iterating over objects and modifying them)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  # Start with a blank canvas
  for obj in fgpartition(I):  # Loop through each object
    leftmost_index = min((j for _, (i, j) in obj))  # Find the leftmost column index
    O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, leftmost_index)) for _, (i, j) in obj if j == leftmost_index})  # Paint only the leftmost cells
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version leverages the concept of iterating through objects and modifying them. It first creates a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input. Then, it iterates through each object (excluding the background) and identifies the leftmost column index for that object. Finally, it paints only the cells located in that leftmost column onto the canvas, effectively achieving the desired compression.


**Program Version 2:** (Inspired by direct grid manipulation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Modify the input grid directly
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(1, width(I)):  # Skip the first column
      if index(O, (i, j)) == index(O, (i, j - 1)):  # Check if the cell has the same color as its left neighbor
        O = fill(O, mostcommon(I), {(i, j)})  # Fill with background color if colors match
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version directly modifies the input grid for efficiency. It iterates through each cell (excluding the first column) and checks if the current cell's color is the same as its left neighbor. If they match, it means the cell is not part of the leftmost column of its object and gets replaced by the background color. This approach avoids explicit object identification and manipulation.


**Program Version 3:** (Inspired by column-wise processing)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  # Start with a blank canvas
  for j in range(width(I)):  # Iterate through each column
    column_cells = {(index(I, (i, j)), (i, j)) for i in range(height(I))}  # Get all cells in the column
    if len(palette(column_cells)) > 1:  # Check if the column has more than one color (excluding background)
      first_fg_color = first(palette(column_cells) - {mostcommon(I)})  # Find the first non-background color
      O = paint(O, {(first_fg_color, (i, j)) for c, (i, j) in column_cells if c == first_fg_color})  # Paint the cells with the first non-background color
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version processes the grid column by column. It initializes a blank canvas and then iterates through each column. For each column, it identifies the first non-background color. It then paints only the cells in that column that have this first non-background color onto the canvas, effectively retaining only the leftmost cells of each object.


**Program Version 4:** (Inspired by identifying and shifting objects)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    shift_amount = leftmost(obj)  # Calculate how much to shift the object
    O = cover(O, obj)  # Remove the original object
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, -shift_amount)))  # Shift the object left and paint it back
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version focuses on shifting objects to their leftmost positions. It iterates through each object, calculates the required leftward shift, removes the original object from the grid, shifts the object, and finally paints it back onto the grid. This approach directly manipulates object positions to achieve the desired outcome.


**Program Version 5:** (Inspired by line drawing)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Create a blank canvas
  for obj in fgpartition(I): # Loop through all objects
    start = (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)) # Get the top-left corner of the object
    end = (lowermost(obj), leftmost(obj)) # Get the bottom-left corner of the object
    O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), connect(start, end))) # Draw a line from top to bottom at the leftmost x-coordinate
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version utilizes line drawing to achieve the desired transformation. For each object in the input, it determines the coordinates of its top-left and bottom-left corners. It then draws a vertical line connecting these corners on a blank canvas using the object's color. This results in retaining only the leftmost column of each object.
