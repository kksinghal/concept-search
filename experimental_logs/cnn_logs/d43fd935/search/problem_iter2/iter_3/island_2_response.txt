## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently applies the following logic across all input-output pairs:

1. **Identify Objects:** Each distinct digit in the input grid represents a unique object.
2. **Compress Objects:** Each object is "compressed" into a single horizontal line. This line retains the object's color (digit value) and starts from the rightmost column of the object's original shape.
3. **Position Lines:** The compressed lines are positioned vertically based on the original object's lowest row. The line occupies the same columns as the original object in that lowest row.

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**
* The '1' objects are compressed into horizontal lines at the bottom row of their original shapes.
* The '3' object is compressed into a horizontal line starting from the 6th column, aligning with its position in the 5th row of the input.
* The '6' objects are compressed and positioned similarly.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**
* All objects follow the same compression and positioning logic as described above. 

**Input_2 - Output_2:**
*  The repeated '1' digit in the input is treated as separate objects, each compressed into a single-cell line.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for v in palette(I):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      column = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(height(I)))
      if index(I, (0, j)) == v:
          O = paint(O, recolor(v, column))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialize Canvas:** A blank canvas `O` is created with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through Colors and Columns:** The program iterates over each unique color (digit) in the input and each column.
3. **Identify Objects:** If a cell in the first row of the current column matches the current color, it indicates the presence of an object.
4. **Paint Column:** The entire column is then painted with the current color on the output canvas.
5. **Return Output:**  The canvas `O` is returned, representing the transformed grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in partition(I):
    bottom_right = lrcorner(obj)
    line = frozenset(((bottom_right[0], j), (v, (i, j)))[i == bottom_right[0]] for v, (i, j) in obj)
    O = paint(O, line)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialize Canvas:**  Similar to version 1, a blank canvas `O` is created.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** The program iterates through each object identified in the input grid using `partition(I)`.
3. **Find Bottom-Right Corner:** For each object, the bottom-right corner's coordinates are found.
4. **Create Line:** A horizontal line is constructed at the bottom-right corner's row, spanning the object's width.
5. **Paint Line:** The line, carrying the object's color, is painted onto the output canvas.
6. **Return Output:** The transformed canvas is returned.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for v in palette(I):
    indices = ofcolor(I, v)
    if indices:
      max_j = maximum(indices, lambda x: x[1])
      line = frozenset((v, (max(i for i, j in indices if j == max_j), j)) for j in range(width(I)) if (max(i for i, j in indices if j == max_j), j) in indices)
      O = paint(O, line)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialize Canvas:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Iterate through Colors:** The program iterates through each unique color in the input.
3. **Find Rightmost Cells:**  For each color, it finds the cells with that color having the maximum column index (`max_j`).
4. **Construct Line:** A horizontal line is created using the rightmost cells, effectively compressing the object.
5. **Paint Line:** The line is painted onto the output canvas.
6. **Return Output:** The modified canvas is returned. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    bottom_row = max(i for i, j in toindices(obj))
    rightmost_cells = frozenset((i, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if i == bottom_row)
    line = recolor(color(obj), rightmost_cells)
    O = paint(O, line)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialize Canvas:** Standard canvas initialization.
2. **Iterate through Objects:**  Iterate through each object in the input.
3. **Find Bottom Row and Rightmost Cells:** For each object, the bottom row index and the coordinates of cells in that row are determined.
4. **Create and Paint Line:**  A horizontal line is created using the rightmost cells and painted onto the canvas.
5. **Return Output:** The transformed canvas is returned.

**Program Version 5:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    _, (row, col) = max((j, (i, j)) for _, (i, j) in enumerate(obj))
    O = paint(O, frozenset({(color(obj), (row, j)) for j in range(col, width(I)) if (row, j) in toindices(obj)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialize Canvas:**  Create a canvas with the same dimensions and background color as the input.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** Loop through each object in the input grid (excluding the background).
3. **Find Rightmost Cell:**  For each object, identify the rightmost filled cell.
4. **Paint Horizontal Line:** Draw a horizontal line from the rightmost cell to the right edge of the grid, using the object's color. 
5. **Return Output:** Return the modified canvas, which represents the transformed grid.


Each program version utilizes a different combination of DSL functions and approaches the problem from a slightly different angle, ensuring diversity in solution logic.
