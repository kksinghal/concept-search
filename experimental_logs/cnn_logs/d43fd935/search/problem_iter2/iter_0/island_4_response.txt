## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids seems to follow these rules:

1. **Object Isolation:** Each distinct object (group of connected digits with the same value) in the input grid is treated independently.

2. **Leftmost Alignment:** Each object is shifted horizontally to the left, aligning its leftmost cells with the left border of the grid. 

3. **Vertical Compression:** For each column, if all cells in that column share the same value, the column is compressed into a single cell with that value.

**Example:**

Let's look at how these rules apply to the top-left '1' object in `Input_0`:

```
Input_0:         Object Isolation:     Leftmost Alignment:   Vertical Compression:
1 1 0 ...        1 1                    1                      1 
0 0 0 ...        0 0                    0                      
                
                
                                        0
                                        
``` 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program implementing the described transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  for obj in objs:
    leftmost_col = leftmost(obj)
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, (0, -leftmost_col))
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, shifted_obj)
  return compress(new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(grid, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies all connected objects in the grid.
2. **Initialize Canvas:** `canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))` creates an empty grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
3. **Iterate and Shift:** The code iterates through each object:
   -  `leftmost_col = leftmost(obj)` finds the leftmost column of the object.
   - `shifted_obj = shift(obj, (0, -leftmost_col))` shifts the object to align with the left border.
   - `new_grid = paint(new_grid, shifted_obj)` paints the shifted object onto the new grid.
4. **Compress:** `compress(new_grid)` removes redundant columns to achieve vertical compression.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(grid):
  return dmirror(compress(dmirror(paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), 
                                         merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, -leftmost(obj))), 
                                                     objects(grid, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)))))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version achieves the same result as Version 1 but uses a more compact, functional approach by nesting function calls:

1. **Steps 1-3 from Version 1** are performed within nested functions.
2. **Diagonal Mirroring:** The grid is diagonally mirrored using `dmirror` twice. This allows vertical compression to be achieved using the existing `compress` function which works horizontally.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(grid):
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  new_grid = [list(row) for row in grid]  # Create a mutable copy
  for j in range(w):
    first_val = next((grid[i][j] for i in range(h) if grid[i][j] != mostcolor(grid)), None)
    if first_val is not None:
      for i in range(h):
        if grid[i][j] == first_val:
          new_grid[i][j] = first_val
        else:
          new_grid[i][j] = mostcolor(grid)
  return compress(tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid))
```

**Explanation:**

This version takes a more iterative approach:

1. **Mutable Grid:** It creates a mutable copy of the input grid for in-place modification.
2. **Column Iteration:**  It iterates through each column.
3. **First Non-Background Value:** It finds the first non-background value in the column.
4. **Cell Update:** It updates the column cells, keeping only those matching the first non-background value.
5. **Compression:** Finally, it compresses the resulting grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(grid):
  transformed = tuple(
      tuple(
          next((v for v in row[j:] if v != mostcolor(grid)), mostcolor(grid))
          for j in range(len(grid[0]))
      )
      for row in grid
  )
  return compress(transformed)
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes Python's list comprehension for a more concise solution:

1. **Nested Comprehensions:** It uses nested comprehensions to iterate through rows and then cells within each row.
2. **Leftmost Non-Background:**  For each cell, it finds the leftmost non-background value in the remaining part of the row.
3. **Compression:** The resulting grid is then compressed.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(grid):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  for j in range(width(grid)):
    column = tuple(grid[i][j] for i in range(height(grid)))
    first_non_bg = next((v for v in column if v != mostcolor(grid)), None)
    if first_non_bg is not None:
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(first_non_bg, (i, j)) for i in range(height(grid)) if column[i] == first_non_bg})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on processing column-by-column:

1. **Empty Grid:**  Creates an empty grid filled with the background color.
2. **Column Processing:** It iterates through columns, extracting each column as a separate tuple.
3. **First Non-Background:** Identifies the first non-background value in the column.
4. **Selective Painting:**  Paints only the cells in the column that match the first non-background value onto the new grid. 


These are five distinct solutions to the given transformation problem, each utilizing different DSL functions and logic. Remember that achieving a similarity score of 0 would require the exact code used to generate the outputs. However, these diverse implementations should provide you with a strong starting point for further analysis and refinement.
