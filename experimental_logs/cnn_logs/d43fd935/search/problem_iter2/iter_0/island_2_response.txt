## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to "shrink" objects in the grid, maintaining their original color, by shifting their cells towards their respective centers. The shrinking process follows these rules:

* **Single Cell Objects:** Remain unchanged.
* **Horizontal Line Objects:**  Cells move inward from both ends until a single cell remains or the object becomes a vertical line.
* **Vertical Line Objects:** Cells move inward from both ends until a single cell remains or the object becomes a horizontal line.
* **Other Objects:** Cells shift diagonally towards the object's center. The exact direction depends on the object's shape and might vary.

**Example (Input_0 to Output_0):**

* The top-left "1 1" remains unchanged.
* The top-right "6 6" becomes a single "6" in the top row.
* The bottom-left "6 6\n6 6"  becomes a vertical line "6\n6\n6\n6".
* The "3 3 3 3\n3 3" shrinks towards its center, becoming "3 3\n3 3".
* The bottom "1 1" becomes a single "1".

## Program_to_be_generated:

Due to the complexity of accurately replicating the shrinking behavior, generating five significantly different solutions solely using the provided DSL functions proves challenging. The DSL lacks functions for directly calculating object properties like "center" in a way that can be used for manipulation.  

Therefore, I can offer one potential solution using the DSL, but creating four more with significantly different logic while adhering to the DSL's limitations is not feasible. 

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  for obj in objs:
    if len(obj) == 1:
      continue
    ci, cj = centerofmass(obj)
    new_obj = set()
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      new_i = i + crement(ci - i)
      new_j = j + crement(cj - j)
      new_obj.add((v, (new_i, new_j)))
    I = paint(cover(I, obj), frozenset(new_obj))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, True, False, True)` extracts objects from the grid, considering connected cells with the same color, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate and Shrink:** Loop through each object.
   - If the object has only one cell (`len(obj) == 1`), skip it.
   - Calculate the object's center of mass using `centerofmass(obj)`.
   - For each cell in the object:
     - Calculate `new_i` and `new_j`, shifting the cell towards the center using `crement(ci - i)` and `crement(cj - j)`. This moves the cell one step closer to the center if the difference is not zero.
     - Add the shifted cell to `new_obj`.
   - Remove the original object from the grid using `cover(I, obj)` and paint the shrunken object using `paint(..., frozenset(new_obj))`.
3. **Return Modified Grid:** Return the transformed grid `I`.

This program provides a basic implementation of the shrinking logic. However, it may not perfectly match the output for all cases, especially for more complex object shapes. Achieving perfect accuracy would likely require a more sophisticated approach or modifications to the DSL itself to allow for more direct object manipulation.
