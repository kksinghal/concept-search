## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

**For each object in the grid:**

1. **Find the top-left most cell of the object.**
2. **Keep only this top-left most cell and recolor the rest of the object with the background color.**

This effectively "shrinks" each object down to its top-left corner cell.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)  # Get objects without background
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if (i, j) != ulcorner(obj):  # Check if it's not the top-left corner
        I = fill(I, bg, {(i, j)})  # Recolor with background
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:**  Gets all objects in the input grid `I` except the background.
2. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:**  Identifies the background color in the input grid.
3. **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterates through each object found.
4. **`for v, (i, j) in obj:`:** Iterates through each cell within the current object.
5. **`if (i, j) != ulcorner(obj):`:**  Checks if the current cell is NOT the top-left corner cell of the object.
6. **`I = fill(I, bg, {(i, j)})`:**  If the current cell is not the top-left corner, it's recolored with the background color.
7. **`return I`:**  Returns the modified grid.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create an empty canvas
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    O = paint(O, {(color(obj), ulcorner(obj))})  # Paint top-left corner of each object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates a new grid `O` filled with the background color and having the same dimensions as input `I`.
2. **`for obj in fgpartition(I):`:** Iterates through each foreground object in the input grid.
3. **`O = paint(O, {(color(obj), ulcorner(obj))})`:**  Paints the top-left corner cell of the current object onto the new grid `O` with its original color.
4. **`return O`:** Returns the newly created grid with only top-left corners.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),  # Create an empty canvas
      frozenset({(color(obj), ulcorner(obj)) for obj in fgpartition(I)})  # Get top-left corners
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version is a more concise version of Program Version 2. It achieves the same result in a single line of code. It first creates an empty canvas and then paints all the top-left corners of the objects onto it in one go.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      I[i][j] if (i, j) == ulcorner(extract(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: (i, j) in toindices(obj))) else mostcolor(I)
      for j in range(len(I[0]))
    )
    for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested list comprehensions to directly construct the output grid. It iterates over each cell of the input grid and checks if the cell is the top-left corner of any object. If it is, the cell's original color is kept; otherwise, it is replaced with the background color.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  corners = mpapply(ulcorner, fgpartition(I))
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      I[i][j] if (i, j) in corners else mostcolor(I)
      for j in range(len(I[0]))
    )
    for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version first pre-computes the set of all top-left corners of objects using `mpapply` and `ulcorner`. Then, it uses nested list comprehensions to efficiently construct the output grid by checking if each cell belongs to the pre-computed set of corners.

These five programs demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformation, leveraging the provided DSL functions effectively.
