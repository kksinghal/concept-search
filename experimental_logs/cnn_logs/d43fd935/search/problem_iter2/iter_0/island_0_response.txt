## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on isolating the rightmost element of each distinct object in the grid. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
* The rightmost '1' of the top-left object, the rightmost '6' of each of the right '6' objects, and the rightmost '1' of the bottom-left object are kept. All other occurrences of these digits are replaced with the background color (0). 

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
* Similarly, the rightmost '7' of each of the top and bottom '7' objects, the rightmost '8' of each of the '8' objects, and the rightmost '3' of the central object are kept. 

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
* The pattern repeats: the rightmost '1' of each '1' object and the rightmost '3' of the '3' object are preserved.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  rightmost_cells = mpapply(lambda o: (color(o), urcorner(o)), objs)
  filtered_obj = frozenset({(v, i) for v, i in asobject(I) if (v, i) in rightmost_cells})
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), filtered_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all distinct objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Find Rightmost Cells:** `rightmost_cells = mpapply(lambda o: (color(o), urcorner(o)), objs)` finds the upper-right corner of each object, which represents the rightmost cell for each row.
3. **Filter Object Cells:**  `filtered_obj = frozenset({(v, i) for v, i in asobject(I) if (v, i) in rightmost_cells})` creates a new object containing only the rightmost cells from the original objects.
4. **Paint on Canvas:**  `O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), filtered_obj)` creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input and paints the filtered object onto it.

**Program Version 2**

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    for i in range(height(obj)):
      row = {(v, (r, c)) for v, (r, c) in obj if r == uppermost(obj) + i}
      if len(row) > 0:
        rightmost = urcorner(row)
        O = paint(cover(O, row), {(color(obj), rightmost)}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects and Rows:** The program iterates through each object and each row of the object.
2. **Find Rightmost Cell in Row:** For every row, it identifies the rightmost cell.
3. **Cover and Paint:** It then covers the entire row and paints only the rightmost cell back onto the grid.

**Program Version 3**

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for c in palette(I):
    obj = frozenset((c, i) for i in ofcolor(I, c))
    for i in range(height(obj)):
      row = {(v, (r, c)) for v, (r, c) in obj if r == uppermost(obj) + i}
      if len(row) > 0:
        O = paint(O, {(c, urcorner(row))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Colors and Rows:** This version iterates through each color in the palette and each row of the corresponding object.
2. **Find Rightmost Cell for Color and Row:** It finds the rightmost cell for each color and row. 
3. **Paint Rightmost Cell:** It paints only the identified rightmost cell on a blank canvas.

**Program Version 4**

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    rightmost_indices = apply(lambda x: urcorner(frozenset((v, (r, c)) for v, (r, c) in obj if r == x)), range(height(I)))
    rightmost_cells = frozenset((color(obj), i) for i in rightmost_indices if i is not None)
    O = underpaint(cover(O, obj), rightmost_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** It iterates through each object.
2. **Find Rightmost Indices:** For each object, it finds the indices of the rightmost cells in each row.
3. **Create Rightmost Cells Object:** It creates an object containing only the rightmost cells with their color.
4. **Cover and Underpaint:** It covers the original object and then underpaints the rightmost cells.

**Program Version 5**

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1, -1, -1):
      if I[i][j] != ZERO:
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))})
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Backwards Through Rows and Columns:** This version iterates through each row from left to right and within each row, iterates through columns from right to left.
2. **Find First Non-Zero Cell:**  It identifies the first non-zero cell encountered in each row.
3. **Paint on Canvas:**  It paints this cell (representing the rightmost non-zero element) onto a blank canvas. 


Each of these programs utilizes different combinations of DSL functions and logic to achieve the same outcome. They showcase the flexibility and expressive power of the DSL in solving this spatial reasoning task.
