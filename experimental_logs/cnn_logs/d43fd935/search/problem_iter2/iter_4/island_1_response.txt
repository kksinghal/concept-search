## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to "shrink" objects in the grid down to their leftmost column. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 / Output_0:**

* The two '1' objects are reduced to their leftmost column.
* The '3' object is reduced to its leftmost column, with the '1' object to its right merging into it.
* The '6' objects are reduced to their leftmost columns.

**Input_1 / Output_1:**

* All objects ('7', '8', and '3') are reduced to their leftmost columns. 
* Note how the '8' objects that were horizontally adjacent in the input are now separated by a column of '3's, reflecting the original grid structure.

**Input_2 / Output_2:**

*  The scattered '1' objects are all reduced to their leftmost column, creating a vertical line.
* The '3' object is reduced to its leftmost column.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    I = underfill(I, mostcolor(I), {(i, j) for i, j in asindices(I) if j != leftmost(obj) and (i, j) in toindices(obj)})
  return I 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over Objects:** `for obj in fgpartition(I)` iterates through each object in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Identify Leftmost Column:**  `leftmost(obj)` finds the column index of the leftmost cell in the object.
3. **Fill Non-Leftmost Cells:** `underfill(I, mostcolor(I), {(i, j) for i, j in asindices(I) if j != leftmost(obj) and (i, j) in toindices(obj)})` fills all cells of the object that are not in the leftmost column with the background color, effectively shrinking the object.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  I = fill(I, mostcolor(I), asindices(I))  # Clear the grid
  for obj in objs:
    leftmost_col = leftmost(obj)
    I = paint(I, {(color(obj), (i, leftmost_col)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)}) # Paint leftmost column
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Store Objects & Clear Grid:**  Store objects and clear the grid to the background color.
2. **Iterate and Paint Leftmost Column:** Iterate through stored objects. For each object, determine the leftmost column and paint a vertical line of that object's color on that column, effectively replicating the shrinking effect.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create empty grid
  for j in range(width(I)):
    column_obj = {(I[i][j], (i, j)) for i in range(height(I)) if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I)}
    if column_obj: 
      leftmost_col = leftmost(column_obj) 
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(color(column_obj), (i, leftmost_col)) for i in range(uppermost(column_obj), lowermost(column_obj) + 1)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Grid:** Initialize a new grid filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate Over Columns:**  Iterate through each column of the input grid. 
3. **Process Non-Background Columns:**  If the column has non-background cells, create a temporary object representing that column. Find its leftmost column and paint that column onto the new grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return rot270(hmirror(rot90(
    apply(lambda col: tuple(col[0] if any(c != mostcolor(I) for c in col) else mostcolor(I) for _ in col), rot90(I))
  )))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses rotations and mirroring for a more "mathematical" approach.

1. **Rotate and Transpose:** Rotates the grid to work with columns as rows.
2. **Process and Replicate Columns:**  `apply(lambda col: tuple(col[0] if any(c != mostcolor(I) for c in col) else mostcolor(I) for _ in col)` checks if a column has any non-background cells. If so, it replicates the first cell's value across the column, effectively shrinking it.
3. **Reverse Transformations:** Rotates and mirrors the grid back to its original orientation.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
 return tuple(
    tuple(
        next((grid[row][col_idx] for col_idx in range(len(row)) if grid[row][col_idx] != mostcolor(grid)), mostcolor(grid)) 
        if any(grid[row][col_idx] != mostcolor(grid) for col_idx in range(len(row))) 
        else mostcolor(grid) 
        for _ in range(len(row))
    )
    for row in range(len(grid))
 ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Nested Loop with Conditional:**  Uses nested loops to iterate through rows and cells, using `next` to find the first non-background color in each row and replicating it across the row if it exists. 


These five versions offer diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic.
