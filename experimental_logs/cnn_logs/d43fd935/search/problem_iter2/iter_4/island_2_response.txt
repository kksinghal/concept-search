## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes each distinct object (group of connected same-value digits) in the input grid and reduces it to a single vertical line, retaining the object's original color. This line starts from the topmost row of the object and extends downwards to the bottom row, always occupying the rightmost column of the original object.

**Input 0:**

* **1s:** Reduced to a single line in the rightmost column (column 1).
* **3s:** Reduced to a single line in column 4.
* **6s:** Reduced to a single line in column 8.

**Input 1:**

* **7s:** Reduced to lines in columns 2 and 7.
* **8s:** Reduced to lines in columns 7 and 8.
* **3s:** Reduced to a line in column 8.

**Input 2:**

* **1s:** Reduced to lines in columns 5 and 9.
* **3s:** Reduced to a line in column 6.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve this transformation:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in partition(I):
    rightmost_col = rightmost(obj)
    line = frozenset({(color(obj), (i, rightmost_col)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)})
    O = paint(O, line)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Create an empty canvas (`O`) with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate Objects:** Loop through each distinct object (`obj`) in the input grid using `partition(I)`.
3. **Find Rightmost Column:** Determine the rightmost column (`rightmost_col`) occupied by the current object using `rightmost(obj)`.
4. **Generate Vertical Line:** Construct a new object (`line`) representing a vertical line with the object's color (`color(obj)`) in the `rightmost_col`, spanning from the topmost row (`uppermost(obj)`) to the bottommost row (`lowermost(obj)`) of the original object.
5. **Paint Line:** Paint the generated `line` onto the canvas (`O`) using `paint(O, line)`.
6. **Return Output:** After processing all objects, return the modified canvas (`O`) as the output.


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for v in palette(I):
    indices = ofcolor(I, v)
    if indices:
      max_j = max(j for _, j in indices)
      line = frozenset({(v, (i, max_j)) for i in range(height(I)) if (i, max_j) in indices})
      O = paint(O, line)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize:** Create an empty output grid `O`.
2. **Iterate Colors:** Loop through each unique color `v` in the input grid.
3. **Find Rightmost Column:** For each color, find the rightmost column `max_j` where the color exists.
4. **Create Line:** Generate a vertical line of that color at `max_j`, from the top to the bottom row.
5. **Paint Line:** Paint the line onto the output grid.
6. **Return Output:** Return the modified grid.


### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    right_edge = frozenset((i, rightmost(obj)) for i in range(height(I)) if (i, rightmost(obj)) in toindices(obj))
    O = paint(cover(O, obj), recolor(color(obj), right_edge))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize:** Set the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Loop through each object in the input grid using `fgpartition`.
3. **Extract Right Edge:** Identify the rightmost edge of each object and store its indices.
4. **Cover Original Object:** Erase the original object from the output grid by filling its area with the background color using `cover`.
5. **Recolor and Paint Edge:** Recolor the extracted right edge with the object's original color and paint it onto the output grid.
6. **Return Output:** Return the modified grid.


### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in partition(I):
    rightmost_index = max(toindices(obj), key=lambda x: x[1])
    line = connect((uppermost(obj), rightmost_index[1]), (lowermost(obj), rightmost_index[1]))
    O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), line))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize:** Create an empty output grid `O` of the same size and background color as the input.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Loop through each object in the input grid using `partition`.
3. **Find Rightmost Point:**  Find the rightmost point of the current object using `max` and a lambda function to compare column indices.
4. **Create Line:** Draw a line using `connect` from the topmost row to the bottommost row of the object, fixed at the column of the rightmost point.
5. **Recolor and Paint:** Recolor the line with the object's original color and paint it onto the output grid.
6. **Return Output:** Return the modified grid.


### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, rightmost(obj))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize:** Set the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Loop through each object in the input grid using `fgpartition`.
3. **Iterate Rows:** For each row within the object's bounding box, fill the cell in the rightmost column with the object's color.
4. **Return Output:** Return the modified grid.


These five program versions demonstrate distinct approaches to solving the given transformation task using different DSL function combinations and logic. Each version achieves the same output by identifying the rightmost edge of each object and representing it as a vertical line while maintaining the original color.
