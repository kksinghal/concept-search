## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

**General Rule:** For each object (connected digits of the same value), keep only the rightmost cell of each row where the object exists. 

**Example:**

Let's take an object from `Input_0`:

```
3 3 3 3 
3 3 0 0 
0 0 0 0 
```

The transformed object in `Output_0` would be:

```
0 0 0 3
0 0 3 0
0 0 0 0
```

**Applying to Inputs:**

- **Input_0, Input_1, Input_2:** The provided outputs for all three inputs follow this rule.  The rightmost cell of each row for each object is preserved, while the rest are replaced with the background color (0).

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program `Program_to_be_generated` to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract connected objects (without background)
    rightmost_cells = mapply(lambda obj: {(color(obj), (row, rightmost(obj))) for row in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)}, objs)  # Get rightmost cell for each row of each object
    covered_grid = cover(I, asindices(I))  # Create a blank grid with background color
    O = paint(covered_grid, rightmost_cells)  # Paint the rightmost cells onto the blank grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify all distinct objects in the input grid.
2. **Find Rightmost Cells:** For each object, iterate through its rows and find the rightmost cell. Store these cells with their respective colors.
3. **Create Blank Grid:** Generate a grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
4. **Paint Rightmost Cells:**  Paint the extracted rightmost cells onto the blank grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas with the background color
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1, -1, -1):  # Iterate through columns from right to left
      if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I):  # Check for non-background colors
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))})  # Paint the cell if it's not the background color
        break  # Move to the next row after finding the rightmost non-background cell
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Blank Canvas:** Create an empty grid filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate Right-to-Left:** Loop through each row of the input grid, examining columns from right to left.
3. **Identify & Paint Rightmost:** Upon encountering a non-background color, paint that cell onto the canvas and proceed to the next row. This ensures only the rightmost non-background cell in each row is painted.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects
  rightmost_cells = mapply(lambda obj: {(color(obj), (i, max(j for _, (x, j) in obj if x == i))) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)}, objs) # Find rightmost cells using list comprehension
  O = paint(cover(I, asindices(I)), rightmost_cells)  # Clear the grid and paint rightmost cells
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** Identify connected objects within the input.
2. **Rightmost Identification (Comprehension):** Use list comprehension to efficiently determine the rightmost cell for each row of each object.
3. **Grid Clearing & Painting:** Replace the entire input grid with the background color, then overlay the extracted rightmost cells.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Initialize output as input
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):  # Iterate through each object
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):  # Iterate through object's rows
      row_cells = {(v, (x, j)) for v, (x, j) in obj if x == i}  # Get cells in the current row
      if row_cells:
        rightmost_cell = (color(obj), (i, max(j for _, (_, j) in row_cells)))  # Find the rightmost cell in the row
        O = paint(cover(O, toindices(row_cells)), {rightmost_cell})  # Clear the row in the output and paint the rightmost cell
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterative Modification:** The output grid is iteratively modified from the input.
2. **Object-wise Processing:** The code iterates through each object in the input.
3. **Row-wise Rightmost:** For every row of an object, it identifies and preserves only the rightmost cell while clearing the rest.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas with the background color
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):  # Iterate over each object
    for i, row in enumerate(I):  # Iterate through rows of the input grid
      for j, cell_val in enumerate(row):  # Iterate through cells in each row
        if cell_val == color(obj) and (i, j) in toindices(obj) and j == rightmost(obj):  # Check if the cell is the rightmost cell of the object
          O = paint(O, {(cell_val, (i, j))})  # Paint the rightmost cell onto the output grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** Begin with a blank grid of the background color.
2. **Object-wise Iteration:** Process each identified object in the input grid.
3. **Rightmost Cell Detection:** For every cell in the input, check if it belongs to the current object and if it's the rightmost one in its row. If so, paint it onto the output canvas.
