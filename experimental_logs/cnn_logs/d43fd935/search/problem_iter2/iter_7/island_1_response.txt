## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied in these examples seems to be shifting the rightmost column of each distinct object (excluding the background color) to the left edge of the object. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The rightmost '1' column in the top-left object is shifted to the leftmost position of that object.
* The rightmost '6' column of each of the three bottom '6' objects are moved to their respective leftmost positions.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* Similar to Input_0, the rightmost column of every distinct object (clusters of '7', '8', and '3') is moved to the leftmost position of that object.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* Same pattern as the previous examples; the rightmost column of each object is shifted to its leftmost position.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation.

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), # Create a blank canvas
               merge(frozenset((color(obj), (i, leftmost(obj) + j)) # Shift and paint each cell
                     for j in range(width(obj)-1, -1, -1) # Iterate through columns right to left
                     for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)) # Iterate through rows
                     for obj in fgpartition(I))) # For each object
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input grid.
2. Iterates through each non-background object in the input.
3. For each object, it iterates through its columns from right to left.
4. It then iterates through each cell in the column and paints it on the canvas at the corresponding row but shifted to the leftmost position plus the column offset. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(v if j != rightmost(extract(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: (i, j) in toindices(obj))) else mostcolor(I) 
                 for j, v in enumerate(row)) # Replace rightmost column with background
               for i, row in enumerate(I)) # For each cell
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterates through each cell in the input grid.
2. For each cell, it checks if it belongs to the rightmost column of its corresponding object.
3. If it is, it replaces the cell value with the background color. Otherwise, it keeps the original value.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(I[i][j - width(extract(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: (i, j) in toindices(obj))) + 1]
                 if j == rightmost(extract(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: (i, j) in toindices(obj)))
                 else v
                 for j, v in enumerate(row))
               for i, row in enumerate(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterates through each cell in the input grid.
2. If the cell is the rightmost of its object, it gets the cell value from the leftmost column of that object.
3. Otherwise, it keeps the original cell value.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  new_objs = frozenset(frozenset((color(obj), (i, j - width(obj) + 1))
                         for c, (i, j) in obj)
                         for obj in objs)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), new_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. Extracts all non-background objects from the input grid.
2. For each object, it shifts all its cells to the left by the object's width - 1, essentially moving the rightmost column to the leftmost position.
3. Creates a new blank canvas and paints the shifted objects onto it.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
               merge(shift(obj, (0, -width(obj) + 1))
                     for obj in apply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), toindices(obj)), fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. Extracts non-background objects from the input.
2. Converts each object into a set of indices with their corresponding colors.
3. Shifts each object to the left by its width - 1.
4. Paints the shifted objects onto a blank canvas with the input's background color.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation. They utilize different combinations of DSL functions, showcasing the flexibility and diversity possible within the provided programming language.
