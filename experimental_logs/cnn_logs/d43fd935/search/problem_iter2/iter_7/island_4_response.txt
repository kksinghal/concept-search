## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

**For each distinct non-background color in the input grid:**

1. **Identify the leftmost column** containing that color.
2. **Shift all occurrences of that color** within the grid to that leftmost column, maintaining their original row positions.
3. **Fill the vacated cells** with the background color (most frequent color).

This essentially "compresses" each color group horizontally towards its leftmost appearance, resulting in vertical lines of each color.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Create blank canvas
  for v in palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}: # For each non-background color
    min_j = min(j for i, j in ofcolor(I, v)) # Find leftmost column
    for i, j in ofcolor(I, v):  
      O = paint(O, {(v, (i, min_j))}) # Paint at leftmost column
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a blank canvas `O` of the same size and background color as the input `I`.
2. Iterates through each distinct non-background color `v` in `I`.
3. Finds the `min_j`, the index of the leftmost column containing color `v`.
4. Iterates through all indices `(i, j)` where color `v` is present in the input.
5. For each such index, paints the color `v` at position `(i, min_j)` on the canvas `O`, effectively shifting it to the leftmost column.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I.copy() # Copy input grid
  for v in palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}:  # For each non-background color
    min_col = min(j for i, j in ofcolor(I, v)) # Find leftmost column
    O = fill(O, mostcommon(I), ofcolor(O, v)) # Clear existing color occurrences
    O = paint(O, recolor(v, {(i, min_col) for i in range(height(I))})) # Paint a vertical line at the leftmost column
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a copy `O` of the input grid `I`.
2. Iterates through each distinct non-background color `v` in `I`.
3. Finds the `min_col`, the index of the leftmost column containing color `v`.
4. Clears all existing occurrences of color `v` in the grid `O` by filling them with the background color.
5. Paints a vertical line of color `v` at the `min_col` on the grid `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Create blank canvas
  for obj in fgpartition(I): # Iterate over objects (excluding background)
    v = color(obj) # Get object's color
    leftmost_col = leftmost(obj) # Leftmost column of the object
    O = paint(O, recolor(v, {(i, leftmost_col) for i in range(height(I))})) # Paint a vertical line at that column
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a blank canvas `O`.
2. Iterates over each foreground object (excluding background) in the input grid.
3. Extracts the object's color `v`.
4. Determines the leftmost column `leftmost_col` of the object.
5. Paints a vertical line of color `v` at the `leftmost_col` on the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I.copy() # Copy input
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    min_j = leftmost(obj)
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
        O = paint(cover(O, {(color(obj), (i, j))}), {(color(obj), (i, min_j))})  # Move each cell to the leftmost column
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Copies the input grid.
2. Iterates through foreground objects.
3. Finds the leftmost column index `min_j` of the current object.
4. Iterates through cell indices `(i, j)` of the object.
5. Moves each cell to the `min_j` column by covering its original position and painting it at `(i, min_j)`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Blank canvas
  for v in palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}: # For each color
    j = min(j for i, j in ofcolor(I, v)) # Find leftmost column
    O = paint(O, recolor(v, {(i, j) for i in range(height(I))})) # Paint a vertical line
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a blank canvas `O`.
2. Iterates through each non-background color `v` in the input.
3. Determines the leftmost column index `j` where `v` appears.
4. Paints a vertical line of color `v` on the canvas at column `j`.

These five program versions provide diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformation using various DSL functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
