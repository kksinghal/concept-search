## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids to achieve the output grids can be described as follows:

**General Principle:** For each unique digit (representing a color) in the input grid, the transformation identifies the rightmost cell within each row where that digit appears.  It then "stretches" that rightmost cell horizontally to the left, replacing all other instances of the same digit in the same row. All other digits are left unchanged.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

* **Input_0 to Output_0:** 
    - Digit '1': In each row, only the rightmost '1' remains, all others are replaced by '0' (background).
    - Digit '3': In the 4th row, the rightmost '3' is stretched leftward, replacing the other two '3's.
    - Digit '6': In the 7th, 8th, and 9th rows, the rightmost '6' is stretched leftward.
* **Input_1 to Output_1:**
    -  Similar logic applies to digits '7', '3', and '8'.
* **Input_2 to Output_2:**
    - Digit '1' and '3' follow the same pattern of rightmost cell preservation and leftward stretching.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions utilizing the provided DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Create a blank canvas
    for v in palette(I): # Iterate over each color
        for i, row in enumerate(I): # Iterate over rows
            j = width(I) - 1
            while j >= 0:
                if row[j] == v:
                    O = paint(O, {(v, (i, k)) for k in range(j + 1)})  # Paint from the rightmost cell
                    break # Move to the next row
                j -= 1
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** A blank canvas (`O`) of the same shape as the input (`I`) is created, filled with the background color (most common color in `I`).
2. **Color Iteration:** The program iterates through each distinct color (`v`) present in the input grid.
3. **Row-wise Processing:** For each row (`i`) in the input grid:
   - It starts from the rightmost column (`j`) and moves towards the left.
   - If it encounters a cell containing the current color (`v`), it paints all cells from that position to the beginning of the row with the same color on the output canvas.
   - This ensures that only the rightmost occurrence of the color in each row is preserved and stretched.
4. **Output:** The modified canvas (`O`) is returned as the final output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
    for obj in partition(I):  # Process each color as a separate object
        for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
            rightmost_j = max(j for _, (row, j) in obj if row == i)
            O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, j)) for j in range(rightmost_j + 1)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Similar to version 1, it starts with a blank canvas.
2. **Partitioning by Color:** The input grid is divided into separate objects based on color using the `partition` function. 
3. **Object Processing:** It iterates through each object (representing all cells of a single color).
4. **Finding Rightmost Cell:** For each row within the object, it identifies the column index (`rightmost_j`) of the rightmost cell.
5. **Painting:** It paints the output canvas with the object's color from the beginning of the row up to and including the `rightmost_j` column.
6. **Output:** The canvas with stretched rightmost cells for each color is returned.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for v in palette(I):  
        for i in range(height(I)): 
            indices = [(i, j) for j in range(width(I)) if I[i][j] == v]
            if len(indices) > 0:
                _, rightmost_j = indices[-1]  # Get the rightmost j
                O = fill(O, mostcommon(I), {(i, j) for j in range(rightmost_j)})  # Clear cells left of rightmost
                O = paint(O, {(v, (i, rightmost_j))})  # Paint the rightmost cell
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **In-place Modification:** This version modifies the input grid `I` directly to produce the output.
2. **Color and Row Iteration:** It iterates through colors and rows similarly to previous versions.
3. **Finding Rightmost Cell:** For each color within a row, it finds the column index (`rightmost_j`) of the rightmost cell.
4. **Clearing and Painting:**
    - It first fills the cells to the left of `rightmost_j` with the background color, effectively clearing any previous instances of the current color.
    - Then, it paints the `rightmost_j` cell with the current color.
5. **Output:** The modified input grid, now representing the output, is returned.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I) - 1, -1, -1):
            v = I[i][j]
            if v != mostcommon(I):  # Ignore background cells
                O = paint(O, {(v, (i, k)) for k in range(j, width(I))})  # Paint rightward from current cell
                break  # Move to next row after painting
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Blank Canvas:** Starts with a blank canvas filled with the background color.
2. **Reverse Iteration:** It iterates through rows from top to bottom and columns from right to left.
3. **Non-Background Detection:** For each cell, it checks if its value is different from the background color.
4. **Rightward Painting:** If a non-background cell is found, it paints the output canvas with that cell's color, stretching it rightward to the end of the row. 
5. **Row Termination:** After painting, it moves to the next row, skipping any remaining cells in the current row. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  rightmost_cells = frozenset(merge([frozenset({(color(obj), (i, max(j for _, (x, j) in obj if x == i))) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)}) for obj in objs]))
  O = paint(cover(I, asindices(I)), rightmost_cells)
  return O
```
**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:** Using `objects(I, T, F, T)`, the program identifies all distinct connected regions ("objects") within the input grid `I`.
2. **Rightmost Cell Extraction:** For each object, it determines the rightmost cell within each row it occupies. It achieves this by first iterating through all the rows the object spans and, within each row, finding the maximum column index (`j`) where the object exists.  This information is stored in the `rightmost_cells` set.
3. **Canvas Preparation:** The original input grid `I` is then "cleared" by replacing all its cells with the background color using `cover(I, asindices(I))`.
4. **Painting Rightmost Cells:** Finally, the `paint` function strategically places the extracted `rightmost_cells` onto the cleared canvas. This step essentially restores the rightmost instance of each color in their respective rows, achieving the desired rightward stretching effect. 

**Note:** These versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation. They utilize various DSL functions, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the language.
