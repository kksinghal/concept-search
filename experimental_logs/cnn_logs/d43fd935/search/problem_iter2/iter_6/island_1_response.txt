## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on shifting elements within each unique object (excluding the background) to the rightmost edge of the object's bounding box.

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The '1's in the top-left and bottom-right corners are shifted to the rightmost edge of their respective objects.
* The '3' object and '6' objects are similarly transformed, with all elements aligned to their rightmost column.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* Similar right-shifting is applied to all objects ('7', '8', and '3') while maintaining their individual shapes.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

*  The transformation consistently shifts elements to the rightmost edge within each object.

## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
               merge(frozenset((color(obj), (i, rightmost(obj))) 
                     for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1))
                     for obj in fgpartition(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`**: Creates a blank canvas with the background color and dimensions of the input grid.
2. **`fgpartition(I)`**: Divides the input grid into objects, excluding the background.
3. **`for obj in fgpartition(I)`**: Iterates through each object.
4. **`frozenset((color(obj), (i, rightmost(obj))) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1))`**:  For each object, it creates a new object with the same color and height, but all elements are shifted to the column index `rightmost(obj)`.
5. **`merge(...)`**: Merges all the transformed objects.
6. **`paint(...)`**: Paints the merged objects onto the blank canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(v if j != rightmost(extract(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: (i, j) in toindices(obj))) else mostcolor(I) 
                 for j, v in enumerate(row))
               for i, row in enumerate(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`for i, row in enumerate(I)`**: Iterates over each row.
2. **`for j, v in enumerate(row)`**: Iterates over each cell in the row.
3. **`extract(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: (i, j) in toindices(obj))`**: Finds the object containing the current cell.
4. **`j != rightmost(...)`**: Checks if the current cell's column is not the rightmost column of the object.
5. **`v if ... else mostcolor(I)`**: If the condition is true (not the rightmost cell), keeps the original cell value; otherwise, replaces it with the background color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(mostcolor(I) if any(v == k and j == rightmost(obj) for obj in fgpartition(I) for k, (_, _) in obj) else v 
                   for j, v in enumerate(row))
               for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`for row in I`**: Iterates over each row.
2. **`for j, v in enumerate(row)`**: Iterates over each cell in the row.
3. **`any(v == k and j == rightmost(obj) for obj in fgpartition(I) for k, (_, _) in obj)`**: Checks if any object has the same color as the current cell and its rightmost column aligns with the current cell's column.
4. **`mostcolor(I) if ... else v`**: If the condition is true, replaces the cell with the background color; otherwise, keeps the original cell value.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  new_objs = frozenset(frozenset((color(obj), (i, rightmost(obj))) 
                         for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)) 
                         for obj in objs)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(new_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`**:  Gets all objects (excluding background) from the input.
2. **`new_objs = ...`**: Creates a new set of objects where each object's elements are shifted to the rightmost column of their original bounding box.
3. **`paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(new_objs))`**: Paints the merged transformed objects onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(next((color(obj) for obj in fgpartition(I) if (i, rightmost(obj)) == (i, j)), mostcolor(I))
                   for j, v in enumerate(row))
               for i, row in enumerate(I)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`for i, row in enumerate(I)`**: Iterates over each row.
2. **`for j, v in enumerate(row)`**: Iterates over each cell in the row.
3. **`(color(obj) for obj in fgpartition(I) if (i, rightmost(obj)) == (i, j))`**: Finds the color of the object whose rightmost column aligns with the current cell. 
4. **`next(..., mostcolor(I))`**: Returns the object's color if found; otherwise, returns the background color.

These five program versions utilize distinct approaches and function combinations while achieving the same objective: shifting elements within objects to their rightmost position. This showcase of diversity demonstrates the flexibility of the provided DSL and provides various perspectives on approaching the given transformation.
