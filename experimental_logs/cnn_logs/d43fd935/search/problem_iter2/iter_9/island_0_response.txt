## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to keep only the rightmost occurrence of each color in every row while replacing other occurrences with the background color.

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

- In the first row, only the rightmost '1' is kept.
- In the second row, only the rightmost '6' is kept.
- In the fourth row, only the rightmost occurrences of '3' and '1' are kept.
- Similarly, for other rows, only the rightmost occurrence of each color is preserved. 

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

- The transformation logic remains the same. For instance, in the third row, the rightmost occurrences of '7', '3' and '8' are kept, while other occurrences are replaced with '0'.

**Input 2 to Output 2:**

- Same logic applies. In the seventh row, only the rightmost occurrence of '3' is kept, and the rest are replaced with '0'.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Initialize output with background
  for i in range(height(I)):           # Iterate over rows
    seen_colors = set()                 # Keep track of seen colors
    for j in range(width(I) - 1, -1, -1): # Iterate columns right-to-left
      v = I[i][j]                     # Get the color at cell
      if v not in seen_colors:          # If color not seen before
        O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j))})  # Paint the cell in the output
        seen_colors.add(v)            # Mark color as seen
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** `O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))` creates an output grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate Rows:** The outer loop `for i in range(height(I))` iterates over each row of the input grid.
3. **Track Seen Colors:** `seen_colors = set()` initializes an empty set to store the colors encountered in the current row.
4. **Iterate Columns Right-to-Left:** The inner loop `for j in range(width(I) - 1, -1, -1)` iterates over the columns from right to left.
5. **Check Color Occurrence:** `if v not in seen_colors` checks if the current cell's color has been encountered before in the row.
6. **Paint Rightmost Occurrence:** If the color is encountered for the first time, `O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j))})` paints the cell in the output grid with the corresponding color at the same location.
7. **Mark Color Seen:** `seen_colors.add(v)` adds the current color to the `seen_colors` set, ensuring that only the rightmost occurrence is painted.

This logic is repeated for all rows, resulting in an output grid where only the rightmost occurrence of each color in each row is preserved.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I[:]  # Create a copy of the input grid
  for i in range(height(I)):          # Iterate over rows
    last_seen = {v: -1 for v in palette(I)} # Store last seen column for each color
    for j in range(width(I)):         # Iterate over columns left-to-right
      v = I[i][j]                    # Get the color at cell
      if last_seen[v] != -1:         # If the color was seen before in the row
        O = fill(O, mostcommon(I), {(i, k) for k in range(last_seen[v], j)}) # Replace previous occurrences with background
      last_seen[v] = j               # Update last seen column for the color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Copy Input:** `O = I[:]` creates a copy of the input grid to modify.
2. **Iterate Rows:** `for i in range(height(I))` iterates over each row.
3. **Track Last Seen:** `last_seen = {v: -1 for v in palette(I)}` creates a dictionary to store the last seen column index for each color in the grid. Initially, all colors are marked as not seen (-1).
4. **Iterate Columns:** `for j in range(width(I))` iterates over each column in the row.
5. **Check Previous Occurrences:** `if last_seen[v] != -1` checks if the current color was encountered before in the row. 
6. **Fill with Background:** If a previous occurrence exists, `O = fill(O, mostcommon(I), {(i, k) for k in range(last_seen[v], j)})` replaces all cells with that color from the last seen column to the current column with the background color.
7. **Update Last Seen:** `last_seen[v] = j` updates the `last_seen` dictionary with the current column index for the encountered color.

This process ensures that only the rightmost occurrence of each color in each row remains in the output grid.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Initialize with background
    for i, row in enumerate(I):        # Iterate over rows
        seen = set()                    # Keep track of seen colors
        for j in range(width(I) - 1, -1, -1): # Iterate columns right-to-left
            if row[j] not in seen:      # If color not seen in the row
                O[i] = O[i][:j] + (row[j],) + O[i][j+1:] # Replace with color from input
                seen.add(row[j])        # Mark color as seen
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** `O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))` creates an output grid filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate Rows:** `for i, row in enumerate(I)` iterates over each row.
3. **Track Seen Colors:** `seen = set()` initializes an empty set to track seen colors in the current row.
4. **Iterate Columns Right-to-Left:** `for j in range(width(I) - 1, -1, -1)` iterates over columns from right to left.
5. **Check and Replace:**  `if row[j] not in seen` checks if the color is encountered for the first time. If so, it replaces the corresponding cell in the output row with the color from the input using: `O[i] = O[i][:j] + (row[j],) + O[i][j+1:]`
6. **Mark as Seen:** `seen.add(row[j])` adds the encountered color to the `seen` set.

This method directly modifies the output grid by replacing cells with the rightmost occurrences of each color while iterating through the rows and columns.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Initialize with background
    for obj in partition(I):             # Iterate over objects in the grid
        for i, j in sorted(toindices(obj), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True): # Sort object indices by column (right to left)
            if O[i][j] == mostcommon(I): # If output cell still has background color
                O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, j))}) # Paint the cell with object color
                break                       # Move to the next object
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** `O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))` creates an output grid filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate over Objects:** `for obj in partition(I)` iterates over each object (connected components of the same color) in the input grid.
3. **Sort Object Indices:** `sorted(toindices(obj), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)` sorts the indices of each object by their column index in descending order, effectively prioritizing rightmost cells.
4. **Check for Background:** `if O[i][j] == mostcommon(I)` checks if the corresponding cell in the output grid still has the background color.
5. **Paint Rightmost Cell:** If the output cell has the background color, `O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, j))})` paints it with the color of the current object.
6. **Break and Proceed:** `break` terminates the inner loop, moving on to the next object, ensuring only the rightmost cell of each object is painted.

This version utilizes object detection and sorting to find and paint only the rightmost cells of each color in the grid.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = [list(row) for row in I]  # Create a mutable copy of the input grid
    for i in range(height(I)):       # Iterate over rows
        seen_colors = set()          # Keep track of seen colors
        for j in range(width(I)-1, -1, -1): # Iterate columns right-to-left
            v = O[i][j]             # Get the color at the cell
            if v in seen_colors:     # If color already seen
                O[i][j] = mostcommon(I) # Replace with background color
            else:
                seen_colors.add(v) # Mark color as seen 
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)  # Convert back to immutable tuples
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Mutable Copy:**  `O = [list(row) for row in I]` creates a mutable copy of the input grid, allowing direct cell modification.
2. **Iterate Rows:**  `for i in range(height(I))` iterates over each row.
3. **Track Seen Colors:** `seen_colors = set()` initializes a set to keep track of encountered colors in the current row.
4. **Iterate Columns Right-to-Left:**  `for j in range(width(I)-1, -1, -1)` iterates through columns from right to left.
5. **Check for Duplicates:**  `if v in seen_colors` checks if the current cell's color has been encountered before in the row. 
6. **Replace with Background:**  If a duplicate is found, `O[i][j] = mostcommon(I)` replaces the cell with the background color.
7. **Mark as Seen:** If the color is encountered for the first time,  `seen_colors.add(v)` adds it to the `seen_colors` set.

This version focuses on directly modifying a mutable copy of the input grid and replacing duplicate color occurrences with the background color in a single iteration over rows and columns. 

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation using different DSL functions and logic flow, showcasing distinct solutions to the given problem.
