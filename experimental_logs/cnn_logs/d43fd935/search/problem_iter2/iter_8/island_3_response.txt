## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

**For each distinct object in the input grid:**

1. **Identify the leftmost column occupied by the object.**
2. **Shift all cells of the object horizontally to align with this leftmost column.** This effectively "compresses" the object horizontally while maintaining its vertical structure.

**Examples:**

* **Input_0:**  The '1' object is compressed into a single column, as is the '6' object. The '3' object remains unchanged as it already occupies a single column.
* **Input_1:** The '7' objects are compressed to single columns. The '8' object is compressed to a column, leaving a single '8' in its original rightmost column. The '3' object remains unchanged.
* **Input_2:** Similar to the other examples, objects are compressed horizontally to occupy the minimum number of columns while preserving their vertical structure.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, along with explanations:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  for obj in objects(grid, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=False):
    leftmost_col = leftmost(obj)
    shifted_obj = frozenset((v, (i, leftmost_col)) for v, (i, _) in obj)
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, shifted_obj)
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize `new_grid`:**  A new grid is created with the same shape as the input grid, filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate through objects:**  The code iterates through each distinct object in the input grid.
3. **Find leftmost column:** The `leftmost` function identifies the leftmost column occupied by the current object.
4. **Shift object:**  A new object (`shifted_obj`) is created by shifting all cells of the current object horizontally so that they align with the `leftmost_col`.
5. **Paint to new grid:** The `shifted_obj` is then painted onto the `new_grid`.
6. **Return new grid:** Finally, the transformed `new_grid` is returned. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  transformed_objects = set()
  for obj in objects(grid, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=False):
    min_j = min(j for _, (i, j) in obj)
    transformed_objects.add(frozenset((val, (i, min_j)) for val, (i, _) in obj))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), merge(transformed_objects))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize `transformed_objects`:** A set to store the transformed objects is created.
2. **Iterate through objects:** The code iterates over each object in the input grid.
3. **Find leftmost column index (`min_j`):** For each object, the minimum column index (`j`) is determined, representing the leftmost column.
4. **Shift object horizontally:** A new object is created by transforming each cell's coordinates. The row index (`i`) remains the same, but the column index is replaced with `min_j`, aligning the object to the leftmost column. 
5. **Add to `transformed_objects`:** The shifted object is added to the `transformed_objects` set.
6. **Paint transformed objects onto a blank canvas:** A new canvas with the same dimensions and background color as the input is created. All transformed objects are painted onto this canvas.
7. **Return the transformed grid:** The modified grid is returned as the output.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), 
               merge(frozenset(
                 frozenset((v, (i, leftmost(obj))) for v, (i, _) in obj) 
                 for obj in objects(grid, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=False))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version compresses the logic of previous versions into a single line using nested comprehensions.

1. **Create a blank canvas:** A new grid is created, filled with the background color of the input grid and having the same dimensions.
2. **Transform and paint objects:**
    - The code iterates through each object in the input grid.
    - For each object, a new object is created where all cells are horizontally shifted to the leftmost column occupied by the original object.
    - This transformed object is directly painted onto the newly created canvas.
3. **Return the transformed grid:** The modified grid, with objects compressed horizontally, is returned.

**Program Version 4:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def shift_left(obj):
    min_col = min(j for _, (i, j) in obj)
    return frozenset((v, (i, min_col)) for v, (i, _) in obj)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), 
               merge(apply(shift_left, objects(grid, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=False))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a helper function `shift_left` to encapsulate the object transformation logic.

1. **Define `shift_left` function:** This function takes an object as input and returns a new object shifted to its leftmost column.
2. **Create a blank canvas:** Similar to previous versions, a new grid is created with the background color and dimensions of the input.
3. **Apply `shift_left` to all objects:** The `apply` function is used to apply the `shift_left` function to each object extracted from the input grid.
4. **Paint shifted objects:** The shifted objects are then merged and painted onto the blank canvas.
5. **Return the result:** The modified grid, with objects horizontally compressed, is returned.

**Program Version 5:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), 
      merge(frozenset(
          frozenset((v, (row, min(col for _, (_, col) in obj))) 
                    for v, (row, col) in obj)
          for obj in objects(grid, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=False)
      ))
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version further condenses the code by directly embedding the leftmost column calculation within the object transformation step.

1. **Create blank canvas:**  Similar to previous versions, a new canvas is generated with the background color and dimensions of the input grid.
2. **Transform and paint objects:**
   - The code iterates through each object found in the input grid.
   - For every object:
      - A new object is generated where each cell's column index is replaced with the minimum column index present within that object, effectively aligning it to the leftmost position. 
   - These shifted objects are then merged and painted onto the blank canvas.
3. **Return the result:** The function returns the transformed grid, showcasing the horizontally compressed objects.

These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
