## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied in these examples aims to shift all elements of each color to a vertical line, preserving their original column positions. The vertical line used for each color is determined by the leftmost occurrence of that color in the input grid. The background color (most common color) remains unchanged.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** 
    - Color 1: Leftmost column is 0, so both '1's are shifted to column 0.
    - Color 3: Leftmost column is 2, so all '3's are shifted to column 2.
    - Color 6: Leftmost column is 1, so all '6's are shifted to column 1.
* **Input_1 & Input_2:** Follow the same logic.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  # Create blank canvas
  for v in palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}:  # For each non-background color
    min_j = min(j for i, j in ofcolor(I, v))  # Find leftmost column
    O = paint(O, recolor(v, {(i, min_j) for i, j in ofcolor(I, v)})) # Paint all occurrences of the color in the leftmost column
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a blank canvas (`O`) of the same shape and background color as the input grid (`I`).
2. Iterates through each unique color (`v`) in the input grid, excluding the background color.
3. Finds the leftmost column index (`min_j`) where the current color occurs.
4. Recolors all occurrences of the current color to their corresponding positions in the `min_j` column on the canvas.
5. Returns the modified canvas (`O`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I.copy() # Copy input grid
  for v in palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}: # For each non-background color
    target_col = min(j for i, j in ofcolor(I, v)) # Get leftmost column for the color
    for i, j in ofcolor(I, v): # Iterate through locations with the current color
      if j != target_col: # If not already in the target column
        O = paint(cover(O, {(v, (i, j))}), {(v, (i, target_col))}) # Move the cell to the target column
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a copy (`O`) of the input grid (`I`).
2. Iterates through each color (`v`) in the input grid, except the background color.
3. Determines the target column (`target_col`) as the leftmost column containing the current color.
4. For each cell containing the current color, it checks if the cell is already in the `target_col`.
5. If not, it moves the cell to the `target_col` on the same row.
6. Returns the modified grid (`O`).

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Create blank canvas
  for obj in fgpartition(I): # Iterate through foreground objects
    v = color(obj) # Get object's color
    min_j = leftmost(obj) # Get the leftmost column of the object
    O = paint(O, recolor(v, {(i, min_j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)})) # Paint a vertical line from top to bottom of the object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a blank canvas (`O`) with the same background and shape as the input.
2. Iterates through each foreground object (`obj`) in the input.
3. Extracts the object's color (`v`) and its leftmost column index (`min_j`).
4. Draws a vertical line of color `v` on the canvas at column `min_j`, spanning from the topmost row to the bottommost row of the original object.
5. Returns the modified canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I.copy() # Copy input grid
  for obj in fgpartition(I): # For each object
    min_j = leftmost(obj) # Get the leftmost column of the object
    for i, j in toindices(obj): # For each cell in the object
      if j != min_j: # If the cell is not in the leftmost column
        O = paint(cover(O, {(color(obj), (i, j))}), {(color(obj), (i, min_j))}) # Move the cell to the leftmost column on the same row
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a copy (`O`) of the input grid (`I`).
2. Iterates over each foreground object in the input grid.
3. Determines the target column (`min_j`) as the leftmost column of the current object.
4. For each cell in the object, it checks if the cell is already in the `min_j` column.
5. If not, it moves the cell to the `min_j` column on the same row.
6. Returns the modified grid (`O`).

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Create blank canvas
  for v in palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}: # For each non-background color
    min_j = min(j for i, j in ofcolor(I, v)) # Find the leftmost column for the color
    for i in range(height(I)): # Iterate through each row
      if (i, min_j) in ofcolor(I, v): # Check if the current color exists in this row at the target column in the input
        O = paint(O, {(v, (i, min_j))}) # Paint the color at the target position
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. A blank canvas (`O`) is created with the same background color and dimensions as the input.
2. It iterates over each unique color (`v`) present in the input grid, excluding the background color.
3. It determines the `min_j` which represents the leftmost column index where the current color (`v`) is found.
4.  For each row in the grid, it checks if the color `v` exists at the `min_j` column in the original input. 
5. If the color `v` is present at that position in the input, it paints the same position on the canvas (`O`) with the color `v`. 
6. Finally, it returns the modified canvas (`O`).

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation by using different combinations of DSL functions and logic.
