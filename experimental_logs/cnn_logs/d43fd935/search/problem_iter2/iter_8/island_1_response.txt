## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

**For each object in the input grid:**

1. **Identify the rightmost column of the object.**
2. **Shift all the cells in the object to the right, so that the rightmost column aligns with the second column from the right.**
3. **Fill the original positions of the shifted cells with the background color.**

This effectively "shifts" each object one column to the right, leaving a trail of background color in its original position.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(mostcolor(I) if j == rightmost(extract(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: (i, j) in toindices(obj))) else v
                 for j, v in enumerate(row))
               for i, row in enumerate(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through each cell (i, j) in the input grid I.**
2. **For each cell, find the object it belongs to using `fgpartition(I)` and `extract` function.**
3. **If the current cell's column index `j` matches the `rightmost` column of the extracted object, replace it with the `mostcolor(I)`, effectively the background color.**
4. **Otherwise, keep the original cell value `v`.**

This code iterates through each cell and selectively replaces those in the rightmost column of each object with the background color, achieving the desired shift effect.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create a canvas filled with background color.
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, (0, 1)) # Shift object one column right
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, shifted_obj) # Paint the shifted object onto the new grid.
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a new grid `new_grid` filled with the background color using `canvas` function.**
2. **Iterate through each object in the input grid using `fgpartition(I)`.**
3. **Shift each object one column to the right using `shift(obj, (0, 1))`.**
4. **Paint the shifted object onto the `new_grid` using the `paint` function.**

This version directly manipulates objects, shifting them to the right and painting them onto a blank canvas to achieve the desired output.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(row[j+1] if j < width(I)-1 and (i,j+1) in toindices(extract(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: (i, j) in toindices(obj))) else row[j]
                 for j in range(len(row)))
               for i, row in enumerate(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through each cell (i, j) in the input grid I.**
2. **Check if the cell is not in the last column (`j < width(I)-1`).**
3. **If it's not in the last column, check if the next cell to the right ((i, j+1)) belongs to the same object using `fgpartition(I)`, `extract`, and `toindices` functions.**
4. **If both conditions are true, replace the current cell with the value of the cell to its right (`row[j+1]`).**
5. **Otherwise, keep the original cell value (`row[j]`).**

This version directly manipulates cell values by conditionally shifting values from the right, effectively simulating the object shift.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(v if j != rightmost(obj)-1  else mostcolor(I)
                 for j, v in enumerate(row))
               for obj in fgpartition(I)
               for i, row in enumerate(I) if any((i, k) in toindices(obj) for k in range(width(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through each object in the input grid using `fgpartition(I)`.**
2. **For each object, iterate through the rows of the input grid (`I`) that intersect with the object using `toindices` function.**
3. **For each cell (i, j) in the intersecting rows, check if the current column index `j` is one less than the rightmost column of the current object (`j != rightmost(obj)-1`).**
4. **If it is, replace the cell value with the background color (`mostcolor(I)`); otherwise, keep the original value (`v`).**

This version combines object-level iteration with cell-level manipulation to selectively replace cell values based on their position within each object.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  new_objs = frozenset(frozenset((color(obj), (i, min(j+1, width(I)-1))) for c, (i, j) in obj) for obj in objs)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(new_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract all objects from the input grid without the background using `fgpartition(I)`.**
2. **Create a new set of objects `new_objs` by shifting each cell in each object one column to the right. If the cell is already in the last column, keep it in the last column (`min(j+1, width(I)-1)`).**
3. **Create a blank canvas filled with the background color using `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`.**
4. **Paint all the shifted objects from `new_objs` onto the canvas using `paint` and `merge` functions.**

This version iterates through objects, shifts each cell within them, and then paints them onto a new canvas, achieving the desired transformation.

These five program versions demonstrate diverse ways to achieve the desired grid transformation using different DSL functions and logic. Each version offers a unique approach to solve the problem, highlighting the flexibility and expressive power of the provided DSL.
