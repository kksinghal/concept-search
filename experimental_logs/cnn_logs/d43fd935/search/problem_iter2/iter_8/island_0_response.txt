## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently removes all but the rightmost occurrence of each color within each row of the input grid, effectively "squashing" objects to the right. The background color remains unchanged.

**Input 0:**

* The two '1' objects, the '3' object, and the '6' objects are all reduced to their rightmost column.

**Input 1:**

* Similar to Input 0, all objects are squashed to their rightmost column. Note how the '8' object spanning multiple rows is handled correctly.

**Input 2:**

* The transformation operates identically, simplifying the '1' and '3' objects.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  # Initialize with background
  for i in range(height(I)):           # Iterate over rows
    seen_colors = set()                # Track colors seen in the row
    for j in range(width(I) - 1, -1, -1): # Iterate columns right-to-left
      v = I[i][j]                     # Get color at cell
      if v != mostcommon(I) and v not in seen_colors:  
        O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j))})  # Paint if not background and first occurrence
        seen_colors.add(v)            # Mark color as seen
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize:** Creates an output grid (`O`) filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate Rows:** Loops through each row of the input grid (`I`).
3. **Track Seen Colors:** Uses a set (`seen_colors`) to remember which colors have been encountered in the current row.
4. **Iterate Columns (Right-to-Left):** Processes columns from right to left to find the rightmost occurrence first.
5. **Paint Condition:** Only paints a cell in the output grid if:
   - The cell's color is not the background.
   - The cell's color has not been encountered yet in the current row.
6. **Mark Color:** After painting, adds the color to `seen_colors` to prevent painting further occurrences in the row.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I[:]  # Copy input grid
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for v in palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}:  # Iterate over colors except background
      for j in range(width(I)):
        if O[i][j] == v:
          O = fill(O, mostcommon(I), {(i, k) for k in range(j)}) # Clear leftward from first occurrence
          O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j))})  # Repaint the first occurrence
          break                       # Move to the next color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Copy Input:** Starts by creating a copy of the input grid (`O`).
2. **Iterate Rows:** Loops through each row of the grid.
3. **Iterate Colors:** For each row, iterates over the colors present in the input grid (excluding the background).
4. **Find First Occurrence:**  Searches for the first occurrence of the current color in the row.
5. **Clear and Repaint:** Upon finding the color:
   - Clears (fills with background color) all cells to the left of the current cell in the row.
   - Repaints the current cell with the original color.
6. **Break and Continue:**  Breaks the inner loop (column iteration) after processing a color to move to the next color in the row. 


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  # Initialize with background
  for obj in partition(I):            # Process objects
    if color(obj) != mostcommon(I):   # Ignore background objects
      rightmost_indices = [(i, j) for v, (i, j) in obj if v != mostcommon(I)]
      if rightmost_indices:
        i, j = max(rightmost_indices, key=lambda x: x[1]) # Find rightmost cell of object
        O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, j))}) # Paint only the rightmost cell
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize and Partition:** Creates a background-filled output grid and partitions the input into objects.
2. **Iterate Objects:**  Loops through each object in the partitioned input.
3. **Ignore Background:** Skips processing if the object is of the background color.
4. **Find Rightmost Cell:**  Iterates through the object's cells to determine the rightmost cell's index.
5. **Paint Rightmost:** Paints only the rightmost cell of the object onto the output grid. 


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Start with background
  for i, row in enumerate(I):          # Iterate rows
    last_seen = {v: -1 for v in palette(I)}  # Color: Last seen column index
    for j in range(width(I) - 1, -1, -1): # Iterate columns right-to-left
      v = row[j]
      if last_seen[v] == -1:
        last_seen[v] = j
        O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j))})  # Paint only the last seen occurrence
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization and Dictionary:** Creates a background grid and a dictionary (`last_seen`) to store the last seen column index for each color.
2. **Row Iteration:**  Loops through each row of the input grid.
3. **Right-to-Left Column Iteration:**  Processes columns from right to left to find the rightmost occurrence first.
4. **Update `last_seen`:**  For each cell, if the color hasn't been seen before in the row (index is -1), update `last_seen` with the current column index and paint the cell in the output grid. 


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I[:]  # Copy input
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
      if O[i][j] != mostcommon(I) and O[i][j+1] == mostcommon(I):
        O = fill(O, mostcommon(I), {(i, k) for k in range(j + 1)})  # Clear leftward from gaps
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Copy and Iterate:** Creates a copy of the input and iterates over rows and columns.
2. **Identify Gaps:** Detects "gaps" where a non-background color is immediately followed by the background color.
3. **Clear Leftward:** When a gap is found, clears (fills with background) all cells to the left of the gap, effectively squashing the object to the right.
