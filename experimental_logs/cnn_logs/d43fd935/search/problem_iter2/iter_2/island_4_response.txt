## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to isolate the leftmost column of each distinct object in the input grid. All other cells belonging to an object are replaced with the background color.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The two '1' objects are reduced to their leftmost columns.
* The '3' object is reduced to its leftmost column.
* The '6' object is reduced to its leftmost column.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The '7' objects are reduced to their leftmost columns.
* The '3' object is reduced to its leftmost column.
* The '8' object is reduced to its leftmost column.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The '1' objects are reduced to their leftmost columns.
* The '3' object is reduced to its leftmost column.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    leftmost_col = min(j for _, (i, j) in obj)
    O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, leftmost_col)) for _, (i, j) in obj if j == leftmost_col})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a blank canvas (`O`) of the same size and background color as the input grid (`I`).
2. Iterates over each object (`obj`) in the input grid (excluding the background).
3. Finds the minimum column index (`leftmost_col`) among all cells of the object.
4. Paints only the cells in the `leftmost_col` that belong to the current object onto the canvas.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = I
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    leftmost_col = leftmost(obj)
    for _, (i, j) in obj:
      if j != leftmost_col:
        O = fill(O, mostcommon(I), {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Initializes the output grid (`O`) as a copy of the input grid (`I`).
2. Iterates through each object (`obj`) in the input grid (excluding the background).
3. Identifies the leftmost column (`leftmost_col`) of the object.
4. Iterates through the object's cells and fills every cell not in `leftmost_col` with the background color.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    column = {(index(I, (i, j)), (i, j)) for i in range(height(I))}
    if len(palette(column)) > 2:  # More than one color + background
      leftmost_color = first(palette(column) - {mostcommon(I)})
      O = paint(O, recolor(leftmost_color, {(i, j) for (c, (i, j)) in column if c == leftmost_color}))
      O = fill(O, mostcommon(I), {(i, j) for i in range(height(I)) if index(O, (i, j)) != leftmost_color})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Initializes the output grid (`O`) as a copy of the input grid (`I`).
2.  Iterates through each column (`j`) of the input grid.
3.  Constructs a temporary object (`column`) representing the current column.
4.  If the column has more than one color (excluding the background), it identifies the leftmost object's color (`leftmost_color`) in that column.
5.  Recolors the cells in that column belonging to the `leftmost_color`.
6.  Fills the rest of the cells in the column with the background color.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True):
    min_j = leftmost(obj)
    O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, min_j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j == min_j})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates an empty canvas (`O`) of the same size as the input (`I`) filled with the background color.
2. Identifies all objects in the input grid.
3. For each object, finds its leftmost column (`min_j`).
4. Paints the cells of the object that are in the `min_j` column onto the canvas.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  leftmost_cols = [{(color(obj), (i, min(j for _, (k, j) in obj))) for _, (i, j) in obj} for obj in objs]
  O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(leftmost_cols))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identifies all objects in the input grid (excluding background) and stores them in `objs`.
2. Extracts the leftmost columns of each object and stores them with their respective colors in `leftmost_cols`.
3. Creates an empty canvas (`O`) and paints the extracted leftmost columns onto it.

These five versions provide distinct implementations using different logic and function combinations to achieve the same transformation. Each version analyzes the input grid, identifies the leftmost column of each object, and reconstructs the output grid by preserving only these columns while replacing the rest with the background color.
