## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to reduce the width of objects to a single cell while preserving their color and vertical extent. This effectively "skeletons" the objects along a vertical line. 

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**
* The '1' objects are reduced to a single column, preserving their vertical positions.
* The '3' object, initially a rectangle, is shrunk to a single column at its leftmost position. 
* The '6' objects undergo a similar transformation, shrinking to their leftmost column.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**
*  The transformation follows the same pattern â€“ each object ('7', '8', '3') is reduced to a single column located at its leftmost position.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**
*  Consistently, all objects ('1', '3') are shrunk to a single column at their leftmost positions.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct programs to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Initialize output with background color
  for obj in fgpartition(I): # Iterate over objects without considering background
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj) # Find the leftmost column index of the object
    O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, leftmost_j)) for _, (i, _) in obj}) # Paint a vertical line with the object's color at the leftmost column
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** The output grid is initialized with the background color of the input grid.
2. **Iterate over Objects:** The program iterates through each object in the input grid (excluding the background).
3. **Find Leftmost Column:**  For each object, the leftmost column index (`leftmost_j`) is determined.
4. **Paint Vertical Line:**  A vertical line is painted onto the output grid at the `leftmost_j` column, using the object's color and spanning the same rows as the original object.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)): # Iterate over rows
    for j in range(width(I)): # Iterate over columns
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I): # Check if cell is not background
        O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, 0)}) # Fill the output grid's first column in the same row with the object's color
        break # Move to the next row after encountering an object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Iterate Row-wise:** The program iterates through each row and then each cell within the row.
3. **Identify Non-Background:** If a cell's color doesn't match the background color, it's part of an object.
4. **Fill First Column:** The corresponding cell in the first column of the output grid is filled with the object's color.
5. **Move to Next Row:**  Once an object is encountered in a row, the loop breaks and proceeds to the next row.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return rot270(hconcat(*((tuple(mostcolor(I) if all(cell == mostcolor(I) for cell in row) else row[0] for _ in range(width(I))),) for row in rot90(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version takes a more mathematical approach by rotating the grid and utilizing vectorized operations. It might not be as readable, but it demonstrates a different approach. 

1. **Rotate:** Rotates the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
2. **Process Rows:**  Iterates through each row and checks if all cells are the background color. If so, it creates a row filled with the background color. Otherwise, it creates a row filled with the first cell's color, replicating it across the entire row. 
3. **Concatenate:** Concatenates the processed rows horizontally.
4. **Rotate Back:** Rotates the result 270 degrees counter-clockwise to get the final output.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    min_j = leftmost(obj)
    for _, (i, j) in obj:
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, min_j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

Similar to Version 1, but iterates through each cell of an object instead of just identifying the leftmost column. This is less efficient than Version 1 but still a valid approach.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(next((index(I, (row_index, col_index)) for col_index in range(width(I)) if index(I, (row_index, col_index)) != mostcolor(I)), mostcolor(I)) for _ in range(width(I))) for row_index in range(height(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes nested list comprehensions to achieve the transformation in a single line. It iterates through each cell and finds the first non-background color in each row, replicating it across the entire row in the output.

These five programs offer distinct approaches to achieving the desired object-shrinking transformation. Remember that efficiency can vary between versions, with versions 1 and 2 generally being more efficient.
