## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to **isolate the rightmost column of each distinct object** in the input grid. All other cells within an object are replaced with the background color (most frequent color) of the input grid.

**Example:**

Input:

```
1 1 0 0
0 1 1 2
0 0 1 2
```

Output:

```
0 0 0 0
0 0 1 2
0 0 1 2
```

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create an empty canvas filled with the background color
  for obj in fgpartition(I): # Iterate over each object
    rightmost_col = argmax(toindices(obj), lambda x: x[1])[1] # Find the rightmost column index
    rightmost_cells = {(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j == rightmost_col} # Extract cells in the rightmost column
    O = paint(O, rightmost_cells) # Paint the extracted cells onto the canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. An empty canvas `O` is created with the same dimensions as the input grid `I`, filled with the background color of `I`.
2. The program iterates over each object in the input grid `I`.
3. For each object, it identifies the index of the rightmost column.
4. It extracts all cells belonging to the object that reside in the rightmost column.
5. These extracted cells are then painted onto the canvas `O`.

**Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in fgpartition(I): # Iterate over each object
    rightmost_col = rightmost(obj) # Find the rightmost column index
    I = underfill(I, mostcolor(I), {(i, j) for i, j in asindices(I) if j != rightmost_col and (i, j) in toindices(obj)}) # Fill everything but the rightmost column with the background color
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. The program iterates through each object in the input grid `I`.
2. For each object, it determines the index of its rightmost column.
3. It then directly modifies the input grid `I` by overwriting all cells belonging to the current object, except those in the rightmost column, with the background color.

**Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create an empty canvas
  for j in range(width(I)): # Iterate over each column
    column_cells = {(I[i][j], (i, j)) for i in range(height(I)) if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I)} # Extract non-background cells in the column
    if len(column_cells) > 0: # Check if the column has non-background cells
      rightmost_object = argmax(objects(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), column_cells), True, False, True), lambda x: rightmost(x)) # Find the rightmost object in the column
      O = paint(O, rightmost_object) # Paint the rightmost object onto the canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  The code initializes an empty canvas `O`.
2. It iterates through each column of the input grid.
3. For each column, it extracts all non-background cells.
4. If non-background cells exist in the column, it identifies the rightmost object within that column.
5. This rightmost object is then painted onto the canvas `O`.

**Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create an empty canvas
  for i, row in enumerate(I): # Iterate over each row
    for j, val in enumerate(row): # Iterate over each cell in the row
      if val != mostcolor(I) and j == argmax(((k, v) for k, v in enumerate(row) if v == val), lambda x: x[0])[0]: # Check if it's the rightmost cell of its value in the row
        O = paint(O, {(val, (i, j))}) # Paint the cell onto the canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. The code initializes an empty canvas `O`.
2. It iterates through each cell in the input grid `I`.
3. It checks if the current cell is:
    - Not a background color
    - The rightmost cell of its kind within its row
4. If both conditions are true, the cell is painted onto the canvas `O`.

**Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          v if j == len(r) - 1 - tuple(reversed(r)).index(v) else mostcolor(I) # Keep the rightmost instance of each value in the row
          for j, v in enumerate(r)
      )
      for r in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version uses list comprehension for a more concise solution.
2. It iterates through each row and within each row, it iterates through each cell.
3. It checks if the current cell is the rightmost instance of its value within the row. If it is, it keeps the value; otherwise, it replaces it with the background color.
