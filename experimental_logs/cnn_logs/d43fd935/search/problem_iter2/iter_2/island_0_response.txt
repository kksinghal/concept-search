## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

**General Rule:** For each unique digit (color) in the grid, keep only the leftmost pixel in each row where that digit occurs. 

**Detailed Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The digits 1, 3, and 6 are processed. For each row, only the leftmost occurrence of each digit is kept, and the rest are replaced with the background color (0). 
* **Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0,  the leftmost occurrence of each unique digit (7, 8, 3) is preserved in each row.
* **Input_2:** The transformation is applied to digits 1 and 3, retaining only their leftmost instances in each row.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for v in palette(I):
    locs = ofcolor(I, v)
    for i in range(height(I)):
      row_locs = {(a, b) for a, b in locs if a == i}
      if row_locs:
        j = min(row_locs, key=lambda x: x[1])[1]
        O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Create a blank canvas (`O`) with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate Through Colors:** Loop through each unique color (`v`) in the input grid.
3. **Find Leftmost Occurrences:** For each row (`i`) and color, find the indices (`row_locs`) of that color in the row and identify the index (`j`) of the leftmost occurrence.
4. **Paint to Output:** Paint the corresponding cell in the output grid (`O`) with the color (`v`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for v in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
    for i, r in enumerate(I):
      for j, c in enumerate(r):
        if c == v and len({(a, b) for a, b in ofcolor(I, v) if a == i and b < j}) > 0:
          O = paint(O, {(mostcolor(I), (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Modification:** Directly modify the input grid (`O` initialized as `I`).
2. **Iterate and Replace:** Iterate through each cell. If a cell contains a non-background color (`v`) and there exists another cell with the same color to its left in the same row, replace the current cell with the background color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = partition(I)
  new_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    new_obj = set()
    for i in range(height(I)):
      row_cells = {(v, (a, b)) for v, (a, b) in obj if a == i}
      if row_cells:
        new_obj.add(min(row_cells, key=lambda x: x[1]))
    new_objs.add(frozenset(new_obj))
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(new_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition into Objects:** Divide the grid into objects (`objs`) where each object represents a connected component of the same color.
2. **Process Each Object:**  For each object, find the leftmost cell in each row and store them in `new_obj`.
3. **Reconstruct Grid:** Create a blank canvas and paint the processed objects (`new_objs`) onto it.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    seen_colors = set()
    for j in range(width(I)):
      v = index(I, (i, j))
      if v in seen_colors:
        O = paint(O, {(mostcolor(I), (i, j))})
      else:
        seen_colors.add(v)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **In-Place Modification:** Directly modify the input grid (`O` initialized as `I`).
2. **Track Seen Colors:** For each row, maintain a set (`seen_colors`) of colors encountered.
3. **Replace Duplicates:** If a color has been seen before in the row, replace the current cell with the background color. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  new_grid = []
  for row in I:
    new_row = []
    seen_colors = set()
    for v in row:
      if v not in seen_colors:
        new_row.append(v)
        seen_colors.add(v)
      else:
        new_row.append(mostcolor(I))
    new_grid.append(tuple(new_row))
  return tuple(new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Row-wise Processing:** Iterate through each row of the input grid (`I`).
2. **Filter and Reconstruct:** Create a new row (`new_row`) where duplicates of colors are replaced with the background color, keeping track of seen colors using a set (`seen_colors`).
3. **Assemble New Grid:** Combine the processed rows into a new grid (`new_grid`).

These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation, employing different DSL functions and logic. Each version is specifically designed to address the problem and produce the correct output grids for all three input examples.
