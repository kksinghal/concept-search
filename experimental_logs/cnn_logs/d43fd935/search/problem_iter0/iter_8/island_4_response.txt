## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves extending non-background objects in a specific direction until they hit another object or the edge of the grid. The direction of extension depends on the object's shape:

**Input_0:**

* **Object 1 (color 1):** Extends horizontally rightwards as its width is initially greater than its height.
* **Object 2 (color 3):** Extends horizontally rightwards as its width is initially greater than its height.
* **Object 3 (color 6):** Extends vertically downwards as its height is initially greater than its width.

**Input_1:**

* **Object 1 (color 7):** Extends vertically downwards as its height is initially greater than its width.
* **Object 2 (color 3):** Extends horizontally rightwards as its width is initially greater than its height.
* **Object 3 (color 8):** Extends vertically downwards as its height is initially greater than its width.

**Input_2:**

* **Object 1 (color 1):** Extends vertically downwards as its height is initially greater than its width.
* **Object 2 (color 3):** No change as it's a square.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        if width(obj) >= height(obj):
            I = fill(I, color(obj), connect(ulcorner(obj), (ulcorner(obj)[0], len(I[0]) - 1)))
        else:
            I = fill(I, color(obj), connect(ulcorner(obj), (len(I) - 1, ulcorner(obj)[1])))
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over objects:** The program iterates over each non-background object in the grid using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Determine extension direction:** It checks if the object's width is greater than or equal to its height using `width(obj) >= height(obj)`.
3. **Horizontal extension:** If the width is greater, it extends the object horizontally rightwards using `connect(ulcorner(obj), (ulcorner(obj)[0], len(I[0]) - 1))`. This creates a line from the object's upper-left corner to the right edge of the grid on the same row.
4. **Vertical extension:** If the height is greater, it extends the object vertically downwards using `connect(ulcorner(obj), (len(I) - 1, ulcorner(obj)[1]))`. This creates a line from the object's upper-left corner to the bottom edge of the grid on the same column.
5. **Fill with object's color:** The `fill` function then colors the connected line with the object's color using `color(obj)`.
6. **Return modified grid:** The program returns the modified grid `I`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for x in range(len(I)):
    for y in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[x][y] != mostcommon(I):
        obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: (x, y) in toindices(obj))
        if width(obj) >= height(obj):
          I = fill(I, I[x][y], connect((x, y), (x, len(I[0])-1)))
        else:
          I = fill(I, I[x][y], connect((x, y), (len(I)-1, y)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over cells:** This version iterates through each cell of the grid.
2. **Check for non-background color:** It checks if the cell's color is not the background color using `I[x][y] != mostcommon(I)`.
3. **Extract object:** If the cell is not background, it extracts the object containing that cell using `extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: (x, y) in toindices(obj))`.
4. **Determine extension direction:** Similar to Version 1, it checks the object's width and height to decide the direction.
5. **Extend and fill:** It extends the object horizontally or vertically using `connect` and `fill` functions based on the determined direction, similar to Version 1.
6. **Return modified grid:** It returns the modified grid `I`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    direction = (0, 1) if width(obj) >= height(obj) else (1, 0)
    start = ulcorner(obj)
    end = (len(I) - 1, start[1]) if direction[0] == 1 else (start[0], len(I[0]) - 1)
    line = connect(start, end)
    I = fill(I, color(obj), intersection(toindices(line), asindices(I)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** It first extracts all non-background objects using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Determine direction:** It pre-calculates the direction of extension based on the object's shape and stores it in the `direction` variable. 
3. **Calculate endpoint:** It calculates the endpoint of the line to be drawn based on the direction.
4. **Create and fill line:** It creates the line using `connect` and fills it with the object's color using `fill`, similar to previous versions. 
5. **Return modified grid:** It returns the modified grid `I`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for x, row in enumerate(I):
    for y, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != mostcommon(I):
        obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: (x, y) in toindices(obj))
        line = connect((x, y), (x, len(I[0])-1)) if width(obj) >= height(obj) else connect((x, y), (len(I) - 1, y))
        I = fill(I, val, intersection(toindices(line), asindices(I)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over cells:** Similar to Version 2, it iterates through each cell of the grid.
2. **Check for non-background color:** It checks if the cell is not background.
3. **Extract object:** It extracts the object containing the current cell.
4. **Determine line and fill:** It determines the line to be drawn based on the object's shape and fills it with the cell's color in a single line.
5. **Return modified grid:** It returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge({recolor(color(obj), connect(ulcorner(obj), (ulcorner(obj)[0], len(I[0])-1)))
                          if width(obj) >= height(obj)
                          else recolor(color(obj), connect(ulcorner(obj), (len(I)-1, ulcorner(obj)[1])))
                          for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects and determine extension:** This version utilizes set comprehension to iterate through objects, determine their extension direction, and create a new set of objects representing the extended lines.
2. **Merge and paint:** It merges all the new objects into a single object and paints it on the original grid using `paint`.
3. **Return modified grid:** It returns the modified grid.


These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation, using different loops, conditions, and function combinations, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL.
