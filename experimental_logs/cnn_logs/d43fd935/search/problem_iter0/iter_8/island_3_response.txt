## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**  The program identifies objects (clusters of same-colored cells). For every object containing the color '1', it draws a horizontal line connecting the leftmost and rightmost cells of that color within each row of the object.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the previous transformation, but this time it connects the leftmost and rightmost cells of each object with the color '7', extending the line to the edges of the grid.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** For objects with the color '1', the program creates a vertical line spanning the entire height of the object, connecting the topmost and bottommost cells. 

## Program to be Generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Extract objects
    painted = set()
    for obj in objs:
        target_color = color(first(obj))  # Get the color of the object
        for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
            row_cells = {(i, j) for j in range(width(I)) if (i, j) in toindices(obj) and index(I, (i, j)) == target_color}
            if len(row_cells) > 1:
                leftmost_cell = min(row_cells, key=lambda x: x[1])
                rightmost_cell = max(row_cells, key=lambda x: x[1])
                painted |= connect(leftmost_cell, rightmost_cell)
    O = paint(I, recolor(target_color, painted))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all distinct objects in the input grid.
2. **Iterate through Objects and Rows:** The code iterates through each object and then through each row of that object.
3. **Find Leftmost and Rightmost Cells:** Within each row, it finds the leftmost and rightmost cells of the object's color using `min` and `max` with a custom key function.
4. **Connect Cells:** If there are at least two cells in the row, it connects the leftmost and rightmost cells using `connect`.
5. **Paint the Lines:** Finally, it paints the connected lines with the object's original color using `paint` and `recolor`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Initialize output as input
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
      if index(I, (i, j)) == index(I, (i, j + 1)) and index(I, (i, j)) != mostcommon(I):
        O = paint(O, recolor(index(I, (i, j)), connect((i, j), (i, j + 1))))  # Connect horizontally
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for i in range(height(I) - 1):
      if index(I, (i, j)) == index(I, (i + 1, j)) and index(I, (i, j)) != mostcommon(I):
        O = paint(O, recolor(index(I, (i, j)), connect((i, j), (i + 1, j))))  # Connect vertically
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:**  Starts with the output grid `O` being the same as the input grid `I`.
2. **Horizontal Connection:** Iterates through each cell and its right neighbor. If they have the same color and are not the background color, it connects them horizontally.
3. **Vertical Connection:** Similar to horizontal connection, but iterates through each cell and its bottom neighbor, connecting them vertically.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  painted = set()
  for obj in objs:
    if width(obj) > 1:
      painted |= connect(ulcorner(obj), urcorner(obj))  # Connect horizontally for wide objects
    if height(obj) > 1:
      painted |= connect(ulcorner(obj), llcorner(obj))  # Connect vertically for tall objects
  O = paint(I, recolor(color(first(toobject(painted, I))), painted))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, T, T)` finds all objects.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** The code iterates through each object.
3. **Horizontal and Vertical Connection:** For each object, it checks its width and height. If the object is wider than one cell, it connects its upper-left and upper-right corners horizontally. If taller than one cell, it connects its upper-left and lower-left corners vertically.
4. **Paint Connections:** The connected lines are then painted using the first color found in the connected regions.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Extract objects
    lines = set()
    for obj in objs:
        for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
            if (i, j + 1) in toindices(obj) and index(I, (i, j)) == index(I, (i, j + 1)):
                lines.add(((i, j), (i, j + 1)))  # Add horizontal line
            if (i + 1, j) in toindices(obj) and index(I, (i, j)) == index(I, (i + 1, j)):
                lines.add(((i, j), (i + 1, j)))  # Add vertical line
    painted = set()
    for (start, end) in lines:
        painted |= connect(start, end)  # Connect identified lines
    O = paint(I, recolor(color(first(toobject(painted, I))), painted))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Potential Lines:** The code first identifies all objects and then iterates through each cell within each object. It checks for adjacent cells (right and below) with the same color, adding potential horizontal and vertical lines to the `lines` set.
2. **Connect Lines:** It then iterates through the `lines` set and connects the cell pairs using `connect`, forming the complete lines.
3. **Paint Connections:** Finally, it paints the connected lines using the color of the first connected cell.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Initialize output as input
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Extract all objects
  for obj in objs:
    min_row, min_col = ulcorner(obj)
    max_row, max_col = lrcorner(obj)
    if max_col - min_col > 0:  # Horizontal line condition
      for i in range(min_row, max_row + 1):
        O = paint(O, recolor(index(I, (i, min_col)), connect((i, min_col), (i, max_col))))
    if max_row - min_row > 0:  # Vertical line condition
      for j in range(min_col, max_col + 1):
        O = paint(O, recolor(index(I, (min_row, j)), connect((min_row, j), (max_row, j))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization and Object Extraction:** Starts by initializing the output `O` with the input `I` and extracting all objects from the input grid.
2. **Iterate Through Objects:** Iterates through each object, finding its bounding box (upper-left and lower-right corners).
3. **Horizontal and Vertical Line Conditions:** Checks if the object's width (difference between max_col and min_col) or height (difference between max_row and min_row) is greater than zero. 
4. **Drawing Lines:** If the conditions are met, it iterates through the rows or columns within the bounding box, drawing lines by connecting the edges of the bounding box with the object's color. 

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, using a variety of DSL functions and logic.
