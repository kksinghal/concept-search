## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to connect all objects of the same color that are on the same row or column with a line of that color. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The three `6` digits in the right half of the grid are connected with a horizontal line of `6`s.
* The two `1` digits in the right half of the grid are connected with a horizontal line of `1`s.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The four `8` digits are connected with a diagonal line of `8`s.
* The six `7` digits are connected with a vertical and horizontal line of `7`s. 

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The five `1` digits are connected with a vertical line of `1`s.

### Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve_connect_same_color(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Extract all objects from the grid
    O = I 
    for obj in objs:
      color_val = color(obj) # Get the color of the current object
      indices = toindices(obj) # Get the indices of the current object
      row_indices = frozenset(i for i, j in indices) # Get all row indices of the object
      col_indices = frozenset(j for i, j in indices) # Get all column indices of the object
      for i in row_indices:
        row_obj = frozenset((i,j) for j in range(width(I)) if index(I, (i,j)) == color_val) # Get all indices of the same color in the row
        O = fill(O, color_val, toindices(row_obj)) # Fill the entire row segment with the object's color
      for j in col_indices:
        col_obj = frozenset((i,j) for i in range(height(I)) if index(I, (i,j)) == color_val) # Get all indices of the same color in the column
        O = fill(O, color_val, toindices(col_obj)) # Fill the entire column segment with the object's color
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  We extract all objects from the grid using `objects(I, True, False, True)`.
2. **Iterate Objects:**  We iterate over each extracted object.
3. **Get Color and Indices:** For each object, we get its color using `color(obj)` and its indices using `toindices(obj)`.
4. **Process Rows:**  
   - We extract all row indices covered by the object.
   - For each row, we find all indices containing the object's color.
   - We fill the entire row segment between those indices with the object's color.
5. **Process Columns:** We repeat the same process for columns.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve_connect_same_color(I):
    O = I
    for value in palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}: # Iterate over each color in the grid, except the background
        indices = ofcolor(I, value) # Get the indices of all cells with the current color
        row_indices = frozenset(i for i, j in indices) # Get all row indices
        col_indices = frozenset(j for i, j in indices) # Get all column indices
        for i in row_indices:
            O = fill(O, value, frozenset((i,j) for j in range(width(I)) if index(I, (i,j)) == value)) # Connect horizontally
        for j in col_indices:
            O = fill(O, value, frozenset((i,j) for i in range(height(I)) if index(I, (i,j)) == value)) # Connect vertically
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Colors:** Loop through each unique color in the input grid, excluding the background color.
2. **Find Indices:** Identify the coordinates of all cells containing the current color using `ofcolor`.
3. **Horizontal Connection:** 
   - For each row containing the color, find the leftmost and rightmost occurrences of that color.
   - Fill the horizontal line between these points with the current color.
4. **Vertical Connection:** Repeat the connection process for columns.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve_connect_same_color(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Extract all objects
  O = I
  for obj1 in objs:
    for obj2 in objs:
      if obj1 != obj2 and color(obj1) == color(obj2) and (hmatching(obj1, obj2) or vmatching(obj1, obj2)): # Check if two objects are of the same color and on the same row or column
        connection_line = connect(centerofmass(obj1), centerofmass(obj2)) # Connect their centers of mass 
        O = fill(O, color(obj1), connection_line) # Fill the connection line with the object's color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Similar to previous versions, extract all objects from the grid.
2. **Pairwise Comparison:** Iterate through all pairs of objects.
3. **Connection Criteria:**  
   - Verify if the objects are distinct (`obj1 != obj2`).
   - Check if they have the same color (`color(obj1) == color(obj2)`).
   - Determine if they share a row or column using `hmatching` or `vmatching`.
4. **Establish Connection:** If all criteria are met, draw a line between the objects' centers of mass using `connect`.
5. **Fill Connection:** Fill the connecting line with the object's color.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve_connect_same_color(I):
    O = I
    for value in palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}:  # Iterate over colors
        indices = ofcolor(I, value)
        while True:
            changed = False  # Flag to track changes in each iteration
            for i, j in indices:
                for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]: # Directions to check for connection
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj # Neighboring index
                    if (0 <= ni < height(I) and 0 <= nj < width(I) and  
                       index(O, (ni, nj)) == value and index(I, (ni, nj)) == 0): 
                        O = fill(O, value, frozenset({(ni, nj)}))
                        changed = True
            if not changed:  # Stop if no new connections are made
                break
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Colors:**  Loop through each unique color (excluding background) in the input grid.
2. **Iterative Connection:** For each color:
   - Set a `changed` flag to `False`.
   - Iterate over all cells containing the current color.
   - For each such cell, examine its four neighbors (up, down, left, right).
   - If a neighbor has the same color in the output grid (`O`) but is empty (0) in the input grid (`I`), fill it with the current color in the output grid and set `changed` to `True`.
   - Repeat the process until no new connections are made in an iteration (`changed` remains `False`).

**Version 5:** 

```python
def solve_connect_same_color(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
        for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
            for direction in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]:
                line = shoot((i,j), direction)
                filtered_line = frozenset((li,lj) for li,lj in line if 0 <= li < height(I) and 0 <= lj < width(I) and index(I,(li,lj)) == color(obj))
                O = fill(O, color(obj), filtered_line)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Extract Objects:** Extract all objects from the grid.
2. **Iterate Objects and Cells:** Loop through each object and then each cell within that object.
3. **Shoot Lines:** For every cell, shoot lines in all four directions (up, down, left, right) using `shoot`.
4. **Filter Lines:** Filter the line to keep only the indices that fall within the grid boundaries and have the same color as the current object.
5. **Fill Lines:**  Fill the filtered line with the current object's color.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to solving the problem. Some focus on iterating through objects, while others prioritize iterating through colors or directly connecting cells. Each version utilizes distinct DSL functions and logic, providing diverse solutions to the transformation task.
