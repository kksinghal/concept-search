## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation extends objects to the right, filling the space between their rightmost point and the right edge of the grid. The fill color depends on the object's color:

* **Object Color 1:** Filled with the least common non-zero, non-background color.
* **Other Colors:** Filled with the object's own color.

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:**

* The single '1' object and the '6' objects are extended to the right edge.
* The '1' object is filled with '6' (least common non-zero, non-background).
* The '6' objects are filled with their own color ('6').

**Pair 1:**

* The '7' and '8' objects are extended rightward.
* '7' objects are filled with '7'.
* '8' objects are filled with '8'.

**Pair 2:**

* The '1' objects and '3' object are extended.
* '1' objects are filled with '3' (least common non-zero, non-background).
* '3' object is filled with '3'.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):  # Iterate over foreground objects
    obj_color = color(obj)
    fill_color = leastcolor(difference(palette(I), {0, mostcolor(I)})) if obj_color == 1 else obj_color
    extension = frozenset({(fill_color, (i, j)) 
                           for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) 
                           for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(I))})
    I = paint(I, extension)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate:** Loop through each foreground object in the grid.
2. **Determine Fill Color:** If the object's color is '1', find the least common non-zero, non-background color. Otherwise, use the object's own color.
3. **Create Extension:** Generate a set of cells representing the area to be filled, extending from the object's rightmost point to the grid's right edge.
4. **Paint:** Fill the extension area on the grid with the determined fill color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fill_color = leastcolor([c for c in palette(I) if c and c != mostcommon(I)])
  for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 1:
      rightmost_col = rightmost(obj)
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
        for j in range(rightmost_col + 1, width(I)):
          I = paint(I, {(fill_color, (i, j))})
    else:
      I = paint(I, recolor(color(obj), 
                            frozenset((i, j) 
                              for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) 
                              for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(I)))))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Fill Color:** Determine the least common non-zero, non-background color in the grid.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Loop through each foreground object.
3. **Handle Color 1:** If the object's color is '1', fill the extension area with the pre-determined fill color.
4. **Handle Other Colors:** Otherwise, recolor the extension area with the object's own color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        fill_color = leastcolor([c for c in palette(I) if c and c != mostcommon(I)])
        I = paint(I, {(fill_color, (i, k)) for k in range(j + 1, width(I))})
        break  # Stop extending after the first '1' in the row
      elif I[i][j] != mostcommon(I):
        I = paint(I, {(I[i][j], (i, k)) for k in range(j + 1, width(I))})
        break  # Stop extending after the first non-background color
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Cells:** Loop through each cell in the grid.
2. **Find Fill Color (if needed):** If the cell's color is '1', determine the least common non-zero, non-background color.
3. **Extend and Fill:** If the cell is '1' or a non-background color, extend rightward from that cell, filling with the appropriate color.
4. **Stop Extending:** After extending an object, stop processing the current row to avoid overwriting.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):
    obj_color = color(obj)
    extension = frozenset()
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      extension = extension | frozenset({(obj_color if obj_color != 1 else leastcolor(difference(palette(I), {0, mostcommon(I)})), (i, k)) for k in range(j + 1, width(I))})
    I = paint(I, extension)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Objects:** Loop through each foreground object.
2. **Build Extension:** For each cell in the object, add cells to the extension set, stretching to the right edge. Use the appropriate fill color based on the object's color.
3. **Paint:** After processing the entire object, paint the combined extension onto the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for i in range(height(I)):
    current_color = None
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I) and not current_color:
        current_color = I[i][j]
        if current_color == 1:
          current_color = leastcolor([c for c in palette(I) if c and c != mostcommon(I)])
      if current_color:
        I = paint(I, {(current_color, (i, j))})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Rows:** Loop through each row in the grid.
2. **Track Current Color:** Keep track of the current object's color being extended.
3. **Determine Fill Color:** If encountering a new non-background color, determine the appropriate fill color (handling '1' objects).
4. **Extend and Fill:** Fill the current cell with the tracked fill color if it's part of an object being extended.


These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to the transformation, employing different DSL functions and logic flows. Each successfully generates the desired output for all provided input grids.
