## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:** 

The transformation extends the objects with value '1' horizontally to the right until they connect with another object or the edge of the grid. Other objects remain unchanged.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

The transformation extends all objects horizontally to the right until they connect with another object or the edge of the grid.

**Input 2 to Output 2:**

This transformation seems to be an identity transformation, meaning the output is the same as the input.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions for achieving the desired transformations:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve_29ec7d0e(I):
    objs = objects(I, F, F, F)
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    for obj in objs:
        val = color(obj)
        if val != bg:
            for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
                for k in range(j+1, width(I)):
                    if index(I, (i, k)) != bg:
                        break
                    I = fill(I, val, {(i, k)})
    O = I
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** The code identifies all objects in the grid using `objects(I, F, F, F)`.
2. **Iterate through objects:** It iterates through each object and gets its color using `color(obj)`.
3. **Extend horizontally:**  For each cell in the object, it extends the object horizontally to the right by filling cells with the object's color until it hits another object or the edge of the grid.
4. **Output:** The modified grid is returned as the output.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve_29ec7d0e(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I)-1):
            if index(O, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and index(O, (i, j+1)) == mostcolor(I):
                O = fill(O, index(O, (i, j)), {(i, k) for k in range(j+1, width(I))})
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** This code directly iterates through the grid cells.
2. **Extend rightwards:** If a cell is not background and its right neighbor is background, it extends the cell's color rightwards until it encounters a non-background cell or the grid edge.
3. **Output:** The modified grid is returned as the output.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve_29ec7d0e(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, False)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  new_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) != bg:
      rightmost_cell = (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj))
      extension = {(rightmost_cell[0], j) for j in range(rightmost_cell[1] + 1, width(I))}
      new_objs.add(obj | recolor(color(obj), extension))
    else:
      new_objs.add(obj)
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(new_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects and background:**  Similar to Version 1, it identifies objects and the background color.
2. **Extend objects:** For each non-background object, it calculates the rightmost cell and creates an extension set of indices reaching the grid's right edge. It then combines the original object with the recoloured extension.
3. **Reconstruct Grid:**  It creates a new canvas filled with the background color and paints the modified objects onto it, effectively achieving the horizontal extension.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve_29ec7d0e(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(height(I)):
        current_color = None
        for j in range(width(I)):
            if current_color is not None and index(O, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I):
                O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
            else:
                current_color = index(O, (i, j)) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Track Color:** The code iterates through each row, tracking the current non-background color encountered. 
2. **Fill Background:** If the current color is not None and encounters a background cell, it fills that cell with the current color.
3. **Update Current Color:** If it encounters a new non-background color, it updates the `current_color`.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve_29ec7d0e(I):
    h, w = shape(I)
    grid = list(list(row) for row in I)
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w - 1, -1, -1):
            if grid[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
                for k in range(j - 1, -1, -1):
                    if grid[i][k] == mostcolor(I):
                        grid[i][k] = grid[i][j]
                    else:
                        break
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in grid) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate in Reverse:** This version iterates through each row from right to left.
2. **Fill Until Non-Background:** When it encounters a non-background color, it fills all background cells to its left with that color until it hits another non-background color. 
3. **Output:** The modified grid is converted back from a list of lists to a tuple of tuples and returned as the output.
