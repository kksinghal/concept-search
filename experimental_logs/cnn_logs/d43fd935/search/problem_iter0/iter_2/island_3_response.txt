## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation connects objects of the same color horizontally, extending a line from the leftmost point to the rightmost point of each object.

**Input_0:** 
* The isolated '1's are connected horizontally.
* The '3's are connected horizontally.
* The '6's are connected horizontally.

**Input_1:**
* The '7's are connected horizontally.
* The '3's are connected horizontally.
* The '8's are connected horizontally.

**Input_2:**
* The '1's are connected horizontally.
* The '3's are connected horizontally.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T) # Identify all objects
  x2 = apply(lambda obj: (leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj), color(obj)), x1)  # Get leftmost, rightmost columns, and color of each object
  x3 = apply(lambda x: frozenset((x[2], (i, j)) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(x[0], x[1] + 1)), x2)  # Create horizontal lines for each object
  x4 = mapply(identity, x3) # Merge all lines
  O = paint(I, x4) # Paint the lines onto the input grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Extract Information:** `apply(lambda obj: (leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj), color(obj)), x1)` iterates over each object and extracts its leftmost column index, rightmost column index, and color.
3. **Create Lines:** `apply(lambda x: frozenset((x[2], (i, j)) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(x[0], x[1] + 1)), x2)` generates a set of cells representing a horizontal line from the leftmost to the rightmost column for each object, colored with the object's color.
4. **Merge Lines:** `mapply(identity, x3)` merges all generated lines into a single set.
5. **Paint Lines:** `paint(I, x4)` paints the merged lines onto the input grid, producing the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T) # Identify all objects
  x2 = apply(lambda obj: connect((uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)), (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj))), x1) # Connect leftmost and rightmost points of each object on the same row
  x3 = mapply(lambda x: recolor(color(first(toobject(x, I))), x), x2) # Recolor the connections with the object's color
  x4 = merge(x3) # Merge all connections
  O = paint(I, x4) # Paint the connections onto the input grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Similar to Version 1.
2. **Connect Extremes:** `apply(lambda obj: connect((uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)), (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj))), x1)` connects the leftmost and rightmost points of each object on the same row using the `connect` function.
3. **Recolor Connections:** `mapply(lambda x: recolor(color(first(toobject(x, I))), x), x2)` recolors each connection with the original object's color.
4. **Merge and Paint:** Similar to Version 1. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T) # Identify all objects
  x2 = apply(lambda obj: (ulcorner(obj)[0], leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj), color(obj)), x1) # Get top row, leftmost, rightmost columns, and color of each object
  x3 = apply(lambda x: frozenset((x[3], (x[0], j)) for j in range(x[1], x[2] + 1)), x2)  # Create horizontal lines for each object at their top row
  x4 = mapply(identity, x3) # Merge all lines
  O = paint(I, x4) # Paint the lines onto the input grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Extract Information:** Extracts the top row index, leftmost column, rightmost column, and color of each object.
3. **Create Lines:** Creates horizontal lines for each object specifically at their top row, spanning from the leftmost to the rightmost column.
4. **Merge and Paint:** Similar to Version 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Identify all objects
  x2 = apply(lambda obj: ((uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)), color(obj)), x1)  # Get top-left corner and color for each object
  x3 = apply(lambda x: frozenset((x[1], (x[0][0], j)) for j in range(len(I[0]))), x2)  # Create horizontal lines at the top row of each object, spanning the entire grid width
  x4 = mapply(identity, x3)  # Merge the lines
  O = paint(I, x4)  # Paint the lines onto the input grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Extract Information:**  Extracts the top-left corner coordinates and the color of each object.
3. **Create Lines:** Creates horizontal lines at the top row of each object. These lines span the entire width of the grid.
4. **Merge and Paint:** Similar to Version 1. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T) # Get all objects
  x2 = apply(lambda obj: ((leftmost(obj), uppermost(obj)), (rightmost(obj), uppermost(obj))), x1)  # Extract the leftmost and rightmost points of each object on the top row
  x3 = apply(lambda x: connect(x[0], x[1]), x2) # Connect the extracted points to form lines
  x4 = mapply(lambda x: recolor(color(first(toobject(x, I))), x), x3)  # Recolor the lines with the corresponding object color
  x5 = merge(x4) # Merge all the lines
  O = paint(I, x5) # Paint the merged lines onto the input grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Extract Points:** `apply(lambda obj: ((leftmost(obj), uppermost(obj)), (rightmost(obj), uppermost(obj))), x1)` extracts the leftmost and rightmost points of each object, specifically on their top row.
3. **Connect Points:**  `apply(lambda x: connect(x[0], x[1]), x2)` uses the `connect` function to draw lines connecting the extracted leftmost and rightmost points of each object. 
4. **Recolor, Merge, and Paint:**  Similar to Version 2.
