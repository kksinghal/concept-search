## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:**  The transformation connects the '1' objects together horizontally, painting over any other numbers in the process. The '6' objects remain unchanged.

**Input 1 -> Output 1:** Similar to the previous transformation, the '7' objects are connected horizontally, overriding other numbers. The '8' objects remain the same.

**Input 2 -> Output 2:**  No change is observed in the grid, indicating an identity transformation.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

**Code:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, T, F, T)
  target_color = color(first(objs))
  filled_grid = grid
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == target_color:
      start_j = leftmost(obj)
      end_j = rightmost(obj)
      filled_grid = fill(filled_grid, target_color, {(i, j) for i in range(height(grid)) for j in range(start_j, end_j + 1)})
  return filled_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** It identifies all distinct objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Target Color:** It determines the color of the first object, which will be used for filling.
3. **Iterate and Fill:** For each object with the target color, it determines the leftmost and rightmost column indices and fills the entire horizontal span between them with the target color.

**Program Version 2:**

**Code:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  target_color = index(grid, (0, 0))
  return tuple(tuple(target_color if target_color in row else cell for cell in row) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Color:** It extracts the color of the top-left cell, assuming it's the target color.
2. **Fill Rows:** It iterates through each row, replacing cells with the target color if the target color is present in that row. Otherwise, it keeps the original cell value.

**Program Version 3:**

**Code:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, True)
  target_obj = first(objs)
  target_color = color(target_obj)
  filled_indices = set()
  for i in range(height(grid)):
    for obj in objs:
      if color(obj) == target_color and hmatching({(i, 0)}, obj):
        filled_indices |= {(i, j) for j in range(width(grid))}
  return fill(grid, target_color, frozenset(filled_indices)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Target:** It identifies objects and selects the first as the target, extracting its color.
2. **Horizontal Matching:** For each row, it checks if the target object has cells in that row.
3. **Fill Rows:** If a match is found, it fills the entire row with the target color.

**Program Version 4:**

**Code:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  target_color = index(grid, (0, 0))
  return tuple(tuple(cell if cell != 0 else target_color for cell in row) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Color:** It assumes the top-left cell contains the target color.
2. **Replace Zeros:** It iterates through the grid, replacing all cells containing '0' with the target color.

**Program Version 5:**

**Code:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, T, F, T)
  target_color = color(argmin(objs, size))
  h = height(grid)
  filled_indices = set()
  for j in range(width(grid)):
    for obj in objs:
      if color(obj) == target_color and contained((0, j), toindices(obj)):
        filled_indices |= {(i, j) for i in range(h)}
  return fill(grid, target_color, frozenset(filled_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Target:**  Identify objects and find the object with the smallest size, assuming its color is the target.
2. **Vertical Matching:** Iterate through columns, checking if the target object has cells in that column.
3. **Fill Columns:** If a match is found, fill the entire column with the target color.
