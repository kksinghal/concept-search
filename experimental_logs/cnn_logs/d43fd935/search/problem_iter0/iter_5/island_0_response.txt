## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending specific objects horizontally to the right edge of the grid. The extension's color depends on the object's original color.

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The object with color `1` at the top is extended to the right edge using the least frequent color in the grid (excluding `0`), which is `9`.
* The objects with color `6` are not extended.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* The objects with color `7` are extended to the right edge using the same color `7`. 
* The object with color `8` at the top right corner is extended downwards and then to the left edge using the same color `8`.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* The objects with color `1` are extended to the right edge using the least frequent color in the grid (excluding `0`), which is `9`. 
* The objects with color `3` are not extended.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Identify objects and non-zero colors
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  non_zero_colors = difference(palette(I), {0})

  # Function to extend object to the right edge with a specific color
  def extend_right(obj, color):
    rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
    extension = frozenset({(color, (i, j)) for i, j in product(range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1), range(rightmost_j + 1, width(I)))})
    return paint(I, recolor(color, extension))

  # Extend objects based on color
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 1:
      I = extend_right(obj, leastcommon(non_zero_colors))
    elif color(obj) == 7:
      I = extend_right(obj, 7)

  O = I
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Colors:**  Identifies objects (excluding background) and a set of non-zero colors present in the grid.
2. **`extend_right` Function:** Defines a function that extends a given object to the right edge of the grid using a specified color.
3. **Iterate and Extend:** Iterates through each object, extending those with color `1` using the least frequent non-zero color and those with color `7` using color `7` itself.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Identify objects and background color
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  bg_color = mostcommon(I)

  for obj in objs:
    target_color = color(obj)
    if target_color == 1:
      target_color = leastcolor(difference(palette(I), {bg_color}))
    I = paint(I, recolor(target_color, frozenset({(target_color, (i, j)) for i, j in product(range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1), range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(I)))})))

  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Background:**  Identifies objects and the background color.
2. **Iterate and Extend:**  Iterates through each object and dynamically determines the extension color. If the object's color is `1`, it uses the least frequent color (excluding background). Otherwise, it uses the object's own color. 
3. **Direct Painting:** Directly paints the extension onto the grid without using an intermediate `extend_right` function. 

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def extend_object(obj, fill_color):
    right_edge = width(I)
    return frozenset({(fill_color, (i, j)) 
                      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) 
                      for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, right_edge)})

  for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 1:
      fill_color = leastcolor(difference(palette(I), {0}))
      I = paint(I, extend_object(obj, fill_color))
    elif color(obj) == 7:
      I = paint(I, extend_object(obj, 7)) 
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_object` Function:** Defines a function to calculate the extension area based on an object and a fill color.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** Iterates over each object, applying the extension logic based on its color. It determines the least frequent non-zero color for objects with color `1`.
3. **Direct Painting:**  Uses the calculated extension area from `extend_object` to directly paint onto the grid.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    for v in palette(I) - {0}:
        obj = extract(objects(I, F, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == v)
        if v == 1:
            fill_color = leastcolor(difference(palette(I), {0}))
        else:
            fill_color = v
        extension = frozenset({(fill_color, (i, j)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(I))})
        I = paint(I, extension)
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over Colors:** Iterates directly over the palette of the input grid (excluding the background color `0`).
2. **Extract Object:**  For each color, extracts the corresponding object from the grid.
3. **Determine Fill Color:** Dynamically decides the fill color based on the object's color (`leastcolor` for `1`, otherwise the object's color).
4. **Extend and Paint:** Calculates the extension area and paints it onto the grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
    for obj in objs:
        c = color(obj)
        extension = frozenset({(c if c == 7 else leastcolor(difference(palette(I), {0})), (i, j)) 
                             for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) 
                             for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(I))})
        I = paint(I, extension)
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identifies objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** For each object, calculates the extension area and dynamically determines the fill color within the set comprehension. If the object's color is `7`, it uses `7`; otherwise, it uses the least frequent non-zero color.
3. **Direct Painting:** Directly paints the calculated extension onto the grid.
