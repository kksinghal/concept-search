## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects horizontally to the right until they encounter another object or the edge of the grid. The extension only occurs if the cell to the right is empty (background color).

**Input 0:**
- The '1' object at (0,0) doesn't extend because it hits the grid edge.
- The '6' objects at (1,8), (2,7), (6,7), (7,6), and (8,2) don't extend because they hit other '6' objects or the grid edge.
- The '3' object at (3,2) extends rightward to fill cells (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), and (3,7). 
- The '1' object at (3,8) extends rightward to fill cell (3,9).

**Input 1:**
- The '7' objects at (0,1) and (8,1) don't extend because they hit the grid edge.
- The '8' objects at (0,6), (1,6), (6,8), and (7,3) don't extend because they hit other objects or the grid edge.
- The '7' object at (2,3) extends rightward to fill cell (2,4).
- The '7' object at (9,6) doesn't extend because it hits the grid edge.
- The '8' object at (2,9) extends rightward to fill cell (2,10).

**Input 2:**
- No objects extend because they all hit either the grid edge or another object.

## Code Improvement:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # Identify all objects
  for obj in objs:
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj: # Iterate through object cells
      for k in range(j + 1, width(I)): # Extend rightward
        if index(I, (i, k)) != mostcommon(I): # Check for collision
          break 
        else:
          I = fill(I, v, {(i, k)}) # Fill if empty
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all connected objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Extend:**  The program iterates through each object and its cells. For each cell, it checks cells to the right.
3. **Collision Check:**  `index(I, (i, k)) != mostcommon(I)` checks if the cell to the right is empty (background color).
4. **Fill:**  If the cell is empty, `fill(I, v, {(i, k)})` fills it with the object's color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    rightmost_index = argmax(toindices(obj), lambda x: x[1]) # Find rightmost index
    for j in range(rightmost_index[1] + 1, width(I)): # Iterate from rightmost index
      extension = frozenset({(i, j) for i, _ in toindices(obj)}) # Create extension
      if all(index(I, (i, j)) == mostcommon(I) for (i, _) in extension): # Check for collision
        O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), extension)) # Paint extension
      else:
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Rightmost Index:**  Finds objects and their rightmost cell's column index.
2. **Iterate and Extend:**  Iterates through columns to the right of the rightmost index.
3. **Create Extension:** Generates a potential extension of the object for each column.
4. **Collision Check:**  Verifies if all cells in the potential extension are empty.
5. **Paint Extension:**  If empty, paints the extension with the object's color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      k = j + 1
      while k < width(I) and index(O, (i, k)) == mostcommon(I):
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, k)})
        k += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identifies all connected objects.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** Iterates through each cell of each object.
3. **Check and Fill:** Uses a `while` loop to extend rightward, filling empty cells with the object's color until encountering a non-background cell or the grid edge.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    rightmost_col = rightmost(obj)
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      extension = frozenset({(i, x) for x in range(j + 1, rightmost_col + width(I))})
      O = underpaint(O, recolor(color(obj), extension)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Rightmost Column:** Identifies objects and their rightmost column index.
2. **Iterate and Extend:**  Iterates through each cell of an object.
3. **Create and Paint Extension:** Creates a large extension reaching beyond the grid and uses `underpaint` to only paint on background cells, effectively extending the object until it hits another object or the grid edge.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    for x in range(width(I)):
      extension = shift(obj, (0, x))
      if any(index(I, (i, j)) != mostcommon(I) for (v, (i, j)) in extension if 0 <= j < width(I)):
        break
      I = paint(I, extension)
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identifies all connected objects.
2. **Iterate and Shift:**  Iterates through possible horizontal shifts and creates a shifted copy of the object.
3. **Collision Check:** Checks if the shifted object would collide with a non-background cell.
4. **Paint:**  If no collision, paints the shifted object onto the grid.
