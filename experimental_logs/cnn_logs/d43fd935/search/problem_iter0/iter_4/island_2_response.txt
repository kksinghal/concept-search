## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation extends objects to the right, stopping when encountering another object.  Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The single '1' objects remain unchanged.
* The '6' objects extend rightward, filling the empty spaces until they hit the rightmost '1' object or the grid boundary.
* The '3' object extends rightward, filling the empty spaces until it hits the rightmost '1' object.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

*  The '8' objects extend rightward until they hit other objects or the grid boundary. 
*  The '7' objects extend rightward, merging with adjacent '7's and stopping at the '3' object and grid boundary.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* No changes occur as all '1' and '3' objects are already touching other objects or the grid boundary to their right. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions for the "Program_to_be_generated" function:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # Identify all objects in the grid.
  for obj in objs:
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj: # Iterate through each cell of the object.
      for k in range(j + 1, width(I)): # Extend rightward from the cell.
        if (i, k) in toindices(objs): # If we encounter another object, stop.
          break
        else:
          I = fill(I, v, {(i, k)}) # Otherwise, fill the cell with the object's color.
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all distinct objects within the input grid `I`.
2.  **Iterate and Extend:** The code iterates through each cell of every object. For each cell, it extends rightward, filling empty cells with the object's color until it encounters a cell belonging to another object. 
3.  **Return Modified Grid:** Finally, the modified grid `I`, now representing the desired output, is returned as `O`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)): # Iterate through each row.
    for j in range(width(I) - 1): # Iterate through columns, except the last one.
      if index(O, (i, j)) != index(O, (i, j + 1)) and index(O, (i, j)) != 0: # If the current cell and its right neighbor are different and not background.
        if index(O, (i, j + 1)) == 0: # If the right neighbor is background, fill it.
          O = fill(O, index(O, (i, j)), {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Grid:** This version iterates through each cell of the grid, comparing it with its right neighbor.
2. **Extend Objects:** If a cell is non-background and its right neighbor is background, the neighbor is filled with the current cell's color, effectively extending the object. 
3. **Return Modified Grid:** The modified grid is returned as the output.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
    filled = asindices(I)
    for obj in objs:
      for cell in toindices(obj):
        filled = difference(filled, hfrontier(cell))
    O = fill(I, mostcommon(I), filled)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Filled Cells:**  This version identifies all objects and creates a set of all grid indices representing initially filled cells.
2. **Remove Horizontal Frontiers:** For each object, it removes its corresponding horizontal frontier from the `filled` set. This effectively marks the cells to be filled.
3. **Fill Remaining Cells:** It fills the remaining cells in the `filled` set with the background color (most common color).

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    rightmost_cell = argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1])
    rightmost_j = rightmost_cell[1][1]
    for j in range(rightmost_j + 1, width(I)):
      extension = frozenset({(cell[1][0], j) for cell in obj})
      if intersection(toindices(extension), toindices(objects(O, T, F, F))) == frozenset():
        O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), extension))
      else:
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Find Rightmost Cell:**  It iterates through each object and finds its rightmost cell.
2. **Create and Check Extension:** It creates a potential extension of the object to the right and checks if it overlaps with any existing object.
3. **Paint Extension:**  If no overlap is detected, the extension is painted onto the grid. Otherwise, the loop breaks, preventing further extension of the object.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  for obj in objs:
    for j in range(width(I)): # For every column
      column = frozenset({(i, j) for i in range(height(I))}) # Define column
      intersection = toindices(obj) & column
      if len(intersection) > 0: # If object has a cell in the column
        for i in range(height(I)):
          if (i, j) not in toindices(objs) and (i, j - 1) in toindices(obj):
            I = fill(I, color(obj), {(i, j)})
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects and Columns:** This version iterates through each object and then each column of the grid.
2. **Check for Intersection:**  It determines if the object has at least one cell in the current column. 
3. **Extend to the Right:**  If an intersection is found, it checks cells to the right of the object within the same column. If the right neighbor is empty, it's filled with the object's color.

These five programs offer distinct approaches to achieve the desired object extension transformation. They showcase the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for tackling spatial reasoning problems. Remember that these are just a few possible solutions, and exploring alternative function combinations and logic within the DSL can lead to even more diverse and efficient solutions!
