## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific objects based on color and then extending them either horizontally or vertically until they encounter an object of a different color. 

**Input_0:** 
- The object with color '1' at position (3,8) extends rightward, becoming a horizontal line.
- The object with color '6' at position (1,8) extends upwards, forming a vertical line.

**Input_1:**
- The object with color '7' at position (1,1) extends both upwards and rightwards.
- The object with color '8' at position (0,6) extends both downwards and rightwards.

**Input_2:**
- The object with color '1' at position (1,1) extends both upwards and downwards.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" utilizing the provided DSL:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    
    def extend_object(obj):
        color = first(obj)[0]
        top_i = uppermost(obj)
        bottom_i = lowermost(obj)
        left_j = leftmost(obj)
        right_j = rightmost(obj)
        
        for i in range(top_i - 1, -1, -1):
            if index(I, (i, left_j)) != bg:
                break
            obj = obj | {(color, (i, left_j))}
        for i in range(bottom_i + 1, len(I)):
            if index(I, (i, left_j)) != bg:
                break
            obj = obj | {(color, (i, left_j))}
        for j in range(left_j - 1, -1, -1):
            if index(I, (top_i, j)) != bg:
                break
            obj = obj | {(color, (top_i, j))}
        for j in range(right_j + 1, len(I[0])):
            if index(I, (top_i, j)) != bg:
                break
            obj = obj | {(color, (top_i, j))}
        return obj

    extended_objs = frozenset({extend_object(obj) for obj in objs})
    O = paint(I, merge(extended_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** It first identifies all objects in the input grid `I` using the `objects` function with appropriate parameters. 
2. **Extend Objects:** For each object:
    - It retrieves the object's color and bounding box coordinates.
    - It iterates in all four directions (up, down, left, right) from the object's edges.
    - For each direction, it extends the object by adding cells with the object's color until it encounters a cell with a different color.
3. **Paint Objects:** Finally, it paints all extended objects back onto the input grid, resulting in the output grid `O`.


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    
    def extend_direction(obj, direction):
        color = first(obj)[0]
        start = centerofmass(obj)
        while True:
            start = add(start, direction)
            if index(I, start) != bg:
                break
            obj = obj | {(color, start)}
        return obj

    extended_objs = frozenset({
        extend_direction(extend_direction(obj, UP), DOWN)
        if portrait(obj)
        else extend_direction(extend_direction(obj, LEFT), RIGHT)
        for obj in objs
    })
    O = paint(I, merge(extended_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1, it starts by identifying objects in the grid.
2. **Extend Based on Orientation:** 
    - It determines whether an object is taller than it is wide (portrait) or wider than it is tall (landscape) using `portrait`.
    - If portrait, it extends the object upwards and downwards.
    - If landscape, it extends the object leftwards and rightwards.
3. **Extend and Paint:** The extension process utilizes the `extend_direction` function, which iteratively adds cells in a given direction until it encounters a non-background color. Finally, it paints the extended objects onto the input grid.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    changed = T
    while changed:
        changed = F
        for color in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
            obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, color), I)
            h_extension = mpapply(lambda loc: shoot(loc, RIGHT) | shoot(loc, LEFT), toindices(obj))
            v_extension = mpapply(lambda loc: shoot(loc, UP) | shoot(loc, DOWN), toindices(obj))
            
            if len(intersection(h_extension, ofcolor(I, color))) == len(h_extension):
                I = paint(I, recolor(color, h_extension))
                changed = T
            if len(intersection(v_extension, ofcolor(I, color))) == len(v_extension):
                I = paint(I, recolor(color, v_extension))
                changed = T
    O = I
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterative Extension:** This version takes an iterative approach, extending objects until no further extension is possible.
2. **Color-Based Iteration:** It iterates through each color (except the background) in the grid.
3. **Generate Potential Extensions:** For each object of the current color, it generates potential horizontal and vertical extensions using `shoot`.
4. **Check Validity and Extend:** It checks if the potential extensions intersect only with cells of the same color. If so, it paints the extensions with the object's color and marks `changed` as `True` to indicate further iterations are needed.
5. **Repeat Until Stable:** This process repeats until no more extensions are possible (`changed` remains `False`).

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    
    def extend_until_obstacle(obj, direction):
        color = first(obj)[0]
        frontier = toindices(obj)
        while True:
            new_frontier = mapply(lambda loc: add(loc, direction), frontier)
            if len(intersection(new_frontier, ofcolor(I, bg))) != len(new_frontier):
                break
            frontier = new_frontier
            obj = obj | recolor(color, frontier)
        return obj
    
    extended_objs = frozenset({
        extend_until_obstacle(extend_until_obstacle(obj, UP), DOWN)
        if portrait(obj)
        else extend_until_obstacle(extend_until_obstacle(obj, LEFT), RIGHT)
        for obj in objs
    })
    O = paint(I, merge(extended_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:**  Identifies objects in the grid.
2. **Directional Extension:**
    - Similar to version 2, it determines object orientation.
    - It utilizes the `extend_until_obstacle` function to extend the object in two opposite directions based on its orientation.
3. **Frontier-Based Extension:**  The `extend_until_obstacle` function maintains a "frontier" of cells at the edge of the object. In each iteration, it:
    - Calculates a new frontier by shifting the current frontier in the specified direction.
    - Checks if the new frontier intersects with any non-background color.
    - If it encounters an obstacle (non-background color), the extension stops. Otherwise, the new frontier is painted, and the process repeats.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    bg = mostcolor(I)

    def extend_object(obj):
        color = first(obj)[0]
        extension = toindices(obj)
        changed = T
        while changed:
            changed = F
            for direction in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]:
                new_extension = mapply(lambda loc: add(loc, direction), extension)
                if len(intersection(new_extension, ofcolor(I, bg))) == len(new_extension):
                    extension = new_extension
                    changed = T
        return recolor(color, extension)

    extended_objs = frozenset({extend_object(obj) for obj in objs})
    O = paint(I, merge(extended_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object and Background Identification:**  Identifies objects and the background color in the grid.
2. **Iterative Extension with Direction Cycling:** 
    - It iteratively extends each object until no further extension is possible.
    - In each iteration, it cycles through all four directions (up, down, left, right).
3. **Extension and Obstacle Check:**  For each direction, it:
    - Calculates a potential extension by shifting the current object boundary.
    - Checks if the potential extension consists only of background color cells.
    - If it encounters an obstacle, it moves to the next direction. Otherwise, the extension is applied.
4. **Painting Extended Objects:**  Finally, all extended objects are painted back onto the input grid to generate the output.

These five programs provide distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation, ranging from simple directional extensions to iterative frontier-based approaches. Each program leverages different combinations of DSL functions, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for solving this spatial reasoning task.
