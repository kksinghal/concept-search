## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) and extending them horizontally towards the right, stopping just before encountering a different object. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The '1' object at (3,8) extends rightwards, filling the space with '1's until it reaches the '6' at (2,8).
* The '6' objects at (1,8) and (7,6) remain unchanged as they are already at the rightmost edge. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The '7' object at (2,3) extends rightwards, becoming a horizontal line until it encounters '3' object.
* The '8' objects at (2,9) and (6,8) remain unchanged as they are already at the rightmost edge. 

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The '1' objects at (2,1), (3,4) and (5,9) extend rightwards, becoming vertical lines until reaching the right edge. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions, each with a unique approach to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  filled_grid = I
  for obj in objs:
    for _, (i, j) in sorted(obj, key=lambda x: x[1][1]):
      for k in range(j + 1, width(I)):
        if index(I, (i, k)) == bg:
          filled_grid = fill(filled_grid, color(obj), {(i, k)})
        else:
          break
  O = filled_grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extract objects from the input grid using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** Loop through each object. For each cell within an object, iterate horizontally towards the right.
3. **Check and Fill:** If the encountered cell is the background color (`bg`), fill it with the object's color. If a different object is encountered, stop filling.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    new_grid = canvas(bg, shape(I))
    for obj in objs:
        leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
        for _, (i, j) in obj:
            new_grid = fill(new_grid, color(obj), {(i, k) for k in range(leftmost_j, width(I))})
    O = new_grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Background:** Find all objects in the input grid and determine the background color.
2. **Create Empty Canvas:** Generate an empty grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
3. **Iterate through Objects:** Loop through each object in the input grid.
4. **Fill From Leftmost:** For each cell in the object, paint a horizontal line on the new canvas from the object's leftmost column to the right edge of the grid, effectively extending the object.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  grid = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(height(I)):
      row_obj = sfilter(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][0] == i)
      if len(row_obj) > 0:
        rightmost_j = rightmost(row_obj)
        for j in range(rightmost_j + 1, width(I)):
          if index(grid, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I):
            grid = fill(grid, color(obj), {(i, j)})
          else:
            break
  O = grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extract objects from the input grid using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Iterate Rows:** For each row in the grid, find the rightmost cell of each object present on that row.
3. **Extend Rightwards:** Starting from the rightmost cell of each object, extend the object horizontally by filling with the object's color until encountering a cell that is not the background color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    modified_grid = I
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I) - 1):
            if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I):
                modified_grid = fill(modified_grid, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, k) for k in range(j + 1, width(I))})
    O = modified_grid
    return O

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:** This program directly iterates through each cell in the input grid.
2. **Identify Starting Points:** If a cell is not the background color and the cell to its right is the background color, it's considered a starting point for extension.
3. **Fill Rightwards:**  From the identified starting point, fill all subsequent cells to the right with the starting cell's color. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    ul = ulcorner(obj)
    for _, (i, j) in obj:
      if j >= ul[1]:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, color(obj), {(i, k) for k in range(j, width(I))})
  O = new_grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** Generates an empty grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** Loops through each object identified in the input grid.
3. **Find Upper-Left Corner:** Determines the upper-left corner of the current object.
4. **Fill From Current Cell:** For each cell in the object, if its column index is greater than or equal to the upper-left corner's column index, it fills the new grid with the object's color from the current cell to the right edge. 

These five program versions showcase different logical approaches and function combinations within the DSL to achieve the same transformation. Each program effectively extends objects horizontally towards the right, stopping before encountering a different object.
