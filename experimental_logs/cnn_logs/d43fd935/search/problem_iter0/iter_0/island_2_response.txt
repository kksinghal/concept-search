## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (groups of connected digits with the same value) and extending them horizontally to the right, connecting them with another object of the same value if one exists on the same row. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The '1' object at (3,8) extends right to connect with the '1' at (0,0).
* The '6' objects at (1,8), (6,7), (7,6) and (8,5) extend right to connect with the '6' at (9,2).
* All other objects remain unchanged.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The '7' object at (2,3) extends right to connect with the '7' at (0,1). 
* The '8' object at (2,7) extends right to connect with the '8' at (0,6).
* The '7' object at (9,6) extends left to connect with the '7' at (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5), and (9,1).
* All other objects remain unchanged.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* No changes occur in this transformation as no objects can be extended to connect with other objects of the same value on the same row. 


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_horizontal_connect(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # Identify all objects in the grid
  out_grid = I 
  for obj in objs:
    color_val = color(obj)
    row_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda o: uppermost(o) == uppermost(obj) and color(o) == color_val) # Objects in the same row with the same color
    if size(row_objs) > 1:
      rightmost_obj = argmax(row_objs, rightmost)
      leftmost_obj = argmin(row_objs, leftmost)
      if obj == rightmost_obj: # Extend object right only if it's the rightmost one
        connection_line = connect(lrcorner(obj), ulcorner(leftmost_obj)) # Line connecting the objects
        out_grid = fill(out_grid, color_val, connection_line) # Fill the connecting line
  O = out_grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The code starts by identifying all objects within the grid using `objects(I, T, F, F)`.
2. **Iterate & Connect:** It iterates through each object (`obj`) and finds other objects in the same row with the same color (`row_objs`). If more than one such object exists, it identifies the leftmost and rightmost objects in the set.
3. **Extend Rightmost:**  If the current object is the rightmost one, it calculates a connecting line (`connection_line`) using `connect` between the current object's lower-right corner and the leftmost object's upper-left corner. This line is then filled with the object's color using `fill`. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_horizontal_connect(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    row = I[i]
    for j in range(width(I)-1):
      if row[j] != 0 and row[j] == row[j+1]:
        O = fill(O, row[j], frozenset({(i,k) for k in range(j, width(I))}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** The code iterates through each row of the grid.
2. **Check for adjacent same color:** For each row, it checks if adjacent cells have the same color and are not 0.
3. **Fill to the right:** If the condition is met, it fills the current cell and all cells to the right with the same color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_horizontal_connect(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for other_obj in objs:
      if obj != other_obj and color(obj) == color(other_obj) and uppermost(obj) == uppermost(other_obj):
        if rightmost(obj) < leftmost(other_obj):
          connection = connect(lrcorner(obj), ulcorner(other_obj))
          O = fill(O, color(obj), connection)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1, the code identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Compare Every Pair:** It compares every pair of objects (`obj` and `other_obj`).
3. **Check for connection:** For each pair, it checks if they have the same color, are on the same row, and the first object is to the left of the second object. 
4. **Connect:** If the conditions are met, it creates a connecting line using `connect` and fills it with the object's color. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_horizontal_connect(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    for x in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, width(I)):
      if index(I, (uppermost(obj), x)) == color(obj):
        O = fill(O, color(obj), frozenset({(uppermost(obj), y) for y in range(leftmost(obj), x + 1)}))
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** This version starts with an empty canvas (`O`) of the same size as the input grid.
2. **Paint & Extend:**  It iterates through each object (`obj`), paints it onto the canvas, and then checks for objects of the same color to the right in the input grid (`I`). If found, it fills the connecting line on the canvas. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_horizontal_connect(I):
    grid = list(list(row) for row in I)
    for i, row in enumerate(grid):
        for j in range(len(row) - 1):
            if row[j] != 0 and row[j] == row[j + 1]:
                for k in range(j + 1, len(row)):
                    if row[k] == row[j]:
                        grid[i][k] = row[j]
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Nested Loops:** Uses nested loops to iterate over each cell in the grid.
2. **Check for Same Color:** Compares the current cell with the next cell to check if they have the same color and are not 0.
3. **Fill Connected Cells:** If a match is found, it fills all subsequent cells with the same color until a different color or the end of the row is reached.


These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation, utilizing different combinations of DSL functions and logic. Each version should be tested with the provided inputs to confirm their individual effectiveness.
