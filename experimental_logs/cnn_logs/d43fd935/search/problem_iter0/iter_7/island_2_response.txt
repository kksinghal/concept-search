## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to focus on extending specific objects horizontally to the right, stopping either at the grid border or another object with a different color. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The single '1' object at (3,8) extends rightward to the grid border, becoming a horizontal line of '1's.
* The three '6' objects remain unchanged.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* The '7' object at (2,3) extends rightward, absorbing another '7' object and stopping at the '3' object.
* The '8' objects at (0,6) and (2,7) extend rightward to the grid border.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* No changes occur in this transformation. This suggests the transformation logic has conditions that prevent modification in this case.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation. Each version utilizes different DSL function combinations to demonstrate diverse approaches:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Extract univalued objects, excluding background
    filled_grid = I  # Initialize the output grid
    for obj in objs:
        left_j = leftmost(obj)  # Find the leftmost column of the object
        right_border = width(I)  # Get the right border of the grid
        for j in range(left_j + 1, right_border):
            next_loc = (uppermost(obj), j)  # Calculate the next location to the right
            if index(I, next_loc) == mostcolor(I):  # Check if the next location is background
                filled_grid = fill(filled_grid, color(obj), frozenset({next_loc}))  # Fill with object's color
            else:
                break  # Stop extending if another object is encountered
    O = filled_grid  
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Extracts univalued objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
2.  Iterates through each extracted object.
3.  Determines the leftmost column index of the object.
4.  Iterates through columns from the object's right edge to the grid's right border.
5.  Checks if each iterated cell is the background color.
6.  If it is, fills the cell with the object's color; otherwise, stops the extension for that object.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    O = I  # Initialize the output grid
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I) - 1):
            if index(O, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and index(O, (i, j + 1)) == mostcolor(I):  # Check if the current cell is not background and the cell to its right is background
                current_color = index(O, (i, j))  # Store the current cell's color
                k = j + 1
                while k < width(I) and index(O, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I):  # Extend rightward as long as it's background
                    O = fill(O, current_color, frozenset({(i, k)}))  # Fill with the object's color
                    k += 1
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterates over each cell in the grid.
2. If a cell is not background and its right neighbor is background, it enters the extension logic.
3. It extends the current color to the right as long as it encounters background cells. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
            right_frontier = hfrontier((i, j))
            for (fi, fj) in right_frontier:
                if fj >= width(I) or index(I, (fi, fj)) != mostcolor(I):
                    break
                O = fill(O, color(obj), frozenset({(fi, fj)}))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Extracts univalued objects from the grid.
2. Iterates through each object and each cell within the object.
3. For every cell, it gets its horizontal frontier to the right.
4. It iterates through the frontier, filling with the object's color until it hits the grid border or another non-background cell.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if value != mostcolor(I):
                for k in range(j + 1, width(I)):
                    if index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I):
                        O = fill(O, value, frozenset({(i, k)}))
                    else:
                        break
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Iterates through each row and each cell in the grid.
2.  If a cell is not a background color, it extends its color to the right.
3.  The extension continues until it hits a non-background color or the grid border.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    def extend_right(obj):
        return frozenset((color(obj), (i, k)) 
                         for (i, j) in toindices(obj) 
                         for k in range(j, width(I)) 
                         if k == j or index(I, (i, k)) == mostcolor(I))
    
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    extension = mapply(extend_right, objs)
    O = paint(I, extension)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Defines a helper function `extend_right` that takes an object and extends it rightward on the grid.
2. Extracts univalued objects from the input grid.
3. Applies `extend_right` to each object and merges the results, creating an extended object set.
4. Paints the extended objects onto the original grid, overwriting the background.

These five program versions showcase distinct logic and DSL function combinations while achieving the same desired transformation. Each program demonstrates a different approach to solving the problem, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
