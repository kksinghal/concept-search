## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on extending objects horizontally or vertically until they hit another object with a different color. The extension should occur only within the grid boundaries.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The '1' objects extend horizontally to the right until they hit the '3' and '6' objects.
- The '6' objects extend vertically downwards until they hit the bottom grid border.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The '8' objects extend horizontally to the right until they hit the right grid border or the '7' object.
- The '7' objects extend vertically downwards until they hit the bottom grid border or the '3' object.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- The '1' objects extend vertically downwards until they hit the bottom grid border or the '3' object.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    for obj in objs:
        direction = (1, 0) if width(obj) >= height(obj) else (0, 1) # Determine extension direction
        start = ulcorner(obj)
        current = start
        while True:
            next_cell = (current[0] + direction[0], current[1] + direction[1])
            if next_cell not in asindices(I) or index(I, next_cell) != mostcolor(I): # Stop at grid border or different color
                break
            current = next_cell
        I = fill(I, color(obj), connect(start, current))
    return I
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects and Direction:** Identify all objects and determine the extension direction based on their shape (wider objects extend horizontally, taller vertically).
2. **Iterate and Extend:**  Iterate through each cell of the object in the determined direction. Extend the object by filling with its color until it encounters a different color or the grid border.


**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    if width(obj) >= height(obj):
        I = fill(I, color(obj), connect(ulcorner(obj), (ulcorner(obj)[0], rightmost(asobject(I)))))
    else:
        I = fill(I, color(obj), connect(ulcorner(obj), (lowermost(asobject(I)), ulcorner(obj)[1])))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects and Direction:** Identify all objects and determine the extension direction based on their shape (wider objects extend horizontally, taller vertically).
2. **Extend to Grid Limits:**  Extend the object in the determined direction by filling with its color until the corresponding grid border is reached.


**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    for x in range(len(I)):
        for y in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[x][y] != mostcommon(I):
                if width(extract(objects(I,T,F,T), lambda obj: (x,y) in toindices(obj))) >= height(extract(objects(I,T,F,T), lambda obj: (x,y) in toindices(obj))):
                    I = fill(I, I[x][y], connect((x, y), (x, len(I[0])-1)))
                else:
                    I = fill(I, I[x][y], connect((x, y), (len(I)-1, y)))
    return I
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate Through Cells:**  Iterate through each cell of the grid.
2. **Identify Object and Direction:** If the cell is not background, determine the extension direction of the object it belongs to based on its shape (wider objects extend horizontally, taller vertically).
3. **Extend to Grid Limits:**  Extend the object in the determined direction by filling with its color until the corresponding grid border is reached.


**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    ul = ulcorner(obj)
    if width(obj) >= height(obj):
        I = fill(I, color(obj), {(ul[0], j) for j in range(ul[1], len(I[0]))})
    else:
        I = fill(I, color(obj), {(i, ul[1]) for i in range(ul[0], len(I))})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects and Direction:** Identify all objects and determine the extension direction based on their shape (wider objects extend horizontally, taller vertically).
2. **Fill to Grid Limits:**  Fetch the top-left corner of the object and fill the grid with object's color in the determined direction until the corresponding grid edge.


**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    for x, y in toindices(obj):
      if width(obj) >= height(obj):
        I = fill(I, color(obj), connect((x, y), (x, len(I[0])-1)))
      else:
        I = fill(I, color(obj), connect((x, y), (len(I)-1, y)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects and Direction:** Identify all objects and determine the extension direction based on their shape (wider objects extend horizontally, taller vertically).
2. **Iterate and Extend:**  Iterate through each cell of the object and extend the object by filling with its color in the determined direction until the corresponding grid border is reached.

These five versions offer distinct logic and function combinations to achieve the desired transformation, highlighting the flexibility and power of the provided DSL.
