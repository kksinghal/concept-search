## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects horizontally to the right edge of the grid. However, there are specific rules for determining the fill color of the extension:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* Objects with color '1' are extended with the least common non-zero, non-background color, which is '1' in this case.
* Other objects are extended with their own color.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* Objects with color '1' are extended with the least common non-zero, non-background color, which is '7' in this case.
* Other objects are extended with their own color.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* Objects with color '1' are extended with the least common non-zero, non-background color, which is '1' in this case.
* Other objects are extended with their own color.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" along with their explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):  # Iterate over all objects
    obj_color = color(obj)
    if obj_color == 1:
      fill_color = leastcolor(difference(palette(I), {0, mostcommon(I)}))  # Find least common non-zero, non-background color
    else:
      fill_color = obj_color
    extension = frozenset({(fill_color, (i, j)) 
                           for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) 
                           for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(I))})  # Create extension area
    I = paint(I, extension)  # Paint the extension
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over Objects:** Loop through each object in the input grid.
2. **Determine Fill Color:** If the object's color is '1', find the least common color excluding zero and the background color. Otherwise, use the object's own color.
3. **Create Extension:** Define the area to be filled as a set of cells extending from the right edge of the object to the right edge of the grid.
4. **Paint Extension:** Fill the extension area with the determined fill color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg_color = mostcommon(I)
  for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):
    target_color = color(obj)
    if target_color == 1:
      target_color = min(difference(palette(I), {bg_color, 0}))
    I = paint(I, frozenset({(target_color, (i, j)) 
                          for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) 
                          for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(I))}))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background:** Determine the background color.
2. **Iterate and Extend:**  For each object, if its color is '1', find the minimum color value excluding the background and zero. Use this value to extend the object to the right edge. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fill_color = leastcolor([c for c in palette(I) if c not in {0, mostcommon(I)}])  # Find the least common color
  for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 1:
      I = paint(I, recolor(fill_color, frozenset({(i, j) 
                                                for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) 
                                                for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(I))})))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Pre-calculate Fill Color:** Determine the least common color in the grid, excluding zero and the background.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** For each object with color '1', create an extension area and fill it with the pre-calculated least common color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):
    c = color(obj)
    fill_color = c if c != 1 else min(palette(I) - {0, mostcommon(I)})
    extension = {(fill_color, (i, j)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(I))}
    I = paint(I, frozenset(extension))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Determine Fill:** For each object, determine the fill color - either the object's color or the minimum color value excluding zero and background if the object's color is '1'. 
2. **Extend and Paint:** Create the extension area and paint it with the determined fill color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 1:
        fill_color = leastcolor([c for c in palette(I) if c not in {0, mostcommon(I)}])
        I = paint(I, {(fill_color, (i, k)) for k in range(j + 1, width(I))})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Cells:** Go through each cell in the grid.
2. **Fill Condition:** If a cell's value is '1', determine the least common color (excluding zero and background) and extend it horizontally to the right edge.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation, utilizing different combinations of DSL functions and logic.
