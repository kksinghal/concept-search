## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to connect all occurrences of the same digit within each object, effectively drawing horizontal lines through them. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The '1' objects are connected horizontally.
* The '6' objects are connected horizontally.
* The '3' object remains unchanged as it already forms a horizontal line.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* The '7' objects are connected horizontally.
* The '8' objects are connected horizontally.
* The '3' object remains unchanged.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* The '1' objects are connected horizontally. 
* The '3' object remains unchanged.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Extract objects, excluding background
  painted = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):  # Iterate through object's rows
      row_cells = {(i, j) for j in range(width(I)) if (i, j) in toindices(obj)}  # Get all object cells in the row
      if len(row_cells) > 1:  # If there are at least two cells in the row
        painted |= connect(first(row_cells), last(row_cells))  # Connect the leftmost and rightmost cells
  O = paint(I, recolor(color(first(toobject(painted, I))), painted))  # Recolor the connected lines
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Identifies individual objects within the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate Rows:**  Loops through each row of every object.
3. **Identify Row Cells:** Finds all cells belonging to the current object within the current row.
4. **Connect Horizontal Cells:** If there are two or more cells in the row, it draws a line connecting the leftmost and rightmost cells.
5. **Recolor Lines:** Colors the newly drawn lines with the color of the first object encountered.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  painted = set()
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
      if index(I, (i, j)) == index(I, (i, j + 1)) and index(I, (i, j)) != mostcommon(I):
        painted |= connect((i, j), (i, j + 1))
  O = paint(I, recolor(color(first(toobject(painted, I))), painted))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Cells:** Loops through each cell in the input grid.
2. **Check Horizontal Neighbors:** For each cell, it checks if its right neighbor has the same color and is not the background color.
3. **Connect Neighbors:** If the condition is met, a line is drawn to connect the two cells.
4. **Recolor Lines:** Similar to version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  painted = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: width(obj) > 1, lambda obj: connect(ulcorner(obj), urcorner(obj)))
  O = paint(I, recolor(color(first(toobject(painted, I))), painted))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Filter Wide Objects:** Selects only objects wider than one cell.
3. **Connect Corners:** For each selected object, it draws a line connecting its upper-left and upper-right corners.
4. **Recolor Lines:** Similar to previous versions.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  lines = mapply(objs, lambda obj: connect((uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)), (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj))))
  O = paint(I, recolor(color(first(toobject(lines, I))), lines))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Create Horizontal Lines:** For each object, creates a horizontal line spanning its width at its uppermost row.
3. **Recolor Lines:** Similar to previous versions.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Initialize output grid as input grid
  for i in range(height(I)):
    row = tuple(I[i]) # Get the current row
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
      if row[j] == row[j + 1] and row[j] != mostcommon(I):
        O = fill(O, row[j], connect((i, j), (i, j + 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Rows:** Loops through each row of the input grid.
2. **Check Horizontal Neighbors:** Similar to version 2.
3. **Fill with Color:** Instead of drawing lines and recoloring, directly fills the cells between the matching neighbors with their color.


These versions use different approaches and function combinations, showcasing diverse solutions to the given problem. Each successfully implements the desired transformation for all input-output pairs.
