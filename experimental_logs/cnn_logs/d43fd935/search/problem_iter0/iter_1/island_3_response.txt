## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects horizontally to connect with other objects of the same color. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The '1' object at (3,8) extends leftward to connect with the '1' object at (0,0).
* The '6' objects at (7,7), (8,6), and (9,2) extend leftward to connect with the '6' object at (6,1).

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* The '7' objects at (3,3), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), and (9,5) extend leftward to connect with the '7' object at (0,1).
* The '8' objects at (3,6) and (3,7) extend leftward to connect with the '8' object at (0,6).

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* The '1' objects at (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), and (6,9) extend leftward to connect with the '1' object at (1,1).


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Identify all objects
    x2 = apply(lambda obj: (rightmost(obj), color(first(obj))), x1)  # Get rightmost point and color for each object
    x3 = apply(lambda x: frozenset((x[1], (i, x[0])) for i in range(len(I))), x2) # Create vertical lines from rightmost point with object color
    x4 = mapply(identity, x3) # Merge lines
    O = paint(I, x4) # Paint lines onto input grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Get rightmost point and color:**  For each object, `(rightmost(obj), color(first(obj)))` retrieves the column index of the rightmost point and the object's color.
3. **Create vertical lines:** For each object, `frozenset((x[1], (i, x[0])) for i in range(len(I)))` generates a vertical line starting from the rightmost point (`x[0]`) and extending across the entire height of the grid (`len(I)`) using the object's color (`x[1]`).
4. **Merge lines:** `mapply(identity, x3)` merges all the generated vertical lines.
5. **Paint lines:** `paint(I, x4)` paints the merged lines onto the input grid `I`, effectively extending the objects horizontally to connect with other objects of the same color.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    x1 = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Identify all objects
    x2 = apply(lambda obj: (ulcorner(obj)[0], rightmost(obj), color(first(obj))), x1)  # Get top row, rightmost column, and color
    x3 = apply(lambda x: connect((x[0], x[1]), (x[0], 0), x[2]), x2)  # Connect rightmost point to left edge on the same row
    x4 = mapply(lambda x: recolor(x[2], x), x3) # Recolor the lines with the object color
    x5 = merge(x4) # Merge all lines
    O = paint(I, x5)  # Paint lines onto input grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all objects.
2. **Get object information:**  ` (ulcorner(obj)[0], rightmost(obj), color(first(obj)))` extracts the top row index, the rightmost column index, and the color of each object.
3. **Connect to the left edge:** `connect((x[0], x[1]), (x[0], 0), x[2])` draws a horizontal line from the rightmost point (`(x[0], x[1])`) to the left edge of the grid (`(x[0], 0)`) on the same row (`x[0]`).
4. **Recolor lines:**  `recolor(x[2], x)` recolors each line segment with the corresponding object color (`x[2]`).
5. **Merge and paint:** The lines are merged using `merge(x4)` and painted onto the input grid using `paint(I, x5)`.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T)
  x2 = apply(lambda obj: (ulcorner(obj), color(first(obj))), x1) # Get top-left corner and color of each object
  x3 = apply(lambda x: frozenset((x[1], (x[0][0], j)) for j in range(len(I[0]))), x2) # Create horizontal lines at the top row of each object
  x4 = mapply(identity, x3) # Merge the lines
  O = paint(I, x4)  # Paint the lines onto the input grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, T, T)` extracts all unique objects from the input grid.
2. **Get Corner and Color:** `(ulcorner(obj), color(first(obj)))` gets the top-left corner coordinates and the color of each object. 
3. **Generate Horizontal Lines:**  `frozenset((x[1], (x[0][0], j)) for j in range(len(I[0])))` creates a horizontal line across the entire width of the grid (`len(I[0])`) at the same row as the top-left corner of the object (`x[0][0]`) and colors it with the object's color (`x[1]`).
4. **Merge Lines:** `mapply(identity, x3)` merges all generated lines.
5. **Paint on Grid:** `paint(I, x4)` overlays the merged lines onto the original input grid. 

## Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T) # Identify all objects
  x2 = apply(lambda obj: (leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj), color(first(obj))), x1) # Get leftmost, rightmost columns and color of each object
  x3 = apply(lambda x: frozenset((x[2], (i, j)) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(x[0], x[1] + 1)), x2)  # Fill from leftmost to rightmost column
  x4 = mapply(identity, x3) # Merge the filled areas
  O = paint(I, x4) # Paint the merged areas on the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, T, T)` extracts all unique objects from the input grid.
2. **Get Object Boundaries and Color:** `(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj), color(first(obj)))` obtains the leftmost and rightmost column indices, and the color of each object.
3. **Fill Objects Horizontally:** `frozenset((x[2], (i, j)) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(x[0], x[1] + 1))` generates a filled rectangle for each object, spanning from its leftmost column (`x[0]`) to its rightmost column (`x[1]`) across the entire height of the grid (`len(I)`) and using the object's color (`x[2]`).
4. **Merge and Paint:**  The filled rectangles are merged using `mapply(identity, x3)` and then painted onto the input grid using `paint(I, x4)`.

## Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T) # Get all objects
  x2 = apply(lambda obj: ((uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)), (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj)), color(first(obj))), x1) # Get top-left, top-right corners and color for each object
  x3 = apply(lambda x: connect(x[0], x[1], x[2]), x2) # Draw a horizontal line connecting the top-left and top-right corners
  x4 = mapply(lambda x: recolor(x[2], x), x3)  # Recolor the lines with the corresponding object color
  x5 = merge(x4) # Merge all the lines
  O = paint(I, x5) # Paint the merged lines onto the input grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all objects within the input grid.
2. **Get Corner Coordinates and Color:** `((uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)), (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj)), color(first(obj)))` determines the coordinates of the top-left and top-right corners of each object, along with its respective color.
3. **Connect Corners with Lines:**  `connect(x[0], x[1], x[2])` generates a horizontal line connecting the top-left corner (`x[0]`) to the top-right corner (`x[1]`) of each object.
4. **Recolor Lines:**  `recolor(x[2], x)` applies the object's color (`x[2]`) to the corresponding line segment.
5. **Merge and Paint Lines:**  All generated lines are combined using `merge(x4)` and then painted onto the original input grid with `paint(I, x5)`.

These five versions demonstrate various approaches to achieve the desired transformation, each with unique logic and DSL function combinations. You can test these programs and adapt them further based on specific requirements or constraints.
