## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on extending objects horizontally to the right, connecting them to isolated digits of the same value. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The '1' at (3,8) extends rightward, absorbing the '1' at (9,4) and forming a horizontal line. 
* The '6' objects at (1,8), (6,7), (7,6), and (8,5) merge into a single horizontal line extending rightward from the original (1,8) position.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The '7' at (2,3) extends rightward, absorbing the '7's at (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), and (9,5) to form a horizontal line.
* The '8' at (2,6) extends rightward to connect with the '8' at (2,9).

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

*  The '1' digits at (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), and (5,9) all extend rightward to the edge of the grid.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

**Code:**

```python
def solve_XXXXXXXXX(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    new_objs = set()
    for obj in objs:
        color = first(obj)[0]
        leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
        for j in range(leftmost_j + 1, width(I)):
            if index(I, (uppermost(obj), j)) == color:
                obj = obj | recolor(color, connect((leftmost(obj), uppermost(obj)), (j, uppermost(obj))))
                break
        new_objs.add(obj)
    O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(new_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Background:** Finds all objects and the background color.
2. **Iterate and Extend:**  For each object:
    * Get the object's color and leftmost column.
    * Check for matching digits to the right on the same row.
    * If found, connect them by recoloring a line.
3. **Reconstruct Grid:** Paints the extended objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input.

**Program Version 2:**

**Code:**

```python
def solve_XXXXXXXXX(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    for obj in objs:
        for x in range(1, width(I)):
            shifted_obj = shift(obj, (0,x))
            intersection = toindices(shifted_obj) & toindices(obj)
            if intersection:
                obj = obj | recolor(color(obj), connect(ulcorner(obj),urcorner(shifted_obj)))
                break
    O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Background:**  Similar to Version 1.
2. **Shift and Check:** For each object:
    * Shift the object rightward iteratively.
    * Check for overlap between the original and shifted object.
    * If overlap exists, connect them with a line of the object's color.
3. **Reconstruct Grid:**  Similar to Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

**Code:**

```python
def solve_XXXXXXXXX(I):
    O = I
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    for obj in objs:
        c = color(obj)
        row = uppermost(obj)
        for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, width(I)):
            if index(I, (row,j)) == c:
                O = fill(O, c, connect((leftmost(obj),row), (j,row)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Directly Modify Grid:**  Starts with the input grid and modifies it directly.
2. **Iterate and Fill:**  For each object:
    * Find its color and the row it occupies.
    * Check for matching digits to the right on the same row.
    * If found, fill the space between them with the object's color.

**Program Version 4:**

**Code:**

```python
def solve_XXXXXXXXX(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    new_grid = canvas(bg, shape(I))
    for obj in objs:
        c = color(obj)
        start_j = leftmost(obj)
        end_j = start_j
        for j in range(start_j + 1, width(I)):
            if index(I, (uppermost(obj), j)) == c:
                end_j = j
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, c, connect((uppermost(obj), start_j), (uppermost(obj), end_j)))
    return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Blank Canvas:** Initializes a blank grid with the background color.
2. **Find Extension Points:**  For each object:
    * Determine the leftmost and rightmost points of the extended object.
3. **Fill Directly:** Fill the line between the determined points directly on the new grid.

**Program Version 5:**

**Code:**

```python
def solve_XXXXXXXXX(I):
    for row in range(height(I)):
        for col in range(width(I) - 1):
            if index(I, (row, col)) != mostcolor(I) and index(I, (row, col + 1)) == index(I, (row, col)):
                I = fill(I, index(I, (row, col)), connect((row, col), (row, width(I) - 1)))
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Iteration and Filling:**  Iterates directly through the grid, cell by cell.
2. **Check and Fill:**  For each cell:
    * Checks if the current and next cell in the row have the same non-background color.
    * If true, fills the entire row from the current cell to the right edge with that color. 

**Note:**  The 'XXXXXXXXX' in the code should be replaced with unique identifiers for each version.
