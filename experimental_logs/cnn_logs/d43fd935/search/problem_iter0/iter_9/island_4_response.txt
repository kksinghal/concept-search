## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects horizontally or vertically towards the nearest same-colored object while staying within the grid boundaries.

**Input 0:**

- The single '1' object at (0,0) doesn't change as there's no other '1' object to connect to.
- The '6' objects extend horizontally or vertically towards other '6' objects.
- The '3' object extends horizontally towards the '1' object.

**Input 1:**

- The '7' objects extend horizontally or vertically towards other '7' objects.
- The '8' objects extend horizontally or vertically towards other '8' objects.
- The '3' object doesn't change as it's already connected to another '3'.

**Input 2:**

- The '1' objects extend vertically towards other '1' objects.
- The '3' object doesn't change as it's already connected to another '3'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj1 in objs:
    closest_distance = float("inf")
    closest_obj = None
    for obj2 in objs:
      if color(obj1) == color(obj2) and obj1 != obj2:
        dist = manhattan(obj1, obj2)
        if dist < closest_distance:
          closest_distance = dist
          closest_obj = obj2
    if closest_obj:
      if hmatching(obj1, closest_obj):
        start = ulcorner(obj1) if leftmost(obj1) < leftmost(closest_obj) else urcorner(obj1)
        end = (start[0], other(corners(closest_obj), start)[1])
      else:
        start = ulcorner(obj1) if uppermost(obj1) < uppermost(closest_obj) else llcorner(obj1)
        end = (other(corners(closest_obj), start)[0], start[1])
      I = fill(I, color(obj1), connect(start, end))
  return I
```

**Explanation:** This program iterates through each object and finds the closest object of the same color. It then connects them horizontally or vertically depending on their relative positions.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  for x in range(len(I)):
    for y in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[x][y] != mostcommon(I):
        obj = None
        for o in objects(I, T, F, T):
          if (x, y) in toindices(o):
            obj = o
            break
        if obj is not None:
          if width(obj) >= height(obj):
            I = fill(I, I[x][y], connect((x, y), (x, len(I[0])-1)))
          else:
            I = fill(I, I[x][y], connect((x, y), (len(I)-1, y)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**  This version iterates through each cell and extends the object containing that cell horizontally or vertically based on its dimensions, stopping at the grid boundary.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    if width(obj) >= height(obj):
      line = connect(ulcorner(obj), (ulcorner(obj)[0], len(I[0])-1))
      I = fill(I, color(obj), intersection(toindices(line), asindices(I)))
    else:
      line = connect(ulcorner(obj), (len(I)-1, ulcorner(obj)[1]))
      I = fill(I, color(obj), intersection(toindices(line), asindices(I)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**  This version is simpler. It extends each object horizontally or vertically based on its dimension towards the respective edge of the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  for x in range(len(I)):
    for y in range(len(I[0])):
      val = I[x][y]
      if val != mostcommon(I):
        for i in range(y + 1, len(I[0])):
          if I[x][i] == val:
            I = fill(I, val, connect((x, y), (x, i)))
            break
        for i in range(x + 1, len(I)):
          if I[i][y] == val:
            I = fill(I, val, connect((x, y), (i, y)))
            break
  return I
```

**Explanation:** This program iterates through each cell and, if it's not the background color, extends it horizontally and vertically until it finds another cell of the same color or hits the grid boundary.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    for dir in [RIGHT, DOWN]:
      for i in range(1, max(len(I), len(I[0]))):
        shifted_obj = shift(obj, multiply(dir, i))
        if len(intersection(toindices(shifted_obj), asindices(I))) == 0:
          break
        if len(intersection(shifted_obj, asobject(I))) > 0:
          I = fill(I, color(obj), connect(centerofmass(obj), centerofmass(shifted_obj)))
          break
  return I
```

**Explanation:** This program iterates through objects and directions, shifting each object until it finds an overlapping same-colored object or hits the grid boundary. It then connects the centers of the original and shifted objects. 

**Note:**  These programs provide diverse solutions for the given transformation. You can test them with the provided inputs to verify their outputs.
