## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** All occurrences of the digit '1' are extended horizontally to the right, connecting to any existing '1' or stopping at the edge of the grid or a different digit. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  All occurrences of the digit '7' are extended both horizontally to the right and vertically downwards, connecting to any existing '7' or stopping at the edge of the grid or a different digit.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**  No change is observed, the input and output grids are identical.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for v in palette(I)-{mostcommon(I)}: # for each digit except background
    for (i, j) in ofcolor(I, v): # for each cell with the digit
      for k in range(j+1, width(I)): # extend right
        if index(I, (i, k)) != 0:
          break
        O = fill(O, v, {(i, k)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over digits:** Loops through each unique digit in the input grid, excluding the background color (most common).
2. **Iterate over cell locations:** For each unique digit, loop through each cell containing that digit.
3. **Extend horizontally:** From each cell location, extend a line of the same digit to the right until it hits a non-zero value or the edge of the grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True): # Get each object
    v = color(obj) # get the digit/color of the object
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      for k in range(j+1, width(I)): # Extend right
        if index(I, (i, k)) != 0:
          break
        O = fill(O, v, {(i, k)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get objects:** Extract each object (connected component of the same digit) from the input grid.
2. **Iterate over object cells:** For each object, loop through each cell belonging to that object.
3. **Extend horizontally:** Same as Version 1, extend right until a non-zero value or grid edge is encountered. 

**Version 3:** 

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create an empty canvas
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    v = color(obj)
    shifted_obj = obj
    for k in range(width(I)):
      shifted_obj = shift(shifted_obj, (0, 1)) # Shift right
      O = paint(O, shifted_obj) # paint onto the canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create empty canvas:** Initialize an output grid filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate over objects:**  Extract objects and loop through them.
3. **Shift and paint:** For each object, repeatedly shift it one cell to the right and paint it onto the canvas. This creates the horizontal extension.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for v in palette(I)-{mostcommon(I)}:
    indices = toindices(objects(I, True, False, True))
    for (i, j) in indices:
      if index(I, (i, j)) == v:
        for k in range(j+1, width(I)):
          if index(I, (i, k)) != 0:
            break
          O = fill(O, v, {(i, k)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

This version is similar to version 2 but iterates through all the indices of the objects and then checks if the value at the index is the current value. If it is, then it extends the value to the right.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    v = color(obj)
    rightmost_j = rightmost(obj) # Find the rightmost column of the object
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      if j == rightmost_j: # Only extend from the rightmost cells
        for k in range(j+1, width(I)):
          if index(I, (i, k)) != 0:
            break
          O = fill(O, v, {(i, k)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get objects:** Extract each object from the input grid.
2. **Find rightmost column:** For each object, determine its rightmost column index.
3. **Extend from rightmost cells:** Loop through the object's cells, extending horizontally only from cells in the rightmost column. This optimizes the extension process.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL functions. They highlight various aspects of problem-solving, such as iteration, object manipulation, and efficient use of grid properties.
