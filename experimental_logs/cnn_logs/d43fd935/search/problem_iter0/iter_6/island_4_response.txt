## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects horizontally to the right, until they encounter another object or the grid boundary.  Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input 0:**

* The '1' object at (0,0) remains unchanged as it touches the grid boundary.
* The '1' object at (9,4) is extended rightwards until it reaches the grid boundary at (9,9). 
* The '3' objects at (3,2), (3,3), (4,2) and (4,3) are extended rightwards, merging into a single object and stopping at the '1' object.
* The '6' objects at (1,8), (2,7), (7,6), (8,5) and (9,2) are extended rightwards until they hit either the grid boundary or another '6' object.

**Input 1:**

*  The logic from Input 0 applies similarly here.  Each object ('3', '7', '8') is extended rightwards until it encounters another object or the grid boundary.

**Input 2:**

* Again, the same logic is applied.  Notice the '1' objects create a "staircase" pattern as they are extended rightwards and are stopped by the presence of other '1' objects or the grid boundary. 


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each with an explanation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Extract objects, not considering diagonals
    for obj in objs:
        right_edge = rightmost(obj) 
        for j in range(right_edge + 1, width(I)):  # Iterate from right edge to grid width
            next_cell = (uppermost(obj), j) 
            if index(I, next_cell) == 0:  # If the next cell is empty
                I = fill(I, color(obj), {next_cell})  # Fill with object color
            else:
                break  # Stop extending if another object is encountered
    return I 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  This version iterates through each object in the grid.
2.  For each object, it determines the rightmost column index.
3.  It then iterates through the columns to the right of the object, filling empty cells with the object's color.
4.  The extension stops when it encounters a non-empty cell (another object or grid boundary).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1):
      if O[i][j] != 0 and O[i][j + 1] == 0:
        O = fill(O, O[i][j], {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version iterates through the grid cell by cell.
2. If a cell is non-empty and its right neighbor is empty, the right neighbor is filled with the current cell's color.
3. This process effectively extends objects horizontally to the right until they hit a non-empty cell.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    for obj in objs:
        for j in range(rightmost(obj) + 1, width(I)):
            extension = {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)}
            if not any(index(I, cell) != 0 for cell in extension):
                I = fill(I, color(obj), extension)
            else:
                break
    return I 
```

**Explanation:**

1. Like Version 1, it iterates through objects.
2. It calculates potential horizontal extensions for each object.
3. It checks if the extension area is entirely empty before filling.
4. This version aims for a more "bulk" extension, potentially being more efficient than Version 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) 
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        current_color = 0
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if value != 0:
                current_color = value
            O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version initializes an empty canvas the same size as the input.
2. It iterates through each row of the input, keeping track of the "current color" encountered.
3.  It fills the output canvas with the current color until a new non-zero color is found.
4.  This approach effectively "paints" the objects onto the output canvas with the desired extension.

**Program Version 5:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    min_row = uppermost(obj)
    max_row = lowermost(obj)
    start_col = leftmost(obj)
    for j in range(start_col, len(I[0])):
      if any(O[row][j] != 0 for row in range(min_row, max_row + 1)):
        break
      for row in range(min_row, max_row + 1):
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {(row, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. It first extracts objects from the input grid.
2. For each object, it determines its top and bottom row boundaries and its starting column.
3. It iterates from the starting column to the right, checking for each column if the corresponding rows within the object's boundaries are all empty.
4. If a column is encountered where any of the rows within the object's boundaries are not empty, the iteration breaks.
5. Otherwise, the current column's cells within the object's boundaries are filled with the object's color.

These five program versions demonstrate distinct approaches to solving the transformation task using the provided DSL. Each version offers a unique combination of functions and logic, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
