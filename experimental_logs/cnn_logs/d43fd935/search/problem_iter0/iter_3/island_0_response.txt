## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to follow these rules:

* **Identify non-background objects:** The transformation focuses on objects made up of digits that are not the background color (most common color).
* **Extend objects horizontally towards the right:** Objects are extended by filling the background cells to their immediate right with the object's color. The extension continues until it encounters another non-background object or reaches the grid border. 

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:**
* The '1' objects and '6' objects are extended to the right. 
* The '3' object is also extended, absorbing the '1' to its right.

**Pair 1:**
* Similar to Pair 0, the '7' and '8' objects are extended rightwards.
* The '3' object, being enclosed, doesn't extend.

**Pair 2:**
* All '1' objects and '3' objects extend rightwards.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct programs using the provided DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    O = I
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w - 1):
            current_color = I[i][j]
            next_color = I[i][j + 1]
            if current_color != bg and next_color == bg:
                O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j + 1)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify background color:** `bg = mostcolor(I)`
2. **Iterate through grid cells:**  The program iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`.
3. **Check for extension condition:** If a cell is not the background color and the cell to its right is the background color, it triggers the extension.
4. **Extend object:** The `fill` function then fills the cell to the right with the current cell's color, effectively extending the object.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        for _, (i, j) in obj:
            if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I):
                O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, j + 1)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify non-background objects:** `objs = objects(I, False, False, True)` extracts non-background objects from the input.
2. **Iterate through object cells:** For each cell within each object:
3. **Check for rightward background:** It checks if the cell to the right is background.
4. **Extend if background:** If it's background, it fills that cell with the object's color using `fill`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), asobject(I))
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1):
            if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and O[i][j + 1] == mostcolor(I):
                O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, j + 1)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Create a background canvas:**  A canvas of the background color and same size as input is created.
2. **Paint input onto canvas:**  The input grid's objects are painted onto this canvas, leaving background intact.
3. **Iterate and extend:** Similar to previous versions, it iterates and extends objects rightwards if a background cell is found.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row[:-1]):
      if val != mostcommon(I) and row[j + 1] == mostcommon(I):
        O = fill(O, val, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate using enumerate:** It iterates through rows and cell values using `enumerate`.
2. **Check for extension:** Similar to previous versions, it checks for non-background values followed by a background value.
3. **Fill for extension:** If found, it fills the background cell with the object's color using `fill`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    O = [[I[i][j] for j in range(w)] for i in range(h)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w - 1):
            if O[i][j] != bg and O[i][j + 1] == bg:
                O[i][j + 1] = O[i][j]
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Create a mutable copy of the grid:** This version creates a nested list `O` as a mutable copy of the input grid.
2. **Iterate through cells:** It iterates through each cell in the grid.
3. **Extend objects directly:** If an object cell is found next to a background cell to its right, it directly assigns the object's color to the background cell in the mutable grid `O`.
4. **Return an immutable grid:** Finally, it converts the modified nested list `O` back to an immutable tuple of tuples and returns it.

These five versions represent distinct approaches to solve the given transformation task using the DSL, offering different coding styles and logic while achieving the same result.
