## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected components of the same digit) in the input grid and extending them horizontally to the right until they encounter another object or the edge of the grid. 

**Example:**

Let's analyze Input_0 and Output_0:

* The '1' at (0,0) is alone and doesn't extend.
* The '6' objects at (1,8), (6,7), (7,6), and (8,2) remain unchanged as they are already touching the right edge or another object. 
* The '3' object at (3,2) extends to the right, filling in with '1's until it reaches the existing '1' at (3,8). 

Similar logic applies to Input_1, Output_1 and Input_2, Output_2.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # Get all objects in the grid
  for obj in objs:
    rightmost_col = rightmost(obj) # Find the rightmost column of the object
    for j in range(rightmost_col + 1, width(I)): # Iterate from rightmost col + 1 to grid width
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1): # Iterate through rows of object's height
        if (i,j) in toindices(objs): # Check if cell is part of any object
          break # Stop extending if another object is encountered
        I = fill(I, color(obj), {(i, j)}) # Fill with object's color otherwise
  O = I 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` finds all connected components (objects) in the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate Objects:** The program loops through each object (`obj`) found in the grid.
3. **Find Rightmost Column:** `rightmost(obj)` determines the rightmost occupied column index of the current object.
4. **Horizontal Extension:** It iterates horizontally from the `rightmost_col + 1` to the grid's width.
5. **Check for Collision:** Inside the loop, it checks if the current cell belongs to any other object using `toindices(objs)`. If a collision is detected, it stops extending the current object in that row.
6. **Fill Grid:** If no collision, the cell is filled with the color of the current object using `fill(I, color(obj), {(i, j)})`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)): # Iterate through each row
    current_color = None
    for j in range(width(I)): # Iterate through each column
      if index(O, (i,j)) != 0: # If a non-zero digit is encountered
        current_color = index(O, (i,j)) # Update the current color
      elif current_color is not None: # If current_color is set (meaning an object is being extended)
        O = fill(O, current_color, {(i, j)}) # Fill with the current_color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Rows:** Loop through each row of the grid.
2. **Track Current Color:** Maintain a `current_color` variable to keep track of the color being extended.
3. **Find Object Start:** When a non-zero digit is encountered, update `current_color`.
4. **Extend Object:** If `current_color` is set and the current cell is zero, fill it with `current_color`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Create an empty canvas with the same shape as the input
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, F): # Get all objects in the grid
        start_j = leftmost(obj) # Find the leftmost column of the object
        for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1): # Iterate through each row in the object
            for j in range(start_j, width(I)): # Iterate through columns from the start to the right edge
                if j == start_j or index(I, (i, j)) == color(obj): # Fill the cell if it's the starting cell or has the same color as the object
                    O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j)})
                else:
                    break # Stop extending if a different color or empty cell is encountered
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** An empty grid (`O`) of the same size as the input is created.
2. **Iterate Objects:** The code iterates through all objects in the input grid.
3. **Find Object Start:** For each object, the leftmost column (`start_j`) is determined.
4. **Horizontal Extension:** The code iterates through each row of the object and then through columns starting from `start_j` to the right edge of the grid.
5. **Conditional Filling:** The current cell is filled with the object's color only if it's the starting cell (`j == start_j`) or if it already contains the same color as the object (`index(I, (i, j)) == color(obj)`).
6. **Stop Extension:** If a different color or an empty cell is encountered during the horizontal iteration, the extension for that row is stopped.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(1, width(I)): # Start from the second column
            if index(O, (i,j)) == 0 and index(O, (i, j-1)) != 0: # If the current cell is empty and the cell to its left is not
                O = fill(O, index(O, (i, j-1)), {(i, j)}) # Fill the current cell with the color of the cell to its left
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Grid:** This version directly iterates through the grid.
2. **Check Left Cell:** For each cell, it checks if the cell to its left is non-zero. 
3. **Extend Color:** If the current cell is zero and the left cell is non-zero, it fills the current cell with the left cell's color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    min_i, max_i = uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj)
    min_j, max_j = leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj)
    for i in range(min_i, max_i + 1):
      for j in range(min_j + 1, width(I)):
        if index(O, (i, j - 1)) != 0 and index(O, (i, j)) == 0:
          O = fill(O, index(O, (i, j - 1)), {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Boundaries:** This version identifies objects and their boundaries.
2. **Iterate Within Boundaries:** It then iterates through each cell within the object's bounding box, but starting from the column next to the leftmost column.
3. **Extend to the Right:** For each cell, it checks if the cell to the left is non-zero and the current cell is zero. If so, it fills the current cell with the color of the cell to its left. 

These are five distinct program versions that achieve the desired transformation. Each version utilizes a different approach or combination of DSL functions, ensuring diversity in the solutions.
