## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on keeping only the leftmost cell of each distinct object (identified by color) on each row. 

**Input 0:**

- **1s:** Two objects are merged into one, keeping only the leftmost 1 on each row.
- **3s:** Similar to 1s, only the leftmost 3 on each row remains.
- **6s:** All but the leftmost 6 on each row are removed.

**Input 1:**

- **7s:**  Objects are separated, keeping only the leftmost 7 on each row.
- **8s:** Similar to 7s, only the leftmost 8 on each row remains.
- **3s:** The object remains mostly unchanged, as it only had one 3 per row. 

**Input 2:**

- **1s:** Objects are separated, retaining the leftmost 1 on each row.
- **3s:** The object remains unchanged, as it had one 3 per row.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Initialize output grid
  for obj in fgpartition(I):  # Iterate over each object (excluding background)
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):  # Iterate over rows of the object
      leftmost_j = min(j for _, (row, j) in obj if row == i)  # Find the leftmost column index for the current row
      O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, leftmost_j))})  # Paint the leftmost cell to the output grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas of the same size and background color as the input.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates over each distinct object in the input, excluding the background.
3. **Row Iteration:**  For each object, iterates over the rows it occupies.
4. **Leftmost Cell:**  Finds the column index (`j`) of the leftmost cell within the current object and row.
5. **Painting:** Paints the identified leftmost cell onto the output grid with the object's color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
            merge({frozenset({(color(obj), (i, min(j for _, (row, j) in obj if row == i)))}) 
                   for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)} 
                  for obj in fgpartition(I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version achieves the same outcome as version 1 but uses more concise nested set comprehensions for efficient processing.

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas with the same background as the input.
2. **Object & Row Processing:** Nested set comprehensions are used. The outer one iterates over each object, and the inner one iterates over rows within the object. 
3. **Leftmost Cell:** `min(j for _, (row, j) in obj if row == i)` identifies the leftmost cell within each row of the object.
4. **Object Construction:** A new object is created containing only the leftmost cell for each row of the original object.
5. **Merging and Painting:**  All the newly created objects (containing only the leftmost cells) are merged and painted onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Start with the input grid
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + 1):  # Iterate from the second cell to the rightmost
        if (color(obj), (i, j)) in obj:
          O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(i, j)})  # Fill with background color if cell belongs to the object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version takes a different approach by iterating over potential cell positions and filling them with the background color if they belong to the object.

1. **Initialization:** Directly uses the input grid as the starting point.
2. **Object & Row Iteration:** Iterates over each object and then over its rows.
3. **Column Iteration:** For each row, iterates over columns starting from the second cell to the rightmost cell of the object.
4. **Conditional Filling:** If the current cell belongs to the object, it's filled with the background color, effectively removing it.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Initialize output grid
  for obj in fgpartition(I):  # Iterate over objects
    leftmost_cells = {(color(obj), (row, min(j for _, (r, j) in obj if r == row))) 
                       for row in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)}
    O = paint(O, leftmost_cells)  # Paint the extracted cells onto the output grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version first extracts the leftmost cells for each object and then paints them onto a blank canvas.

1. **Initialization:**  Creates an empty canvas with the same background as the input.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates over each object.
3. **Leftmost Cell Extraction:**  Finds the leftmost cells for each row of the object using a set comprehension.
4. **Painting:** Paints the extracted leftmost cells onto the output canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
               merge(apply(lambda obj: 
                           {(color(obj), (i, min(j for _, (r, j) in obj if r == i))) 
                            for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)}, 
                         fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages functional programming paradigms using `apply` and `merge` for efficient processing.

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas with the same background as the input.
2. **Functional Processing:**  `apply` function applies a lambda function to each object returned by `fgpartition(I)`.
3. **Lambda Function:** The lambda function extracts the leftmost cells for each row of the input object.
4. **Merging and Painting:** `merge` function combines all the extracted leftmost cells from all objects and `paint` function paints them onto the canvas.


Each version utilizes different combinations of DSL functions and logic, demonstrating diversity in achieving the desired transformation.
