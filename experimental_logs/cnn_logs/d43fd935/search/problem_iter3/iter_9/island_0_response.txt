## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in this puzzle involves taking each unique object (connected components of the same digit) in the input grid and creating a vertical line from its rightmost point to the top of the grid, using the object's color.

**Input 0:**

- **1s:** Two objects, both become vertical lines extending to the top of the grid.
- **3s:** Two objects, both become vertical lines.
- **6s:** Three objects, each forming a vertical line.

**Input 1:**

- The same principle applies to all objects (7s, 8s, 3s) in this input.

**Input 2:**

- Same as above, with vertical lines formed for digits 1 and 3.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify connected components
  rightmost_points = mapply(lambda obj: (color(obj), lrcorner(obj)), objs)  # Get rightmost point of each object
  vertical_lines = mapply(lambda point: frozenset({(point[0], (i, point[1][1])) for i in range(height(I))}), rightmost_points)  # Draw vertical lines
  O = paint(cover(I, asindices(I)), merge(vertical_lines))  # Paint lines on blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` finds all connected components (objects).
2. **Rightmost Points:** `mapply` applies a lambda function to each object to get its rightmost point (`lrcorner`).
3. **Vertical Lines:** Another `mapply` creates vertical lines from the rightmost point to the top of the grid for each object.
4. **Paint on Canvas:** `paint` draws the lines on a blank canvas created by `cover`.


**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  lines = set()
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):  # Ignore background
        lines.add(frozenset({(I[i][j], (k, j)) for k in range(height(I))}))  # Draw line from current point
  O = paint(cover(I, asindices(I)), merge(lines))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Draw:** The code iterates through each cell, and if it's not the background color, it draws a vertical line from that point to the top using a set comprehension.
2. **Combine and Paint:**  Lines are combined and painted onto a blank canvas.


**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Start with a blank canvas
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (k, j)) for k in range(i, height(I))})  # Draw upward line
        break  # Move to the next column after drawing one line
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Blank Canvas:**  Initialize the output grid (`O`) as a blank canvas.
2. **Column-wise Iteration:** Iterate through each column and find the first non-background cell.
3. **Draw and Break:** Draw a vertical line upwards from that cell and then move to the next column.


**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def create_line(obj):
    _, (i, j) = next(iter(obj))  # Get any cell's coordinates
    return frozenset({(I[i][j], (k, j)) for k in range(height(I))})
    
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Get all objects
  lines = apply(create_line, objs)  # Create lines for each object
  O = paint(cover(I, asindices(I)), merge(lines))  # Paint lines on blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`create_line` Function:**  A helper function takes an object and creates a vertical line based on any cell within that object.
2. **Apply and Paint:** Applies the `create_line` function to all objects and paints the resulting lines.


**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def rightmost_cell(obj):
    return argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1])
  
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  lines = set()
  for obj in objs:
    color, (i, j) = rightmost_cell(obj)
    lines.add(frozenset({(color, (k, j)) for k in range(height(I))}))
  O = paint(cover(I, asindices(I)), merge(lines))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`rightmost_cell` Function:**  Finds the rightmost cell within an object.
2. **Iterate and Draw:** Iterates through each object, gets its rightmost cell, and draws a vertical line.
3. **Combine and Paint:**  Combines the lines and paints them on a blank canvas.


These five programs demonstrate different approaches to solve the problem, utilizing various DSL functions and logic. They are distinct solutions, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.
