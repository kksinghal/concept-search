## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to **shrink horizontally each object in the input grid to a single column, preserving its vertical structure.** The leftmost column of each object remains unchanged while the rest of the columns are replaced with the background color.

**Input_0 Example:**

- The two '1' objects are reduced to single columns.
- The '3' object retains its leftmost column, the other two columns are replaced with '0's.
- The '6' objects are similarly reduced to their leftmost columns.

**Input_1 & Input_2:**  Follow the same pattern of shrinking objects to their leftmost column.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions for the "Program_to_be_generated" along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Initialize output grid with background color
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):      # Iterate over each object in the input grid
        left_edge = frozenset((v, (i, leftmost(obj))) for v, (i, j) in obj)  # Extract the leftmost column of the object
        O = paint(O, left_edge)          # Paint the leftmost column onto the output grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** A canvas of the same size as the input grid is created, filled with the most common color (background) of the input.
2. **Object Iteration:** The program iterates through each object identified in the input grid.
3. **Left Edge Extraction:**  For each object, its leftmost column is extracted and stored as a separate object.
4. **Painting:** The extracted left edge is painted onto the output canvas.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(1, width(I)):  # Iterate over columns, starting from the second
    column = crop(I, (0, j), (height(I), 1))  # Extract the current column
    if numcolors(column) > 1:  # Check if the column contains more than one color (part of an object)
      O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), asindices(column))  # Fill the column with the background color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** The output grid is initialized as a copy of the input.
2. **Column Iteration:**  The program iterates through each column of the input grid, excluding the first column.
3. **Column Check:** For each column, it checks if there is more than one color present. This indicates if the column is part of a multi-column object.
4. **Background Fill:** If the column is part of an object, it's filled with the background color, effectively shrinking the object to its leftmost column.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
        if width(obj) > 1:  # Check if object spans multiple columns
            for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj) + 1):
                O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(i, j) for i in range(height(I)) if (i, j) in toindices(obj)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Output grid is initialized as a copy of the input.
2. **Object Iteration:**  Iterates through each object in the input.
3. **Multi-Column Check:** Checks if an object spans multiple columns.
4. **Column Filling:** For each column of a multi-column object except the first one, it fills the cells belonging to that object with the background color.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Initialize output with background color
  for i in range(height(I)):  # Iterate over rows
    leftmost_color = None  # Keep track of the leftmost color encountered in the row
    for j in range(width(I)):  # Iterate over columns
      color = index(I, (i, j))  # Get the color at the current cell
      if color != mostcolor(I) and leftmost_color is None: # If a non-background color is encountered for the first time in the row
        leftmost_color = color  # Update the leftmost color
      if leftmost_color is not None:  # If a leftmost color has been found
        O = fill(O, leftmost_color, {(i, j)})  # Fill the cell with the leftmost color
        leftmost_color = None  # Reset leftmost color for the next object in the row
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  The output grid is initialized with the background color.
2. **Row-wise Iteration:** It iterates through each row of the input grid.
3. **Leftmost Color Tracking:**  For each row, it keeps track of the first non-background color encountered.
4. **Filling with Leftmost Color:** As soon as a non-background color is found, all subsequent cells in that row are filled with that color until the next object begins.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for x in range(width(I)):
        column = crop(I, (0, x), (height(I), 1))
        colors = palette(column) - {mostcommon(column)}
        if len(colors) == 1:
            target_color = first(colors)
            O = fill(O, target_color, asindices(column))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  The output grid is initialized with the input grid.
2. **Column Extraction:**  The program iterates through the input grid, extracting one vertical column at a time.
3. **Color Analysis:**  For each column, it identifies the unique colors present, excluding the most common one (background).
4. **Single-Color Column Fill:** If the column contains only one unique color (apart from the background), indicating it's a single-object column, it fills the entire column with that color in the output grid.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation, utilizing different DSL functions and logic. Each version should be significantly different, going beyond just minor variations.
