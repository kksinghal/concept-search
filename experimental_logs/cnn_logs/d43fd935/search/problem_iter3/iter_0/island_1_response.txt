## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids seems to be:

**General Rule:** For each object (connected group of same-colored cells, excluding the background color), keep only the leftmost cell of each row the object occupies.

Let's illustrate with examples:

**Input_0:**

* **Object 1 (color 1):**  The leftmost '1' in each row is kept, the rest are replaced with the background color (0).
* **Object 2 (color 3):** Same logic applied - only the leftmost '3' in each row remains.
* **Object 3 (color 6):** Similarly, only the leftmost '6' in each row is kept.

**Input_1 and Input_2:** 
The same transformation logic is applied to every object in these grids as well. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)  # Get all objects except background
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1): # For each row the object occupies
      leftmost_j = min(j for _, (row, j) in obj if row == i) # Find the leftmost cell's column index in that row
      I = fill(I, mostcolor(I), {(i, j) for j in range(leftmost_j + 1, width(I))}) # Fill everything to the right of that cell with background color
  return I 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `fgpartition(I)` identifies all objects in the grid except the background.
2. **Iterate through Rows:** For each object, it iterates through the rows the object occupies.
3. **Find Leftmost Cell:** In each row, `min(j for _, (row, j) in obj if row == i)` finds the column index (`j`) of the leftmost cell.
4. **Fill with Background:** Everything to the right of this leftmost cell in that row is filled with the background color using `fill(I, mostcolor(I), {(i, j) for j in range(leftmost_j + 1, width(I))})`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)-1, 0, -1): # Iterate columns right to left
      if I[i][j] == I[i][j-1]: # If current cell same as the one to its left
        I = fill(I, mostcolor(I), {(i, j)}) # Replace current cell with background
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** Iterates through each cell of the grid from right to left, row by row.
2. **Compare with Left Neighbor:** Checks if the current cell has the same color as its left neighbor.
3. **Replace if Same:** If they are the same color, it means this cell is not the leftmost of the object in this row and is replaced with the background color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  new_I = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create a blank canvas
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    leftmost_indices = {min((j, (i, j)) for _, (i, j) in obj if i == row)[1] for row in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)} # Find leftmost indices for each row
    new_I = paint(new_I, {(color(obj), i) for i in leftmost_indices}) # Paint only those leftmost cells onto the canvas
  return new_I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Blank Canvas:** Creates a blank canvas filled with the background color.
2. **Find Leftmost Cells:** For each object, identifies the leftmost cell's index in each row the object occupies. 
3. **Paint Leftmost Cells:** Paints only these identified leftmost cells onto the blank canvas with their original colors.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  return tuple(tuple(v if j == min(k for k in range(width(I)) if I[i][k] == v) else mostcolor(I) for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(I))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested list comprehensions for a more compact solution. 

1. **Iterate and Compare:** It iterates through each cell, comparing its column index with the minimum column index of cells having the same color in that row.
2. **Conditional Replacement:** If the current cell's index is the minimum, it is kept; otherwise, it is replaced with the background color. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  return tuple(tuple(row[0:next((j for j, v in enumerate(row) if v != mostcolor(I)), len(row))]) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Rows:** Iterates through each row.
2. **Find First Non-Background:**  Finds the index of the first cell that is not the background color using `next((j for j, v in enumerate(row) if v != mostcolor(I)), len(row))`.
3. **Slice and Keep:**  Keeps the slice of the row from the beginning till the found index, effectively removing everything else.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation while using the allowed DSL functions.
