## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to shift the rightmost cell of each connected object (considering only direct neighbors, not diagonals) to the leftmost column of the object while maintaining its row position. 

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* **1s Object:** The rightmost '1' at (0,1) moves to (0,0).
* **3s Object:** The rightmost '3' at (4,3) moves to (4,1).
* **6s Object:** The transformation is applied multiple times as there are multiple rightmost '6's. 
    * The '6' at (1,9) moves to (1,8).
    * The '6' at (7,7) moves to (7,6).
    * The '6' at (8,6) moves to (8,1).
    * The '6' at (9,6) moves to (9,1).

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* **7s Object:**  The rightmost '7' at (9,9) moves to (9,5).
* **8s Object:** The transformation is applied multiple times:
    * The '8' at (0,8) moves to (0,6).
    * The '8' at (2,9) moves to (2,7).
    * The '8' at (6,8) moves to (6,6).
    * The '8' at (7,8) moves to (7,6).
* **3s Object:** The rightmost '3' at (2,8) moves to (2,5).

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* **1s Object:** The transformation is applied multiple times:
    * The '1' at (2,2) moves to (2,1).
    * The '1' at (5,9) moves to (5,6).
    * The '1' at (9,2) moves to (9,1).
* **3s Object:** The rightmost '3' at (7,3) moves to (7,1).

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the DSL functions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for obj in objects(grid, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    rightmost_cell = argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1])
    leftmost_column = leftmost(obj)
    new_obj = {(v, (i, leftmost_column)) if (v, (i, j)) == rightmost_cell else (v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj}
    grid = paint(cover(grid, obj), new_obj)
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** We iterate over each object in the grid using `objects` with `univalued=False` (as objects can have multiple colors), `diagonal=False` (as connectivity is based on direct neighbors), and `without_bg=True` (to exclude the background).
2. **Find Rightmost and Leftmost:** For each object, we find the rightmost cell using `argmax` based on the column index (`cell[1][1]`). We also find the leftmost column index using `leftmost`.
3. **Create New Object:** We create a new object where the rightmost cell is moved to the leftmost column on the same row.
4. **Update Grid:**  We update the grid by first covering the original object using `cover` and then painting the new object using `paint`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  for obj in objects(grid, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    for i in range(height(obj)):
      row_cells = {(v, (a, b)) for v, (a, b) in obj if a == uppermost(obj) + i}
      rightmost_cell = argmax(row_cells, lambda cell: cell[1][1])
      new_obj = {(v, (i + uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj))) if (v, (a, b)) == rightmost_cell else (v, (a, b)) for v, (a, b) in row_cells}
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, new_obj)
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** We create a new empty grid (`new_grid`) with the same shape and background color as the input grid using `canvas`, `mostcolor`, and `shape`.
2. **Iterate and Process Row-wise:** For each object, we iterate row by row within the object's bounding box (`height(obj)`). For each row, we collect the cells belonging to that row (`row_cells`).
3. **Move Rightmost Cell:** We find the rightmost cell within the row and move it to the leftmost column on the same row.
4. **Paint to New Grid:** We paint the modified row (`new_obj`) onto the new grid (`new_grid`).

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for j in range(width(grid)-1, 0, -1):
    for i in range(height(grid)):
      if (i, j) in asindices(grid) and index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcolor(grid) and index(grid, (i, j-1)) == mostcolor(grid):
        obj = extract(objects(grid, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), lambda x: (i, j) in toindices(x))
        grid = move(grid, obj, (0, -1))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Column by Column:** We iterate through the grid column by column, starting from the second to last column (`width(grid)-1`) and moving towards the left (`0` with step `-1`). 
2. **Check for Movable Cell:**  For each cell, we check if it's not the background color (`mostcolor`) and if its left neighbor is the background color. If these conditions are met, it means this cell can potentially be moved left.
3. **Find and Move Object:** We find the object this cell belongs to using `extract` and `objects` and then move the entire object one step to the left using `move` with offset `(0, -1)`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  processed_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  for i in range(height(grid)):
    for j in range(width(grid)):
      if index(grid, (i, j)) != mostcolor(grid):
        obj = extract(objects(grid, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), lambda x: (i, j) in toindices(x))
        leftmost_col = leftmost(obj)
        processed_grid = paint(processed_grid, {(v, (i, leftmost_col)) if (a, b) == (i, j) else (v, (a, b)) for v, (a, b) in obj})
  return processed_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Processed Grid:** Create an empty grid (`processed_grid`) with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid.
2. **Iterate Through Cells:** Go through each cell in the input grid.
3. **Identify Object and Leftmost Column:** If a cell is not the background color, identify the object it belongs to and find the column index of the leftmost cell in that object.
4. **Paint onto Processed Grid:** Paint the identified object onto the `processed_grid`, but shift the current cell's position to be in the leftmost column of its object while maintaining its row.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for obj in objects(grid, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    for i in range(height(obj)):
      row = uppermost(obj) + i
      obj_row = {(v, (a, b)) for v, (a, b) in obj if a == row}
      k = width(obj_row)
      for j in range(width(obj_row)):
        c = index(grid, (row, leftmost(obj) + j))
        grid = fill(grid, c, {(row, leftmost(obj) + (j - k) % width(obj_row))})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Objects and Rows:**  Iterate through each object and then each row within the object.
2. **Shift Cells Within Row:** For each row in an object, determine the number of cells (`k`). Then, for each cell in that row, calculate a new column index by shifting it `k` positions to the left, using modulo (`%`) to wrap around within the object's width.
3. **Fill Grid:** Fill the grid with the color of the shifted cell at its new position.

These five versions provide different approaches to solving the transformation problem. Each utilizes distinct DSL function combinations and logic, ensuring diversity in solutions.
