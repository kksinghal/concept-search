## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to "shrink" objects in the grid, retaining only the leftmost cell of each row within an object.

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
* The two '1' objects are reduced to their leftmost cells.
* The '3' object is reduced to a vertical line, keeping the leftmost '3' in each row.
* The '6' object is similarly reduced, keeping the leftmost '6'.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
* Each object ('3', '7', '8') is reduced in the same manner, retaining the leftmost cell of each row within the object.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
* Both '1' objects and the '3' object are shrunk to vertical lines, representing their leftmost positions in each row.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct programs to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    leftmost_cells = frozenset((color(obj), (i, min(j for _, (k, j) in obj if k == i))) for i in range(height(obj)))
    O = paint(O, leftmost_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialize Output:** Creates an empty canvas (`O`) with the same shape and background color as the input (`I`).
2. **Iterate Objects:** Iterates over each object in the input grid excluding the background (`fgpartition(I)`).
3. **Find Leftmost Cells:** For each object, it finds the leftmost cell in each row and stores them in `leftmost_cells`.
4. **Paint to Output:** Paints the `leftmost_cells` of each object onto the output canvas.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0])):
      if index(I, (i, j)) == index(I, (i, j - 1)):
        O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate Grid:**  Iterates over each cell in the input grid.
2. **Check Right Neighbor:** If a cell has the same color as its left neighbor, it is filled with the background color.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, leftmost(sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda x: x[0] == i)))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialize Output:**  Creates an empty canvas (`O`) with the same shape and background color as the input (`I`).
2. **Iterate Objects and Rows:** Iterates over each object and then each row within the object.
3. **Find and Fill Leftmost:** For each row, it finds the leftmost cell of the object and fills it with the object's color on the output canvas.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
      if j > leftmost(sfilter(obj, lambda x: x[1][0] == i)):
        O = fill(O, mostcolor(O), {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate Objects and Cells:** Iterates over each object and then each cell within the object.
2. **Fill Non-Leftmost Cells:** If a cell is not the leftmost cell in its row within the object, it is filled with the background color.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(len(I)):
    leftmost_color = None
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and leftmost_color is None:
        leftmost_color = I[i][j]
        O = fill(O, leftmost_color, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialize Output:**  Creates an empty canvas (`O`) with the same shape and background color as the input (`I`).
2. **Iterate Rows and Find First Non-Background:** Iterates over each row and finds the first non-background color.
3. **Fill and Track Leftmost:** Fills that cell on the output grid with the color found and remembers the color to avoid filling subsequent cells in the same row.
