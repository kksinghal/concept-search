## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all examples seems to be moving the digits of each object to the leftmost possible position in their row, effectively compressing the objects horizontally towards the left.  The original shape and relative order of objects are maintained.

**Input 0:**

* The two '1's at the top left move to the far left of the first row.
* The '6' object is compressed horizontally, maintaining its overall shape.
* The '3' object and the bottom '1's are similarly compressed.

**Input 1:**

* The '7' objects are compressed to the leftmost position in their respective rows.
* The '8' object maintains its shape but moves to the leftmost columns.
* The '3' object is also compressed to the left.

**Input 2:**

*  The '1' objects are compressed to the leftmost position in their respective rows.
* The '3' object maintains its shape and compresses left.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct programs to achieve this transformation:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  processed_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)) # Create blank canvas
  for obj in fgpartition(grid): # Iterate through each object
    leftmost_col = leftmost(obj) # Find the leftmost column of the object
    processed_grid = paint(processed_grid, { # Paint the object onto the canvas
        (v, (i, leftmost_col)) if (a, b) == (i, j) else (v, (a, b)) 
        for v, (a, b) in obj 
        for j in range(width(grid)) # Iterate through columns to ensure leftmost placement
    })
  return processed_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a Blank Canvas:**  We start by creating a blank canvas of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate Through Objects:** The program iterates through each distinct object (non-background color) in the input grid using `fgpartition`.
3. **Find Leftmost Column:** For each object, it determines the leftmost occupied column index (`leftmost_col`).
4. **Paint to Canvas:** It then paints the object onto the canvas.  It strategically places the object such that all its cells occupy the same row as in the input but are shifted to start at the `leftmost_col`, effectively compressing the object leftwards. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  new_grid = [] 
  for row in grid: 
    non_bg_digits = [v for v in row if v != mostcommon(row)] # Extract non-background digits
    padding = [mostcommon(row)] * (len(row) - len(non_bg_digits)) # Calculate padding
    new_row = non_bg_digits + padding # Combine digits and padding
    new_grid.append(tuple(new_row)) 
  return tuple(new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Rows:** The code iterates over each row of the input grid.
2. **Extract Non-Background Digits:**  For each row, it extracts all digits that are not the background color (`mostcommon(row)`).
3. **Calculate Padding:**  It determines the number of background digits needed to maintain the original row length.
4. **Combine and Append:** It combines the extracted non-background digits with the calculated padding of background digits and appends this new row to the `new_grid`.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for y, row in enumerate(I):
    x = 0
    for v in row:
      if v != mostcolor(I):
        O = paint(O, {(v, (y, x))})
        x += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output Grid:** Creates an output grid (`O`) filled with the background color, having the same shape as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate Through Cells:**  Iterates through each cell in the input grid, keeping track of the row (`y`) and column (`x`) indices.
3. **Conditional Painting:** If the current cell's value is not the background color, it paints this value at the corresponding row (`y`) but at a dynamically updated column (`x`) in the output grid.  The `x` is incremented only when a non-background color is painted, ensuring compression.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(
      tuple(sorted(row, key=lambda x: x == mostcommon(grid)))
      for row in grid
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a clever trick with Python's `sorted` function:

1. **Iterate and Sort Rows:** It iterates through each row of the input grid. For each row, it uses `sorted` with a custom key to sort the elements.
2. **Custom Sorting Key:** The key `lambda x: x == mostcommon(grid)` effectively pushes all background color elements to the end of the row while preserving the relative order of non-background elements. 


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(
    tuple(v for k,v in sorted((grid[i][j],j) for j in range(width(grid))) if v != mostcolor(grid)) + 
    tuple(mostcolor(grid) for _ in range(width(grid)-len([v for k,v in sorted((grid[i][j],j) for j in range(width(grid))) if v != mostcolor(grid)])))
    for i in range(height(grid))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over Rows and Sort:** Iterates over each row (`i`) and sorts the row elements based on their original column index (`j`).
2. **Extract Non-Background and Pad:**  Extracts non-background elements from the sorted list and concatenates them with padding made of the background color to maintain the original row length.
3. **Construct New Grid:** Constructs a new grid (`tuple of tuples`) from the modified rows.

These five versions all achieve the same outcome but demonstrate significantly different approaches using the provided DSL functions. Each version offers a unique way to think about and manipulate the grid data, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL and your ability to problem-solve with code.
