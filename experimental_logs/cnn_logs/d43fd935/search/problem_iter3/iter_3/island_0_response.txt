## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation removes all but the leftmost occurrence of each distinct digit in each row of the input grid. 

Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* Row 1: The two '1's are reduced to one.
* Row 2: The two '6's are reduced to one.
* Row 4: The four '1's are reduced to one.
* Row 6: One of the two '6's is removed.
* Row 7: One of the two '6's is removed. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* Row 1: One of the two '7's and one of the two '8's are removed.
* Row 3:  Two of the three '8's are removed.
* Row 6: One of the two '8's is removed.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* Row 2: One of the two '1's is removed.
* Row 3: One of the two '1's is removed.
* Row 6: One of the two '1's is removed.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_363442ee(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    seen_colors = set()
    for j in range(width(I)):
      value = index(I, (i, j))
      if value not in seen_colors:
        O = paint(O, {(value, (i, j))})
        seen_colors.add(value)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas (`O`) of the same size as the input grid (`I`), filled with the most common color in the input.
2. **Row Iteration:** Iterates through each row (`i`) of the input grid.
3. **Color Tracking:** For each row, maintains a set (`seen_colors`) to track the unique colors encountered.
4. **Cell Processing:** Iterates through each cell (`j`) in the current row:
   - If the cell's color (`value`) has not been seen before in this row, it's painted onto the output canvas (`O`) at the same location.
   - The color is then added to `seen_colors` to mark it as encountered.
5. **Output:** Returns the transformed grid `O`.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_363442ee(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)-1, 0, -1):
      if index(I, (i,j)) == index(I, (i, j-1)):
        O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Starts with the output grid (`O`) being the same as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Row Iteration:** Iterates through each row (`i`) of the grid.
3. **Reverse Column Iteration:** Iterates through each column (`j`) in the current row from right to left (excluding the first column).
4. **Duplicate Check:**  Compares the current cell's color with the color of its left neighbor. 
5. **Filling Duplicates:** If the colors match (indicating a duplicate), the current cell in the output grid (`O`) is filled with the background color.
6. **Output:**  Returns the modified output grid `O`.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_363442ee(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in partition(I):
    leftmost_cell = argmin(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1])
    O = paint(O, {leftmost_cell})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas (`O`) of the same dimensions as the input (`I`), filled with the most prevalent color.
2. **Object Partitioning:** Divides the input grid into distinct objects (`obj`) based on connected same-colored cells using `partition(I)`.
3. **Finding Leftmost Cell:** For each object, it identifies the cell (`leftmost_cell`) with the smallest column index (`argmin`) which represents the leftmost cell in that object.
4. **Painting Leftmost Cell:**  Paints only the `leftmost_cell` of each object onto the output canvas (`O`).
5. **Output:** Returns the modified canvas `O` containing only the leftmost cells of each object from the input.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_363442ee(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = I
  for i in range(h):
    seen = set()
    for j in range(w):
      v = index(I, (i, j))
      if v in seen:
        O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(i, j)})
      else:
        seen.add(v)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Initialization:**  Gets the height (`h`) and width (`w`) of the input grid (`I`). The output grid (`O`) is initialized as a copy of the input.
2.  **Row Iteration:** Iterates through each row (`i`) of the grid.
3.  **Seen Colors Set:**  For each row, a set (`seen`) is used to track encountered colors.
4.  **Cell Iteration:** Iterates through each cell (`j`) in the current row.
5.  **Color Check:**
    -   If the cell's color (`v`) is already in `seen` (encountered before in this row), the corresponding cell in `O` is filled with the background color using `fill`.
    -   If the color is new, it's added to the `seen` set.
6.  **Output:** Returns the modified `O` grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_363442ee(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    row = tuple(index(I, (i, j)) for j in range(width(I)))
    unique_row = dedupe(row)
    for j, v in enumerate(unique_row):
      O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas (`O`) with the same dimensions as the input (`I`) and filled with the background color (most common color).
2. **Row Iteration:** Iterates through each row (`i`) of the input grid.
3. **Extracting and Deduplicating Row:**
   - Extracts the current row (`row`) as a tuple of color values.
   - Removes duplicate colors from the row using `dedupe(row)`, storing the result in `unique_row`.
4. **Painting Unique Values:** Iterates through each unique color (`v`) and its index (`j`) in `unique_row`:
   - Paints the color onto the canvas `O` at the corresponding row and the index `j`. 
5. **Output:** Returns the modified canvas `O`.
