## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

**For each non-background object in the grid:**

1. **Identify the leftmost cell** of the object.
2. **Extend the object horizontally** to the right, filling all cells with the object's color until it reaches the grid boundary or another object.
3. **Remove all other cells** of the object that are not part of this newly extended horizontal line.

**In essence, the transformation "squashes" each object horizontally towards its leftmost cell, creating a single horizontal line for each object.**

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_I = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create a blank canvas
  for obj in fgpartition(I): # Iterate over each non-background object
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj) # Find the leftmost column index of the object
    for i in range(height(I)): # Iterate over each row
      if (i, leftmost_j) in toindices(obj): # Check if the leftmost column of this row contains the object
        new_I = paint(new_I, {(color(obj), (i, leftmost_j))}) # Paint the leftmost cell
        for j in range(leftmost_j + 1, width(I)): # Extend horizontally to the right
          new_I = paint(new_I, {(color(obj), (i, j))}) # Paint the current cell
  return new_I
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a blank canvas with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid.
2. Iterates over each non-background object in the input grid.
3. For each object, it determines the column index of its leftmost cell.
4. It then iterates through each row of the grid and checks if the leftmost column for that row contains a cell belonging to the current object.
5. If so, it paints the leftmost cell and then extends a horizontal line to the right, painting each cell with the object's color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      v if j == min((k for k, val in enumerate(r) if val == v), default=width(I) - 1) else mostcolor(I) # Keep leftmost occurrence, else fill with background
      for j, v in enumerate(r)
    )
    for r in I # Iterate over rows
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. Uses a nested tuple comprehension to process the grid row by row and cell by cell.
2. For each cell, it checks if its column index is the minimum index where the cell's color appears in that row. This effectively identifies the leftmost occurrence of each color in each row.
3. If the cell is the leftmost occurrence, its color is kept. Otherwise, it's replaced with the background color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_I = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create a blank canvas
  for obj in fgpartition(I): # Iterate over each non-background object
    min_j = leftmost(obj) # Find the leftmost column index of the object
    max_i = lowermost(obj) # Find the bottom row index of the object
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), max_i + 1): # Iterate over rows where the object is present
      new_I = paint(new_I, {(color(obj), (i, min_j))}) # Paint the leftmost cell for each row
      if i == max_i: # If it's the bottom row
        for j in range(min_j + 1, width(I)): # Extend horizontally from the leftmost cell
          new_I = paint(new_I, {(color(obj), (i, j))}) # Paint the current cell
  return new_I
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a blank canvas.
2. Iterates over each non-background object.
3. Determines the leftmost column and bottom row indices of the object.
4. Iterates through the rows where the object is present.
5. For each row, paints the leftmost cell.
6. On the bottom row, it additionally extends a horizontal line from the leftmost cell to the right edge of the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_I = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    row = I[i]
    seen_colors = set()
    for j in range(width(I)):
      color = row[j]
      if color != mostcolor(I) and color not in seen_colors:
        seen_colors.add(color)
      else:
        new_I = fill(new_I, mostcolor(I), {(i, j)})  
  return new_I
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterates through each row of the grid.
2. For each row, keeps track of seen colors.
3. If a color is encountered for the first time in that row, it's considered the leftmost occurrence and is kept.
4. If a color has been seen before (or is the background color), it's replaced with the background color. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_I = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    start = (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj))
    end = (uppermost(obj), width(new_I)-1)
    line = connect(start, end)
    new_I = paint(new_I, recolor(color(obj), line)) 
  return new_I
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a blank canvas.
2. Iterates through each non-background object.
3. Calculates the start and end points for a horizontal line representing the squashed object.
4. Generates the line segment connecting those points.
5. Paints the line segment onto the canvas using the object's color. 

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the same transformation, utilizing various combinations of DSL functions and logic flow. Each version offers a distinct solution path while adhering to the constraints of the DSL.
