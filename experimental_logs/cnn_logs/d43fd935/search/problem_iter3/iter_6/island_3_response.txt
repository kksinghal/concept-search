## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to keep only the leftmost cell of each object in the input grid, while replacing all other cells in the object with the background color. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** For the object consisting of '1's, only the leftmost '1' in each row is kept. All other '1's are replaced with '0's (background color). Similarly, for objects consisting of '3's and '6's, only the leftmost cell in each row is retained. 
* **Input_1 & Input_2:** The same logic applies.  The leftmost cell of each object in each row is preserved, and the rest are replaced by the background color.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the described transformation:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create output grid with background color
  for obj in fgpartition(I):  # Iterate over each object (excluding background)
    for i in range(height(I)): # Iterate through each row
      leftmost_j = min([j for _, (row, j) in obj if row == i], default=None) # Find column index of leftmost cell in the row
      if leftmost_j is not None: # If a cell from the object exists in this row
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, leftmost_j)})  # Fill the leftmost cell 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Create an empty output grid `O` filled with the background color of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Iterate through each object (color) present in the input grid, excluding the background.
3. **Find Leftmost Cell per Row:** For each row `i`, find the minimum column index `j` of the cells belonging to the current object in that row.
4. **Fill Leftmost Cell:** If a leftmost cell exists (`leftmost_j` is not None), fill the corresponding cell in the output grid `O` with the object's color.


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Initialize output as a copy of the input
  for i in range(height(I)):  # Iterate over each row
    for j in range(width(I)):  # Iterate over each column
      if index(I, (i,j)) != mostcolor(I): # If the current cell is not background
        if j != leftmost(sfilter(toindices(asobject(crop(I,(i,0),(1,width(I))))), lambda x: index(I, x) != mostcolor(I))): # Check if it's not the leftmost non-background cell in the row
          O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(i,j)})  # Fill with background color if not leftmost
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Copy Input:** Create the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Cells:** Iterate through each cell in the grid.
3. **Check for Non-Background:** If the cell is not the background color:
    -  Check if it's the leftmost non-background cell in its row.
    -  If not, fill the cell in the output grid `O` with the background color. 


### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create output grid with background color
  for obj in fgpartition(I):  # Iterate over each foreground object
    leftmost_indices = set()  # Initialize a set to store leftmost indices
    for _, (i, j) in obj: # Iterate through each cell in the object
      if not any((i, k) in leftmost_indices for k in range(j)):  # Check if a leftmost index already exists in the same row
        leftmost_indices.add((i, j))  # If not, add the current index as leftmost
    O = paint(O, toobject(frozenset(leftmost_indices), I))  # Paint the leftmost cells onto the output grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Create an empty output grid `O` filled with the input's background color.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Loop through each object (excluding the background) in the input grid.
3. **Find & Store Leftmost:** For each cell in the object, check if a leftmost index already exists in that row. If not, add the current cell's index to `leftmost_indices`.
4. **Paint Leftmost:** After processing each object, paint the cells at the collected `leftmost_indices` onto the output grid `O`.


### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create an empty output grid 
  for i in range(height(I)): # Iterate over rows
    row_cells = [(index(I, (i, j)), (i, j)) for j in range(width(I)) if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I)] # Get non-background cells in the row
    if row_cells:
      O = paint(O, {row_cells[0]}) # Paint the leftmost non-background cell to the output
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Create an empty output grid `O` filled with the input's background color. 
2. **Iterate Rows:** Loop through each row of the input grid.
3. **Collect Row Cells:** For each row, collect all cells that are not the background color.
4. **Paint Leftmost:** If non-background cells exist in the row (`row_cells` is not empty), paint the first cell (leftmost) to the output grid.


### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I # Create the output grid as a copy of the input
  for obj in fgpartition(I): # Iterate over each foreground object
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj: # Iterate over each cell in the object
      if j > leftmost(sfilter(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][0] == i)):  # If the cell is not the leftmost in its row within the object
        O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(i, j)}) # Replace the cell with the background color 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Copy Input:** Create the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Loop through each object (excluding the background) in the input grid.
3. **Identify Non-Leftmost Cells:**  For each cell in the object, determine if it's the leftmost cell in its row within that specific object. 
4. **Fill with Background:** If the cell is not the leftmost in its row, replace it with the background color in the output grid `O`.

These five program versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic combinations.
