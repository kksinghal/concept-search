## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving all non-background digits in the input grid to the rightmost column while preserving their relative vertical positions. The background color is the most frequent color in the grid. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**

- All '1's are moved to the rightmost column, maintaining their vertical positions.
- All '6's are moved to the rightmost column, maintaining their vertical positions.
- The '3's are also shifted right, filling the spaces left by the '1's.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**

- Similar to Input_0, all non-zero digits ('7', '8', '3') are moved to the rightmost column, preserving their relative vertical order.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**

- The '1's and '3's are moved to the rightmost column, maintaining their relative vertical order. 

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  for j in range(w - 1, -1, -1):
    for i in range(h):
      if grid[i][j] != bg:
        for k in range(w - 1, j, -1):
          if grid[i][k] == bg:
            grid = fill(grid, grid[i][j], {(i, k)})
            grid = fill(grid, bg, {(i, j)})
            break
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

- Determines the background color (`bg`).
- Iterates through the grid columns from right to left.
- For each non-background digit, it finds the closest empty space (filled with `bg`) in the same row to the right and moves the digit there.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(bg, shape(grid))
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    new_row = list(repeat(bg, len(row)))
    j = len(row) - 1
    for v in row[::-1]:
      if v != bg:
        new_row[j] = v
        j -= 1
    new_grid = fill(new_grid, new_row, {(i, 0)})
  return new_grid 
```

**Explanation:**

- Creates a new grid filled with the background color.
- Iterates through the rows of the input grid.
- For each row, it creates a new row and fills it from the right with non-background digits, preserving their order.
- Replaces the corresponding row in the new grid with the modified row.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  for obj in fgpartition(grid):
    j = w - 1
    for i in range(h):
      if (grid[i][0], (i, 0)) in obj:
        grid = fill(grid, grid[i][0], {(i, j)})
        grid = fill(grid, bg, {(i, 0)})
        j -= 1
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

- Determines the background color (`bg`).
- Iterates through each non-background object (using `fgpartition`).
- For each object, it moves its cells to the rightmost column, starting from the top row.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  for j in range(w):
    column = tuple(grid[i][j] for i in range(h))
    new_column = tuple(v for v in column if v != bg) + tuple(bg for _ in range(h - len(tuple(v for v in column if v != bg))))
    grid = fill(grid, new_column, {(0, j)})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

- Determines the background color (`bg`).
- Iterates through each column of the grid.
- For each column, it extracts the non-background digits, appends necessary background digits, and overwrites the column with the modified version. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  transformed = tuple(tuple(v if j == len(row) - 1 else bg for j, v in enumerate(row)) for row in grid)
  for obj in fgpartition(grid):
    offset = (0, len(grid[0]) - 1 - rightmost(obj))
    transformed = paint(transformed, shift(obj, offset))
  return transformed
```

**Explanation:**

- Creates a new grid (`transformed`) filled with the background color except for the rightmost column, which retains the original values.
- Iterates through each non-background object and shifts it to the rightmost available column in `transformed`.

These five program versions provide different approaches to achieve the desired grid transformation using the provided DSL functions. They demonstrate a diverse range of logic and function combinations.
