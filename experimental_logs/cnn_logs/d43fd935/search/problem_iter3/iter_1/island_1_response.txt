## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation removes all but the leftmost cell of each row within each non-background object. 

**Example:**

Input:
```
1 1 0 0
0 1 1 1
```

Output:
```
1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0
```

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in fgpartition(I): # Iterate over non-background objects
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1): # Iterate over rows of each object
      leftmost_j = min([j for _, (row, j) in obj if row == i]) # Find leftmost column index for the current row
      I = fill(I, mostcolor(I), {(i, j) for j in range(leftmost_j + 1, width(I))}) # Fill everything to the right with background color
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each non-background object and each row the object occupies. It finds the column index of the leftmost cell in that row and fills everything to the right of that cell with the background color.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_I = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create a canvas filled with background color
  for obj in fgpartition(I): # Iterate over non-background objects
    leftmost_cells = {(i, min([j for _, (row, j) in obj if row == i])) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)} # Find leftmost cell coordinates for each row
    new_I = paint(new_I, {(color(obj), (i, j)) for i, j in leftmost_cells}) # Paint the leftmost cells onto the new canvas
  return new_I
```

**Explanation:**

This version creates a new grid filled with the background color. Then, for each object, it identifies the coordinates of the leftmost cell in each row and paints only those cells onto the new grid.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(v if j == min([k for k, w in enumerate(row) if w == v], default=-1) else mostcolor(I) for j, v in enumerate(row)) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested list comprehensions. For each row, it iterates over the values and their indices. If a value's index is the same as the minimum index for that value in the row, it's kept; otherwise, it's replaced with the background color.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(row[:next((j for j, v in enumerate(row) if v != mostcolor(I)), width(I))]) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each row and uses `next` to find the index of the first non-background color. It then slices the row from the beginning to that index, effectively keeping only the leftmost colored segment.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  I = dmirror(I)  # Mirror along diagonal
  I = tuple(tuple(row[0:next((j for j, v in enumerate(row) if v != mostcolor(I)), len(row))]) for row in I) # Apply transformation from version 4
  I = dmirror(I)  # Mirror back to original orientation
  return I 
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages the existing logic from Version 4 but applies it vertically instead of horizontally. It achieves this by mirroring the grid diagonally, applying the transformation from Version 4, and then mirroring it back to its original orientation.
