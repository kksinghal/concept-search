## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as **"Leftmost Pixel Preservation"**.  Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

* **Input_0 -> Output_0:** For each object (group of connected digits with the same value), only the leftmost pixel in each row is kept. Other pixels of the object are replaced with the background color (0 in this case).
* **Input_1 -> Output_1:**  Same logic applies. For example, the horizontal line of 7s at the bottom becomes a single 7.
* **Input_2 -> Output_2:** Similar to the previous examples, the 3x2 rectangle of 3s is reduced to two 3s, one on each row, at the leftmost position.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each with an explanation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create empty canvas
  for obj in fgpartition(I):  # Loop through each object (no background)
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):  # Loop through rows
      leftmost_cell = min(obj, key=lambda x: x[1][1] if x[1][0] == i else float('inf')) # Find leftmost cell in row
      O = paint(O, {leftmost_cell})  # Paint leftmost cell
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** We initialize an empty canvas (`O`) of the same size as the input (`I`) filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate Objects:** We iterate through each object in the input grid using `fgpartition` (excluding the background).
3. **Find Leftmost:** For each row within an object, we find the cell with the minimum column index (`j`) using the `min` function and a custom key to handle empty rows.
4. **Paint & Return:**  We paint the found leftmost cell onto the canvas (`O`) and return the modified canvas.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I)):
            if j == leftmost(ofcolor(I, I[i][j])):
                O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** An empty canvas `O` is created with the input's background color and dimensions.
2. **Iterate Through Cells:** The code iterates over each cell `(i, j)` in the input grid `I`.
3. **Leftmost Check:** For every cell, it checks if its column index `j` is the same as the leftmost column index of all cells with the same color.
4. **Conditional Painting:** If the condition is true (it's the leftmost cell of that color in the row), the cell is painted onto the canvas `O`.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
              mapply(lambda obj: {(color(obj), (i, min(j for _, (i, j) in obj if i == row))) 
                                  for row in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)}, 
                     fgpartition(I)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates a blank canvas (`O`) with the background color and size of the input (`I`). 
2. **Object Processing:** The core logic lies within the nested `mapply` and `lambda` functions. It iterates through each object (excluding background) in the input grid (`fgpartition(I)`).
3. **Leftmost Extraction:** For each row within an object, it finds the leftmost cell (minimum `j`) and stores its color and coordinates.
4. **Painting:**  The `mapply` function collects these leftmost cells from all objects and paints them onto the initially blank canvas.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    leftmost_indices = mfilter(lambda cell: cell[1][1] == leftmost(sfilter(obj, lambda x: x[1][0] == cell[1][0])), obj)
    O = paint(O, leftmost_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas (`O`) filled with the input's background color and having the same dimensions.
2. **Object-wise Iteration:** Iterates through each object in the foreground of the input image (`fgpartition(I)`).
3. **Leftmost Identification:** For each object, it identifies the leftmost cells by filtering the object's cells based on the condition that their column index (`j`) matches the leftmost column index in their respective row.
4. **Painting:** Finally, it paints the identified leftmost cells onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    for (v, (i, j)) in obj:
      if j != leftmost(sfilter(obj, lambda x: x[1][0] == i)):
        O = paint(O, {(mostcolor(I), (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Modification:** It starts by directly copying the input grid (`I`) to the output (`O`).
2. **Object and Cell Iteration:** It iterates through each foreground object (`fgpartition(I)`) and then through each cell (`(v, (i, j))`) of the object.
3. **Leftmost Comparison and Overwrite:** For each cell, it checks if its column index `j` is different from the leftmost column index of cells with the same row index `i` within that object. If it's not the leftmost, the cell is overwritten with the background color on the output grid (`O`).
