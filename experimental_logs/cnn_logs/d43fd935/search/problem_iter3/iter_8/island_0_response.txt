## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation for all input-output pairs can be described as follows:

**For each unique object (connected component of same-colored cells) in the input grid:**

1. **Identify the rightmost cell** of the object.
2. **Create a vertical line** extending downwards from the rightmost cell to the bottom edge of the grid.
3. **Paint this vertical line** with the color of the object.

Let's illustrate with an example from Input_0:

* The top-left "1 1" forms an object. Its rightmost cell is at (0,1). A vertical line is drawn downwards from this cell, resulting in the column of "1"s in the output.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions in the provided DSL to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Identify connected components
  rightmost_cells = mapply(lambda obj: (color(obj), (lrcorner(obj)[0], lrcorner(obj)[1])), objs)  # Get rightmost cell of each object
  vertical_lines = mapply(lambda cell: frozenset({(cell[0], (i, cell[1][1])) for i in range(cell[1][0], height(I))}), rightmost_cells)  # Create vertical lines
  O = paint(cover(I, asindices(I)), merge(vertical_lines)) # Paint lines on blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, T, F, T)`:  Identifies connected components (objects) in the grid.
2. `mapply(lambda obj: (color(obj), (lrcorner(obj)[0], lrcorner(obj)[1])), objs)`:  Finds the rightmost cell (using `lrcorner`) and its color for each object.
3. `mapply(lambda cell: frozenset({(cell[0], (i, cell[1][1])) for i in range(cell[1][0], height(I))}), rightmost_cells)`: For each rightmost cell, generates a vertical line of indices extending downwards.
4. `paint(cover(I, asindices(I)), merge(vertical_lines))`: Paints the vertical lines onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = cover(I, asindices(I))  # Start with a blank canvas
  for j in range(width(I)):  # Iterate over each column
    for i in range(height(I)):  # Iterate over each row in the column
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):  # If cell is not background
        O = paint(O, frozenset({(I[i][j], (k, j)) for k in range(i, height(I))}))  # Draw a vertical line from this cell downwards
        break  # Move to the next column
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. `cover(I, asindices(I))`: Creates a blank canvas.
2.  Iterates through each column, and within each column, iterates through rows.
3. `if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I)`: Checks if the current cell is not the background color.
4.  `paint(O, frozenset({(I[i][j], (k, j)) for k in range(i, height(I))}))`: If a non-background cell is found, draws a vertical line downwards from that cell using its color.
5. `break`:  Stops processing the current column and moves to the next.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def rightmost_cell_in_column(j, obj):
    return any((i, j) in toindices(obj) for i in range(height(I)))
  
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = cover(I, asindices(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for obj in objs:
      if rightmost_cell_in_column(j, obj):
        color_ = color(obj)
        O = paint(O, frozenset({(color_, (i, j)) for i in range(height(I))}))
        break 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `rightmost_cell_in_column`: This helper function checks if an object has its rightmost cell in a given column.
2.  Similar to version 2, it iterates through columns and objects.
3.  Uses `rightmost_cell_in_column` to check if the current object's rightmost cell is in the current column.
4. If found, it paints the entire column with the object's color.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def vertical_line_from(cell):
    return frozenset({(cell[0], (i, cell[1][1])) for i in range(cell[1][0], height(I))})
  
  rightmost_cells = mfilter(lambda obj: len(obj) > 0, apply(lambda obj: {(color(obj), urcorner(obj))}, objects(I, T, F, T)))
  vertical_lines = apply(vertical_line_from, rightmost_cells)
  O = paint(cover(I, asindices(I)), merge(vertical_lines)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `vertical_line_from`:  Helper function to generate vertical line indices from a given cell.
2.  Identifies rightmost cells of objects using `urcorner` and filters out empty objects.
3.  Applies `vertical_line_from` to each rightmost cell to generate line indices.
4. Paints the lines onto a blank canvas.


**Program Version 5**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
      for j in range(width(I)-1, -1, -1):
          if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
              O = paint(cover(O, ((i, j), (height(I)-1, j))), I[i][j])
              break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Iterates through each row and within each row, iterates through columns from right to left.
2. `if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I)`:  Finds the first non-background color cell in the row.
3. `paint(cover(O, ((i, j), (height(I)-1, j))), I[i][j])`: Creates a vertical line downwards from that cell to the bottom of the grid, overwriting any existing cells.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation. They utilize various DSL functions and demonstrate flexibility in solving the problem.
