## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves taking each unique object (defined as a group of connected, same-valued digits), identifying its leftmost column, and then redrawing the object in a single vertical line starting from the topmost cell in that leftmost column. 

**Let's break down the transformation for each example:**

* **Input_0:** The '1' objects are moved to the leftmost column and drawn downwards. The '6' objects follow the same logic. The '3' object is consolidated into a vertical line starting at its top leftmost position.
* **Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0, all objects ('7', '8', and '3') are moved to their respective leftmost columns and drawn downwards.
* **Input_2:**  Again, the objects ('1', and '3') are consolidated into vertical lines starting at their top leftmost positions.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Iterates over each object, finds its topmost row and leftmost column, 
  and paints a vertical line from the topmost position in the leftmost column. 
  """
  J = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    top_i = uppermost(obj)
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
    for i in range(top_i, height(I)):
      J = paint(J, {(color(obj), (i, leftmost_j))}) 
  return J
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas (`J`) of the same size and background color as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Object Iteration:** Loops through each object found in the input grid.
3. **Finding Extremes:**  For each object, it determines the topmost row index (`top_i`) and the leftmost column index (`leftmost_j`).
4. **Vertical Painting:** Draws a vertical line of the object's color from the `top_i` downwards in the `leftmost_j` column. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Utilizes recolor and set comprehension to efficiently create the transformed objects.
  """
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), 
      merge({recolor(color(obj), {(i, leftmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), height(I))}) 
             for obj in objects(I, True, False, False)})
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization and Painting:** Similar to version 1, it creates a canvas and uses `paint` to draw on it.
2. **Set Comprehension:** Efficiently generates a set of transformed objects. For each object in the input:
    - `recolor` changes the indices to form a vertical line at the leftmost column.
    - The line extends from the topmost row to the bottom of the grid. 
3. **Merging and Painting:** Merges all transformed objects and paints them onto the canvas. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Constructs new objects by mapping over existing object indices. 
  """
  new_objs = []
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    min_j = leftmost(obj)
    new_obj = {(color(obj), (i, min_j)) for i, _ in toindices(obj)}
    new_objs.append(new_obj)
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(new_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Creates an empty list (`new_objs`) to store the transformed objects and an empty canvas.
2. **Object Transformation:** Iterates over each object and creates a new object (`new_obj`) where all cells are shifted to the leftmost column (`min_j`) while maintaining their original row index.
3. **Painting:** Merges all `new_objs` and paints them onto the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Uses functional programming paradigm with apply and rbind for a different approach. 
  """
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)),
      merge(apply(
          lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), {(i, leftmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), height(I))}),
          objects(I, True, False, False)
      ))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization and Painting:**  Similar to previous versions.
2. **Functional Approach:**  
    - `apply` applies a lambda function to each object from `objects(I, True, False, False)`.
    - The lambda function uses `recolor` to transform the object into a vertical line at the leftmost column. 
3. **Merging:** Merges the transformed objects.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Iterates over every cell in the grid and paints non-background cells 
  to their corresponding row in the first column.
  """
  output = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcommon(I):
        output = paint(output, {(index(I, (i, j)), (i, 0))})
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas.
2. **Cell Iteration:** Iterates through each cell in the input grid.
3. **Conditional Painting:** If a cell is not the background color:
    - Retrieves its color using `index`.
    - Paints a cell of that color at the same row (`i`) but in the first column (`0`) of the output grid.

These five versions showcase diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation. Each utilizes different functions and strategies from the DSL, highlighting the flexibility and expressive power of the provided programming language.
