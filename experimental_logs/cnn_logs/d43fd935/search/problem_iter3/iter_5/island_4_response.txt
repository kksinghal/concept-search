## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place involves moving the leftmost cell of each distinct object (excluding the background color) to the leftmost column of the grid, while maintaining its original row position. The remaining cells of each object are removed.

**Example Breakdown:**

- **Input_0:** The leftmost '1' of the top-left object is moved to (0,0).  The leftmost '3' of the middle object is moved to (3,0). The leftmost '6's of the various '6' objects are moved to (2,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0).

- **Input_1 & Input_2:**  The same logic is applied. The leftmost cell of each object (excluding background color) is identified and moved to the leftmost column while maintaining its row position.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(grid):
  processed_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)) # Create a blank canvas
  for obj in fgpartition(grid): # Iterate over each foreground object
    leftmost_index = argmin(toindices(obj), lambda x: x[1]) # Find the index of the leftmost cell
    processed_grid = paint(processed_grid, { # Paint the leftmost cell onto the canvas
        (color(obj), (leftmost_index[0], 0)) 
    })
  return processed_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** A blank canvas with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid is created.
2. **Iterate & Identify:** The program iterates through each foreground object in the input grid and identifies the index of its leftmost cell using `argmin` and a lambda function to find the minimum column value.
3. **Paint:** The leftmost cell is then painted onto the canvas at the same row position but in the first column.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(grid):
  output_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)) # Blank canvas
  for i, row in enumerate(grid): # Iterate through rows
    for j, value in enumerate(row): # Iterate through columns
      if value != mostcolor(grid): # If not background color
        output_grid = paint(output_grid, {(value, (i, 0))}) # Paint to leftmost column
        break # Move to next row
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** Similar to version 1, a blank canvas is created.
2. **Row-wise Iteration:**  The program iterates through each row and then each cell in the row.
3. **Leftmost Cell Detection & Painting:**  If a cell doesn't contain the background color, it's considered a leftmost cell of an object. This cell's value is painted onto the canvas at the same row but in the first column. The inner loop then breaks to avoid painting other cells of the same object in that row.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple( # Construct output grid tuple
      tuple( # Construct each row
          next((v for v in r if v != mostcolor(grid)), mostcolor(grid)) # Find first non-background color or use background color if none found
          for _ in range(1) # Take only one element (the leftmost)
      ) + tuple(mostcolor(grid) for _ in range(width(grid)-1)) # Fill the rest of the row with background
      for r in grid # Iterate over each row
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Tuple Construction:**  This version directly constructs the output grid as a nested tuple.
2. **Leftmost Color Selection:** For each row, it finds the first non-background color using a generator expression. If none is found, it defaults to the background color.
3. **Row Assembly:**  It takes only this first (leftmost) color and combines it with a tuple of the background color repeated to fill the remaining columns of the row.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = shape(grid) # Get grid dimensions
  return tuple( # Construct output grid
      tuple(
          grid[i][j] if j == min([idx for idx, val in enumerate(row) if val != mostcolor(grid)] + [w]) else mostcolor(grid)
          for j in range(w)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(grid)
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Dimensions & Tuple:** Similar to other versions, it starts with a blank canvas.
2. **Find Leftmost Index:** For each row, it finds the index of the leftmost non-background color. If no foreground color is found, it defaults to the grid width (which is an invalid index) to ensure the background color is used.
3. **Conditional Painting:** It then iterates through each cell in the row and paints the cell with the original color if its index matches the leftmost index; otherwise, it uses the background color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      v if j == next((idx for idx, val in enumerate(row) if val != mostcolor(grid)), len(row)) else mostcolor(grid)
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for row in grid
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Construction:** This version constructs the output grid directly using nested generators.
2. **Leftmost Index with Generator:** For each row, it uses a generator expression to find the index of the first non-background color.  If none are found, it defaults to the row length, ensuring the background color is used.
3. **Conditional Value:**  It iterates through each cell and its value in the row and uses the cell's value if its index matches the found index; otherwise, it uses the background color.


These are five distinct program versions using different DSL functions and logic to achieve the same transformation. Each version demonstrates a different approach to problem-solving within the constraints of the provided DSL.
