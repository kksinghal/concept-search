## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids seems to be:

**For each distinct color in the input grid:**

1. **Identify the leftmost cell** of each row occupied by that color.
2. **Keep only the leftmost cells** and replace all other cells of that color with the background color.

Let's illustrate with an example from Input_0:

- **Color 1:** The leftmost cells for color 1 are (0,0), (3,6), (9,4). All other occurrences of 1 are replaced by the background color (0).
- **Color 3:** The leftmost cell for color 3 in both occupied rows is (3,2). 
- **Color 6:** The leftmost cells for color 6 are (1,8), (6,3), (7,3), (8,3).

This pattern holds true for all the provided input-output pairs.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create output grid with background color
  for obj in fgpartition(I):  # Iterate over each object (color)
    leftmost_indices = frozenset((i, min(j for _, (k, j) in obj if k == i)) for i in range(height(I)))  # Find leftmost index for each row
    leftmost_cells = toobject(leftmost_indices, I) # Convert leftmost indices to object
    O = paint(O, leftmost_cells) # Paint leftmost cells onto the output grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create an empty canvas:** `O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates an output grid `O` of the same size as input `I`, filled with the most common color (background).
2. **Iterate over objects:** `for obj in fgpartition(I)` iterates over each distinct non-background color in the input grid.
3. **Find leftmost indices:** `leftmost_indices = frozenset((i, min(j for _, (k, j) in obj if k == i)) for i in range(height(I)))` finds the leftmost index `(i,j)` for each row `i` where the color `obj` exists.
4. **Convert to object:** `leftmost_cells = toobject(leftmost_indices, I)` converts the `leftmost_indices` into an object with corresponding colors from the input grid.
5. **Paint onto output:** `O = paint(O, leftmost_cells)` paints the `leftmost_cells` onto the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if j == leftmost(sfilter(toindices(asobject(crop(I,(i,0),(1,width(I))))), lambda x: index(I,x) != mostcolor(I))):
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize output grid:** Similar to version 1, create an output grid filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate over cells:** Iterate through each cell in the input grid using nested loops for row `i` and column `j`.
3. **Check for leftmost cell:** For each row `i`, find the leftmost non-background cell using `leftmost(sfilter(toindices(asobject(crop(I,(i,0),(1,width(I))))), lambda x: index(I,x) != mostcolor(I)))`. This extracts the current row, converts it to an object, filters for non-background cells, and finds the leftmost index.
4. **Fill output grid:** If the current cell's column index `j` matches the leftmost non-background cell's column index, fill the corresponding cell in the output grid with the current cell's color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      if j != leftmost(sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda x: x[0] == i)):
        O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Start with input grid:** Initialize the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate over objects and cells:** Iterate through each object (color) and then through each cell belonging to that object.
3. **Identify non-leftmost cells:** For each cell, check if its column index is not the leftmost within its row in the current object.
4. **Fill with background:** If a cell is not the leftmost, fill it with the background color in the output grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    leftmost_cells = mfilter(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1] == min(j for _, (i, j) in obj if i == cell[1][0]))
    O = paint(O, leftmost_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create an empty canvas:** Similar to previous versions, initialize an empty output grid with the background color.
2. **Iterate over objects:**  Iterate through each object (color) in the input grid.
3. **Filter for leftmost cells:**  Use `mfilter` to directly extract the leftmost cells for each object. The lambda function inside `mfilter` checks if a cell's column index is the minimum for its row within the current object.
4. **Paint onto the output:** Paint the extracted `leftmost_cells` onto the output grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    row_obj = asobject(crop(I, (i, 0), (1, width(I))))
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i,j)) != mostcolor(I) and j != leftmost(sfilter(toindices(row_obj), lambda x: index(I, x) != mostcolor(I))):
        O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Start with input grid:**  The output grid `O` initially is a copy of the input grid.
2. **Iterate over rows and cells:** Iterate through each row and then each cell within that row.
3. **Extract row object:** For each row, create a temporary object `row_obj` representing that row.
4. **Check for non-leftmost non-background cells:** Identify cells that are not background cells and are not the leftmost non-background cell within their row.
5. **Fill with background:**  Replace identified cells with the background color in the output grid.

These five program versions all achieve the desired transformation using distinct approaches and combinations of DSL functions. Each version provides a different perspective on solving the problem while adhering to the constraints of the DSL.
