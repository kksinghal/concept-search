## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to "gather" the digits of each object towards their vertical center line. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:**

* The '1' objects are condensed to a single column, centered on their original vertical position. 
* The '3' object shifts its rightmost column leftwards to connect with the central column.
* The '6' objects see their left and right portions shift inwards to align with the central column.

**Pair 1:**

*  Similar to Pair 0, all objects ('7', '8', and '3') are condensed towards their vertical center, leaving a single column of each digit where applicable.

**Pair 2:**

* The isolated '1's and the '3' object behave as in the previous examples. The horizontally aligned '1's at the top and bottom remain unchanged, suggesting the transformation primarily affects vertically separated portions of objects.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve this transformation. Each version uses a different approach to identify and shift the object parts:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  center_j = width(I) // 2
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      for i in range(height(I)):
        if (j < center_j and index(I, (i, j)) == color(obj)) or (j > center_j and index(I, (i, width(I) - j + center_j - 1)) == color(obj)):
          O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas `O` of the same size as input `I`, filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Iterates through each object in the input.
3. **Iterate Cells:** For every cell in the input:
   - If the cell is left of the center and has the object's color, fill the same cell in the output.
   - If the cell is right of the center and its mirrored counterpart (across the center line) has the object's color, fill the current cell in the output.
4. **Return Output:** Return the transformed grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  center_j = width(I) // 2
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True):
    left_part = {(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < center_j}
    right_part = {(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j > center_j}
    if left_part and right_part:
      O = paint(cover(O, left_part), shift(left_part, (0, center_j - leftmost(left_part))))
      O = paint(cover(O, right_part), shift(right_part, (0, center_j - rightmost(right_part))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Starts with the output `O` being a copy of the input `I`.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Loops through each object.
3. **Split Object:** Divides the object into `left_part` and `right_part` based on their position relative to the center line.
4. **Shift and Paint:** If both parts exist, shifts each part horizontally to align its outermost column with the center line and paints it onto the output.
5. **Return Output:** Returns the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 3:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  c = width(I) // 2
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True):
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      if j < c:
        O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, j + c - leftmost(obj))})
      elif j > c:
        O = fill(O, index(I, (i, j)), {(i, j - (rightmost(obj) - c + 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Sets output `O` as a copy of input `I`, and finds the center column `c`.
2. **Iterate Objects and Cells:** Loops through each object and its cells' indices `(i, j)`.
3. **Conditional Shifting:** 
   - If a cell is left of the center (`j < c`), it's shifted rightward to align with the object's leftmost column and the center.
   - If a cell is right of the center (`j > c`), it's shifted leftward to align with the object's rightmost column and the center.
4. **Return Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  center_j = width(I) // 2
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      left_j = None
      right_j = None
      for j in range(width(I)):
        if index(I, (i, j)) == color(obj):
          if j < center_j and (left_j is None or j < left_j):
            left_j = j
          if j > center_j and (right_j is None or j > right_j):
            right_j = j
      if left_j is not None:
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, center_j - (center_j - left_j))})
      if right_j is not None:
        O = fill(O, color(obj), {(i, center_j + (right_j - center_j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas `O` filled with the background color of input `I`.
2. **Iterate Objects and Rows:** Loops through each object and each row in the grid.
3. **Find Extremes:** For each row, finds the leftmost (`left_j`) and rightmost (`right_j`) occurrences of the object's color.
4. **Conditional Filling:**
   - If `left_j` is found, fills the output at the mirrored position of `left_j` with respect to the center line.
   - If `right_j` is found, fills the output at the mirrored position of `right_j` with respect to the center line.
5. **Return Output:** Returns the filled canvas `O`.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  c = width(I) // 2
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=True):
      for x in range(width(obj) // 2):
        O = paint(cover(O, {(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j == leftmost(obj) + x}), shift({(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j == leftmost(obj) + x}, (0, c - leftmost(obj) - x)))
        O = paint(cover(O, {(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j == rightmost(obj) - x}), shift({(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j == rightmost(obj) - x}, (0, c - rightmost(obj) + x)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Starts with the output `O` being a copy of the input `I` and defines the center column `c`.
2. **Iterate Objects and Layers:**  Iterates through each object and each layer of columns from both the left and right edges towards the center.
3. **Shift and Paint Layers:** For each layer `x`:
   - Identifies the leftmost and rightmost columns of the object and shifts them to their respective mirrored positions across the center line.
   - Paints the shifted columns onto the output grid. 
4. **Return Output:**  Returns the transformed grid `O`.


These five programs offer distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation. Each leverages different DSL functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility and diversity possible within the provided programming language.
