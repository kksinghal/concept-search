## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as **"shifting all object pixels to the leftmost column while maintaining their row positions."**  The original shape of the object is irrelevant; all pixels are moved to create a single vertical line in the column where the leftmost pixel of the original object was located.

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 / Output_0:**

* The '1' objects are shifted to column 0.
* The '3' objects are shifted to column 2.
* The '6' objects are shifted to column 8.

**Input_1 / Output_1:**

* The '7' objects are shifted to column 1.
* The '3' objects are shifted to column 5.
* The '8' objects are shifted to column 6.

**Input_2 / Output_2:**

* The '1' objects are shifted to column 2.
* The '3' objects are shifted to column 4.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  J = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Initialize output grid
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    min_j = leftmost(obj) # Find leftmost column index
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      J = paint(J, {(color(obj), (i, min_j))})  # Paint at (i, min_j)
  return J
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** A canvas of the same shape as the input grid is created, filled with the most common color in the input.
2. **Object Iteration:** The program iterates over each object identified in the input grid.
3. **Leftmost Column Identification:**  For each object, the `leftmost` function determines the index of the leftmost column.
4. **Pixel Shifting:**  The program iterates over each cell belonging to the current object and paints the corresponding color at the same row (`i`) but in the `min_j` column.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  transformed = set()
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
    transformed.add(recolor(color(obj), {(i, leftmost_j) for i, _ in toindices(obj)}))
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(transformed)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  An empty set `transformed` will store the transformed objects, and a canvas of the same shape as the input, filled with the most common color, is initialized.
2. **Object Iteration:** The code iterates over each object in the input grid.
3. **Leftmost Column and Recoloring:** The `leftmost` function finds the leftmost column index. Then, the `recolor` function creates a new object with the same color as the original but with all its cells shifted to the `leftmost_j` column.
4. **Painting:**  The transformed objects are merged and painted onto the canvas to generate the output.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_objs = []
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    min_col = leftmost(obj)
    new_obj = {(color(obj), (i, min_col)) for i, _ in toindices(obj)}
    new_objs.append(new_obj)
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(new_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** An empty list `new_objs` will store the transformed objects, and a canvas of the same shape as the input grid, filled with the most common color, is initialized. 
2. **Object Iteration:** The code iterates over each object found in the input grid.
3. **Shifting to Leftmost Column:**  For each object, the `leftmost` function identifies the index of the leftmost column. A new object (`new_obj`) is created by shifting all cells of the current object to the `min_col` while keeping their row positions.
4. **Painting:**  Finally, all new objects are merged and painted onto the canvas to generate the output grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), 
               merge({recolor(color(obj), {(i, leftmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)}) 
                      for obj in objects(I, True, False, False)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization and Painting:** A canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the most common color, is created and will be painted upon directly.
2. **Object Iteration and Transformation:**  A set comprehension iterates over each object in the input grid. For each object, the `recolor` function generates a new object with the same color but with its pixels shifted to the leftmost column (`leftmost(obj)`) and spanning from the uppermost row (`uppermost(obj)`) to the lowermost row (`lowermost(obj)`) of the original object. 
3. **Merging and Output:**  The transformed objects are merged and painted onto the canvas in a single step to produce the output grid. 

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  output = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcommon(I):
        output = paint(output, {(index(I, (i, j)), (i, 0))})
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  A canvas of the same size as the input grid is initialized, filled with the most common color from the input.
2. **Grid Traversal:**  The program iterates over each cell of the input grid, column by column, and row by row.
3. **Pixel Shifting:** If a cell's color is not the background color, it means it belongs to an object. In this case, the color is painted onto the canvas at the same row but in the first column (column 0).

These five program versions provide distinct approaches to solving the transformation problem using the provided DSL, demonstrating a range of logic and function combinations.
