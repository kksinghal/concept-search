## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as **keeping only the leftmost non-background cell for each object in each row**. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The two '1' objects, the '3' object, and the '6' object are all reduced to their leftmost non-background cell in each row. 

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

*  Similar to Input_0, the '7' and '8' objects are reduced to their leftmost non-background cell in each row. The '3' object is only present in one row, so it remains unchanged.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* Again, all objects ('1' and '3') are reduced to their leftmost non-background cell in each row.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Initialize output as a copy of the input
  for i in range(height(I)):  # Iterate over each row
    leftmost_cell = None  # Track the leftmost non-background cell in the row
    for j in range(width(I)):  # Iterate over each column
      if index(I, (i,j)) != mostcolor(I):  # If the current cell is not background
        if leftmost_cell is None:  # If no leftmost cell found yet
          leftmost_cell = (i, j)  # Mark this cell as leftmost
        else:  # If a leftmost cell has been found
          O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(i, j)})  # Fill current cell with background
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create a copy of the input grid (`O`).
2. **Row Iteration:** Loop through each row of the grid.
3. **Leftmost Cell Tracking:** For each row, keep track of the leftmost non-background cell encountered.
4. **Background Filling:** If a non-background cell is encountered and a leftmost cell has already been marked for the row, fill the current cell with the background color. 
5. **Output:** Return the modified grid (`O`).


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Initialize an empty canvas
  for obj in fgpartition(I):  # Iterate through each object (without background)
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):  # Loop through rows of the object
      leftmost_j = min(j for _, (row, j) in obj if row == i) # Find leftmost cell in the row
      O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, leftmost_j))})  # Paint the leftmost cell onto the canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Create an empty canvas (`O`) filled with the background color, having the same dimensions as the input.
2. **Object Iteration:** Loop through each object in the input grid, excluding the background.
3. **Row-wise Leftmost Cell:** For each row within the object's bounding box, identify the leftmost cell belonging to the object.
4. **Painting:** Paint the leftmost cell of the object for the current row onto the canvas.
5. **Output:** Return the painted canvas (`O`).

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    row_obj = asobject(crop(I, (i, 0), (1, width(I))))  # Extract the current row as an object
    non_bg_indices = sfilter(toindices(row_obj), lambda x: index(I, x) != mostcolor(I))  # Get indices of non-background cells
    if non_bg_indices:  # If non-background cells exist
      leftmost_j = leftmost(non_bg_indices)  # Find the leftmost non-background cell
      O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(i, j) for j in range(leftmost_j + 1, width(I))}) # Fill everything to the right of it with background
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Start with the output grid (`O`) as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Row Iteration:** Loop through each row of the grid.
3. **Row Processing:** 
    * Extract the current row as an object.
    * Identify the indices of all non-background cells in the row.
    * If non-background cells exist, find the leftmost one and fill everything to its right with the background color in the output grid.
4. **Output:** Return the modified grid (`O`).

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in fgpartition(I):  # Iterate through objects
    leftmost_cells = set()
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      row_indices = [j for _, (row, j) in obj if row == i]
      if row_indices:  # If the object has cells in this row
        leftmost_cells.add((i, min(row_indices)))
    O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), toindices(obj) - frozenset(leftmost_cells)) # Fill all but the leftmost cells with background
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Initialize the output grid (`O`) as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Object Iteration:** Loop through each object (excluding the background) in the grid.
3. **Leftmost Cell Identification:** For each row within the object's bounding box, determine if the object occupies any cells in that row. If so, add the leftmost cell's index to a set (`leftmost_cells`).
4. **Selective Filling:** After processing all rows of an object, fill all cells belonging to the object except the identified leftmost cells with the background color in the output grid.
5. **Output:** Return the modified grid (`O`).

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Initialize an empty canvas
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        if not any(index(I, (i, k)) != mostcolor(I) for k in range(j)):  # Check if there's no non-background cell to the left in the same row
          O = paint(O, {(index(I, (i, j)), (i, j))})  # Paint the cell onto the canvas if it's the leftmost
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Create an empty canvas (`O`) filled with the background color and having the same size as the input grid.
2. **Grid Traversal:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
3. **Leftmost Non-background Check:** For each non-background cell, check if any other non-background cell exists to its left within the same row.
4. **Conditional Painting:** If the current cell is the leftmost non-background cell in its row, paint it onto the canvas.
5. **Output:** Return the canvas (`O`) containing only the leftmost non-background cells.

These five versions provide different approaches to achieve the same transformation, each employing a distinct combination of DSL functions and logic. Remember to test each version thoroughly to ensure it correctly handles various input grids and edge cases.
