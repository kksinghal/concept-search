## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving all non-background digits within each object to the rightmost column of that object. This effectively "right justifies" the objects within their bounding box, leaving the rest of the grid filled with the background color. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input 0:**

* The "1" objects are right-justified, leaving a single "1" in the rightmost column of each original object.
* The "3" object is right-justified, filling the rightmost two columns.
* The "6" objects are right-justified, leaving a single "6" in the rightmost column of each original object.

**Input 1:**

*  Similar right-justification is applied to "7", "8", and "3" objects.

**Input 2:**

*  Right-justification is applied to "1" and "3" objects. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions for "Program_to_be_generated":

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(bg, shape(grid))
  for obj in fgpartition(grid):
    rightmost_col = rightmost(obj)
    new_obj = {(v, (i, rightmost_col)) for v, (i, j) in obj}
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, new_obj)
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background:** Determine the background color (most frequent) in the grid.
2. **Initialize Canvas:** Create a new grid filled with the background color, having the same dimensions as the input grid.
3. **Iterate Through Objects:** Loop through each object (connected component of non-background colors).
4. **Find Rightmost Column:** Determine the rightmost column index of the current object.
5. **Construct Right-Justified Object:** Create a new object where all cells are moved to the rightmost column, preserving their row positions.
6. **Paint Object:** Paint the new, right-justified object onto the canvas.
7. **Return Transformed Grid:** Return the newly constructed grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      bg if j < width(grid[0]) - row.count(v) else v 
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    ) 
    for i, row in enumerate(grid)
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background:** Determine the background color (most frequent) in the grid.
2. **Iterate Through Rows:** Loop through each row in the grid.
3. **Iterate Through Cells in Row:** For each cell in the row, check if its column index is less than the total width minus the count of the cell's value in the row. 
4. **Fill Cell:** If the condition in step 3 is true, fill the cell with the background color; otherwise, keep the original cell value. 
5. **Return Transformed Grid:** Return the modified grid with right-justified objects.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  return tuple(
    tuple(v for v in r[::-1] if v != bg) + tuple(bg for _ in range(len(grid[0]) - len(tuple(v for v in r[::-1] if v != bg))))
    for r in grid
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background:** Find the most common color, which represents the background.
2. **Iterate Through Rows:** Loop through each row of the input grid.
3. **Process Each Row:** For each row, reverse it and filter out the background color. Then, extend the filtered row with the background color to match the original row length.
4. **Construct New Grid:** Create a new grid from the processed rows. 
5. **Return Transformed Grid:** Return the new grid with right-justified objects.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(bg, shape(grid))
  for i in range(height(grid)):
    values = [v for v in grid[i] if v != bg]
    for j, v in enumerate(values):
      new_grid = fill(new_grid, v, {(i, len(grid[0]) - len(values) + j)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background:** Determine the background color of the input grid.
2. **Initialize Canvas:** Create a new grid filled with the background color, having the same dimensions as the input grid.
3. **Iterate Through Rows:**  Loop through each row in the input grid.
4. **Extract Non-Background Values:**  Collect all non-background values from the current row.
5. **Place Values in Rightmost Columns:** Place the extracted values in the rightmost columns of the corresponding row in the new grid.
6. **Return Transformed Grid:** Return the new grid with right-justified objects.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  return tuple(tuple(
    branch(j >= len(row) - row.count(v), v, bg) 
    for j, v in enumerate(row)
    ) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background:** Find the background color (most frequent) in the input grid.
2. **Iterate Through Rows:** Loop through each row of the input grid.
3. **Iterate Through Cells in Row:**  For each cell in the row, check if its column index is greater than or equal to the difference between the row's length and the count of that cell's value in the row.
4. **Conditional Cell Filling:** If the condition in step 3 is true, keep the cell's original value. Otherwise, fill the cell with the background color.
5. **Return Transformed Grid:** Return the modified grid with right-justified objects.
