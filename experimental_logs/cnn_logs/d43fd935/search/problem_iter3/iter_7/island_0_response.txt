## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

* **Keep only the rightmost element of each connected component (object) in the input grid.** 
* **All other elements of the object are replaced with the background color.**

Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The rightmost '1' of each connected component of '1's is kept, the rest are replaced by '0'. 
* The rightmost '6' of each connected component of '6's is kept, the rest are replaced by '0'.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

*  This logic applies to all digits (7, 8, 3) in the grid.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

*  Again, the same logic is consistently applied.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each inspired by the provided examples but with improvements to achieve the desired zero-score transformation.

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Identify connected components
  rightmost_cells = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset({(color(obj), urcorner(obj))}), objs) # Find rightmost cell of each object
  covered_grid = cover(I, asindices(I)) # Create a blank canvas with background color
  O = paint(covered_grid, merge(rightmost_cells)) # Paint rightmost cells onto the canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identify all connected components (objects) in the input grid `I`.
2. **`rightmost_cells = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset({(color(obj), urcorner(obj))}), objs)`:**  For each object, find its upper-right corner (`urcorner`), which represents the rightmost cell due to the row-wise scanning nature of the `objects` function. 
3. **`covered_grid = cover(I, asindices(I))`:** Create a new grid filled with the background color by "covering" the input grid with itself.
4. **`O = paint(covered_grid, merge(rightmost_cells))`:** Paint the rightmost cells of each object onto the blank canvas (`covered_grid`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I # Initialize output as input
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T): # Iterate over connected components
    for cell in obj: # Iterate over cells in each object
      if cell[1] != urcorner(obj): # If cell is not the rightmost cell 
        O = paint(O, {(mostcolor(I), cell[1])}) # Replace the cell with background color
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initialize the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):`:** Iterate through each connected component (object) in the input grid.
3. **`for cell in obj:`:**  Iterate through each cell within the current object.
4. **`if cell[1] != urcorner(obj):`:** Check if the cell's index is not equal to the upper-right corner index of the object.
5. **`O = paint(O, {(mostcolor(I), cell[1])})`:** If the cell is not the rightmost, replace it with the background color in the output grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create blank canvas with background color
  for j in range(width(I)): # Iterate over columns from right to left
    for i in range(height(I)): # Iterate over rows 
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I): # If cell is not background color
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i,j))}) # Paint the cell onto the output grid
        break # Move to the next column
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Create a blank canvas `O` of the same size as the input grid `I` and fill it with the background color.
2. **`for j in range(width(I)):`:** Iterate through each column of the input grid from right to left.
3. **`for i in range(height(I)):`:** Iterate through each row within the current column.
4. **`if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):`:** Check if the current cell's color is not the background color.
5. **`O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i,j))})`:** Paint the cell onto the output canvas at the same location.
6. **`break`:** Exit the inner loop (rows) and move to the next column to avoid overwriting.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Identify connected components
  rightmost_cells = apply(lambda obj: extract(obj, lambda c: c[1][1] == rightmost(obj)), objs) # Extract rightmost cell from each object
  O = paint(cover(I, asindices(I)), merge(rightmost_cells)) # Paint rightmost cells onto a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identify all connected components (objects) in the input grid.
2. **`rightmost_cells = apply(lambda obj: extract(obj, lambda c: c[1][1] == rightmost(obj)), objs)`:**  This line finds the rightmost cell in each object by using the `extract` function. It iterates through each object and extracts the cell whose column index (`c[1][1]`) is equal to the rightmost column index (`rightmost(obj)`) of that object.
3. **`O = paint(cover(I, asindices(I)), merge(rightmost_cells))`:**  This line first creates a blank canvas by "covering" the input grid with itself, effectively filling it with the background color. Then, it "paints" the extracted rightmost cells from all objects onto this blank canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def rightmost_filter(cell, obj): 
    return cell[1] == urcorner(obj) 
  rightmost_cells = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(obj, rbind(rightmost_filter, obj)), objects(I, T, F, T)) # Keep only rightmost cells in each object
  O = paint(cover(I, asindices(I)), merge(rightmost_cells)) # Paint rightmost cells onto a blank canvas
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def rightmost_filter(cell, obj): ...`:** Defines a helper function `rightmost_filter` that takes a cell and an object as input and returns `True` if the cell is the rightmost cell of the object, otherwise `False`. 
2. **`rightmost_cells = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(obj, rbind(rightmost_filter, obj)), objects(I, T, F, T))`**: Identifies and keeps only the rightmost cells within each object. It first identifies all objects in the input grid. Then, for each object, it filters its cells to keep only the rightmost cell.
3.  **`O = paint(cover(I, asindices(I)), merge(rightmost_cells))`:**  Similar to previous versions, this line first creates a blank canvas and then paints only the rightmost cells of all objects onto this canvas.

These are just five examples, and you can explore other combinations and logic within the DSL to achieve the same result. The key is to understand the underlying transformation and utilize the available functions effectively.
