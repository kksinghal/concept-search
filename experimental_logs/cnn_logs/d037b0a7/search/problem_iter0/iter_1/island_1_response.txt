## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending the rightmost object in each row downwards to the bottom of the grid. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The rightmost object in the first row is the '6'. It is extended downwards to fill the cells below it.
- The rightmost object in the second row is the '4'. It is extended downwards to fill the cell below it.
- The third row remains unchanged as the '3' is already extending to the bottom.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The rightmost object in the first row is the '2'. It is extended downwards to fill the cells below it.
- The rightmost object in the second row is the '8'. It is extended downwards to fill the cell below it.
- The third row remains unchanged as it only contains the background color.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- The rightmost object in the first row is the '0' (background). It remains unchanged.
- The rightmost object in the second row is the '2'. It is extended downwards to fill the cell below it.
- The third row remains unchanged as it only contains the background color.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code in the provided DSL:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Initialize output as input
  for i in range(len(I) - 1): # Iterate through rows except the last
    row = I[i]
    rightmost_color = last(row) # Find the color of the rightmost object
    if rightmost_color != mostcommon(I): # If it's not background
      for j in range(i + 1, len(I)): # Iterate through rows below
        O = fill(O, rightmost_color, {(j, len(row) - 1)}) # Fill the rightmost cell with the color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:**  The code iterates through each row of the grid except the last one.
2. **Identify rightmost object:** It identifies the color of the rightmost object in the current row.
3. **Extend downwards:** If the identified color is not the background color, the code fills the rightmost cells in all rows below with this color.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Get all objects
  rightmost_objs = argmax(objs, lambda obj: rightmost(obj)) # Get rightmost objects in each row
  extension = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset({(i, rightmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj) + 1, len(I))}), rightmost_objs) # Generate extension indices
  O = paint(I, merge(extension))  # Paint extensions onto the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** The code identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Find rightmost objects:** It then finds the rightmost object within each row.
3. **Generate extension indices:** For each rightmost object, it generates a set of indices extending downwards from the object's bottom edge to the bottom of the grid.
4. **Paint extensions:** Finally, it paints these extensions onto the original grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(len(I[0])): # Iterate through columns
    last_seen_color = I[-1][j] # Start with the color in the bottom row
    for i in range(len(I) - 2, -1, -1): # Iterate upwards through rows
      current_color = I[i][j]
      if current_color != mostcommon(I): # If not background
        last_seen_color = current_color # Update last seen color
      O = fill(O, last_seen_color, {(i, j)}) # Fill current cell with last seen color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns:** This version iterates through each column of the grid.
2. **Track last seen color:** It keeps track of the last non-background color encountered in each column, starting from the bottom row. 
3. **Fill upwards:** It then iterates upwards through each row in the column and fills each cell with the last seen non-background color. 

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = len(I)
  w = len(I[0])
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), (h, w)) # Create empty canvas
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w - 1, -1, -1): # Iterate backwards through columns
      if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I): # If not background
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(k, j) for k in range(i, h)}) # Fill downwards from current cell
        break # Move to next row
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create empty canvas:** This version first creates an empty canvas filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate backwards through columns:** It then iterates through each row and then backwards through each column. 
3. **Find first non-background:**  It identifies the first non-background color encountered in each row.
4. **Fill downwards:** From the identified cell, it fills downwards to the bottom of the grid with that color.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = tuple(tuple(I[k][j] if k >= i and I[i][j] != mostcommon(I) else I[k][j] for j in range(len(I[0]))) for i in range(len(I)) for k in range(len(I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Nested loops:** Uses nested loops to iterate through rows and columns.
2. **Conditional Filling:** Fills cell (k, j) with the color of cell (i, j) if k >= i and the color of cell (i, j) is not the background color.
3. **Tuple Construction:** Constructs the output grid as a tuple of tuples using the conditionally filled values.

Each version of the program utilizes a different approach and combination of functions to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
