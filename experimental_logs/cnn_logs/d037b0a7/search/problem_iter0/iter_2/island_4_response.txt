## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending the rightmost non-background color of each row downwards to fill the background cells. 

**Input_0:**
* The rightmost non-background color in row 1 is 4. It is extended downwards to fill the background cell in row 2.
* The rightmost non-background color in row 0 is 6. It is extended downwards to fill the background cell in row 1 and row 2.

**Input_1:**
* The rightmost non-background color in row 0 is 2. It remains unchanged as there are no background cells below it.
* The rightmost non-background color in row 1 is 8. It is extended downwards to fill the background cell in row 2.

**Input_2:**
* The rightmost non-background color in row 0 is 4. It is extended downwards to fill the background cells in row 1 and row 2. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I) - 1):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1, -1, -1):
      if O[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        fill_color = O[i][j]
        for k in range(i + 1, height(I)):
          if O[k][j] == mostcolor(I):
            O = fill(O, fill_color, {(k, j)})
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** The outer loop iterates through each row of the grid except the last one.
2. **Find rightmost non-background color:** The inner loop iterates through each cell in the row from right to left, stopping at the first non-background color.
3. **Extend color downwards:** For each cell below the current cell, if it's a background color, fill it with the identified non-background color. 
4. **Break inner loop:** Once the color is extended, break the inner loop to move to the next row.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I) - 1):
    rightmost_color = extract(I[i], lambda x: x != mostcolor(I))
    if rightmost_color is not None:
      O = fill(O, rightmost_color, {(j, width(I) - 1) for j in range(i + 1, height(I))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:**  The loop iterates through each row of the grid except the last one.
2. **Extract rightmost color:**  Find the rightmost non-background color in the current row using `extract`.
3. **Fill downwards:** If a non-background color is found, fill all cells below it in the last column with that color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
    if rightmost(obj) == width(I) - 1:
      fill_color = color(obj)
      O = fill(O, fill_color, {(i, rightmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj) + 1, height(I))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** Iterate through each object in the grid (excluding background).
2. **Check rightmost position:** If the object touches the right edge of the grid, proceed.
3. **Fill downwards:** Fill all cells below the object in the last column with the object's color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
  return vconcat(tophalf(I), paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), (height(I) // 2, width(I))), asobject(bottomhalf(replace(I, mostcolor(I), last(sfilter(I[-1], lambda x: x != mostcolor(I))))))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Split and replace:** Split the grid horizontally. In the bottom half, replace background cells with the rightmost non-background color of the last row.
2. **Create canvas:** Create a canvas filled with the background color, having the same dimensions as the bottom half.
3. **Paint and concatenate:** Paint the modified bottom half onto the canvas. Concatenate the top half and the painted canvas vertically to get the final output.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for i in range(height(I) - 1):
      if O[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and O[i + 1][j] == mostcolor(I):
        O = fill(O, O[i][j], {(k, j) for k in range(i + 1, height(I))})
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns:** The outer loop iterates through each column of the grid.
2. **Find first non-background color:** The inner loop iterates through each cell in the column from top to bottom, looking for a non-background color followed by a background color.
3. **Fill downwards:** If such a pattern is found, fill all cells below with the identified non-background color and break the inner loop.
