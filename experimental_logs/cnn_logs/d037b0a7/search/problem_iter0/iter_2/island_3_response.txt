## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation involves expanding the color '4' downwards and rightwards, replacing any '0's it encounters.  '3' and '6' remain unchanged.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  The digit '7' expands downwards, replacing only '0's. Other digits remain unchanged.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** Similar to the previous transformations, the digit '4' expands downwards, replacing only '0's. Other digits are preserved.

## Code Generation:

The common theme in these transformations is the expansion of a specific color (determined from the input-output pair) downwards and sometimes rightwards, overwriting only the background color (generally '0'). Let's call the expanding color the "dominant color" and the background color the "recessive color".

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_6455b5f5(I):
    dom_color = leastcolor(remove(mostcommon(I), I))  # Find dominant color 
    rec_color = mostcommon(I)  # Find recessive color
    dom_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), dom_color)) # Find the object with dominant color
    expansion = toindices(dom_obj)
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    for i, j in toindices(dom_obj):
        for di in range(i + 1, h):
            if I[di][j] == rec_color:
                expansion = insert((di, j), expansion)
        for dj in range(j + 1, w):
            if I[i][dj] == rec_color:
                expansion = insert((i, dj), expansion)
    O = fill(I, dom_color, expansion)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify dominant and recessive colors:** `leastcolor` and `mostcommon` are used to determine the dominant and recessive colors based on their frequencies.
2. **Find the dominant object:** `objects` identifies all objects, `colorfilter` selects those with the dominant color, and `first` picks one such object.
3. **Expand downwards and rightwards:** The loop iterates over the dominant object's cells. For each cell, it expands downwards and rightwards, adding indices of recessive colored cells to the `expansion` set.
4. **Fill the expansion:** `fill` is used to color the `expansion` indices with the dominant color, resulting in the final output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_6455b5f5(I):
    dom_color = leastcolor(difference(I, {mostcolor(I)})) # Find dominant color
    O = I
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] == dom_color:
                for k in range(i + 1, len(I)):
                    if O[k][j] == 0:
                        O = fill(O, dom_color, {(k, j)}) 
                for l in range(j + 1, len(I[0])):
                    if O[i][l] == 0:
                        O = fill(O, dom_color, {(i, l)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify dominant color:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Iterate and Expand:**  Iterate through the grid, and upon finding the dominant color, expands it downwards and rightwards, overwriting only '0's.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_6455b5f5(I):
    dom_color = leastcolor(remove(mostcommon(I), I)) 
    expansion = set()
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if value == dom_color:
                expansion |= {(i + k, j) for k in range(1, len(I) - i) if I[i + k][j] == 0}
                expansion |= {(i, j + k) for k in range(1, len(row) - j) if I[i][j + k] == 0}
    O = fill(I, dom_color, frozenset(expansion))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify dominant color:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Iterate and Expand:**  Iterate through the grid. Upon finding the dominant color, expand downwards and rightwards using set comprehension, adding indices of '0's to the `expansion` set.
3. **Fill the expansion:** `fill` colors the `expansion` indices with the dominant color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_6455b5f5(I):
    dom_color = leastcolor(difference(I, {mostcolor(I)})) 
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
        if color(obj) == dom_color:
            for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
                I = fill(I, dom_color, {(k, j) for k in range(i, len(I)) if I[k][j] == 0})
                I = fill(I, dom_color, {(i, l) for l in range(j, len(I[0])) if I[i][l] == 0})
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify dominant color:** Same as Version 2.
2. **Find and Expand Dominant Objects:**  Find all objects in the grid using `objects` and iteratively expand the object with the dominant color downwards and rightwards.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_6455b5f5(I):
  dom_color = leastcolor(remove(mostcommon(I), I))
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, dom_color), I)
  indices = toindices(obj)
  for (i, j) in indices:
    vfrontier = {(k, j) for k in range(i, len(I))}
    hfrontier = {(i, k) for k in range(j, len(I[0]))}
    obj |= toobject(sfilter(vfrontier, lambda p: index(I, p) == 0), I)
    obj |= toobject(sfilter(hfrontier, lambda p: index(I, p) == 0), I)
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), obj)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify dominant color:** Same as Version 1 & 3.
2. **Find and Expand Dominant Objects:**  Find the dominant object and expand it by merging with frontiers that contain only the recessive color ('0' in this case).

Each of these program versions provides a distinct approach to solving the given transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
