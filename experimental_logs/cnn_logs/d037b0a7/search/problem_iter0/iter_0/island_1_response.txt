## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The rightmost column of the input grid is extended downwards, filling the cells with the value '6'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** The leftmost column of the input grid is extended downwards, filling the cells with the value '7'. The value '2' also extends downwards one cell.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The topmost row of the input grid is extended downwards, filling the cells with the value '4'.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct programs to achieve the desired transformation, each with a different approach:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify all objects in the grid
    x2 = mapply(rightmost, x1)  # Find the rightmost column index for each object
    x3 = argmax(x1, rbind(lambda x, y: x[1][1], y))  # Find the object with the rightmost cell
    x4 = color(x3)  # Get the color of the rightmost object
    x5 = toindices(x3) # Get indices of the rightmost object
    x6 = sfilter(x5, lambda x: x[0] < len(I) - 1)  # Filter indices to those not in the last row
    x7 = apply(lambda x: (x[0] + 1, x[1]), x6)  # Shift the filtered indices one row down
    x8 = fill(I, x4, x7)  # Fill the shifted indices with the object's color
    O = x8  # Output the modified grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:** This program identifies the object extending furthest to the right and extends its color downwards. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    h = height(I)  # Get the height of the grid
    w = width(I)  # Get the width of the grid
    x1 = [(I[i][j], (i, j)) for i in range(h) for j in range(w)] # Get all cell-index pairs
    x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda x: x[1][1] == w - 1)  # Get cell-index pairs in the last column
    x3 = sfilter(x2, lambda x: x[0] != 0)  # Filter out background cells (assuming 0 is background)
    x4 = apply(lambda x: (x[0], (x[1][0] + 1, x[1][1])), x3)  # Shift cell-index pairs one row down
    x5 = apply(lambda x: (x[0], x[1][1]), x4)  # Extract only the shifted indices
    O = fill(I, x3[0][0], x5) if x3 else I # Fill shifted indices with the last column's color
    return O
```

**Explanation:** This program directly works on the grid, identifying the rightmost column, and extending its color downwards, handling empty columns.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)
  x2 = apply(lambda x: (color(x), rightmost(x)), x1)  # Extract color and rightmost index for each object
  x3 = argmax(x2, lambda x: x[1])  # Find object with maximum rightmost index
  target_color, target_col = x3  # Get color and column of target object
  x4 = apply(lambda row: row + (target_color,), I)  # Extend each row with the target color
  O = x4
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This program finds the object extending furthest to the right, extracts its color, and extends all rows with that color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = []
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        x2 = row[-1]  # Get the last element of each row
        if i < len(I) - 1:
            x1.append(row + (x2,))  # Append the last element to each row except the last
        else:
            x1.append(row) # Keep the last row unchanged
    O = tuple(x1)  # Construct the output grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:** This program iterates through the input grid and extends each row (except the last) by duplicating its last element.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify objects in the grid
  x2 = apply(lambda obj: (obj, ulcorner(obj)), x1)  # Combine each object with its upper-left corner
  x3 = sorted(x2, key=lambda x: x[1][1], reverse=True)  # Sort by column index of upper-left corner
  x4 = x3[0][0]  # Get the rightmost object
  target_color = color(x4) # Get the color of the rightmost object
  x5 = apply(lambda row: tuple(list(row) + [target_color]), I)  # Extend each row with the target color
  O = tuple(x5) # Convert to tuple
  return O
```

**Explanation:**  This program identifies the rightmost object based on the column position of its upper-left corner and extends all rows with the object's color. 

These are five distinct approaches to the problem. Please note that the assumption is made that the background color is 0 in some of the solutions. You can adjust the code based on the actual background color if it's different.
