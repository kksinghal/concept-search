## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying two types of objects in the input grid and recoloring them:

* **Border Objects:** Objects that are connected to any border of the grid.
* **Non-Border Objects:** Objects that are not connected to any border.

The recoloring scheme is as follows:

* Border Objects are recolored to **1**.
* Non-Border Objects are recolored to **2**.

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** The input has two objects, one touching the bottom border and the other completely enclosed. The output correctly recolors the bordering object to 1 and the enclosed object to 2.

**Pair 1:**  Similar to Pair 0, with the bordering object now spanning across the top edge. The output accurately recolors based on border connection.

**Pair 2:** This input includes multiple objects, some touching corners and some completely surrounded. The output consistently applies the recoloring based on border contact.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:


### **Program Version 1:**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  border_objs = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: any(bordering(initset(cell[1]), I) for cell in obj))
  non_border_objs = difference(objs, border_objs)
  O = paint(paint(I, recolor(ONE, merge(border_objs))), recolor(TWO, merge(non_border_objs)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all connected objects in the grid `I`.
2. **Filter Border Objects:** 
    * `lambda obj: any(bordering(initset(cell[1]), I) for cell in obj)` checks if any cell of an object is on the border.
    * `mfilter(objs, ...)` filters objects based on the border-checking condition.
3. **Non-Border Objects:** `difference(objs, border_objs)` isolates non-border objects.
4. **Recolor and Paint:** 
    * `recolor(ONE, merge(border_objs))` recolors all border objects to 1.
    * `recolor(TWO, merge(non_border_objs))` recolors non-border objects to 2.
    * Two nested `paint` calls apply the recoloring to the grid.


### **Program Version 2:**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    new_color = ONE if any(bordering(initset(cell[1]), I) for cell in obj) else TWO
    O = paint(O, recolor(new_color, obj)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Objects:** The code iterates through each object found in the grid.
2. **Determine Color:** For each object, it checks if it's a border object and assigns `new_color` accordingly.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** It recolors the current object to `new_color` and paints it onto a copy of the original grid.


### **Program Version 3:**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  border_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda idx: bordering(initset(idx), I))
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if (i, j) in border_indices:
        O = paint(O, {(ONE, (i, j))})
      elif val != mostcolor(I): 
        O = paint(O, {(TWO, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Border Indices:** `border_indices` stores indices of all cells on the grid border.
2. **Iterate Cells:**  The code iterates through each cell of the grid.
3. **Recolor Based on Location:** It recolors cells to 1 if they are on the border.  Non-border cells that aren't the background color are recolored to 2.

### **Program Version 4:**
**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  is_border_obj = lambda obj: any(bordering(initset(cell[1]), I) for cell in obj)
  recolor_func = lambda obj: recolor(ONE if is_border_obj(obj) else TWO, obj)
  O = paint(I, merge(apply(recolor_func, objects(I, T, F, F))))
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Define Helper Functions:** 
    * `is_border_obj` checks if an object touches the grid border.
    * `recolor_func` determines the correct color for an object and recolors it.
2. **Apply Transformation:**
    * `objects` finds all connected objects.
    * `apply` applies `recolor_func` to each object.
    * `merge` combines recolored objects.
    * `paint` draws the transformed objects onto the original grid.

### **Program Version 5:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    border_cells = mfilter(asobject(I), lambda cell: bordering(initset(cell[1]), I))
    non_border_cells = difference(asobject(I), border_cells)
    O = paint(paint(I, recolor(ONE, border_cells)), recolor(TWO, non_border_cells))
    return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Cells:**
    * `asobject` treats the grid as a single object containing all cells.
    * `border_cells` filters cells directly on the grid border.
    * `non_border_cells` selects the remaining cells not on the border.
2. **Recolor and Paint:**
    * Two nested `paint` calls efficiently recolor and apply the border and non-border cells to the grid.



These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation in the DSL, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the language.
