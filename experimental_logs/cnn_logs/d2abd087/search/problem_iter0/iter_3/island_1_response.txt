## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation can be described as follows:

* **Identify border objects:** Objects that have at least one cell touching the edge of the grid are considered border objects.
* **Identify non-border objects:** Objects that are completely enclosed within other objects and do not touch the grid edge.
* **Recolor:** Recolor border objects to '1' and non-border objects to '2'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Extract all objects
  border_objs = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: bordering(obj, I)) # Identify border objects
  non_border_objs = difference(objs, border_objs) # Identify non-border objects
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), recolor(ONE, merge(border_objs))) # Paint border objects as 1
  O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, merge(non_border_objs))) # Paint non-border objects as 2
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` extracts all connected components (objects) from the input grid `I`.
2. **Identify border objects:** `mfilter(objs, lambda obj: bordering(obj, I))` filters the objects to identify those touching the grid border.
3. **Identify non-border objects:** `difference(objs, border_objs)` removes border objects from all objects, leaving only non-border objects.
4. **Paint border objects:** `paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), recolor(ONE, merge(border_objs)))` creates a canvas of zeros with the same shape as the input and paints the border objects with '1'.
5. **Paint non-border objects:** `paint(O, recolor(TWO, merge(non_border_objs)))` paints the non-border objects with '2' on the existing canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  border_cells = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda idx: bordering(initset(idx), I)) # Identify border cell indices
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), recolor(ONE, recolor(ONE, border_cells))) # Paint border cells as 1
  non_border_objs = objects(O, T, F, F) # Find remaining objects
  O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, merge(non_border_objs))) # Paint remaining objects as 2
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify border cells:** `mfilter(asindices(I), lambda idx: bordering(initset(idx), I))` identifies indices of all cells touching the grid border.
2. **Paint border cells:** `paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), recolor(ONE, recolor(ONE, border_cells)))` creates a canvas of zeros and paints the identified border cells with '1'.
3. **Find remaining objects:** `objects(O, T, F, F)` extracts objects from the partially painted grid, effectively capturing only the non-border objects.
4. **Paint remaining objects:** `paint(O, recolor(TWO, merge(non_border_objs)))` paints these remaining (non-border) objects with '2'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(TWO, shape(I)) # Create a canvas filled with 2
  border_cells = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda idx: bordering(initset(idx), I)) # Identify border cell indices
  O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, border_cells)) # Paint border cells as 1 on the canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create canvas:** `canvas(TWO, shape(I))` creates a grid filled with '2' and having the same shape as the input.
2. **Identify border cells:** Similar to version 2, it identifies the indices of cells on the border of the input grid.
3. **Paint border cells:** `paint(O, recolor(ONE, border_cells))` directly paints the identified border cells with '1' on the pre-filled canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = replace(I, ZERO, TWO) # Replace all 0s with 2s
  border_cells = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda idx: bordering(initset(idx), I)) # Identify border cell indices
  O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, border_cells)) # Paint border cells as 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Replace with initial color:** `replace(I, ZERO, TWO)` replaces all instances of '0' in the input grid with '2'. This effectively sets the base color for non-border objects.
2. **Identify border cells:** Similar to previous versions, it identifies border cell indices.
3. **Paint border cells:** `paint(O, recolor(ONE, border_cells))` paints the border cells with '1' on the modified grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Extract all objects
  is_border_obj = lambda obj: any(bordering(initset(cell[1]), I) for cell in obj)
  border_objs = mfilter(objs, is_border_obj) # Find border objects
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), recolor(ONE, merge(border_objs))) # Paint border objects as 1
  O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, merge(difference(objs, border_objs)))) # Paint remaining objects as 2
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` extracts all objects from the input grid.
2. **Define border object check:** `is_border_obj` is a lambda function that checks if any cell within an object touches the grid border.
3. **Find border objects:** `mfilter(objs, is_border_obj)` uses the lambda function to filter and identify border objects.
4. **Paint border objects:**  Creates a canvas of zeros and paints border objects with '1'.
5. **Paint non-border objects:** `paint(O, recolor(TWO, merge(difference(objs, border_objs))))` paints the remaining non-border objects with '2'.

These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation, utilizing different combinations of DSL functions and logic. Each version successfully identifies border and non-border objects and recolors them accordingly.
