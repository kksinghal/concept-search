## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on recoloring objects in the grid based on their position relative to the grid's border. 

**Logic:**

1. **Identify Border Objects:** Objects that share at least one cell with the grid's border are classified as "border objects."
2. **Identify Non-Border Objects:** Objects entirely contained within the grid's boundaries are classified as "non-border objects."
3. **Recolor:**
    - Border objects are recolored with the value `1`.
    - Non-border objects are recolored with the value `2`.

Let's illustrate with an example using `Input_0`:

```
Input_0:
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0
0 5 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0
0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
```

- The `5`s touching the edges of the grid are the border objects.
- The `5`s in the bottom left corner are the non-border object.

```
Output_0:
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0
0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

This pattern holds true for all the input-output pairs.


## Program to be Generated (5 Versions)

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  border_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda idx: bordering(initset(idx), I))
  non_border_indices = difference(asindices(I), border_indices) 
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), recolor(ONE, toobject(border_indices, I))) 
  O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, toobject(non_border_indices, I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`border_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda idx: bordering(initset(idx), I))`**:  Identifies indices of border cells.
2. **`non_border_indices = difference(asindices(I), border_indices)`**:  Gets indices of non-border cells.
3. **`O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), recolor(ONE, toobject(border_indices, I)))`**: Creates a canvas of zeros and paints border objects with `1`.
4. **`O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, toobject(non_border_indices, I)))`**: Paints non-border objects with `2`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
    is_border_obj = lambda obj: any(bordering(initset(cell), I) for cell in toindices(obj)) 
    border_objs = sfilter(objs, is_border_obj)
    non_border_objs = difference(objs, border_objs)
    O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), recolor(ONE, merge(toindices(obj) for obj in border_objs)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, merge(toindices(obj) for obj in non_border_objs))) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, F)`**: Extracts all objects from the input grid.
2. **`is_border_obj = lambda obj: any(bordering(initset(cell), I) for cell in toindices(obj))`**:  Defines a function to check if any cell of an object touches the border.
3. **`border_objs = sfilter(objs, is_border_obj)`**: Filters for border objects.
4. **`non_border_objs = difference(objs, border_objs)`**:  Filters for non-border objects.
5. **`O = paint(...), O = paint(...)`**:  Similar to version 1, paints the canvas with respective colors.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    border_obj = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: bordering(obj, I)) 
    non_border_obj = difference(objects(I, T, F, F), border_obj)
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    for obj in border_obj:
        O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, obj))
    for obj in non_border_obj:
        O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, obj))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`border_obj = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: bordering(obj, I))`**: Extracts and filters for border objects.
2. **`non_border_obj = difference(objects(I, T, F, F), border_obj)`**: Extracts and filters for non-border objects.
3.  The code iterates through border and non-border objects and paints them onto a canvas of zeros.

**Program Version 4:**

```python 
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if bordering(initset((i, j)), I):
        O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, {(value, (i, j))}))
      else:
        O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, {(value, (i, j))}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates through each cell of the grid, checking if it's a border cell. It then paints the corresponding cell on the output canvas with the appropriate color (1 for border, 2 for non-border). 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    border_cells = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda idx: any(c in (0, len(I)-1) or r in (0, len(I[0])-1) for r, c in neighbors(idx)))
    O = paint(canvas(TWO, shape(I)), recolor(ONE, toobject(border_cells, I)))
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`border_cells = mfilter(...)`**: Identifies border cells by checking if their neighbors fall outside the grid boundaries.
2.  It directly creates a canvas filled with `2` (non-border color) and then paints the border cells with `1`. 

These five versions showcase different approaches and DSL function combinations to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating code diversity. Each version leverages the DSL's capabilities for object manipulation, filtering, and grid operations to solve the problem.
