## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying border and non-border objects in the input grid and then recoloring them with specific values. 

* **Border objects** are those that have at least one cell touching the edge of the grid. These objects are recolored to `1`.
* **Non-border objects** are completely enclosed within the grid and are recolored to `2`.

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** The single 5-valued object is a border object, so it's recolored to `1`. The remaining 0s represent the background and remain unchanged.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:** The 5-valued objects at the top and right edges are border objects and are recolored to `1`. The remaining 5-valued object is a non-border object and is recolored to `2`. 

**Input_2 -> Output_2:** Similar to previous examples, border objects (5-valued) are recolored to `1`, and the single non-border object (5-valued) is recolored to `2`.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Extract all objects
  border_objs = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: any(bordering(initset(cell[1]), I) for cell in obj)) # Identify border objects
  non_border_objs = difference(objs, border_objs) # Identify non-border objects
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), recolor(ONE, merge(border_objs))) # Paint border objects as 1
  O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, merge(non_border_objs))) # Paint non-border objects as 2
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

1.  **Extract objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all connected components in the input grid `I` as individual objects.
2.  **Identify border objects:** The `mfilter` function filters objects that satisfy a condition. The lambda function checks if any cell within the object is on the border using `bordering(initset(cell[1]), I)`.
3.  **Identify non-border objects:**  `difference(objs, border_objs)` removes the border objects from the set of all objects, leaving only non-border objects.
4.  **Paint border objects:** A canvas of the same size as the input grid filled with zeros is created using `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`. Then, the border objects are recolored to `1` and painted onto the canvas.
5.  **Paint non-border objects:**  Similarly, non-border objects are recolored to `2` and painted onto the canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))  # Initialize output grid with zeros
    for i, row in enumerate(I):  # Iterate over rows
        for j, value in enumerate(row):  # Iterate over cells
            if bordering(initset((i, j)), I) and value != ZERO: # Check for border and non-zero value
                O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, {(value, (i, j))})) # Paint border cells as 1
            elif value != ZERO:
                O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, {(value, (i, j))})) # Paint non-border cells as 2
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize output grid:** Create a canvas `O` of the same dimensions as the input grid `I` and fill it with `ZERO`.
2. **Iterate over cells:** Use nested loops to iterate over each cell (i, j) in the input grid `I`.
3. **Identify border cells:** Use `bordering(initset((i, j)), I)` to check if the current cell is on the grid border. Additionally, ensure the cell value is not `ZERO`.
4. **Paint border cells:** If a cell is on the border and has a non-zero value, recolor it to `ONE` and paint it onto the output grid `O`.
5. **Paint non-border cells:** If a cell is not on the border but has a non-zero value, recolor it to `TWO` and paint it onto the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  border_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda idx: bordering(initset(idx), I)) # Find border indices
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), recolor(ONE, toobject(border_indices, I))) # Paint border cells as 1
  non_border_objs = objects(paint(I, recolor(ZERO, toobject(border_indices, I))), T, F, F) # Find non-border objects
  O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, merge(non_border_objs))) # Paint non-border objects as 2
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find border indices:** Extract all cell indices from the input grid `I` using `asindices(I)`. Then, filter the indices to keep only those on the border using `bordering(initset(idx), I)`.
2. **Paint border cells:** Create a canvas filled with zeros. Convert the border indices to an object using `toobject(border_indices, I)` to get color information. Recolor this object to `1` and paint it onto the canvas.
3. **Find non-border objects:**  First, paint the border cells in the input grid `I` to `ZERO` to isolate non-border objects. Then, use `objects(..., T, F, F)` to extract the remaining connected components as non-border objects.
4. **Paint non-border objects:** Recolor the non-border objects to `2` and paint them onto the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = replace(I, ZERO, TWO) # Replace 0s with 2s
    border_cells = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda idx: bordering(initset(idx), I)) # Identify border cell indices
    O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, toobject(border_cells, I))) # Paint border cells as 1
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Replace background:** Replace all occurrences of `ZERO` in the input grid `I` with `TWO`, effectively pre-coloring the non-border objects.
2. **Identify border cells:**  Similar to version 3, find the indices of all cells on the grid border using `bordering(initset(idx), I)`.
3. **Paint border cells:** Recolor the identified border cells (now with their original color information) to `1` and paint them onto the modified grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Create a copy of the input grid
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != 0: # For every non-zero cell
        if i == 0 or j == 0 or i == len(I) - 1 or j == len(I[0]) - 1: # Check if the cell is on the border
          O = paint(O, recolor(1, {(I[i][j], (i, j))})) # If on the border, paint it as 1
        else:
          O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(I[i][j], (i, j))})) # If not on the border, paint it as 2
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Copy input grid:** Create a copy of the input grid `I` and store it in `O`.
2. **Iterate over cells:** Use nested loops to iterate over each cell in the grid.
3. **Check for non-zero cells:** For each cell, check if its value is not equal to zero.
4. **Identify and paint border cells:** If a cell is non-zero and located on the grid border (first/last row or column), paint it as `1` in the output grid `O`.
5. **Paint non-border cells:** If a cell is non-zero and not on the border, paint it as `2` in the output grid `O`.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressive power of the provided DSL.
