## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation recolors objects in the input grid based on their size and position:

* **Small Objects:** Objects with 2 or fewer cells are recolored to 0.
* **Edge Objects:** Objects with more than 2 cells touching the top or left edge of the grid are recolored to 1.
* **Other Large Objects:**  All other objects with more than 2 cells are recolored to 2.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1 (Inspired by Program_A and Program_B):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  small_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) <= 2)
  large_objs = difference(objects(I, T, F, T), small_objs)
  edge_objs = mfilter(large_objs, lambda obj: uppermost(obj) == 0 or leftmost(obj) == 0)
  O = paint(fill(I, 2, asindices(I)), recolor(1, merge(edge_objs)))
  return paint(O, recolor(0, merge(small_objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Object Types:**  The code first identifies small objects, large objects, and edge objects.
2. **Initialize Canvas:** A canvas `O` is created filled with the color 2 (representing "Other Large Objects").
3. **Paint Edge Objects:** Edge objects are painted onto the canvas with color 1.
4. **Paint Small Objects:** Finally, small objects are painted onto the canvas with color 0.

**Version 2 (Iteration over grid cells):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(2, shape(I)) # Start with a canvas filled with 2
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: (i, j) in toindices(obj))
      if size(obj) <= 2:
        O = fill(O, 0, {(i, j)}) # Small object, recolor to 0
      elif i == 0 or j == 0:
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)}) # Edge object, recolor to 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** Creates a canvas `O` with the same dimensions as the input, filled with color 2.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:** Iterates over each cell of the input grid. For each cell, it finds the object containing that cell and recolors the corresponding cell in the output canvas based on the object's size and if it touches the top/left edge.

**Version 3 (Using indices instead of objects):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  small_indices = merge(mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) <= 2))
  edge_indices = merge(mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) > 2 and (uppermost(obj) == 0 or leftmost(obj) == 0)))
  O = fill(I, 2, asindices(I))
  O = fill(O, 1, edge_indices)
  return fill(O, 0, small_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Indices:**  Identifies indices belonging to small objects and edge objects.
2. **Fill Canvas:**  Fills the canvas `O` with color 2.
3. **Recolor Indices:** Recolors cells at `edge_indices` to 1 and then at `small_indices` to 0.

**Version 4 (Leveraging default values with `cellwise`):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  small_obj_grid = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) <= 2)))
  edge_obj_grid = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) > 2 and (uppermost(obj) == 0 or leftmost(obj) == 0))))
  return cellwise(I, small_obj_grid, 0) + cellwise(I, edge_obj_grid, 1)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Generate Object Grids:** Creates separate grids (`small_obj_grid` and `edge_obj_grid`) where object cells have their original color and the rest are 0.
2. **Cellwise Merging:** Uses `cellwise` to prioritize colors from the object grids. If a cell in an object grid is not 0, it keeps its color; otherwise, it takes the color from the original grid or a default color (0 for small objects, 1 for edge objects).

**Version 5 (Simplified logic with nested conditionals):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(2, shape(I)) # Default to 2
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    color = 0 if size(obj) <= 2 else (1 if uppermost(obj) == 0 or leftmost(obj) == 0 else 2)
    O = paint(O, recolor(color, obj)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:**  Starts with a canvas filled with color 2.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:**  Iterates over each object. For each object, it determines the appropriate color based on size and edge contact and then paints the object with that color onto the canvas.
