## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves the following steps:

1. **Identify Edge Objects:** Objects that touch the top or left border of the grid.
2. **Identify Large Objects:** Objects with more than 2 cells that are not edge objects.
3. **Recolor:**
    - Edge objects are recolored to 1.
    - Large objects are recolored to 2.

Let's analyze this for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**
- The two objects touching the top and left borders are recolored to 1.
- The larger object that doesn't touch the borders is recolored to 2.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**
- The objects touching the top and left borders are recolored to 1.
- The larger objects that don't touch the borders are recolored to 2.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**
- The objects touching the top and left borders are recolored to 1.
- The larger objects that don't touch the borders are recolored to 2.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL functions:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
            recolor(1, merge(mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 
                                    lambda obj: uppermost(obj) == 0 or leftmost(obj) == 0)))),
      recolor(2, merge(mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 
                              lambda obj: size(obj) > 2 and not (uppermost(obj) == 0 or leftmost(obj) == 0)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`**: Creates a blank canvas with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid.
2. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`**:  Extracts all objects from the input grid.
3. **`mfilter(... lambda obj: uppermost(obj) == 0 or leftmost(obj) == 0)`**: Filters for edge objects (touching the top or left border).
4. **`merge(...)`**: Combines all edge objects into a single patch.
5. **`recolor(1, ...)`**: Recolors the combined edge object patch to 1.
6. **`paint(...)`**: Paints the recolored edge objects onto the canvas.
7. **`mfilter(... lambda obj: size(obj) > 2 and not (uppermost(obj) == 0 or leftmost(obj) == 0))`**: Filters for large non-edge objects.
8. **`merge(...)`**: Combines all large non-edge objects into a single patch.
9. **`recolor(2, ...)`**: Recolors the combined large object patch to 2.
10. **`paint(...)`**: Paints the recolored large objects onto the canvas, resulting in the final output grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, 
                  paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
                        recolor(1, merge(mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 
                                                lambda obj: uppermost(obj) == 0 or leftmost(obj) == 0)))),
                  2)
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes `cellwise` for a different approach:

1. Steps 1-6 are identical to Version 1, creating a canvas with recolored edge objects.
2. **`cellwise(I, ..., 2)`**: This function compares the input grid `I` with the canvas containing recolored edge objects.
    - If the cells match, the input value is retained.
    - If they don't match (meaning it's a large object cell), the cell is recolored to 2.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  edge_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: uppermost(obj) == 0 or leftmost(obj) == 0)
  large_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) > 2 and obj not in edge_objs)
  return paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolor(1, merge(edge_objs))), recolor(2, merge(large_objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version improves readability by separating object filtering:

1. **`edge_objs = ...`**:  Filters and stores edge objects.
2. **`large_objs = ...`**: Filters and stores large non-edge objects.
3. The rest of the code is similar to Version 1, painting the recolored objects onto the canvas.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
             recolor(1, merge(mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: uppermost(obj) == 0 or leftmost(obj) == 0))))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if size(obj) > 2 and uppermost(obj) != 0 and leftmost(obj) != 0:
      O = paint(O, recolor(2, obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a loop for painting large objects:

1. Creates a canvas with recolored edge objects (similar to previous versions).
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):`**: Iterates through all objects.
3. **`if size(obj) > 2 and ...`**: Checks for large non-edge objects.
4. **`O = paint(O, recolor(2, obj))`**: Recolors and paints each large object individually.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      fill(canvas(2, shape(I)), mostcolor(I), 
           merge(mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) <= 2 or (uppermost(obj) != 0 and leftmost(obj) != 0)))),
      recolor(1, merge(mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: uppermost(obj) == 0 or leftmost(obj) == 0))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version takes a slightly different approach:

1. **`canvas(2, shape(I))`**: Creates a canvas filled entirely with color 2.
2. **`mfilter(...)`**:  Filters for objects that are either small (size <= 2) or not edge objects.
3. **`merge(...)`**: Combines these objects into a single patch.
4. **`fill(..., mostcolor(I), ...)`**: Fills the combined patch with the background color, effectively "erasing" them from the canvas.
5. The remaining part is similar to previous versions, recoloring and painting the edge objects onto the canvas.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation using various DSL functions and logic, showcasing code diversity.
