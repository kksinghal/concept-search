## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently recolors the objects in the input grid based on their spatial relationship to the grid border:

**General Pattern:**

- Objects directly bordering the grid border are recolored to **1**.
- Objects not bordering the grid border are recolored to **2**.

**Specific Examples:**

**Input_0:**
- The '5' object touching the bottom and right borders becomes '1'.
- The '5' object further from the border becomes '2'.

**Input_1:**
- The '5' objects touching the top and right borders become '1'.
- The '5' object in the center, not touching any border, becomes '2'.

**Input_2:**
- The '5' objects touching the top, right, and bottom borders become '1'.
- The '5' object towards the left, not touching any border, becomes '2'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  border_objs = mfilter(objs, rbind(bordering, I))
  non_border_objs = difference(objs, border_objs)
  O = paint(paint(I, recolor(ONE, merge(border_objs))), recolor(TWO, merge(non_border_objs)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, F)` extracts all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Separate Border/Non-Border:**
   - `border_objs = mfilter(objs, rbind(bordering, I))` identifies objects touching the grid border.
   - `non_border_objs = difference(objs, border_objs)`  isolates objects not touching the border.
3. **Recolor and Paint:**
   - `paint(I, recolor(ONE, merge(border_objs)))` recolors and paints border objects with '1'.
   - `paint(..., recolor(TWO, merge(non_border_objs)))` further recolors and paints non-border objects with '2'.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    new_color = ONE if bordering(obj, I) else TWO
    O = paint(O, recolor(new_color, obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Objects:** Loops through each object extracted using `objects(I, T, F, F)`.
2. **Conditional Recoloring:**
   - `new_color = ONE if bordering(obj, I) else TWO` assigns '1' to border objects, '2' to others.
3. **Paint Iteratively:** `O = paint(O, recolor(new_color, obj))` paints each object with its determined color.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  is_border_obj = lambda obj: bordering(obj, I)
  recolor_func = lambda obj: recolor(ONE if is_border_obj(obj) else TWO, obj)
  O = paint(I, merge(apply(recolor_func, objects(I, T, F, F))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Helper Functions:**
   - `is_border_obj` checks if an object touches the border.
   - `recolor_func` determines the new color and recolors the object.
2. **Apply and Paint:**
   - `apply(recolor_func, objects(I, T, F, F))` applies recoloring to each extracted object.
   - `paint(I, merge(...))` paints the recolored objects onto the grid.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  border_indices =  frozenset((i, j) for i in range(len(I)) for j in (0, len(I[0])-1)) | \
                  frozenset((i, j) for j in range(len(I[0])) for i in (0, len(I)-1))
  is_border_obj = lambda obj: any(index in toindices(obj) for index in border_indices)
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    O = paint(O, recolor(ONE if is_border_obj(obj) else TWO, obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Pre-calculate Border Indices:**  `border_indices` stores all indices on the grid border.
2. **Check Border Intersection:**  `is_border_obj` efficiently checks if an object intersects with pre-calculated `border_indices`.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** Similar to Version 2, but with optimized border checking. 


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  border_cells = mfilter(asobject(I), lambda cell: bordering(initset(cell[1]), I))
  non_border_cells = difference(asobject(I), border_cells)
  O = paint(paint(I, recolor(ONE, toindices(border_cells))), recolor(TWO, toindices(non_border_cells)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Cell-Based Approach:** Instead of objects, this version works with individual cells.
2. **Identify Border/Non-Border Cells:**
   - `border_cells = ...` extracts cells directly on the border.
   - `non_border_cells = ...` gets the remaining cells.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** Similar to Version 1, but operates on cell sets instead of objects.
