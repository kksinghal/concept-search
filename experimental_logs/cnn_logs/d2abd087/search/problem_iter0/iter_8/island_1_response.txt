## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves identifying and recoloring objects based on their size and position relative to the grid borders. 

Here's a breakdown:

**Rule 1:** Objects touching the grid borders are colored with '1'.
**Rule 2:** Objects with a size greater than 1 (having more than one cell) are colored with '2'.
**Rule 3:** All other objects (size 1 and not touching the border) remain unchanged.

Let's analyze this for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**
- The '5' object at the top center touches the border, so it becomes '1'.
- All other '5' objects are larger than size 1 and become '2'.

**Input_1:**
- The '5' objects at the top right and partially on the right border are touching the border, so they become '1'.
- The larger '5' objects become '2'.

**Input_2:**
-  The '5' objects touching the top, right, and bottom borders are colored '1'.
-  The larger '5' objects become '2'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  border_obj = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: bordering(obj, I)) # Find border objects
  large_obj = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) > 1) # Find large objects
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), recolor(ONE, merge(border_obj))) # Color border objects '1'
  O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, merge(large_obj))) # Color large objects '2'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `border_obj = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: bordering(obj, I))`: Identifies objects touching the border using `bordering` and `objects`.
2.  `large_obj = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)`:  Identifies objects larger than size 1 using `size` and `objects`.
3.  `O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), recolor(ONE, merge(border_obj)))`: Creates a blank canvas and paints border objects with '1'.
4.  `O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, merge(large_obj)))`: Paints large objects with '2' on the canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if bordering(obj, I):
      O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, obj)) 
    if size(obj) > 1:
      O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Iterates through each object in the input grid.
2.  Uses an if-condition to color border objects '1'.
3.  Uses another if-condition to color large objects '2'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  border_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda idx: bordering(initset(idx), I))
  large_obj = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), recolor(ONE, toobject(border_indices, I)))
  O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, merge(large_obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Identifies border indices directly instead of using `objects` function.
2.  Reuses logic from Version 1 for large objects.
3.  Uses `toobject` to convert border indices to an object before painting.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I)):
            if bordering(initset(astuple(i, j)), I):
                O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, {(I[i][j], (i, j))}))
            elif any(size(obj) > 1 for obj in objects(crop(I, (i, j), (1, 1)), T, F, T)):
                O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, {(I[i][j], (i, j))}))
            else:
                O = paint(O, recolor(I[i][j], {(I[i][j], (i, j))}))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Iterates through each cell of the grid.
2.  Uses `bordering` on individual cell indices to identify border cells.
3.  Uses a nested `objects` call on a 1x1 cropped grid to check for large objects at each cell.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  border_obj = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: bordering(obj, I))
  large_obj = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)
  O = I
  for obj in border_obj:
    O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, obj))
  for obj in large_obj:
    O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Gets all objects using `objects`.
2.  Separately filters for border objects and large objects using `sfilter`.
3.  Iterates through both filtered sets to paint them accordingly.

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the same transformation. Each version uses distinct logic or function combinations, showcasing the flexibility and power of the provided DSL.
