## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to differentiate between objects connected to the grid border and those that are not. 

* **Border Objects:** Objects with at least one cell touching the edge of the grid are recolored to "1".
* **Non-Border Objects:** Objects entirely enclosed within the grid, without touching the border, are recolored to "2". 

**Let's analyze each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0:** The single 5-object is split into two parts: one touching the bottom edge (recolored to "1") and another fully inside (recolored to "2").
* **Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0, the 5-object is split, with the border-touching part becoming "1" and the enclosed part becoming "2". The isolated "5" on the right edge remains unchanged.
* **Input_2:**  Again, the large 5-object is split based on border contact. The isolated "5" at the bottom remains unchanged as it's not part of any multi-cell object.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the DSL:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Extract all objects 
  border_objs = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: bordering(obj, I)) # Identify border objects
  non_border_objs = difference(objs, border_objs) # Identify non-border objects
  O = paint(paint(I, recolor(ONE, merge(border_objs))), recolor(TWO, merge(non_border_objs))) # Recolor
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:**  Identifies all connected objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`border_objs = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: bordering(obj, I))`:** Filters objects, keeping only those touching the grid border using `bordering`.
3. **`non_border_objs = difference(objs, border_objs)`:**  Finds the difference between all objects and border objects, resulting in non-border objects.
4. **`O = paint(paint(I, recolor(ONE, merge(border_objs))), recolor(TWO, merge(non_border_objs)))`:** 
    - `recolor(ONE, merge(border_objs))` : Recolors all border objects to "1".
    - `recolor(TWO, merge(non_border_objs))`: Recolors all non-border objects to "2".
    - These recolored objects are then painted back onto the original grid `I` to generate the output `O`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  border_cells = mfilter(asobject(I), lambda cell: bordering(initset(cell[1]), I)) # Identify border cells
  O = paint(I, recolor(ONE, border_cells))  # Recolor border cells to 1
  objs = objects(O, T, F, F) # Find remaining objects
  O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, merge(objs))) # Recolor remaining objects to 2
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`border_cells = mfilter(asobject(I), lambda cell: bordering(initset(cell[1]), I))`:**  Identifies individual cells on the grid border.
2. **`O = paint(I, recolor(ONE, border_cells))`:** Recolors identified border cells to "1".
3. **`objs = objects(O, T, F, F)`:**  Identifies remaining connected objects in the partially transformed grid `O` (which now has "1" for border cells).
4. **`O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, merge(objs)))`:** Recolors all remaining objects to "2", effectively targeting the non-border objects.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(TWO, shape(I)) # Create a canvas filled with '2'
    border_cells = mfilter(asobject(I), lambda cell: bordering(initset(cell[1]), I))  # Identify border cells
    O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, border_cells)) # Paint border cells as '1' on the canvas
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(TWO, shape(I))`:** Creates a new grid `O` of the same size as input `I`, filled with "2". This ensures all non-border areas will be "2".
2. **`border_cells = mfilter(asobject(I), lambda cell: bordering(initset(cell[1]), I))`:**  Similar to Version 2, it identifies border cells in the input. 
3. **`O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, border_cells))`:**  Recolors only the border cells on the newly created canvas `O` to "1", achieving the final output.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = replace(I, ZERO, TWO)  # Replace all '0' with '2'
  border_cells = mfilter(asobject(I), lambda cell: bordering(initset(cell[1]), I)) # Identify border cells
  O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, border_cells)) # Paint border cells as '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = replace(I, ZERO, TWO)`:** Creates a copy of the input `I`, replacing all occurrences of "0" with "2". This sets the base for non-border areas.
2. **`border_cells = mfilter(asobject(I), lambda cell: bordering(initset(cell[1]), I))`:**  Identifies border cells in the original input.
3. **`O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, border_cells))`:** Recolors the identified border cells on the modified grid `O` to "1".

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Extract all objects 
  is_border_obj = lambda obj: any(bordering(initset(cell[1]), I) for cell in obj)
  border_obj_indices = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: is_border_obj(obj)) # Find indices of border objects
  O = I # copy input grid
  for idx in border_obj_indices:
    O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, idx)) # Recolor border objects to 1
  non_border_objs = objects(O, T, F, F) 
  O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, merge(non_border_objs))) # Recolor remaining objects to 2
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Identifies all connected objects in the input grid.
2. **`is_border_obj = lambda obj: any(bordering(initset(cell[1]), I) for cell in obj)`:** Defines a lambda function to check if an object touches the border.
3. **`border_obj_indices = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: is_border_obj(obj))`:** Filters objects, keeping only those identified as border objects.
4. **Loop through `border_obj_indices`:** Iterates through the indices of border objects.
5. **`O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, idx))`:** For each border object, it recolors its cells to "1" on the grid `O`.
6. **`non_border_objs = objects(O, T, F, F)`:** After processing border objects, it identifies the remaining connected objects.
7. **`O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, merge(non_border_objs)))`:**  Recolors all remaining objects to "2", effectively targeting the non-border objects.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation using various DSL functions and logic.
