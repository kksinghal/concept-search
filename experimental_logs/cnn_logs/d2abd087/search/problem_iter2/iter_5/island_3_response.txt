## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently swaps the colors of the smallest and second largest objects in each grid, excluding the background color.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- Smallest object: two connected cells with value '1'.
- Second largest object: three connected cells with value '1'. 
- Transformation: The colors are swapped, resulting in the smaller object now having value '2' and the larger object having value '1'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- Smallest object: single cell with value '1'.
- Second largest object: four connected cells with value '2'.
- Transformation:  The colors are swapped, resulting in the single cell now having value '2' and the four connected cells having value '1'.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- Smallest object: single cell with value '1'.
- Second largest object: three connected cells with value '1'.
- Transformation:  The colors are swapped, resulting in the single cell now having value '2' and the three connected cells having value '1'.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T) # Extract objects, excluding background
  sizes = apply(size, objs) # Get the size of each object
  smallest_size = minimum(sizes) # Find the size of the smallest object
  second_largest_size = valmax(difference(sizes, {minimum(sizes), maximum(sizes)}), identity) # Find the size of the second largest object
  smallest_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) == smallest_size) # Extract the smallest object
  second_largest_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) == second_largest_size) # Extract the second largest object
  return paint(paint(I, recolor(color(smallest_obj), toindices(second_largest_obj))), recolor(color(second_largest_obj), toindices(smallest_obj))) # Swap the colors of the objects
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Extracts all objects from the input grid (`I`), excluding the background, and stores them in the `objs` set.
2. **Determine Object Sizes:**  Calculates the size of each object and stores these sizes in the `sizes` set.
3. **Find Target Sizes:**  Finds the smallest and second largest sizes from the `sizes` set.
4. **Extract Target Objects:**  Retrieves the smallest and second largest objects from the `objs` set based on the identified sizes.
5. **Swap Colors:** Paints the second largest object with the color of the smallest object and vice versa, effectively swapping their colors on the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T) # Extract objects, excluding background
  sorted_objs = order(objs, size) # Sort objects by size
  smallest_obj = first(sorted_objs) # Smallest object is the first
  second_largest_obj = sorted_objs[-2] # Second largest is the second last
  return paint(paint(I, recolor(color(smallest_obj), toindices(second_largest_obj))), recolor(color(second_largest_obj), toindices(smallest_obj))) # Swap colors
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extracts all objects from the input grid (`I`), excluding the background, and stores them in the `objs` set.
2. **Sort Objects:** Sorts the objects based on their size in ascending order.
3. **Select Target Objects:** Directly selects the first object (smallest) and the second last object (second largest) from the sorted list.
4. **Swap Colors:**  Paints the second largest object with the color of the smallest object and vice versa, effectively swapping their colors on the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T) # Extract objects, excluding the background
  def key_func(obj):
    return (size(obj), -sum(i for i, j in toindices(obj))) # Sort by size then uppermost row
  sorted_objs = order(objs, key_func)
  smallest_obj = first(sorted_objs)
  second_largest_obj = sorted_objs[-2]
  return paint(paint(I, recolor(color(smallest_obj), toindices(second_largest_obj))), recolor(color(second_largest_obj), toindices(smallest_obj))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extracts all objects, excluding the background.
2. **Custom Sorting:** Sorts objects primarily by size and secondarily by the negative sum of their row indices (effectively prioritizing objects starting at higher rows when sizes are equal).
3. **Select and Swap:** Selects the first and second-to-last objects from the sorted list, and swaps their colors.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T) # Extract objects, excluding the background
  sizes = apply(size, objs)
  smallest_size = minimum(sizes)
  largest_size = maximum(sizes)
  second_largest_size = maximum(s for s in sizes if s != largest_size)
  smallest_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) == smallest_size)
  second_largest_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) == second_largest_size)
  return paint(paint(I, recolor(color(smallest_obj), toindices(second_largest_obj))), recolor(color(second_largest_obj), toindices(smallest_obj)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extracts all objects, excluding the background.
2. **Calculate Sizes:**  Determines the sizes of all objects.
3. **Find Target Sizes:** Finds the smallest, largest, and second largest sizes.
4. **Extract Objects:** Extracts the smallest and second largest objects based on their sizes.
5. **Swap Colors:**  Swaps the colors of the extracted objects.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  if len(objs) < 2: # Handle cases with less than two objects
    return I
  smallest_obj = argmin(objs, size)
  second_largest_obj = argmax(difference(objs, {smallest_obj}), size)
  return paint(paint(I, recolor(color(smallest_obj), toindices(second_largest_obj))), recolor(color(second_largest_obj), toindices(smallest_obj)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extracts all objects, excluding the background.
2. **Handle Edge Cases:** If there are less than two objects, returns the original input to avoid errors.
3. **Find Target Objects:** Finds the smallest object and the largest object among the remaining objects after excluding the smallest one.
4. **Swap Colors:** Swaps the colors of the identified objects. 

These five versions provide different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version leverages various combinations of functions to identify and manipulate objects based on their properties.
