## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring objects within the input grid based on these rules:

1. **Non-bordering Objects:**  If an object does not touch the grid borders, recolor it based on its original color:
    * Color 1 becomes Color 2.
    * Other colors remain unchanged.

2. **Bordering Objects:**  Objects touching any grid border retain their original color.

## Program Version 1: 

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Find all objects
  bg_color = mostcommon(I)  # Identify background color
  O = canvas(bg_color, shape(I))  # Create new grid with background color
  for obj in objs:
    if not bordering(obj, I):  # Check for non-bordering objects
      O = paint(O, recolor(2 if color(obj) == 1 else color(obj), obj))  # Apply recoloring
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)  # Keep original color for bordering objects
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Background:** The code starts by identifying all distinct objects in the input grid (`objs`) and the background color (`bg_color`).
2. **Create Blank Canvas:** It then creates a new grid (`O`) filled with the background color, having the same dimensions as the input grid.
3. **Iterate and Recolor:** The code iterates over each identified object (`obj`). For each object:
    * **Bordering Check:** It checks if the object is bordering the grid using `bordering(obj, I)`.
    * **Recoloring Logic:** If the object is *not* bordering:
        * It checks if the object's color is 1 (`color(obj) == 1`). 
        * If true, it recolors the object to 2 (`recolor(2, obj)`).
        * Otherwise, it keeps the original color (`recolor(color(obj), obj)`).
    * **Painting:** The recolor operation is applied to the canvas (`O`) using `paint()`.
4. **Return Output:** Finally, the transformed grid (`O`) is returned.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(
        canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)),
        merge(
            frozenset(
                recolor(2 if color(obj) == 1 else color(obj), obj)
                if not bordering(obj, I)
                else obj
                for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)
            )
        )
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Background:**  Similar to Version 1, it identifies objects and the background color.
2. **Transform and Merge Objects:** This version streamlines the recoloring process:
    * It uses a generator expression within `frozenset()` to process each object from `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
    * For each `obj`, a conditional expression checks if it's bordering.
    * Based on the bordering check, it either recolors the object (if not bordering) or keeps the original object.
    * `merge()` combines the transformed objects into a single set.
3. **Paint to Canvas:**  It creates a canvas with the background color and uses `paint()` to apply the transformed objects.
4. **Return Output:** The transformed grid is returned.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(
        canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)),
        merge(
            apply(
                lambda obj: recolor(2 if color(obj) == 1 else color(obj), obj)
                if not bordering(obj, I)
                else obj,
                objects(I, T, F, T)
            )
        )
    )
```

**Explanation:**

This version is structurally similar to Version 2 but uses `apply()` instead of a generator expression for object transformation:

1. **Identify Objects and Background:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Apply Transformation:** 
    * `apply()` takes a function and applies it to each element of the provided container (in this case, the set of objects).
    * The lambda function within `apply()` encapsulates the recoloring logic based on the bordering condition.
3. **Merge and Paint:** The rest is identical to Version 2 - merging transformed objects and painting them onto a canvas.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  bg = mostcommon(I)
  return paint(
      canvas(bg, shape(I)),
      merge(
          frozenset(
              recolor(2, obj) if color(obj) == 1 else obj
              for obj in objs
              if not bordering(obj, I)
          ),
          frozenset(obj for obj in objs if bordering(obj, I))
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version separates the object processing into two distinct steps before merging:

1. **Identify Objects and Background:** Same as before.
2. **Process Non-Bordering Objects:**
    * A generator expression creates a new set containing only re-colored non-bordering objects where color 1 is changed to 2.
3. **Process Bordering Objects:**
    * Another generator expression creates a set containing only the bordering objects without any modification.
4. **Merge and Paint:** Both sets (recolored non-bordering and original bordering) are merged and then painted onto a canvas with the background color.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), 
      merge(
          rapply(
              (
                  lambda obj: recolor(2, obj) if color(obj) == 1 else obj, 
                  lambda obj: obj
              ),
              sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I))
          )
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version introduces `rapply()` for applying different functions based on bordering:

1. **Identify Objects and Background:** Standard procedure.
2. **Filter Non-Bordering Objects:** `sfilter()` keeps only the non-bordering objects.
3. **Apply Functions with `rapply()`:**
    * `rapply()` takes a container of functions and a value. It applies each function to the value and returns a container of results. 
    * Here, it applies two lambda functions to the filtered non-bordering objects:
        * The first lambda recolors if the color is 1.
        * The second lambda simply returns the object without changes. 
4. **Merge and Paint:** The results from `rapply()`, which now include potentially re-colored non-bordering objects, are merged and painted onto the canvas.
