## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

**General Rule:** Recolor all objects with color '1' to color '2', except for the objects that touch the borders of the grid. 

Let's analyze how this applies to each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** 
- The object represented by '1's is recolored to '2's, except for the '1' attached to the left border.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- Two objects are represented by '1's.
- The top-left object is recolored to '2's, as it doesn't touch the border.
- The bottom object, touching the left border, remains unchanged.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
- The objects represented by '1's at the top and bottom remain unchanged as they touch the border. 
- The object with '1's in the center is recolored to '2's.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)),  # Create canvas with background color
      merge(
          apply(
              lambda obj: recolor(2, obj) if color(obj) == 1 and not bordering(obj, I) else obj, 
              objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract all objects
          )
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**
1. `objects(I, T, F, T)`:  Extracts all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. `lambda obj: ...`: Applies a lambda function to each object:
   - `color(obj) == 1 and not bordering(obj, I)`:  Checks if the object's color is '1' and if it's not bordering the grid.
   - `recolor(2, obj)`: If both conditions are true, recolors the object to '2'.
   - `else obj`: Otherwise, keeps the object unchanged.
3. `merge(...)`: Merges all the processed objects back together.
4. `canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))`: Creates a canvas with the background color and shape of the input grid.
5. `paint(..., ...)`:  Paints the merged objects onto the canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  bg = mostcommon(I)
  return paint(
      canvas(bg, shape(I)), 
      merge(
          frozenset(recolor(2, obj) for obj in objs if color(obj) == 1 and not bordering(obj, I)),
          frozenset(obj for obj in objs if color(obj) != 1 or bordering(obj, I))
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**
1.  Separates objects into two sets: those with color '1' and not on the border, and all others.
2.  Recolors the first set to '2'.
3.  Merges both sets, effectively applying the recoloring only to the desired objects.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)),
      merge(
          apply(
              lambda obj: branch(
                  color(obj) == 1 and not bordering(obj, I),
                  recolor(2, obj),
                  obj
              ),
              objects(I, T, F, T)
          )
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**
1. Uses the `branch` function for a more explicit conditional recoloring within the lambda function.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      replace(I, 1, mostcommon(I)), 
      merge(
          apply(
              lambda obj: recolor(2, obj) if not bordering(obj, I) else obj,
              colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 1)
          )
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**
1.  First replaces all '1's in the input grid with the background color.
2.  Then, extracts objects with color '1' (before the replacement), recolors them to '2' if they don't touch the border, and paints them back onto the modified grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcommon(I)
  return paint(
      canvas(bg, shape(I)),
      merge(
          frozenset(
              recolor(2, obj) 
              for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) 
              if color(obj) == 1 and all(index(I, loc) != bg for loc in outbox(obj))
          ),
          frozenset(obj for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if color(obj) != 1 or any(index(I, loc) == bg for loc in outbox(obj)))
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**
1.  Instead of using `bordering`, this version checks if an object's outbox contains the background color to determine if it touches the border. 
2.  This provides a slightly different way to identify border objects. 

These are five different approaches to achieve the desired transformation. They illustrate the flexibility of the DSL and offer varying levels of readability and conciseness.
