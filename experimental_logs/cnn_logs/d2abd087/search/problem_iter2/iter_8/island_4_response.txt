## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the grid and selectively recoloring them based on their position and color:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- Objects touching the top or left border retain their original color.
- All other objects with color '1' are recolored to '2'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- Objects touching the top or left border retain their original color.
- All other objects with color '1' are recolored to '2'.
- Additionally, objects with color '2' are recolored to '1'.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- Objects touching the top or left border retain their original color.
- All other objects with color '1' are recolored to '2'.
- Objects with color '2' retain their original color.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), # Create canvas with background color
      merge(
          frozenset(
              branch(
                  either(uppermost(obj) == 0, leftmost(obj) == 0), # Check for top/left border
                  obj, # Keep original color
                  recolor(2 if color(obj) == 1 else color(obj), obj) # Recolor if color is 1, else keep original
              )
              for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)
          )
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** A canvas with the background color of the input grid is created.
2. **Object Iteration:** The code iterates through each object identified in the input grid.
3. **Border Check:** If the object touches the top or left border, it retains its original color.
4. **Color-Specific Recoloring:** If the object doesn't touch the border and has the color '1', it's recolored to '2'. Otherwise, its original color is kept.
5. **Painting:** The modified objects are then painted onto the canvas, resulting in the final output.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)),
      merge(
          apply(
              lambda obj: obj if (uppermost(obj) == 0 or leftmost(obj) == 0) 
                          else recolor(2 if color(obj) == 1 else color(obj), obj),
              objects(I, T, F, T)
          )
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation & Object Identification:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Lambda Function:** Uses a lambda function to concisely apply the recoloring logic to each object.
3. **Conditional Recoloring:** Within the lambda function, the object's color is changed to '2' if it doesn't touch the border and has the color '1'. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.
4. **Painting:** The modified objects are painted onto the canvas.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    border_objs = sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: uppermost(obj) == 0 or leftmost(obj) == 0)
    other_objs = difference(objects(I, T, F, T), border_objs)
    recolored_objs = frozenset(recolor(2, obj) for obj in other_objs if color(obj) == 1)
    return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge((*border_objs, *recolored_objs, *(other_objs - recolored_objs))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Separation:** Separates border objects and other objects into distinct sets.
2. **Targeted Recoloring:** Only recolors objects within the 'other_objs' set that have the color '1'.
3. **Object Merging:** Merges the unchanged border objects, recolored objects, and remaining unchanged objects.
4. **Painting:** Paints the merged set of objects onto the canvas.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)),
      merge(
        frozenset(
            branch(
                (uppermost(obj) == 0 or leftmost(obj) == 0) or color(obj) != 1, # Check for border or color other than 1
                obj, # Keep original
                recolor(2, obj) # Recolor to 2
            )
            for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)
        )
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Simplified Condition:** Uses a single 'branch' function with a combined condition to determine recoloring.
2. **Recoloring Logic:** Recolors to '2' only if the object is not on the border and has the color '1'. 
3. **Painting:**  Paints the objects onto the canvas.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)),
      merge(
          frozenset(
            branch(
              color(obj) == 1,  # Check if color is 1
              branch(  # If color is 1
                  (uppermost(obj) == 0 or leftmost(obj) == 0),  # Check for border
                  obj,  # Keep original color if on border
                  recolor(2, obj)  # Recolor if not on border
              ),
              obj  # Keep original color if color is not 1
            )
            for obj in objs
          )
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Nested Conditions:** Uses nested 'branch' functions to implement a hierarchical recoloring logic.
2. **Color Priority:**  Prioritizes the color check, only proceeding to border check if the color is '1'.
3. **Painting:**  Paints the objects onto the canvas.

These versions showcase different approaches and DSL function combinations to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
