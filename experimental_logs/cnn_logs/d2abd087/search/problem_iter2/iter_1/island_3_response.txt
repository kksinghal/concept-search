## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all three examples involves identifying the largest and second smallest objects (based on the number of cells they occupy) and swapping their positions while preserving their original shapes and colors. All other objects and background remain unchanged.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The largest object consists of five '1's and the second smallest object consists of two '1's. The program swaps their positions.
* **Input_1:**  The largest object consists of five '2's and the second smallest object consists of two '1's.  The program swaps their positions.
* **Input_2:**  The largest object consists of six '1's and the second smallest object consists of two '2's. The program swaps their positions.

## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  largest = argmax(objs, size)
  objs_without_largest = remove(largest, objs)
  second_smallest = argmin(objs_without_largest, size)
  return paint(paint(I, recolor(color(second_smallest), toindices(largest))), recolor(color(largest), toindices(second_smallest)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  It identifies all objects in the input grid `I` using `objects(I, F, F, T)`.
2. **Find Largest & Second Smallest:** It finds the largest object `largest` using `argmax(objs, size)` and the second smallest object `second_smallest` using `argmin(objs_without_largest, size)`, after removing the largest object from the set.
3. **Swap and Paint:** It paints the largest object's location with the second smallest object's color and vice versa using `paint` and `recolor` functions. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  obj_sizes = apply(size, objs)
  largest_size = maximum(obj_sizes)
  second_smallest_size = minimum(remove(largest_size, obj_sizes))
  largest = extract(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) == largest_size)
  second_smallest = extract(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) == second_smallest_size)
  return paint(paint(I, recolor(color(second_smallest), toindices(largest))), recolor(color(largest), toindices(second_smallest)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Sizes:**  Identifies objects and their sizes using `objects` and `apply(size, objs)`.
2. **Find Target Sizes:**  Finds the size of the largest and second smallest objects.
3. **Extract Objects by Size:**  Extracts the objects matching the target sizes using `extract` and `size` functions.
4. **Swap and Paint:** Same as Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  sorted_objs = order(objs, size)
  largest = first(sorted_objs)
  second_smallest = sorted_objs[1]
  return paint(paint(I, recolor(color(second_smallest), toindices(largest))), recolor(color(largest), toindices(second_smallest)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Sort Objects:**  Sorts the objects based on their size using `order(objs, size)`.
3. **Extract Largest & Second Smallest:**  The largest and second smallest objects are the first and second elements in the sorted list, respectively.
4. **Swap and Paint:** Same as Version 1. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  size_dict = {} 
  for obj in objs:
    s = size(obj)
    if s not in size_dict:
      size_dict[s] = []
    size_dict[s].append(obj)
  sorted_sizes = sorted(size_dict.keys())
  largest = first(size_dict[sorted_sizes[-1]])
  second_smallest = first(size_dict[sorted_sizes[1]])
  return paint(paint(I, recolor(color(second_smallest), toindices(largest))), recolor(color(largest), toindices(second_smallest)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Create Size Dictionary:**  Creates a dictionary mapping object sizes to a list of objects with that size.
3. **Sort Sizes:**  Sorts the dictionary keys (object sizes).
4. **Extract Largest & Second Smallest:** Retrieves the largest and second smallest objects from the dictionary using the sorted sizes.
5. **Swap and Paint:** Same as Version 1.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  def score(obj):
    return -size(obj) if size(obj) != min(apply(size, objs)) else size(obj) * 100
  largest = argmin(objs, score)
  second_smallest = argmax(objs, score)
  return paint(paint(I, recolor(color(second_smallest), toindices(largest))), recolor(color(largest), toindices(second_smallest)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Define Custom Scoring Function:**  Defines a custom scoring function `score` that prioritizes smaller objects except for the absolute smallest one (which would be penalized heavily).
3. **Find Largest & Second Smallest:** Uses `argmin` and `argmax` with the custom scoring function to directly find the largest and second smallest objects.
4. **Swap and Paint:** Same as Version 1.
