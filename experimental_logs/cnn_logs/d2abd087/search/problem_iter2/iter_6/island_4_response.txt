## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the grid and then selectively recoloring them based on their original color and position relative to the grid's border.

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** 
- Objects with color '1' are recolored to '2'. 

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- Objects with color '1' are recolored to '2' only if they are not bordering the grid. 

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
- Objects with color '1' are recolored to '2' only if they are not bordering the grid.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), # Create canvas with background color
      merge(
          apply(
              lambda obj: branch(
                  color(obj) == 1, # Condition for recoloring
                  recolor(2, obj), # Recolor to 2
                  obj  # Keep original color
              ),
              objects(I, T, F, T) # Extract all objects
          )
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`**: Creates a blank canvas with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid.
2. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Extracts all objects from the input grid.
3. **`apply(lambda obj: ..., objects(I, T, F, T))`**:  Applies a lambda function to each extracted object.
4. **`lambda obj: branch(color(obj) == 1, recolor(2, obj), obj)`**: For each object:
   - If the object's color is '1', it recolors it to '2'.
   - Otherwise, it keeps the original color.
5. **`merge(...)`**: Merges all the modified objects back together.
6. **`paint(...)`**: Paints the merged objects onto the canvas.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)),  # Create canvas with background color
      merge(
          frozenset(
              recolor(2, obj) if color(obj) == 1 else obj
              for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)
          )
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a generator expression within `frozenset` for a more concise way to recolor objects. It follows the same logic as Version 1, but with a more Pythonic approach.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract all objects
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), # Create canvas with background color
      merge(
          frozenset(
              branch(
                  color(obj) == 1,  # Condition
                  recolor(2, obj),  # Recolor to 2
                  obj                 # Keep original 
              ) 
              for obj in objs
          )
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version first extracts all objects into the `objs` variable and then uses it within the `merge` function for clarity and potential minor performance improvement by avoiding repeated object extraction.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(
        canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)),
        merge(
            frozenset(
                branch(
                    both(color(obj) == 1, not bordering(obj, I)),
                    recolor(2, obj),
                    obj
                )
                for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)
            )
        )
    )
```

**Explanation:**

This version incorporates the `bordering(obj, I)` function into the condition for recoloring. Objects with color '1' are only recolored if they are *not* bordering the grid.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    recolored_objs = frozenset(recolor(2, obj) for obj in objs if color(obj) == 1 and not bordering(obj, I))
    return paint(
        canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)),
        combine(recolored_objs, objs - recolored_objs) # Combine recolored and unchanged objects
    )
```

**Explanation:**

This version takes a different approach by first identifying and recoloring the specific objects that meet the criteria (`recolored_objs`). Then, it uses set operations to combine the `recolored_objs` with the remaining unchanged objects (`objs - recolored_objs`) before painting them onto the canvas. This approach might offer better performance for larger grids with many objects.
