## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves identifying the smallest and largest objects (excluding the background object), switching their colors, and then recoloring the second-largest object to 2.

**Input 0:**
* Smallest object: Single '1' cell at the bottom left.
* Largest object: Cluster of '1's at the bottom left.
* Second largest object: Cluster of '1's at the top center.

**Input 1:**
* Smallest object: Single '1' cell at the top right.
* Largest object: Cluster of '2's in the middle.
* Second largest object: Cluster of '1's at the bottom right. 

**Input 2:**
* Smallest object: Single '1' cell at the bottom right.
* Largest object: Cluster of '1's at the bottom left.
* Second largest object: Cluster of '1's at the top right.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I) # Partition objects without background
  smallest = argmin(objs, size) # Find smallest object
  largest = argmax(objs, size) # Find largest object
  second_largest = argmax(difference(objs, {largest, smallest}), size) # Find second largest
  # Switch colors of smallest and largest objects
  I = paint(recolor(2, smallest), recolor(color(smallest), largest))
  I = paint(I, recolor(color(largest), smallest))
  return paint(I, recolor(2, second_largest)) # Recolor second largest to 2
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `fgpartition(I)` identifies all objects in the grid excluding the background.
2. **Find smallest, largest, and second largest:** `argmin` and `argmax` are used with the `size` function to identify the smallest and largest objects respectively. `difference` is used to exclude the largest and smallest objects when finding the second largest.
3. **Switch colors:** The colors of the smallest and largest objects are swapped using `recolor` and `paint`.
4. **Recolor second largest:** Finally, the second-largest object is recolored to 2.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, False, False, True), key=size) # Sort objects by size
  return paint(
      paint(
          recolor(0, asindices(I)), # Recolor everything to 0
          recolor(color(objs[-1]), objs[0]) # Recolor smallest to largest's color
      ),
      recolor(2, objs[1]) # Recolor second largest to 2
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sort objects:**  `objects(I, False, False, True)` retrieves objects (excluding background) and `sorted` arranges them by size.
2. **Recolor:** The grid is first recolored to 0, then the smallest object takes the color of the largest object (last in sorted list). Finally, the second largest object (second in the sorted list) is recolored to 2.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  sizes = apply(size, objs)
  smallest_size = minimum(sizes)
  largest_size = maximum(sizes)
  second_largest = extract(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) != largest_size and size(obj) != smallest_size)
  return paint(
      paint(
          recolor(0, asindices(I)),
          recolor(2, argmax(objs, size))
      ),
      recolor(1, argmin(objs, size))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object sizes:** This version calculates and stores sizes of all objects.
2. **Find objects:**  It identifies the smallest, largest, and second largest objects based on their calculated sizes.
3. **Recolor:** It recolors everything to 0, the largest object to 2, and the smallest object to 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  smallest = argmin(objs, size)
  largest = argmax(objs, size)
  temp_grid = paint(recolor(0, asindices(I)), recolor(1, largest))
  second_largest = argmax(fgpartition(temp_grid), size)
  return paint(
      paint(
          temp_grid,
          recolor(color(largest), smallest)
      ),
      recolor(2, second_largest)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify smallest and largest:**  Similar to other versions, it identifies the smallest and largest objects.
2. **Temporary Grid:** Creates a temporary grid (`temp_grid`) where everything is recolored to 0 and the largest object is recolored to 1.
3. **Find second largest:**  Identifies the second largest object in the `temp_grid`  (which is the original second largest object).
4. **Recolor:**  Recolors the smallest object with the color of the largest object and the second-largest object to 2 in the original grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = list(fgpartition(I))
  objs.sort(key=size)
  return paint(
      paint(
          recolor(0, asindices(I)),
          recolor(color(objs[-1]), objs[0])
      ),
      recolor(2, objs[1])
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sort objects:** Converts the object set to a list and sorts it by size.
2. **Recolor:** Similar to version 2, it recolors everything to 0, then recolors the smallest object with the color of the largest, and finally recolors the second-largest object to 2.
