## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation can be summarized as follows:

* **Identify objects:** The input grids consist of various objects formed by connected cells of the same value.
* **Color change:**  Objects not touching the border of the grid undergo a color transformation:
    * Value '1' is replaced with '2'.
    * Other values remain unchanged.
* **Border preservation:** Objects touching the grid border retain their original colors.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The central '1' object is transformed into a '2' object. The right '1' object and the bottom '1' object retain their color as they touch the border.
* **Input_1:** The '1' object in the middle of the grid becomes '2'.  The top '1' object, the right '1', and the bottom right '2' object keep their original values due to border contact.
* **Input_2:** The top right '1' object changes to '2'. The '2' object on the right retains its color as it touches the border.  

## Program Versions & Explanations:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find all objects
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  # Identify the background color
  bg_color = mostcommon(I)
  # Create a new grid filled with the background color
  O = canvas(bg_color, shape(I))
  # Iterate over each object
  for obj in objs:
    # Check if the object doesn't touch the border
    if not bordering(obj, I):
      # Recolor the object based on transformation rules
      O = paint(O, recolor(2 if color(obj) == 1 else color(obj), obj))
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj) # Keep original color for bordering objects
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Identifies objects using `objects()`, determines the background color with `mostcommon()`, and creates an empty canvas of the background color using `canvas()`.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each object in the `objs` set.
3. **Border Check:** Uses `bordering()` to determine if the object touches the grid border.
4. **Color Transformation:** If not bordering:
   -  `recolor()` changes the object color to '2' if it's initially '1', otherwise retains the color. 
   - `paint()` applies the recolored object to the output grid `O`.
5. **Border Preservation:** If bordering, the object is painted onto the output grid `O` without color modification.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), 
      merge(
          recolor(2 if color(obj) == 1 else color(obj), obj) 
          if not bordering(obj, I) 
          else obj 
          for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes nested function calls and list comprehension for a more compact representation:

1. **Object Processing:** A list comprehension iterates over objects identified by `objects()`, applying the following logic to each:
   -  `recolor()`:  Changes the object's color to '2' if its original color is '1' and it doesn't touch the border (`not bordering(obj, I)`).
   -  The conditional expression ensures objects touching the border retain their original color.
2. **Painting & Merging:** `merge()` combines all processed objects. Then, `paint()` draws them onto a canvas created with `canvas()` based on the background color (`mostcommon(I)`). 

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(
        canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)),
        merge(
            *(recolor(2, obj) if color(obj) == 1 else obj for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if not bordering(obj, I)),
            *(obj for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if bordering(obj, I))
        )
    )
```

**Explanation:**

This version further streamlines the code using generator expressions and unpacking:

1. **Object Categorization:** Two generator expressions separate objects based on their border contact:
    - The first processes non-bordering objects, recoloring them to '2' if their original color is '1'.
    - The second simply yields bordering objects without modification.
2. **Unpacking and Merging:**  The `*` operator unpacks the generator expressions, and `merge()` combines all objects. 
3. **Painting:** `paint()` draws the merged objects onto the canvas created by `canvas()` using the background color determined by `mostcommon(I)`.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    bg_color = mostcommon(I)
    return paint(
        canvas(bg_color, shape(I)), 
        merge(
            recolor(2, obj) if color(obj) == 1 and not bordering(obj, I) else obj 
            for obj in objs
        )
    )
```

**Explanation:**

This version optimizes the logic within a single generator expression:

1. **Object Identification and Background Color:** `objects()` and `mostcommon()` identify objects and the background color, respectively.
2. **Unified Object Processing:** A single generator expression iterates over objects:
    - `recolor(2, obj)` changes the color to '2' only if the original color is '1' **and** the object doesn't border the grid.
    -  Otherwise, the object remains unchanged. 
3. **Painting and Merging:**  `merge()` combines the processed objects, and `paint()` draws them onto the background canvas.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  bg_color = mostcommon(I)
  transformed_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    if not bordering(obj, I) and color(obj) == 1:
      transformed_objs.add(recolor(2, obj))
    else:
      transformed_objs.add(obj)
  return paint(canvas(bg_color, shape(I)), merge(transformed_objs)) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a separate set to store transformed objects, promoting code clarity:

1. **Object and Background Identification:** `objects()` and `mostcommon()` identify objects and the background color, respectively.
2. **Transformation and Storage:** A loop iterates through each object:
   - If the object doesn't touch the border and its color is '1', it's recolored to '2' using `recolor()` and added to the `transformed_objs` set.
   -  Otherwise, the original object is added to `transformed_objs`.
3. **Painting and Merging:** `merge()` combines the `transformed_objs`, and `paint()` draws them onto the background canvas.
