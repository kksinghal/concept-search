## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the grid and changing the color of the object that is furthest to the right. All other objects retain their original colors. 

**Input 0:** The rightmost object (three '1's) is recolored to '2'.
**Input 1:** The single '1' in the top right corner is the rightmost object and is recolored to '2'. 
**Input 2:** The rightmost object (three '1's on the right edge) is recolored to '2'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  rightmost_obj = argmax(objs, rbind(rightmost, toindices))
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if obj != rightmost_obj:
      O = paint(O, obj) 
  return paint(O, recolor(2, rightmost_obj))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all connected objects in the grid `I`.
2. **Find Rightmost Object:** `rightmost_obj = argmax(objs, rbind(rightmost, toindices))` finds the object with the highest column index using `rightmost` and `toindices`.
3. **Paint Other Objects:** The code iterates through each object in `objs`, and if it's not the `rightmost_obj`, it paints it onto the output grid `O` with its original color.
4. **Recolor Rightmost Object:** Finally, the `rightmost_obj` is recolored to '2' and painted onto the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  rightmost_index = valmax(objs, rbind(rightmost, toindices))
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if rightmost(toindices(obj)) != rightmost_index:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return paint(O, recolor(2, extract(objs, matcher(rightmost, rightmost_index))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Find Rightmost Index:** `rightmost_index = valmax(objs, rbind(rightmost, toindices))`  finds the highest column index of any object cell.
3. **Paint Other Objects:** Iterates through objects and paints them with their original color if their rightmost index doesn't match `rightmost_index`.
4. **Recolor Rightmost Object:** The object with the `rightmost_index` is found using `extract` and `matcher`, recolored to '2', and painted onto the output grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  rightmost_obj = extract(objs, matcher(rightmost, valmax(objs, compose(rightmost, toindices))))
  return paint(cover(I, rightmost_obj), recolor(2, rightmost_obj))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Find Rightmost Object (Concise):** This version finds the rightmost object in a single line using nested functions. It finds the maximum rightmost index and then extracts the object with that index.
3. **Cover and Recolor:** The rightmost object is covered on the input grid, and then the recolored object is painted onto the output grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  rightmost_obj = max(objs, key=lambda obj: rightmost(toindices(obj))) 
  return fill(I, 2, toindices(rightmost_obj))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Find Rightmost Object (Pythonic):** This version utilizes Python's built-in `max` function with a lambda function to find the object with the maximum `rightmost` index.
3. **Fill Rightmost Object:** The `fill` function directly fills the indices of the `rightmost_obj` with '2' on the input grid, effectively recoloring it.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  def rightmost_obj(objs):
    return max(objs, key=lambda obj: rightmost(toindices(obj)))
  return paint(I, recolor(2, rightmost_obj(objs))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Rightmost Function:** Defines an inner function `rightmost_obj` to find the rightmost object, making the code more modular.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** This version recolors the `rightmost_obj` to '2' and paints it onto a copy of the input grid, preserving the original input grid.
