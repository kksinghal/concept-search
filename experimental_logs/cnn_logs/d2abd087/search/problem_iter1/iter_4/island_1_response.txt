## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation relabels connected components (objects) in the input grid based on their size and position relative to the grid's border. 

**General Rule:**

1. **Bordering Objects:** Objects touching the grid border retain their original color.
2. **Non-Bordering Objects:**  Non-bordering objects are relabeled with incrementing colors (1, 2, 3...) based on their size. Larger objects receive smaller color values.

**Illustrative Examples:**

* **Input_0:** The large 5-object at the top becomes color 2, the smaller 5-objects at the bottom left and bottom center become color 2, and the two 5-objects on the left and right borders retain their original color (5).
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, with bordering objects retaining their color and non-bordering objects relabeled by size.
* **Input_2:**  The largest non-bordering object receives color 1, the next largest receives color 2, and so on, while bordering objects remain unchanged.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bordering_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: bordering(obj, I))
  non_bordering_objs = sorted(mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I)), key=size, reverse=True)
  recolored_objs = [recolor(i + 1, toindices(obj)) for i, obj in enumerate(non_bordering_objs)]
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(bordering_objs, recolored_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Uses `objects(I, T, F, T)` to find all connected components (objects) in the input grid `I`.
2. **Separate by Bordering:**  `mfilter` and `bordering(obj, I)` are used to separate objects into `bordering_objs` and `non_bordering_objs` lists.
3. **Sort Non-Bordering:**  `sorted` function with `size` as the key (in reverse) arranges `non_bordering_objs` from largest to smallest.
4. **Recolor by Size:**  A list comprehension `recolor(i + 1, toindices(obj))` recolors non-bordering objects based on their position (larger get smaller color values).
5. **Combine and Paint:** `merge` combines `bordering_objs` (unchanged) and `recolored_objs`. Finally, `paint` applies these objects onto a blank canvas of the same shape as the input.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)),
               merge([recolor(i + 1, toindices(obj)) for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I)), key=size, reverse=True))]+
                     [obj for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if bordering(obj, I)]))
```

**Explanation:**

This version condenses the logic into a single `paint` operation. It uses list comprehensions to recolor non-bordering objects based on size and directly includes bordering objects without modification. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), 
               merge((recolor(i + 1, toindices(obj)) if not bordering(obj, I) else obj 
                     for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(objs, key=size, reverse=True)))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version streamlines the code by first identifying all objects and then using a generator expression within `merge` to conditionally recolor objects based on their bordering status.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), 
               merge(starmap(lambda i, obj: recolor(i + 1, toindices(obj)) if not bordering(obj, I) else obj, 
                             enumerate(sorted(objects(I, T, F, T), key=size, reverse=True)))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages `starmap` to apply a lambda function that conditionally recolors objects based on their bordering status and index in the sorted list of objects.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  border_color = color(next((obj for obj in objs if bordering(obj, I)), None)) 
  return paint(replace(I, border_color, 0),
               merge([recolor(i + 1, toindices(obj)) for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(mfilter(objs, lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I)), key=size, reverse=True))])) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version first identifies the color of bordering objects (if any) and then replaces them with 0 in the input grid. Subsequently, it recolors non-bordering objects based on their size and paints them onto the modified input grid.

**Note:** Each program version achieves the same result but employs different DSL function combinations and logic flow, demonstrating diversity in solution approaches.
