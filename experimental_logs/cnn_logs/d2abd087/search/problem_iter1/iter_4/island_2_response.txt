## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently recolors objects in the input grid based on their position relative to the vertical center line. 

* **Objects entirely or predominantly on the left side of the grid are recolored to '1'.**
* **Objects entirely or predominantly on the right side of the grid are recolored to '2'.**

This applies to all three input-output examples.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return paint(I, merge(
    recolor(ONE if centerofmass(obj)[1] < len(I[0]) // 2 else TWO, obj)
    for obj in objs
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies all distinct objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterates through each identified object.
3. **`centerofmass(obj)[1] < len(I[0]) // 2`:**  Determines if the object's center of mass lies on the left side of the grid's vertical center line.
4. **`recolor(ONE if ... else TWO, obj)`:**  Recolors the object to '1' if its center of mass is on the left, and '2' otherwise.
5. **`merge(...)`:** Combines all the recolored objects.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged, recolored objects onto the input grid `I`, producing the output grid.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  midpoint = len(I[0]) // 2
  return paint(I, merge(
    branch(rightmost(obj) < midpoint, 
           recolor(ONE, obj), 
           recolor(TWO, obj))
    for obj in objs
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies distinct objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`midpoint = len(I[0]) // 2`:** Calculates the horizontal midpoint of the grid.
3. **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterates over each object.
4. **`rightmost(obj) < midpoint`:** Checks if the rightmost point of the object is to the left of the midpoint.
5. **`branch(..., recolor(ONE, obj), recolor(TWO, obj))`:** Recolors the object based on its position. If it's on the left, it's recolored to '1', otherwise '2'.
6. **`merge(...)`:**  Combines all recolored objects.
7. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged objects onto the input grid `I` to generate the output. 

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return paint(I, merge(
    branch(any(j < len(I[0]) // 2 for i, j in toindices(obj)),
           recolor(ONE, obj),
           recolor(TWO, obj))
    for obj in objs
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies distinct objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterates over each object.
3. **`toindices(obj)`:** Gets the indices of all cells in the object.
4. **`any(j < len(I[0]) // 2 for i, j in toindices(obj))`:** Checks if any cell of the object has a column index (`j`) less than the midpoint of the grid, indicating the object is at least partially on the left side. 
5. **`branch(..., recolor(ONE, obj), recolor(TWO, obj))`:** Conditionally recolors the object. If any part is on the left, it's recolored to '1', otherwise '2'.
6. **`merge(...)`:** Combines all the recolored objects.
7. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the merged, recolored objects onto the input grid to produce the output.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return paint(I, merge(
    obj 
    if any(j < len(I[0]) // 2 for i, j in toindices(obj)) 
    else recolor(TWO, obj) 
    for obj in objs
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies distinct objects in the input grid.
2. **`for obj in objs:`:**  Iterates over each identified object.
3. **`any(j < len(I[0]) // 2 for i, j in toindices(obj))`:** Checks if any cell of the object is located on the left half of the grid.
4. **`obj if ... else recolor(TWO, obj)`:** If the object has at least one cell on the left side, it remains unchanged. Otherwise, the entire object is recolored to '2'.
5. **`merge(...)`:**  Combines all the objects, with those on the right potentially recolored.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the combined objects onto the input grid `I`, generating the output. 

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  left_objs = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: leftmost(obj) < len(I[0]) // 2)
  right_objs = objs - left_objs
  return paint(paint(I, recolor(ONE, merge(left_objs))), recolor(TWO, merge(right_objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies all distinct objects in the input grid.
2. **`left_objs = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: leftmost(obj) < len(I[0]) // 2)`:** Filters out and merges the objects whose leftmost point lies on the left side of the grid's vertical center.
3. **`right_objs = objs - left_objs`:**  Gets the remaining objects, implying those on the right side. 
4. **`recolor(ONE, merge(left_objs))`:** Recolors all the objects identified as being on the left side to '1'.
5. **`recolor(TWO, merge(right_objs))`:** Recolors all objects identified as being on the right side to '2'.
6. **`paint(paint(I, ...), ...)`:**  Paints the recolored left objects, then the recolored right objects, onto the input grid, generating the output.
