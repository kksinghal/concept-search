## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the input grid and recoloring them based on their size and whether they touch the grid border.

**Logic:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find all connected regions of non-zero digits in the grid.
2. **Bordering Objects:** Determine which objects touch the grid border.
3. **Size-Based Ordering:** Sort the non-bordering objects by size.
4. **Recoloring:**
    - Bordering objects retain their original color.
    - Non-bordering objects are recolored sequentially, starting from color 1, based on their size order (smallest to largest).

**Example:**

In Input_2:

- The top-most and bottom-most '5' objects are bordering and retain their color.
- The remaining '5' objects are non-bordering and are reordered by size, then recolored as 1 (smallest) and 2 (largest).

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_fn(i, obj):
    return recolor(color(obj) if bordering(obj, I) else i + 1, obj)
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)),
               merge(apply(lambda x: recolor_fn(*x), enumerate(sorted(objects(I, T, F, T), key=size)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`sorted(..., key=size)`:** Sorts the objects based on their size.
3. **`enumerate(...)`:**  Assigns a sequential index to each sorted object.
4. **`recolor_fn(i, obj)`:** 
   - If an object `obj` is bordering, it keeps its original color using `color(obj)`.
   - Otherwise, it gets recolored to `i + 1`, where `i` is the index from the sorted list.
5. **`apply(lambda x: recolor_fn(*x), ...)`:**  Applies the `recolor_fn` to each (index, object) pair.
6. **`merge(...)`:** Combines all recolored objects.
7. **`paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), ...)`:**  Paints the recolored objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    bordering_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: bordering(obj, I))
    non_bordering_objs = difference(objs, bordering_objs)
    recolored_objs = [recolor(i + 1, obj) for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(non_bordering_objs, key=size))]
    return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge((*recolored_objs, *bordering_objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`bordering_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: bordering(obj, I))`:** Filters objects that are touching the border.
3. **`non_bordering_objs = difference(objs, bordering_objs)`:** Filters objects that are not touching the border.
4. **`recolored_objs = [recolor(i + 1, obj) for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(non_bordering_objs, key=size))]`:**  Sorts non-bordering objects by size and recolors them sequentially.
5. **`paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge((*recolored_objs, *bordering_objs)))`:** Paints the recolored and bordering objects onto a blank canvas.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), 
                 merge([recolor(i+1, obj) if not bordering(obj, I) else obj 
                        for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(objects(I, T, F, T), key=size))]))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies all objects.
2. **`sorted(..., key=size)`:** Sorts objects by size.
3. **`enumerate(...)`:** Assigns indices to sorted objects.
4. **`[... for i, obj in ...]`:**  Iterates through (index, object) pairs, recoloring non-bordering objects sequentially and keeping bordering objects unchanged.
5. **`paint(canvas(...), merge(...))`:**  Paints the resulting objects onto a blank canvas.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_fn(obj):
    return recolor(color(obj) if any((i == 0 or j == 0 or i == len(I) - 1 or j == len(I[0]) - 1) for i, j in toindices(obj)) 
                   else index(sorted({size(o) for o in objects(I, T, F, T)}), size(obj) - 1) + 1, obj)
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(apply(recolor_fn, objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`recolor_fn(obj)`:** This function takes an object and determines its new color. 
2. **`any((i == 0 or j == 0 or i == len(I) - 1 or j == len(I[0]) - 1) for i, j in toindices(obj))`:** Checks if any cell of the object is on the border of the grid. 
3. **`index(sorted({size(o) for o in objects(I, T, F, T)}), size(obj) - 1) + 1`:**  This part calculates the new color for non-bordering objects based on their size ranking.
4. **`paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(apply(recolor_fn, objects(I, T, F, T))))`:** This paints the recolor objects on the canvas.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_obj(obj, i):
    return recolor(color(obj) if bordering(obj, I) else i + 1, obj)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), 
               merge([process_obj(obj, i) for i, obj in 
                      enumerate(sorted([obj for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if size(obj) > 1], key=size))])) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Extracts all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **`[obj for obj in ... if size(obj) > 1]`:** Filters out single-cell objects.
3. **`sorted(..., key=size)`:** Sorts the remaining objects by their size.
4. **`enumerate(...)`:**  Assigns a sequential index to each sorted object.
5. **`process_obj(obj, i)`:** Processes each object `obj` with its index `i`:
    - If the object is bordering, it keeps its original color.
    - Otherwise, it is recolored based on its index `i` plus 1.
6. **`merge(...)`:** Merges all the processed objects.
7. **`paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), ...)`:**  Paints the merged objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid. 

Each version utilizes different combinations of DSL functions and logic to achieve the same transformation. This provides a diverse set of solutions, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
