## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation logic for this task involves identifying objects within the input grid and recoloring them based on their position relative to the grid borders. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

* **Objects:** There are two objects, one consisting of five '5's and another consisting of three '5's.
* **Transformation:** The object bordering the grid is recolored to '1'. The other object is recolored to '2'.
* **Logic:** Objects bordering the grid maintain their original color ('5' in this case), while interior objects are assigned new colors starting from '1' and incrementing with each unique object.

**Input_1:**

* **Objects:** Four objects with sizes: nine, four, four, and one.
* **Transformation:** The object bordering the grid retains its color ('5'). The three interior objects are recolored to '1', '2', and '2' respectively.
* **Logic:** Similar to Input_0, with interior objects assigned new colors based on size. Objects with the same size share the same new color.

**Input_2:**

* **Objects:** Four objects with sizes: eleven, seven, five, and two.
* **Transformation:** The object bordering the grid keeps its color ('5'). The interior objects are recolored to '1', '1', and '2' respectively.
* **Logic:** Again, bordering objects retain their color, while interior objects are recolored based on size. Objects with the same size are assigned the same new color.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  def recolor_fn(obj):
    return recolor(color(obj) if bordering(obj, I) else index(sorted({size(o) for o in objects(I, T, F, T)}), size(obj) - 1) + 1, obj)
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(apply(recolor_fn, objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Extracts all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **`{size(o) for o in objects(I, T, F, T)}`:** Creates a set of unique object sizes.
3. **`sorted(...)`:** Sorts the unique sizes in ascending order.
4. **`index(..., size(obj) - 1)`:**  Finds the index of the current object's size in the sorted sizes list (minus 1 to start new colors from 1).
5. **`... + 1`:**  Adds 1 to the index to get the new color for the object.
6. **`color(obj) if bordering(obj, I) else ...`:** Retains the object's original color if it borders the grid; otherwise, assigns the calculated new color.
7. **`recolor(..., obj)`:** Recolors the object with the determined color.
8. **`paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), ...)`:** Creates a canvas filled with '0' and paints the recolored objects onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  def process_object(i, obj):
    return recolor(i + 1, obj) if not bordering(obj, I) else obj
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)),
               merge(apply(process_object,
                           enumerate(sorted(objects(I, T, F, T), key=size, reverse=True)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts all objects from the grid.
2. **`sorted(..., key=size, reverse=True)`:** Sorts the objects by size in descending order.
3. **`enumerate(...)`:** Iterates through the sorted objects, assigning an index to each.
4. **`process_object(i, obj)`:**  Recolors the object based on its index if it's not bordering the grid; otherwise, leaves it unchanged.
5. **`paint(canvas(...), ...)`:** Creates a blank canvas and paints the processed objects.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  non_bordering = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I))
  recolored = [recolor(i + 1, obj) for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(non_bordering, key=size))]
  return paint(I, merge(recolored, sfilter(objs, bordering)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid.
2. **`sfilter(objs, lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I))`:** Filters out objects that don't border the grid.
3. **`sorted(non_bordering, key=size)`:** Sorts the non-bordering objects by their size.
4. **`[recolor(i + 1, obj) for i, obj in ...]`:** Recolors each non-bordering object based on its index in the sorted list, starting from '1'.
5. **`sfilter(objs, bordering)`:** Filters for objects that border the grid.
6. **`paint(I, merge(..., ...))`:**  Paints the recolored non-bordering objects and the original bordering objects onto the input grid. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  def recolor_fn(i, obj):
    return recolor(color(obj) if bordering(obj, I) else i + 1, obj)
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), 
               merge(apply(lambda x: recolor_fn(*x), enumerate(sorted(objects(I, T, F, T), key=size)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid.
2. **`sorted(..., key=size)`:** Sorts objects by their size in ascending order.
3. **`enumerate(...)`:**  Iterates over sorted objects, assigning each an index.
4. **`recolor_fn(i, obj)`:**  Recolors an object based on its index if it's not bordering; otherwise, keeps its original color.
5. **`apply(lambda x: recolor_fn(*x), ...)`:** Applies the `recolor_fn` to each indexed object.
6. **`paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), ...)`:** Paints the recolored objects onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  def recolor_object(obj, i):
    return recolor(i + 1, obj) if not bordering(obj, I) else obj
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)),
                merge(
                  papply(recolor_object,
                          sorted(objects(I, T, F, T), key=size),
                           interval(1, size(objects(I, T, F, T)) + 1, 1))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid.
2. **`sorted(..., key=size)`:** Sorts the objects by size in ascending order.
3. **`interval(1, size(objects(I, T, F, T)) + 1, 1)`:** Generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to the number of objects.
4. **`papply(recolor_object, ..., ...)`:** Applies the `recolor_object` function to pairs of objects and numbers from the generated sequence.
5. **`recolor_object(obj, i)`:**  Recolors an object with the corresponding number if it's not bordering; otherwise, leaves it unchanged.
6. **`paint(canvas(...), ...)`:**  Paints the recolored objects onto a blank canvas.


These five versions provide diverse implementations using different combinations of DSL functions while achieving the same goal of recoloring objects based on their position and size. Each version demonstrates a unique approach to solving the problem within the constraints of the provided DSL.
