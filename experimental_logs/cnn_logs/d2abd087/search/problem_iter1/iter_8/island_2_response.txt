## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be recoloring objects based on their horizontal position relative to the center of the grid.  Objects that are primarily on the left side of the grid are recolored to one color (let's say '1'), and objects primarily on the right side are recolored to another (let's say '2'). 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The top two '5' objects are on the left and recolored to '2'.
* The bottom two '5' objects are on the right and recolored to '1'.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* The large '5' object spans both sides but is primarily on the right, so it's recolored to '2'.
* The smaller '5' objects follow the same pattern as in the previous example.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* Similar to Input_1, the larger '5' objects are recolored based on their primary side. 
* Smaller objects adhere to the left/right recoloring rule. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the `Program_to_be_generated` function:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Extract objects from the grid
  midpoint = width(I) // 2   # Calculate the midpoint
  new_objs = frozenset((ONE if centerofmass(obj)[1] < midpoint else TWO, obj) for obj in objs) # Determine object color based on center of mass
  return paint(I, merge(recolor(color, obj) for color, obj in new_objs)) # Paint the objects with new colors
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify all distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Calculate Midpoint:** Determine the vertical line dividing the grid into left and right halves.
3. **Determine Object Color:** For each object, calculate its center of mass. If the x-coordinate of the center of mass is less than the midpoint, assign color '1'; otherwise, assign color '2'.
4. **Paint Objects:**  Recolor and paint the objects back onto the grid with their new colors.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  midpoint = width(I) // 2
  return paint(I, merge(
    recolor(ONE, obj) if sum(j for i, j in toindices(obj)) < midpoint * len(obj) else recolor(TWO, obj)
    for obj in objs
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify all distinct objects.
2. **Calculate Midpoint:** Find the vertical dividing line.
3. **Determine Object Color:** For each object:
    * Calculate the sum of column indices of its cells.
    * If this sum is less than the midpoint multiplied by the object's size, it's primarily on the left, so recolor it to '1'.
    * Otherwise, recolor it to '2'.
4. **Paint Objects:** Paint the recolored objects onto the grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  midpoint = width(I) // 2
  return paint(I, merge(
    recolor(ONE, obj) if len(intersection(toindices(obj), asindices(lefthalf(I)))) > len(obj) // 2 else recolor(TWO, obj)
    for obj in objs
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Get all distinct objects.
2. **Calculate Midpoint:** Find the vertical dividing line.
3. **Determine Object Color:**  For each object:
    * Find the intersection of its indices with the indices of the left half of the grid.
    * If the size of this intersection is greater than half the object's size, it's primarily on the left, so recolor to '1'.
    * Otherwise, recolor to '2'. 
4. **Paint Objects:** Paint the recolored objects.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  midpoint = width(I) // 2
  left_objs = frozenset(sfilter(objs, lambda obj: centerofmass(obj)[1] < midpoint)) 
  right_objs = objs - left_objs
  return paint(paint(I, recolor(ONE, merge(left_objs))), recolor(TWO, merge(right_objs))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Identify all objects.
2. **Calculate Midpoint:** Determine the vertical dividing line.
3. **Separate Left/Right Objects:** 
    * Filter objects whose center of mass is on the left side of the midpoint.
    * The remaining objects are considered to be on the right side.
4. **Paint Objects:** Paint the left objects with color '1' and the right objects with color '2'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  midpoint = width(I) // 2
  return paint(I, merge(
    branch(rightmost(obj) < midpoint, recolor(ONE, obj), 
           branch(leftmost(obj) >= midpoint, recolor(TWO, obj),
                  branch(size(intersection(toindices(obj), asindices(lefthalf(I)))) > size(obj) // 2, 
                         recolor(ONE, obj), recolor(TWO, obj))))
    for obj in objs
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify objects.
2. **Calculate Midpoint:** Find the vertical division.
3. **Determine Object Color:** For each object:
    * If it's entirely left of the midpoint, recolor to '1'.
    * If it's entirely right of the midpoint, recolor to '2'.
    * If it spans the midpoint, determine the side with a larger portion of the object and recolor accordingly.
4. **Paint Objects:** Paint the objects with their new colors.
