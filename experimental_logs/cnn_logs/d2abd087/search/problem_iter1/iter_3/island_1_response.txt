## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected areas of the same digit) within the input grid and recoloring them based on whether they touch the grid border and their size relative to other non-bordering objects. Here's a breakdown:

* **Bordering Objects:** Objects touching the grid border retain their original color.
* **Non-Bordering Objects:** Non-bordering objects are recolored sequentially based on their size. The largest non-bordering object receives color '1', the second largest receives '2', and so on.

**Illustrative Examples:**

* **Input_0:** The largest object (five '5's) touches the border and retains its color (assumed to be '5'). The two smaller objects (two '5's each) are recolored to '1' and '2' respectively, with '1' assigned to the larger of the two.
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the bordering objects keep their original colors. The largest non-bordering object (four '5's) is recolored to '1', followed by the two smaller objects (two '5's each) recolored to '2'. 
* **Input_2:** The transformation logic remains consistent, with bordering objects retaining their original colors and non-bordering objects recolored based on size.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bordering_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: bordering(obj, I))
  non_bordering_objs = sorted(mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I)), key=size, reverse=True)
  recolored_objs = [recolor(i + 1, obj) for i, obj in enumerate(non_bordering_objs)]
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(bordering_objs, recolored_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Uses `objects(I, T, F, T)` to find all connected objects in the input grid.
2. **Separate Objects:** Divides objects into `bordering_objs` and `non_bordering_objs` based on whether they touch the border using `bordering(obj, I)`.
3. **Sort Non-Bordering Objects:** Sorts `non_bordering_objs` by size in descending order using `sorted(non_bordering_objs, key=size, reverse=True)`.
4. **Recolor:** Assigns new colors to `non_bordering_objs` sequentially starting from '1' using `recolor(i + 1, obj)`.
5. **Combine and Paint:** Creates a blank canvas with `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`. Combines `bordering_objs` (with original colors) and `recolored_objs`. Finally, paints these objects onto the canvas using `paint`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), 
               merge([recolor(i + 1, obj) for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I)), key=size, reverse=True))]+
                     [obj for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if bordering(obj, I)]))
```

**Explanation:**

This version condenses the logic into a single line by directly merging the recolored non-bordering objects and bordering objects within the `paint` function.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  border_color = color(extract(objs, lambda obj: bordering(obj, I))) 
  return paint(replace(I, border_color, 0),
               merge([recolor(i + 1, obj) for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(mfilter(objs, lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I)), key=size, reverse=True))]))
```

**Explanation:**

This version first identifies all objects and the color of a bordering object. Then it replaces the bordering color with 0 in the input grid and paints the recolored non-bordering objects on top.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), 
               merge(sorted([recolor(i + 1 if not bordering(obj, I) else color(obj), obj) for i, obj in enumerate(objs)], key=lambda obj: (not bordering(obj, I), -size(obj)))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version first identifies the background color and all objects. It then recolors the objects, assigning sequential colors to non-bordering objects and preserving the original colors of bordering objects. Finally, it sorts the objects based on bordering status and size before painting them onto a canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), 
               merge(recolor(i + 1, obj) if not bordering(obj, I) else obj 
                     for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(objects(I, T, F, T), key=size, reverse=True))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through all objects, sorted by size. It recolors non-bordering objects sequentially and keeps the original color for bordering objects. It then paints the objects onto a canvas.

These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
