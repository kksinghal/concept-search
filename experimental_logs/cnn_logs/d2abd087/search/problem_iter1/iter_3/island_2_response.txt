## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be summarized as follows:

**Goal:** Recolor objects in the grid based on their horizontal position relative to the center vertical axis. The largest object retains its original color.

**Details:**

1. **Identify Objects:** All distinct objects formed by connected cells of the same value are identified.
2. **Locate Largest Object:** The largest object in the grid is determined based on the number of cells it occupies.
3. **Recolor Based on Position:**  
    * Objects located entirely to the left of the center vertical axis are recolored to '1'.
    * Objects located entirely to the right of the center vertical axis are recolored to '2'.
    * The largest object retains its original color. 

**Example:**

Let's illustrate this with `Input_1`:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0
0 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 5 0
5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 5 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0
0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0
0 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 0 0
0 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

* There are multiple objects formed by the digits '5'.
* The largest object spans the top three rows and partially into the eighth and ninth rows.
* Objects to the left of the center are recolored to '1'.
* Objects to the right of the center are recolored to '2'.
* The largest object retains its '5' color.

This results in `Output_1`:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
0 2 2 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 0 2 2 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 0 2 2 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program implementing the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  largest_obj = argmax(objs, size)
  return paint(I, merge(
    branch(obj == largest_obj, 
           obj, 
           recolor(ONE if rightmost(obj) < len(I[0]) // 2 else TWO, obj)) 
    for obj in objs
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Find Largest:** `argmax(objs, size)` determines the largest object based on size.
3. **Iterate & Recolor:** The code iterates through each object (`obj` in `objs`):
    * `obj == largest_obj`: If the current object is the largest, it's left unchanged.
    * `rightmost(obj) < len(I[0]) // 2`:  If the rightmost column of the object is less than the middle column of the grid, it's on the left side and recolored to '1'.
    * Otherwise, it's on the right side and recolored to '2'.
4. **Merge & Paint:** The recolored objects are merged back (`merge`) and painted onto the original grid `I` using `paint`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  max_size = valmax(objs, size)
  return paint(I, merge(
    branch(size(obj) == max_size, 
           obj, 
           recolor(ONE if centerofmass(obj)[1] < len(I[0]) // 2 else TWO, obj))
    for obj in objs
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Same as Version 1.
2. **Find Largest Size:** `valmax(objs, size)` finds the maximum object size. 
3. **Iterate & Recolor:** Similar to Version 1, but instead of comparing objects directly, it checks if the current object's `size` matches `max_size`.
4. **Merge & Paint:** Same as Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  midpoint = len(I[0]) // 2
  largest = lambda obj: size(obj) == valmax(objs, size)
  return paint(I, merge(
    branch(largest(obj), 
           obj, 
           recolor(ONE if centerofmass(obj)[1] < midpoint else TWO, obj))
    for obj in objs
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Define 'largest' function:** A lambda function `largest` is defined to check if an object's size is the maximum.
3. **Find Midpoint:** Calculates the horizontal midpoint of the grid.
4. **Iterate & Recolor:** Uses the `largest` function for clarity and the `midpoint` variable for conciseness. 
5. **Merge & Paint:** Same as previous versions.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return paint(I, merge(
    recolor(
      branch(size(obj) == valmax(objs, size), 
             color(obj),  # Keep original color 
             ONE if centerofmass(obj)[1] < len(I[0]) // 2 else TWO), 
      obj)
    for obj in objs
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Iterate & Recolor:**  This version streamlines the recoloring logic within the `recolor` function itself.
    *  It determines the new color: original color if largest, '1' if on the left, '2' if on the right.
    * Then, `recolor` is called with the determined color and the object.
3. **Merge & Paint:** Same as previous versions.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  max_obj = argmax(objs, size)
  left_objs = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: centerofmass(obj)[1] < len(I[0]) // 2 and obj != max_obj)
  right_objs = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: centerofmass(obj)[1] >= len(I[0]) // 2 and obj != max_obj)
  return paint(paint(I, recolor(ONE, merge(left_objs))), recolor(TWO, merge(right_objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Find Largest:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Filter Left & Right Objects:**  
    * `left_objs = mfilter(...)` filters objects on the left, excluding the largest object.
    * `right_objs = mfilter(...)` filters objects on the right, excluding the largest object.
4. **Recolor & Paint:**
    *  `recolor(ONE, merge(left_objs))` recolors and merges left objects.
    * `recolor(TWO, merge(right_objs))` recolors and merges right objects.
    * These are then painted onto the original grid in two steps using `paint`. 


These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation while adhering to the provided DSL.
