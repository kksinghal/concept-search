## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently recolors objects in the input grid based on their position relative to the vertical midpoint of the grid. Objects entirely to the left of the midpoint are recolored to '1', and objects entirely to the right are recolored to '2'. 

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**
* The top left '5' object is entirely left of the midpoint and is recolored to '2'.
* The bottom right '5' object is entirely right of the midpoint and is recolored to '2'.
* The remaining '5' object crosses the midpoint and retains its original color. 

**Input_1:**
* The large '5' object spanning the top and left edges is partially on both sides of the midpoint, thus retaining its original color.
* All other '5' objects are recolored to '1' or '2' based on their position relative to the midpoint.

**Input_2:**
* Similar to the previous examples, objects are recolored to '1' or '2' depending on their position relative to the midpoint. Objects crossing the midpoint retain their original color.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def transform(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects from the grid
  midpoint = width(I) // 2   # Calculate the midpoint
  new_objs = [(ONE if rightmost(obj) < midpoint else TWO, obj) for obj in objs]
  return paint(I, merge(recolor(color, obj) for color, obj in new_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies and separates distinct objects from the input grid 'I'. 
2. **Calculate Midpoint:** `width(I) // 2` determines the horizontal middle of the grid.
3. **Recolor Objects:** A list comprehension iterates through each object:
    * `rightmost(obj) < midpoint` checks if the object lies entirely left of the midpoint.
    * Based on the check, `recolor(ONE, obj)` or `recolor(TWO, obj)` assigns the new color.
4. **Paint Recolored Objects:** `paint(I, merge(...))` paints the recolored objects back onto the original grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def transform(I):
  midpoint = width(I) // 2
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      ONE if j < midpoint and v != 0 else 
      TWO if j >= midpoint and v != 0 else 
      v 
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    ) 
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate Midpoint:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:** Nested loops iterate through each cell in the grid.
   * `j < midpoint and v != 0` checks for cells left of the midpoint belonging to an object.
   * `j >= midpoint and v != 0` checks for cells right of the midpoint belonging to an object.
   * Based on the checks, the cell is recolored to '1', '2', or retains its original color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def transform(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  midpoint =  width(I) // 2
  return paint(I, merge(
    branch(rightmost(obj) < midpoint, recolor(ONE, obj), recolor(TWO, obj))
    for obj in objs
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects & Midpoint:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Recolor with Branching:** Uses `branch` for a more concise recoloring logic within the list comprehension.
    * `rightmost(obj) < midpoint` acts as the condition for branching. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def transform(I):
  midpoint = width(I) // 2
  left_mask = canvas(ONE, (height(I), midpoint))
  right_mask = canvas(TWO, (height(I), width(I) - midpoint))
  mask = hconcat(left_mask, right_mask)
  return cellwise(mask, I, 0) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate Midpoint:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Create Masks:** 
   * `left_mask` is a grid filled with '1' representing the left half.
   * `right_mask` is a grid filled with '2' representing the right half.
3. **Combine Masks:** `hconcat` horizontally joins the masks to cover the entire input grid.
4. **Apply Mask:** `cellwise` compares the combined mask with the input grid. 
    * Cells matching the mask adopt the mask's color.
    * Mismatched cells (background) are set to '0'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def transform(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  midpoint = width(I) // 2
  return paint(I, merge(
    recolor(ONE, intersection(obj, asobject(lefthalf(I)))) 
    for obj in objs
  )
  ) | paint(I, merge(
    recolor(TWO, intersection(obj, asobject(righthalf(I)))) 
    for obj in objs
  )) 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Extract Objects & Midpoint:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Split Grid:** `lefthalf(I)` and `righthalf(I)` divide the input into left and right portions.
3. **Find Intersections:** `intersection(obj, asobject(lefthalf(I)))` identifies object parts on the left. Similar logic applies to the right half.
4. **Recolor and Paint:** Objects or their parts are recolored and painted back onto the original grid based on their presence in the left or right half. 

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressive power of the provided DSL.
