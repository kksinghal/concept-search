## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to recolor the objects based on whether they touch the border and their size. Here's a breakdown:

* **Bordering Objects:** Objects touching the grid border retain their original color.
* **Non-Bordering Objects:** These are recolored based on size, with the largest object getting the smallest recolor value (1), the second largest getting the next value (2), and so on.

Let's analyze each input-output pair to confirm:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The single-cell objects at the bottom and right border retain their original color (5).
* The largest non-bordering object (three 5s) is recolored to 2.
* The two smaller non-bordering objects (two 5s each) are recolored to 1.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The objects touching the borders retain their color (5).
* The largest non-bordering object (four 5s) is recolored to 1.
* The three smaller non-bordering objects (two 5s each) are recolored to 2.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The pattern holds consistent with the above observations.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bordering_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: bordering(obj, I))
  non_bordering_objs = sorted(difference(objects(I, T, F, T), bordering_objs), key=size, reverse=True)
  recolored_grid = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), bordering_objs)
  for i, obj in enumerate(non_bordering_objs):
    recolored_grid = paint(recolored_grid, recolor(i + 1, obj))
  return recolored_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Bordering and Non-Bordering Objects:** 
   -  `bordering_objs` stores objects touching the border.
   -  `non_bordering_objs` stores the rest, sorted by size (largest to smallest).

2. **Create Base Canvas:** A canvas of 0s with the input grid's shape.

3. **Paint Bordering Objects:**  The bordering objects are painted onto the canvas with their original colors.

4. **Recolor and Paint Non-Bordering Objects:**  Iterate through the sorted `non_bordering_objs`. Each object is recolored starting from 1 and painted onto the canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), 
               merge([recolor(i + 1 if not bordering(obj, I) else color(obj), obj) 
                      for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(objects(I, T, F, T), key=size, reverse=True))]))
```

**Explanation:**

This version condenses the logic into a single `paint` function call:

1. **Extract and Sort Objects:**  Extract all objects and sort them by size (largest to smallest).

2. **Recolor Based on Border and Size:**  Within a list comprehension:
   -  For each object, determine if it's bordering.
   -  If bordering, keep the original color (`color(obj)`); otherwise, recolor based on its index in the sorted list (`i + 1`).

3. **Paint on Canvas:**  Paint the recolored objects onto a canvas of 0s.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_fn(i, obj):
    return recolor(i + 1 if not bordering(obj, I) else color(obj), obj)
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), 
               merge(apply(lambda x: recolor_fn(*x), enumerate(sorted(objects(I, T, F, T), key=size, reverse=True)))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version introduces a helper function `recolor_fn` for better readability:

1. **Define `recolor_fn`:** Takes an index `i` and an object `obj`. 
   -  Recolors the object based on the border condition and index, similar to version 2.

2. **Extract, Sort, and Apply:** 
   -  Extract all objects and sort them by size.
   -  Use `apply` to apply the `recolor_fn` to each object along with its index from `enumerate`.

3. **Paint Merged Objects:** Paint the merged set of recolored objects onto a canvas.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  bordering_objs = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: bordering(obj, I))
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)),
               merge(bordering_objs, 
                     merge([recolor(i + 1, obj) for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(difference(objs, bordering_objs), key=size, reverse=True))])))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** 
   -  `objs` stores all objects in the input.

2. **Separate and Recolor:**
   -  `bordering_objs`: Objects touching the border.
   -  Non-bordering objects are sorted by size (largest to smallest). Then, they are iterated through and recolored starting from 1.

3. **Combine and Paint:**  The recolored objects and bordering objects are combined using `merge`. Finally, they are painted onto a canvas of 0s.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_obj(obj, idx, bordering_objs):
    return recolor(idx + 1, obj) if obj not in bordering_objs else obj
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  bordering_objs = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: bordering(obj, I))
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), 
               merge([recolor_obj(obj, i, bordering_objs) for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(objs, key=size, reverse=True))]))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a helper function `recolor_obj` and directly passes `bordering_objs` to it:

1. **Define `recolor_obj`:** Takes an object, its potential new color index, and the set of bordering objects.
   -  If the object is not bordering, recolor it using the provided index.
   -  If it's bordering, return the object unchanged.

2. **Identify Objects:** 
   -  `objs` stores all objects.
   -  `bordering_objs` stores objects touching the border.

3. **Recolor and Paint:**  
   -  Sort all objects by size.
   -  Iterate through them, applying `recolor_obj` to handle recoloring based on bordering and size.
   -  Finally, paint the merged set of recolored objects onto a canvas. 

These five versions offer a diverse set of approaches to solve the problem using the DSL, showcasing different strategies for code organization, clarity, and function utilization.
