## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation recolors the objects in the grid based on their size. Here's a breakdown:

* **Object Identification:** Objects are groups of connected, non-zero cells with the same value (considering only direct neighbors, not diagonal). 
* **Bordering Objects:** Objects touching the grid's edge are considered "bordering objects".
* **Size-Based Ordering:** Non-bordering objects are sorted by size in descending order.
* **Recoloring:**  The largest non-bordering object is recolored to 1, the second largest to 2, and so on. Bordering objects retain their original color.

**Let's analyze each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0:** The largest object (5 cells) is recolored to 2, and the two smaller objects (3 cells each) are recolored to 1. 
* **Input_1:** The largest object (9 cells) is recolored to 2, the next largest (6 cells) to 1.  
* **Input_2:** The logic is consistent - the largest object (7 cells) is recolored to 2, and so on.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the `Program_to_be_generated` that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  non_bordering_objs = sorted(filter(lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I), objs), key=size, reverse=True)
  recolored_objs = [recolor(i + 1, obj) for i, obj in enumerate(non_bordering_objs)]
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs + list(filter(lambda obj: bordering(obj, I), objs))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Extracts all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **`non_bordering_objs = ...`:** Filters out the bordering objects and sorts the remaining objects by size in descending order.
3. **`recolored_objs = ...`:** Recolors each non-bordering object based on its size rank (largest gets 1, next gets 2, etc.).
4. **`return paint(...)`:** Creates a blank canvas the same size as the input, paints the recolored objects, and then paints the bordering objects on top, thus preserving their original colors.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bordering_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: bordering(obj, I))
  non_bordering_objs = sorted(mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I)), key=size, reverse=True)
  recolored_grid = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), bordering_objs)
  for i, obj in enumerate(non_bordering_objs):
    recolored_grid = paint(recolored_grid, recolor(i + 1, obj))
  return recolored_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bordering_objs = ...` and `non_bordering_objs = ...`:**  Separates bordering and non-bordering objects.
2. **`recolored_grid = ...`:** Creates a canvas and paints the bordering objects first.
3. **`for i, obj in ...`:** Iterates through the sorted non-bordering objects, painting each one with an incrementing color, starting from 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), 
               merge([recolor(i + 1, obj) for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(filter(lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I), objs), key=size, reverse=True))] +
                     list(filter(lambda obj: bordering(obj, I), objs))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts all objects from the input.
2. **`return paint(...)`:** Creates a blank canvas. The `merge` function combines two lists of objects:
    -  The first list contains re-colored non-bordering objects.
    -  The second list contains the original bordering objects.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    recolored_objs = []
    for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(objs, key=size, reverse=True)):
        recolored_objs.append(recolor(i + 1, obj) if not bordering(obj, I) else obj)
    return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts all objects.
2. **`recolored_objs = []`:** Initializes an empty list to store the processed objects.
3. **`for i, obj in ...`:**  Iterates through sorted objects, recoloring non-bordering ones and appending all (recolored or original) to the `recolored_objs` list.
4. **`return paint(...)`:** Creates a canvas and paints all the objects from `recolored_objs` onto it.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  recolored_objs = [recolor(i + 1, obj) if not bordering(obj, I) else obj 
                    for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(objs, key=size, reverse=True))]
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts all objects.
2. **`recolored_objs = ...`:**  Uses a list comprehension to efficiently iterate through the sorted objects, recoloring non-bordering ones while keeping bordering objects unchanged.
3. **`return paint(...)`:**  Paints the processed objects onto a blank canvas.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation. They showcase the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for spatial reasoning tasks.
