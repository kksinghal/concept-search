## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently recolors the objects in the input grid based on whether they are bordering the grid or not. 

* **Bordering Objects:** Objects touching the edge of the grid retain their original color.
* **Non-Bordering Objects:** Non-bordering objects are recolored sequentially, with the largest object receiving color 1, the second largest receiving color 2, and so on. 

Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
* The two single-cell objects and the outer frame of '5's are bordering objects, so they retain their original colors (0 and 5 respectively).
* The 3x3 square of '5's and the two horizontally adjacent '5's are non-bordering. The 3x3 square is the largest and becomes color 2. The two adjacent '5's form the second largest object and become color 1.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
* The outer frame of '5's is the only bordering object and retains its original color (5).
* The 4x4 square, the four vertically adjacent '5's, and the single '5' are non-bordering. The 4x4 square becomes color 2, the four adjacent '5's become color 1, and the single '5' remains unchanged as it's the smallest.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
*  The logic from the previous examples applies here as well. The bordering objects retain their original colors, and the non-bordering objects are recolored sequentially based on size.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bordering_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: bordering(obj, I))
  non_bordering_objs = sorted(mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I)), key=size, reverse=True)
  recolored_objs = [recolor(i + 1, obj) for i, obj in enumerate(non_bordering_objs)]
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(bordering_objs, recolored_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Separate Objects:** `bordering_objs` filters for bordering objects, and `non_bordering_objs` filters for non-bordering objects, sorted by size in descending order.
3. **Recolor Objects:** `recolored_objs` recolors the non-bordering objects sequentially based on their size order.
4. **Combine and Paint:**  A new canvas is created with `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`. Then, `paint` function paints both the bordering objects and the recolored non-bordering objects onto this canvas, producing the final output.


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  recolored_objs = []
  for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(objs, key=lambda obj: (-size(obj), bordering(obj, I)))):
    recolored_objs.append(recolor(i + 1 if not bordering(obj, I) else color(obj), obj))
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects.
2. **Sort Objects:**  Objects are sorted first by size (descending) and then by whether they are bordering (bordering objects last).
3. **Recolor Objects:**  Iterates through the sorted objects and recolors them. Non-bordering objects are recolored sequentially, while bordering objects retain their original color using `color(obj)`.
4. **Combine and Paint:** Similar to Version 1, the recolored objects are painted onto a new canvas.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(objects(I, T, F, T), key=lambda obj: (bordering(obj, I), -size(obj)))):
    O = underpaint(O, recolor(i + 1 if not bordering(obj, I) else color(obj), obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** Starts with a blank canvas.
2. **Sort Objects:** Objects are sorted by bordering status (bordering objects first) and then by size (descending).
3. **Iterative Recoloring and Painting:** Iterates through the sorted objects. For each object, it recolors it based on its bordering status and size order and then uses `underpaint` to paint it onto the existing canvas. This ensures that previously painted objects are not overwritten.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), 
               merge([recolor(i + 1, obj) for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I)), key=size, reverse=True))]+
                     [obj for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if bordering(obj, I)]))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Background:**  Determines the background color of the input grid.
2. **Create Canvas:** Creates a new canvas filled with the background color.
3. **Separate Objects:**  Separates bordering and non-bordering objects.
4. **Recolor Non-Bordering:**  Recolors non-bordering objects sequentially based on size.
5. **Combine and Paint:** Combines the recolored non-bordering objects with the bordering objects and paints them onto the canvas.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  border_color = color(extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: bordering(obj, I)))
  non_border_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I))
  recolored_objs = [recolor(i + 1, obj) for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(non_border_objs, key=size, reverse=True))] 
  return paint(replace(I, border_color, 0), merge(recolored_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Border Color:** Extracts the color of a bordering object.
2. **Separate Objects:** Separates bordering and non-bordering objects.
3. **Recolor Non-Bordering:** Recolors non-bordering objects sequentially based on size.
4. **Replace Border Color:** Replaces the original border color in the input grid with 0. 
5. **Combine and Paint:**  Combines the recolored non-bordering objects with the modified input grid, effectively painting the recolored objects while preserving the original colors of all other cells.
