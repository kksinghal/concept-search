## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to recolor the non-bordering objects in the input grid based on their size. The largest non-bordering object gets color 1, the second-largest gets color 2, and so on. The bordering objects retain their original color. 

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The largest non-bordering object (5x3) is recolored to 2. 
* The two smaller non-bordering objects (2x2) are recolored to 1.
* Bordering objects retain their original color (5).

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* The largest non-bordering object (4x2) is recolored to 2.
* The second-largest non-bordering object (3x2) is recolored to 1.
* The smallest non-bordering object (1x1) is also recolored to 1 as it's the only remaining non-bordering object.
* Bordering objects retain their original color (5).

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* The largest non-bordering object (5x1) is recolored to 2.
* The second-largest non-bordering object (2x2) is recolored to 1.
* Bordering objects retain their original color (5).

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bordering_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: bordering(obj, I))
  non_bordering_objs = sorted(mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I)), key=size, reverse=True)
  recolored_objs = [recolor(i + 1, obj) for i, obj in enumerate(non_bordering_objs)]
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(bordering_objs, recolored_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify bordering and non-bordering objects:** `bordering_objs` and `non_bordering_objs` are created using `objects`, `mfilter`, and `bordering`.
2. **Sort non-bordering objects by size:** `non_bordering_objs` is sorted in descending order of size using `sorted` and `size`.
3. **Recolor non-bordering objects:** `recolored_objs` is created by iterating through `non_bordering_objs` and recoloring them incrementally based on their index (`i + 1`) using `recolor`.
4. **Combine and paint:** Finally, a blank canvas is created using `canvas` and `shape(I)`. The `bordering_objs` and `recolored_objs` are merged using `merge` and painted onto the canvas using `paint`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  recolored_objs = []
  for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(objs, key=lambda obj: (bordering(obj, I), -size(obj)))):
    color = i + 1 if not bordering(obj, I) else color(obj)
    recolored_objs.append(recolor(color, obj))
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify all objects:** `objs` is created using `objects`.
2. **Sort objects:** `objs` is sorted based on two criteria: (a) Whether it's bordering (using `bordering`) and (b) size (using `size`).  Bordering objects come first, and within each category, they are sorted by descending size.
3. **Recolor objects:** `recolored_objs` is created by iterating through the sorted `objs`. Each object is recolored based on its index (`i + 1`) only if it's not bordering. Bordering objects retain their original color using `color(obj)`.
4. **Combine and paint:** Similar to version 1, a blank canvas is created and the `recolored_objs` are merged and painted onto it.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  border_color = color(first(objects(I, T, F, T)))
  non_border_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I))
  recolored_objs = []
  for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(non_border_objs, key=size, reverse=True)):
    recolored_objs.append(recolor(i + 1 if len(non_border_objs) > 1 else border_color, obj))
  return paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify border color and non-bordering objects:** Similar to previous versions, `non_border_objs` is identified. Additionally, the color of the first object is considered the border color (`border_color`).
2. **Sort non-bordering objects:** Same as version 1.
3. **Recolor non-bordering objects:**  `recolored_objs` is created by iterating through the sorted `non_bordering_objs`.  The recoloring logic here considers the case where there's only one non-bordering object. In such a case, it retains the `border_color`. Otherwise, it recolors incrementally.
4. **Combine and paint:**  Instead of creating a blank canvas, this version directly paints the `recolored_objs` onto the original input grid `I`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  border_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: bordering(obj, I))
  non_border_objs = difference(objs, {border_obj})
  recolored_objs = []
  for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(non_border_objs, key=size, reverse=True)):
    recolored_objs.append(recolor(i + 1, obj))
  return paint(canvas(color(border_obj), shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects and border object:** Similar to previous versions, but here, we explicitly extract the `border_obj` using `extract` and `bordering`.
2. **Remove border object:** `non_border_objs` is created by removing the `border_obj` from `objs` using `difference`.
3. **Sort and recolor:** Similar to previous versions.
4. **Create canvas with border color and paint:**  A canvas is created with the color of the `border_obj` using `canvas`, `color(border_obj)`, and `shape(I)`. The `recolored_objs` are merged and painted onto this canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  recolored_grid = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(objects(I, T, F, T), key=lambda obj: (-size(obj), bordering(obj, I)))):
    new_color = i + 1 if not bordering(obj, I) else index(I, first(toindices(obj)))
    recolored_grid = paint(recolored_grid, recolor(new_color, obj))
  return recolored_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize canvas:** `recolored_grid` is initialized as a blank canvas using `canvas` and `shape(I)`.
2. **Sort objects:**  All objects are sorted based on (a) size in descending order and (b) whether they are bordering. This ensures that larger objects are recolored first, and within each size category, non-bordering objects are prioritized.
3. **Iterate and recolor:** The code iterates through the sorted objects. If an object is not bordering, it's recolored based on its index (`i + 1`). If it's bordering, it retains its original color, extracted from the input grid `I` using `index`, `toindices`, and `first`.
4. **Paint and return:** Each object, with its determined color, is painted onto the `recolored_grid`, which is finally returned.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation. Each version utilizes different combinations of DSL functions, highlighting the flexibility and power of the provided DSL for solving this spatial reasoning task.
