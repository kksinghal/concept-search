## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation recolors objects in the input grid based on their size and bordering status. It prioritizes bordering objects and then sorts non-bordering objects by size in descending order. The recoloring scheme is as follows:

1. **Bordering Objects:** Retain their original color.
2. **Largest Non-Bordering Object:** Color 1
3. **Second Largest Non-Bordering Object:** Color 2
4. **And so on...**

**Example:**

In Input_0, the object at the bottom left corner is the largest and is recolored to 1. The bordering objects retain their original color (5).  The next largest object is assigned color 2, and so on.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  bordering_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: bordering(obj, I))
  non_bordering_objs = sorted(mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I)), key=size, reverse=True)
  recolored_grid = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), bordering_objs)
  for i, obj in enumerate(non_bordering_objs):
    recolored_grid = paint(recolored_grid, recolor(i + 1, toindices(obj)))
  return recolored_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Program B, it identifies bordering and non-bordering objects.
2. **Sort Non-Bordering Objects:** It sorts non-bordering objects by size in descending order.
3. **Initialize Canvas:** It creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.
4. **Paint Bordering Objects:** It paints the bordering objects onto the canvas with their original colors.
5. **Paint Non-Bordering Objects:** It iterates through the sorted non-bordering objects and paints them onto the canvas with incrementing colors, starting from 1.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, T, F, T), key=lambda obj: (bordering(obj, I), -size(obj)))
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge([recolor(i + 1 if not bordering(obj, I) else color(obj), toindices(obj)) for i, obj in enumerate(objs)]))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sort All Objects:**  It sorts all objects based on bordering status (prioritizing bordering objects) and then by size in descending order.
2. **Recolor and Paint:** It iterates through the sorted objects and recolors them based on their position in the sorted list. Bordering objects retain their color, while non-bordering objects are assigned colors starting from 1. It then paints these recolored objects onto a blank canvas.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge([recolor(i + 1 if i > len(bordering_objs) - 1 else color(obj), toindices(obj)) for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(objects(I, T, F, T), key=lambda obj: (bordering(obj, I), -size(obj))))]))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sort Objects:** Similar to Version 2, it sorts objects based on bordering status and size.
2. **Recolor and Paint (One-liner):** It combines the recoloring and painting into a single line. It iterates through the sorted objects, recoloring them based on their index relative to the number of bordering objects. It then paints these objects directly onto a blank canvas.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  bordering_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), bordering)
  non_bordering_objs = sorted(difference(objects(I, T, F, T), bordering_objs), key=size, reverse=True)
  return paint(paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), bordering_objs), 
               merge([recolor(i + 1, toindices(obj)) for i, obj in enumerate(non_bordering_objs)]))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Separate Objects:** Similar to previous versions, it identifies bordering and non-bordering objects.
2. **Paint in Stages:** It first paints the bordering objects with their original colors onto a blank canvas. Then, it paints the non-bordering objects in descending order of size with incrementing colors starting from 1.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
    def recolor_fn(i, obj):
        return recolor(i + 1 if not bordering(obj, I) else color(obj), toindices(obj))
    return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda x: recolor_fn(*x), enumerate(sorted(objects(I, T, F, T), key=lambda obj: (bordering(obj, I), -size(obj)))))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Helper Function:** It defines a helper function `recolor_fn` to handle the recoloring logic based on bordering status and index.
2. **Sort Objects:** It sorts objects based on bordering status and size.
3. **Apply and Paint:** It uses `apply` to apply the `recolor_fn` to each object in the sorted list, effectively recoloring them. It then paints these recolored objects onto a blank canvas.

These are five distinct versions of the program, each using a slightly different approach to achieve the same transformation.
