## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying each non-zero digit in the input grid and drawing a 3x3 square of '3's centered on that digit's location. The original digits are preserved within the square.

**Input_0 Example:**

* A '2' is located at (3, 3). The transformation places a 3x3 square of '3's centered at (3, 3), resulting in the '2' being surrounded by '3's.
* This process repeats for all other '2's in the grid.

**Input_1 Example:**

* Similar to Input_0, each non-zero digit ('2' in this case) is used as a center point for a 3x3 square of '3's.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find all non-zero objects
  objs = difference(partition(I), colorfilter(partition(I), ZERO))

  # Function to create a 3x3 square of '3's centered at a given index
  def create_square(index):
    i, j = index
    return frozenset({(THREE, (i + di, j + dj)) for di in range(-1, 2) for dj in range(-1, 2)})

  # Create squares for each cell of the objects
  new_objs = mapply(lambda obj: mapply(create_square, toindices(obj)), objs)

  # Paint the squares onto the input grid
  O = paint(I, merge(new_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Non-Zero Objects:** `difference(partition(I), colorfilter(partition(I), ZERO))` isolates objects formed by non-zero digits.
2. **Create Square Function:** `create_square(index)` generates a set of cells representing a 3x3 square of '3's centered at the input `index`.
3. **Apply Square Creation:** `mapply` applies `create_square` to each cell within each non-zero object. 
4. **Paint Squares:** The generated squares are combined and painted onto the input grid `I` using the `paint` function.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Create a blank canvas of '3's with the same dimensions as the input
  canvas_threes = canvas(THREE, shape(I)) 

  # Overlay the input grid onto the canvas of '3's
  O = cellwise(canvas_threes, I, THREE)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create '3's Canvas:** `canvas(THREE, shape(I))` creates a grid of '3's with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. **Overlay Grids:**  `cellwise(canvas_threes, I, THREE)` iterates through both grids. If the cells match, the input cell value is kept; otherwise, the '3' from `canvas_threes` is used.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find all indices of non-zero values in the grid
  non_zero_indices = frozenset((i, j) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, val in enumerate(row) if val != ZERO)

  # Create a set of 3x3 squares centered at each non-zero index
  squares = mapply(lambda index: frozenset((i + di, j + dj) for di in range(-1, 2) for dj in range(-1, 2)), non_zero_indices)

  # Fill the squares with '3's on the input grid
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(squares))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Non-Zero Indices:**  `non_zero_indices` stores the locations of all non-zero digits.
2. **Generate Squares:** For each non-zero index, a 3x3 square of indices is generated.
3. **Fill Squares:** The `fill` function paints '3's onto the input grid at all indices within the generated squares. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    # Get the dimensions of the input grid
    h, w = shape(I)
    
    # Create a new grid filled entirely with zeros
    O = canvas(ZERO, (h, w))
    
    # Iterate through the input grid
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            # If a cell is non-zero, draw a 3x3 square of '3's around it 
            if I[i][j] != ZERO:
                for di in range(-1, 2):
                    for dj in range(-1, 2):
                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                        if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w:
                            O = paint(O, {(THREE, (ni, nj))})
                # Preserve the original non-zero value in the center
                O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** Generates a grid of zeros with the same dimensions as the input.
2. **Iterate and Paint:** Loops through each cell of the input grid. If a non-zero value is encountered, a 3x3 square of '3's is drawn around it on the new canvas. 
3. **Preserve Original Value:**  After drawing the square, the original non-zero value is painted back onto the center of the square, preserving it.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Define a function to create the surrounding pattern for a single cell
  def create_pattern(i, j):
    pattern = {(THREE, (i+di, j+dj)) for di in range(-1, 2) for dj in range(-1, 2)}
    pattern.discard((i, j))  # Remove the center cell from the pattern
    return pattern
  
  # Create the new object by applying the pattern function to each non-zero cell
  new_obj = frozenset((v, idx) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(row) 
                    if v != ZERO for idx in create_pattern(i, j))

  # Paint the new object onto the input grid
  O = paint(I, new_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `create_pattern` Function:** Generates the 8 surrounding cells of a given cell, excluding the center itself. 
2. **Create New Object:** Iterates through the grid and applies `create_pattern` to each non-zero cell, generating a set of all surrounding '3' positions. 
3. **Paint and Return:** The new object (the surrounding '3's) is painted directly onto the input grid, preserving the original non-zero values.
