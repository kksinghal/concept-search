## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying non-background objects and creating a border around them using the value '3'. The border extends one cell outwards in all directions, including diagonals. 

**Example:**

```
Input:           Output:
0 0 2 0 0        0 0 3 3 3 0
0 0 0 2 0        0 0 3 2 3 0
0 0 0 2 0  --->  0 0 3 2 3 0
0 0 0 0 0        0 0 3 3 3 0
                  0 0 0 0 0 
```

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T) # Find all non-background objects
  shifted_objs_up_left = mapply(lambda o: shift(o, (-1, -1)), objs) # Shift objects up-left
  shifted_objs_down_right = mapply(lambda o: shift(o, (1, 1)), objs) # Shift objects down-right
  expanded_boxes = mapply(lambda o: box(toindices(o)), shifted_objs_up_left) | mapply(lambda o: box(toindices(o)), shifted_objs_down_right) # Calculate bounding boxes of all shifted objects
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(expanded_boxes)) # Fill the bounding boxes with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, F, T, T)` finds all non-background objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Shift Objects:** We create two sets of shifted objects - one shifted up-left and the other shifted down-right.
3. **Bounding Boxes:** For each shifted object, `box(toindices(o))` calculates the bounding box indices.
4. **Merge & Fill:** The bounding boxes of all shifted objects are merged, and these indices are filled with '3' in the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T)  # Find all non-background objects
  expanded_indices = mapply(lambda o: backdrop(toindices(o)), objs)  # Get the backdrop indices for each object
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(expanded_indices))  # Fill the backdrop indices with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, F, T, T)` finds all non-background objects in the input grid.
2. **Backdrop Indices:** `backdrop(toindices(o))` calculates the indices of the bounding box for each object, effectively including one extra layer of cells around the object.
3. **Merge & Fill:** The backdrop indices for all objects are merged, and these indices are filled with '3' in the output grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T) # Find all non-background objects
  object_indices = mapply(toindices, objs) # Extract indices of all objects
  expanded_indices = frozenset({n for idx in object_indices for n in neighbors(idx) if n[0] >= 0 and n[1] >= 0})  # Include neighbors for each index within bounds
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(expanded_indices)|object_indices) # Fill the expanded indices and original object indices with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects & Indices:** The code identifies objects and their indices similar to previous versions.
2. **Neighbor Expansion:** For each object index, it finds its neighboring indices using `neighbors(idx)`, but only includes valid neighbors within the grid bounds.
3. **Merge & Fill:** The expanded neighbor indices, along with the original object indices, are merged. These combined indices are filled with '3' in the output grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, F, T, T) # Find all non-background objects
    dilated_objs = mapply(lambda o: toobject(delta(toindices(o)), I), objs) # Create dilated objects using delta
    O = paint(I, merge(dilated_objs)) # Paint the dilated objects onto the input grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The code identifies non-background objects.
2. **Dilation:** For each object, it finds its delta (`delta(toindices(o))`) -  the bounding box excluding the object itself.  It then converts these delta indices back to an object representation (`toobject`). This effectively creates a "dilated" version of each object.
3. **Paint Dilated Objects:**  All dilated objects are merged, and then painted directly onto the input grid (`paint`). This effectively draws the border around the original objects.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T)  # Find all non-background objects
  shifted_objs = [shift(o, d) for o in objs for d in [(-1,-1),(-1,0),(-1,1),(0,-1),(0,1),(1,-1),(1,0),(1,1)]]
  expanded_boxes = mapply(lambda o: toindices(o), shifted_objs)  # Extract indices from shifted objects
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(expanded_boxes))  # Fill the expanded indices with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Eight-Directional Shift:** It shifts each object in all eight directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) using list comprehension.
3. **Extract Indices & Fill:** The indices of all shifted objects are extracted and merged. These indices are then filled with '3' in the output grid. 

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieving the same transformation using various DSL functions and logic, demonstrating diverse solutions within the limitations of the provided DSL.
