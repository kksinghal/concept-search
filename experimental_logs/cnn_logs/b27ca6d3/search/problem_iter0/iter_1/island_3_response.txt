## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:** The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '2' (excluding the background of '0'). For each of these objects, a 3x3 square of the digit '3' is drawn, centered on the location of the '2' in the original grid.  The original '2's are preserved.

**Input 1 to Output 1:** Similar to the first transformation, this one identifies objects of '2's. However, instead of squares, a '3' border is drawn around each object. The border extends one cell in each direction (up, down, left, right) from the object's edges. The original '2's are preserved.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") that achieve the desired transformations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  new_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    center_i, center_j = centerofmass(obj)
    square = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(center_i - 1, center_i + 2) for j in range(center_j - 1, center_j + 2))
    new_objs = combine(new_objs, recolor(3, square))
  O = paint(I, new_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objs = objects(I, True, False, True)` finds all objects formed by non-zero digits, treating '0' as background.
2. **Iterate and Draw Squares:** For each object `obj` in `objs`:
   -  `center_i, center_j = centerofmass(obj)` finds the object's center.
   -  `square = ...` generates the indices of a 3x3 square centered at the object's center.
   -  `new_objs = combine(new_objs, recolor(3, square))` adds the recolored square to the `new_objs` set.
3. **Paint to Grid:** `O = paint(I, new_objs)` paints the new squares (recolored to '3') onto the original grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    border_cells = frozenset()
    for obj in objs:
        for i, j in toindices(obj):
            border_cells = combine(border_cells, dneighbors((i, j))) 
    border_cells = difference(border_cells, toindices(merge(objs)))
    O = paint(I, recolor(3, border_cells))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Border Cells:** Similar to Version 1, we identify objects. Then, for each cell in each object, we find its direct neighbors and add them to the `border_cells` set.
2. **Remove Object Cells:** `border_cells = difference(border_cells, toindices(merge(objs)))` removes any cells that are part of the original objects, leaving only the actual border cells.
3. **Paint Border:** `O = paint(I, recolor(3, border_cells))` paints the border cells (recolored to '3') onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  border = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    for cell in toindices(obj):
      border = combine(border, difference(neighbors(cell), toindices(obj)))
  O = paint(I, recolor(3, border))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **Identify Objects and Borders:** This version directly calculates the border cells for each object by finding all neighbors of each object cell and removing the object cells themselves.
- **Paint Borders:** Similar to previous versions, it then paints the identified border cells onto the original grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  new_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      for di in range(-1, 2):
        for dj in range(-1, 2):
          new_grid = fill(new_grid, 3, {(i+di, j+dj)})
  O = paint(new_grid, asobject(I)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **Create Empty Canvas and Fill Squares:** This version first creates an empty canvas of the same size as the input. Then, it iterates over each object and fills a 3x3 square around each cell of the object with the digit '3'.
- **Paint Original Objects:** Finally, it paints the original objects from the input grid onto the new grid, effectively overwriting the '3's where the original objects were.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  border = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) != 2: continue
    for cell in toindices(obj):
      border = combine(border, difference(dneighbors(cell), toindices(obj)))
  O = underfill(I, 3, border)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **Partition and Filter Objects:** This version partitions the grid into objects but only considers objects with the color '2'. 
- **Calculate and Underfill Borders:** It calculates the border cells for these objects and uses `underfill` to place '3's only in the background cells within the border. 

These are five different ways to implement the desired transformations. Each version utilizes different combinations of DSL functions, demonstrating the flexibility and diversity of solutions possible within the given DSL.
