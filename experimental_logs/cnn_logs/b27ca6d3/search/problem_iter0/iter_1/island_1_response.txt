## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation for both input-output pairs seems to be:

**Identify objects with the value '2' that are adjacent to the background (value '0'). Surround these specific '2'-valued objects with a border of the value '3'.** 

Let's break it down:

1. **Object Detection:** The input grid is analyzed to identify distinct objects formed by connected cells of the same value. 
2. **Value Filtering:** Objects with the value '2' are specifically selected.
3. **Adjacency Check:** For each selected '2'-valued object, the program checks if any of its neighboring cells belong to the background (value '0').
4. **Border Creation:** If an adjacent background cell is found, the object is considered a border object. A border of '3's is then created around the object. This likely involves finding the bounding box of the object and filling the surrounding cells with the value '3'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1 (Inspired by object manipulation):**

```python
def efcfbaihajbceebcijcgbgjgefadbdhi(I):
  objs = objects(I, diagonal=False, univalued=True, without_bg=True)
  border_objs = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2 and any(adjacent(toindices(obj), toindices(other_obj)) for other_obj in objs if color(other_obj) == 0))
  O = paint(I, recolor(3, merge(apply(backdrop, border_objs))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`objs = objects(I, diagonal=False, univalued=True, without_bg=True)`**: Identifies objects in the input grid (`I`), considering only directly adjacent cells (`diagonal=False`) for object formation. Each object must have a single value (`univalued=True`), and the background is excluded (`without_bg=True`).
2.  **`border_objs = mfilter(...)`**: Filters the objects to select those that meet two conditions:
    *   **`color(obj) == 2`**: The object's color is 2.
    *   **`any(adjacent(toindices(obj), toindices(other_obj)) for other_obj in objs if color(other_obj) == 0)`**: The object is adjacent to another object with color 0 (background).
3.  **`O = paint(I, recolor(3, merge(apply(backdrop, border_objs))))`**: 
    *   **`apply(backdrop, border_objs)`**:  Applies the `backdrop` function to each border object to get a set of indices forming their bounding boxes.
    *   **`merge(...)`**: Merges the bounding box indices of all border objects.
    *   **`recolor(3, ...)`**: Recolors the merged indices to the value 3, creating the border.
    *   **`paint(I, ...)`**: Paints the border onto the original input grid (`I`) to generate the output grid (`O`).

**Program Version 2 (Inspired by direct index manipulation):**

```python
def cheibahbecaaeebdijecefhifiaecbde(I):
  two_indices = ofcolor(I, 2)
  border_indices = mfilter(two_indices, lambda loc: any(n in ofcolor(I, 0) for n in neighbors(loc)))
  O = fill(I, 3, backdrop(border_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`two_indices = ofcolor(I, 2)`**:  Gets the indices of all cells with the value 2 in the input grid (`I`).
2.  **`border_indices = mfilter(...)`**:  Filters the indices of 2-valued cells to select only those that have at least one neighboring cell with the value 0:
    *   **`lambda loc: any(n in ofcolor(I, 0) for n in neighbors(loc))`**: For each location (`loc`) of a 2-valued cell, it checks if any of its neighbors (`neighbors(loc)`) is present in the set of indices of 0-valued cells (`ofcolor(I, 0)`).
3.  **`O = fill(I, 3, backdrop(border_indices))`**: 
    *   **`backdrop(border_indices)`**:  Calculates the bounding box indices for the `border_indices`.
    *   **`fill(I, 3, ...)`**: Fills the bounding box indices with the value 3 on the original grid (`I`), generating the output grid (`O`).

**Program Version 3 (Using a nested loop approach):**

```python
def abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz(I):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    O = [[I[i][j] for j in range(w)] for i in range(h)]
    for i in range(1, h - 1):
        for j in range(1, w - 1):
            if I[i][j] == 2 and any(I[ni][nj] == 0 for ni, nj in [(i - 1, j), (i + 1, j), (i, j - 1), (i, j + 1)]):
                for ni, nj in [(i - 1, j - 1), (i - 1, j), (i - 1, j + 1), (i, j - 1), (i, j + 1), (i + 1, j - 1), (i + 1, j), (i + 1, j + 1)]:
                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w:
                        O[ni][nj] = 3
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates a copy of the input grid (`O`) and gets the height (`h`) and width (`w`) of the grid.
2. **Iteration:** Iterates over each cell of the input grid (`I`), excluding the border rows and columns.
3. **Condition Check:** For each cell, checks if it's a '2' and has an adjacent '0'.
4. **Border Filling:** If the conditions are met, fills all neighboring cells (including diagonals) of the current cell in the output grid (`O`) with the value '3'.
5. **Output:** Returns the modified output grid (`O`).

**Program Version 4 (Leveraging `dneighbors` for adjacency check):**

```python
def solve_task(I):
  two_indices = ofcolor(I, 2)
  border_indices = mfilter(two_indices, lambda loc: any(neighbor in ofcolor(I, 0) for neighbor in dneighbors(loc)))
  border_and_surrounding = merge(apply(lambda loc: dneighbors(loc) | {loc}, border_indices))
  O = fill(I, 3, border_and_surrounding)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`two_indices = ofcolor(I, 2)`:** Identifies indices of cells with value '2'.
2. **`border_indices = mfilter(...)`:** Filters '2' indices to find those adjacent to '0' using `dneighbors`.
3. **`border_and_surrounding = ...`:** Expands `border_indices` to include directly neighboring cells using `dneighbors` and set union.
4. **`O = fill(I, 3, border_and_surrounding)`:** Fills the expanded set of indices with '3' on the input grid to produce the output.

**Program Version 5 (Combining `ofcolor` and `neighbors` for conciseness):**

```python
def transform_grid(I):
  border_indices = mfilter(ofcolor(I, 2), lambda loc: any(n in ofcolor(I, 0) for n in neighbors(loc)))
  O = fill(I, 3, merge(apply(neighbors, border_indices)) | border_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`border_indices = ...`:** Directly identifies indices of '2's adjacent to '0's by combining `ofcolor` and `neighbors` in the `mfilter`.
2. **`O = fill(...)`:** Calculates the border region by merging `border_indices` with their neighbors and fills it with '3' on the input grid to generate the output.


Each of these program versions represents a distinct approach to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and diversity of the provided DSL.
