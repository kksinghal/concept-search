## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place in these input-output pairs involves identifying non-background objects and extending their bounding boxes by one unit in all directions. The extended area is then filled with the value '3'.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. Objects formed by the digit '2' are identified.
2. The bounding box of each object is expanded outward by one unit.
3. The expanded area is filled with the digit '3', effectively creating a border around each object.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

The same logic applies to Input_1. The bounding boxes of the '2' objects are expanded and filled with '3'.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct code versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T)  # Find non-background objects
  expanded_boxes = mapply(lambda o: outbox(toindices(o)), objs) # Calculate expanded bounding boxes
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(expanded_boxes)) # Fill expanded boxes with '3'
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, F, T, T)`:  Identifies non-background objects in the input grid `I`.
2. `mapply(lambda o: outbox(toindices(o)), objs)`: For each object, it calculates the indices of its outer bounding box using `outbox` and `toindices`.
3. `merge(expanded_boxes)`: Combines the indices of all expanded boxes.
4. `fill(I, THREE, merge(expanded_boxes))`: Fills the cells at the calculated indices in the input grid with the value `THREE` (which is 3).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = fill(O, THREE, outbox(toindices(obj))) # Iteratively fill for each object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, F, T, T)`: Same as Version 1.
2. This version iterates through each identified object. 
3. For each object, it directly fills its outer bounding box with '3' using `fill`, `outbox`, and `toindices`, updating the output grid `O` in each iteration.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  padded = canvas(THREE, add(shape(I), TWO)) # Create a padded canvas
  O = paint(padded, asobject(I)) # Paint the input onto the padded canvas
  return trim(O) # Trim the outer layer of the canvas
```

**Explanation:**

1. `canvas(THREE, add(shape(I), TWO))`: Creates a new grid filled with '3' and dimensions larger than the input grid by one unit on each side.
2. `asobject(I)`: Converts the input grid into an object representation.
3. `paint(padded, asobject(I))`:  Paints the input object onto the padded canvas, leaving a border of '3'.
4. `trim(O)`:  Removes the outermost layer of the padded canvas, resulting in the desired output.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  shifted_grids = (shift(asobject(I), d) for d in (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)) # Create shifted versions of the input
  merged_grid = I
  for shifted in shifted_grids:
      merged_grid = cellwise(merged_grid, paint(canvas(THREE, shape(I)), shifted), THREE) # Merge shifted grids, filling with '3' where they differ
  return merged_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version creates four shifted copies of the input grid, each shifted one unit in a cardinal direction.
2. It then iteratively merges these shifted grids onto the original input.
3. The `cellwise` function ensures that for overlapping cells, the original value is retained, while non-overlapping cells (the expanded border) are filled with '3'.

**Program Version 5:** 

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T)
  expanded_indices = mfilter(lambda o: delta(toindices(o)), objs) # Find the indices in the delta of each object's bounding box
  O = fill(I, THREE, expanded_indices)  # Fill the delta indices with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, F, T, T)`:  Identifies non-background objects.
2. `mfilter(lambda o: delta(toindices(o)), objs)`:  For each object, it finds the indices that are part of the expanded bounding box but not part of the object itself (the 'delta').
3. `fill(I, THREE, expanded_indices)`:  Fills the identified 'delta' indices with the value '3'.


These five distinct code versions demonstrate various ways to achieve the target transformation using the provided DSL. Each version leverages different functions and logic, offering unique approaches to the problem.
