## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation identifies each connected component of '2's (considering diagonal connections) in the input grid. For each component, it draws a bounding box around it and fills the box with the value '3'. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the previous transformation, this one also identifies connected components of '2's. However, it draws a bounding box around each component, extending one cell outwards in all directions. This expanded bounding box is then filled with the value '3'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformations:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T)
  padded_objs = mapply(lambda o: delta(toindices(o)), objs)
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(padded_objs))
  return O

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, F, T, T)`**:  Identifies all connected components of non-zero values in the input grid (`I`), considering diagonal connections, and stores them as a set of objects in `objs`.
2. **`padded_objs = mapply(lambda o: delta(toindices(o)), objs)`**:  For each object in `objs`, it calculates the indices surrounding the object (`delta`) and stores them in `padded_objs`.
3. **`O = fill(I, THREE, merge(padded_objs))`**:  Merges all the padded indices (`merge(padded_objs)`) and fills those locations in the input grid (`I`) with the value '3' to generate the output grid (`O`).

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T)
  expanded_boxes = mapply(lambda o: outbox(toindices(o)), objs)
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(expanded_boxes))
  return O

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, F, T, T)`**:  Identifies connected components of non-zero values, considering diagonals, and stores them in `objs`.
2. **`expanded_boxes = mapply(lambda o: outbox(toindices(o)), objs)`**: Computes the outer bounding box (`outbox`) for each object's indices and stores them in `expanded_boxes`.
3. **`O = fill(I, THREE, merge(expanded_boxes))`**:  Merges all expanded boxes and fills the corresponding indices in the input grid with '3' to produce the output grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, F, T, T):
        indices = toindices(obj)
        surrounding_indices = delta(indices)
        O = fill(O, THREE, surrounding_indices)
    return O

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`**: Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, F, T, T):`**: Iterates over each connected component (`obj`) in the input grid.
3. **`indices = toindices(obj)`**: Retrieves the indices of the current object.
4. **`surrounding_indices = delta(indices)`**:  Calculates the indices surrounding the object.
5. **`O = fill(O, THREE, surrounding_indices)`**: Fills the surrounding indices in the output grid `O` with the value '3'.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T)
  box_indices = mfilter(lambda o: box(toindices(o)), objs)
  O = fill(I, THREE, box_indices)
  return O

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, F, T, T)`**: Identifies connected components, considering diagonals, and stores them in `objs`.
2. **`box_indices = mfilter(lambda o: box(toindices(o)), objs)`**: Extracts the bounding box indices for each object using `box` and merges them using `mfilter`, storing the result in `box_indices`.
3. **`O = fill(I, THREE, box_indices)`**: Fills the identified box indices in the input grid with '3' to generate the output grid.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, F, T, T):
        upper_left = ulcorner(obj)
        lower_right = lrcorner(obj)
        for i in range(upper_left[0] - 1, lower_right[0] + 2):
            for j in range(upper_left[1] - 1, lower_right[1] + 2):
                if 0 <= i < height(I) and 0 <= j < width(I):
                    if I[i][j] != 2:
                        O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j)})
    return O

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`**:  Initializes the output grid `O` with the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, F, T, T):`**:  Iterates over each connected component (`obj`) in the input.
3. **`upper_left = ulcorner(obj)`**:  Gets the upper-left corner coordinates of the object.
4. **`lower_right = lrcorner(obj)`**: Gets the lower-right corner coordinates of the object.
5. **`for i in range... for j in range...`**:  Iterates through the expanded bounding box of the object.
6. **`if 0 <= i < height(I) and 0 <= j < width(I):`**: Ensures the current indices are within the grid boundaries.
7. **`if I[i][j] != 2:`**: Checks if the current cell is not part of the object.
8. **`O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j)})`**: If the cell is not part of the object, it is filled with '3' in the output grid.


These five versions offer different approaches to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
