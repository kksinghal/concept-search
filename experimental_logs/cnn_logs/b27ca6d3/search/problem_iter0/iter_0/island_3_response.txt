## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Identify Target Objects:**  The transformation focuses on objects composed of the digit '2'.
2. **Create a Horizontal Line:** For each target object, a horizontal line of '3's is drawn with the same width as the object, centered on the object's vertical center. 
3. **Preserve Original Objects:** The original '2' objects remain unchanged.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

This transformation follows the same logic as above, but with a few additional nuances:

1. **Object Orientation:** The horizontal lines of '3's now extend to the right edge of the grid.
2. **Overlapping:** If lines from different objects would overlap, they merge seamlessly, maintaining a continuous line of '3's.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  lines = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    c = color(obj)
    w = width(obj)
    center_j = leftmost(obj) + w // 2
    start_j = center_j - w // 2
    line = {(THREE, (i, j)) for i, j in product(interval(0, height(I), 1), interval(start_j, start_j + w, 1))}
    lines = lines | line
  O = paint(I, lines)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` finds all connected objects of the same color (excluding background).
2. **Iterate and Draw Lines:** It loops through each object, calculating the center and width to draw a horizontal line of '3's.
3. **Paint Lines:** Finally, it paints the created lines onto the original grid. 

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = partition(I)
  lines = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) != ZERO:
      start_j = leftmost(obj)
      w = width(obj)
      line = {(THREE, (i, j)) for i, j in product(interval(0, height(I), 1), interval(start_j, start_j + w, 1))}
      lines |= line
  O = paint(I, lines)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition:**  `partition(I)` divides the grid into objects based on cell values.
2. **Filter & Draw:** It iterates through objects, filtering out the background (color 0), and draws horizontal lines to the right edge.
3. **Combine & Paint:**  Lines are merged, and then painted onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
    lines = frozenset()
    for j in range(width(I)):
        for i in range(height(I)):
            if I[i][j] != ZERO:
                line_indices = {(a, b) for a in range(height(I)) for b in range(j, width(I))}
                line = recolor(THREE, line_indices)
                lines |= line
                break
    O = paint(I, lines)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Columns:** This version iterates through each column of the input grid.
2. **Find First Non-Zero:** In each column, it searches for the first non-zero cell.
3. **Create and Merge Lines:** Upon finding one, it creates a line of '3's extending to the right edge of the grid from that cell's row and merges it with existing lines. 
4. **Paint Lines:** Finally, it paints the merged lines onto the original grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  lines = frozenset()
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] != ZERO:
        lines = lines | {(THREE, (row, col)) for row in range(h) for col in range(j, w)}
        break
  O = paint(I, lines)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Grid Dimensions:**  `shape(I)` returns the height and width of the input grid.
2. **Iterate & Find Non-Zero:** The code iterates through each cell, aiming to find the first non-zero cell in each row. 
3. **Construct Lines:** Once a non-zero cell is encountered, it constructs a line of '3's extending from that cell's column to the right edge of the grid.
4. **Paint on Grid:**  Finally, the constructed lines are painted onto the original grid.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  painted = I
  for obj in objs:
    ul = ulcorner(obj)
    w = width(obj)
    for i in range(height(I)):
      for j in range(w):
        painted = fill(painted, THREE, {(i, ul[1] + j)})
  return painted
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **Identify Objects:**  Similar to previous versions, it identifies objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Paint:** For every object, it determines the object's upper-left corner and width. Then, it iterates over the grid, painting a horizontal line of '3's starting from the object's upper-left corner and extending to the right by the object's width.
3. **Return Painted Grid:**  The modified grid with painted lines is returned.
