## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 
The transformation identifies all '2' valued cells in the input grid.  It then draws a horizontal line of '3's centered on each '2' cell, extending three cells to the left and three cells to the right. The '2' valued cells themselves remain unchanged.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
This transformation identifies '2' valued cells and replaces them with a 3x3 square of '3's centered on the original '2' location.  The top-left and bottom-right corners of this square are then replaced with the original '2' value.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) 
  output = I
  for obj in objs:
    c = color(obj)
    for cell in obj:
      i, j = cell[1]
      output = fill(output, c, {(i,j-1),(i,j),(i,j+1)})
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  The code begins by identifying all objects in the input grid `I` using `objects(I, T, F, T)`. This function finds connected regions of the same color, treating the grid as non-diagonal and ignoring the background.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** The code then iterates through each identified object and its constituent cells. 
3. **Horizontal Line:** For each cell belonging to an object, it fills a horizontal line of three cells centered on that cell's location with the object's color using the `fill` function.

**Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
  twos = ofcolor(I, 2)
  output = replace(I, 2, 3)
  for i, j in twos:
    output = fill(output, 2, {(i-1,j-1),(i+1,j+1)})
  return output 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '2's:**  Find all indices of '2' valued cells in the input grid `I` using `ofcolor(I, 2)`.
2. **Replace and Fill:** Replace all '2' values with '3's using `replace(I, 2, 3)`.
3. **Corner Restoration:**  For each original '2' location, fill the top-left and bottom-right corners of a 3x3 square centered on that location with the original '2' value.

**Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  canvas_3 = canvas(3, shape(I))
  output = paint(canvas_3,  objs)
  for obj in objs:
    for cell in obj:
      i, j = cell[1]
      output = fill(output, cell[0], {(i,j-1),(i,j+1)})
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object and Canvas:** Identify objects in the input grid and create a new canvas filled with '3's using `canvas(3, shape(I))`.
2. **Initial Paint:** Paint the identified objects onto the new canvas.
3. **Horizontal Extension:** For each cell in every object, fill the cells to the left and right of it with the object's color, extending it horizontally.

**Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
  twos = ofcolor(I, 2)
  output = canvas(3, shape(I))
  for i, j in twos:
    square_3x3 = {(i-1,j-1),(i-1,j),(i-1,j+1),(i,j-1),(i,j),(i,j+1),(i+1,j-1),(i+1,j),(i+1,j+1)}
    output = fill(output, 2, {(i-1,j-1),(i+1,j+1)}) if len(intersection(square_3x3, twos)) == 1 else output
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate and Initialize:**  Find '2' indices and create a canvas filled with '3's.
2. **Conditional Filling:**  For each '2' location, check if a 3x3 square centered on it has only one '2' cell (the center). If so, fill the top-left and bottom-right corners with '2'.

**Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
  shifted_right = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)
  shifted_left = shift(asobject(I), LEFT)
  output = cellwise(I, shifted_right, 3)
  output = cellwise(output, shifted_left, 3)
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift and Compare:**  Shift the input grid one position to the right and left.
2. **Cellwise Matching:** Use `cellwise` to create a new grid where cells matching the original grid and its shifted versions are kept, and mismatches are replaced with '3'. This effectively creates the horizontal extensions and corner patterns.
