## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by connected pixels of the same color (excluding the background color, 0) and extending them horizontally by one pixel to the left and right, filling the new pixels with color '3'. 

**Example:**

- If an object consists of a single pixel at (i, j) with color '2', the output will have three horizontally adjacent pixels at (i, j-1), (i, j), (i, j+1) filled with color '3'.
- Existing objects are not modified if they are not adjacent to the background.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  output = I
  for obj in objs:
    c = 3 
    for cell in obj:
      i, j = cell[1]
      if j > 0:
        output = fill(output, c, {(i, j-1)})
      if j < len(I[0]) - 1:
        output = fill(output, c, {(i, j+1)})
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts objects from the input grid `I`, considering only directly connected pixels (`F`) and excluding the background (`T`).
2. **Iterate and Extend:** The program iterates over each object and its cells. 
3. **Horizontal Extension:** For each cell, it checks if the left and right neighbors are within the grid boundaries. If so, it fills those neighboring cells with color '3' using `fill(output, c, {(i, j-1)})` and `fill(output, c, {(i, j+1)})`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  shifted_left = hconcat(((0,),)*len(I), I)
  shifted_right = hconcat(I, ((0,),)*len(I))
  O = cellwise(shifted_left, shifted_right, 3)
  return cellwise(O, I, 0)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift and Compare:** This version creates two shifted copies of the input grid: `shifted_left` (shifted one position left) and `shifted_right` (shifted one position right).
2. **Identify Extension Areas:** It uses `cellwise` to compare the shifted grids. Where both shifted grids have a background color ('0'), it fills with '3', indicating the extension area.
3. **Combine with Original:** Finally, it uses `cellwise` again to overlay the extensions onto the original grid, retaining the original object pixels.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    for cell in obj:
      i, j = cell[1]
      O = paint(O, {(3, (i, max(0, j - 1)))})
      O = paint(O, {(3, (i, min(len(I[0]) - 1, j + 1)))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:**  An empty canvas `O` of the same size as the input is created using `canvas`.
2. **Iterate and Paint:** The program iterates over each object and its cells, similar to Version 1.
3. **Paint Extension:** Instead of directly filling, it paints color '3' onto the canvas `O` at the left and right neighboring positions of each cell, ensuring it stays within grid boundaries.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] != 0 and (I[i][j - 1] == 0 or I[i][j + 1] == 0):
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j - 1), (i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:**  This version directly iterates over each cell in the input grid.
2. **Identify Edge Cells:** For each cell, it checks if it's part of an object (non-zero) and has a background pixel as a direct left or right neighbor.
3. **Fill Neighbors:** If the conditions are met, it fills both the left and right neighbors with color '3'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  extension = mfilter(lambda obj: any(j == 0 or j == len(I[0]) - 1 for _, (i, j) in obj), objs)
  extended_indices = mapply(lambda obj: {(i, j - 1) for _, (i, j) in obj if j > 0} | {(i, j + 1) for _, (i, j) in obj if j < len(I[0]) - 1}, extension)
  return paint(I, recolor(3, extended_indices)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects with Extensions:**  The program first identifies objects touching the left or right edge of the grid using `mfilter`.
2. **Calculate Extension Indices:** For each object needing extension, it determines the indices of the cells to be filled with color '3' using `mapply`.
3. **Paint Extensions:**  Finally, it paints the extensions onto the original grid using `paint` and `recolor`.
