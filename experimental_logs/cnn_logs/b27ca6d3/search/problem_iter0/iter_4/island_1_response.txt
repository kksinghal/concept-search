## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects with color '2' that are adjacent to the background color '0'. Then, it creates a frame around these objects using color '3', excluding the cells of the objects themselves. 

**Input_0:** The input grid has scattered '2's representing objects. The output has a frame of '3's around any '2' that was adjacent to a '0'.

**Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0, but with a different object configuration. The output again demonstrates the framing logic around '2's adjacent to '0's.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  border_indices = mfilter(
      asobject(I),
      lambda cell: cell[0] == 2 and any(n[0] == 0 for n in toobject(dneighbors(cell[1]), I))
  )
  frame = backdrop(toindices(border_indices)) - toindices(border_indices)
  O = fill(I, 3, frame) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`border_indices`:** Identifies cells with color '2' that have at least one directly adjacent neighbor with color '0'.
2. **`frame`:** Calculates the indices for the frame by taking the backdrop of the border indices and removing the border indices themselves.
3. **`O`:** Fills the input grid 'I' with color '3' at the calculated frame indices.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  border_cells = mfilter(
      asindices(I),
      lambda loc: I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 2 and any(I[n[0]][n[1]] == 0 for n in dneighbors(loc))
  )
  frame = mapply(dneighbors, border_cells) - border_cells
  O = fill(I, 3, frame)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`border_cells`:** Finds indices of cells with color '2' directly adjacent to cells with color '0'.
2. **`frame`:** Determines the frame indices by taking the direct neighbors of all border cells and removing the border cells themselves.
3. **`O`:**  Creates the output by filling the input grid 'I' with '3' at the frame indices.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  border_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2 and adjacent(obj, recolor(0, obj)))
  frame_indices = mapply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), border_objs)
  O = fill(I, 3, frame_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs`:** Extracts all objects from the grid.
2. **`border_objs`:** Filters for objects with color '2' that are adjacent to a version of themselves recolored to '0', essentially checking for adjacency to the background.
3. **`frame_indices`:** Calculates the frame indices by taking the delta (outline minus object) of each border object.
4. **`O`:**  Generates the output by filling the frame indices in the input grid with color '3'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  border_cells = mfilter(asobject(I), lambda c: c[0] == 2 and any(n == 0 for n in rapply(lambda l: index(I, l), dneighbors(c[1]))))
  O = fill(I, 3, mapply(dneighbors, border_cells) - toindices(border_cells))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`border_cells`:**  Finds cells with color '2' having at least one directly adjacent neighbor with color '0' using `index` for neighbor checking.
2. **`O`:**  Creates the output by filling the input grid 'I' with '3' at the frame indices, calculated as the direct neighbors of border cells excluding the border cells themselves.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  padded_grid = canvas(0, (height(I) + 2, width(I) + 2))
  padded_grid = paint(padded_grid, shift(asobject(I), (1, 1))) 
  border_indices = mfilter(
      asindices(I), 
      lambda loc: padded_grid[loc[0] + 1][loc[1] + 1] == 2 and any(
          padded_grid[loc[0] + di][loc[1] + dj] == 0
          for di in [-1, 1, 0, 0] for dj in [0, 0, -1, 1]
      )
  )
  O = fill(I, 3, backdrop(border_indices) - border_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`padded_grid`:** Creates a padded version of the input grid to simplify border checking.
2. **`border_indices`:** Identifies indices of cells with color '2' in the original grid that have at least one adjacent '0' in the padded grid.
3. **`O`:** Generates the output by filling the frame, calculated as the backdrop of border indices excluding the border indices themselves, with color '3' in the original grid.

Each version uses distinct approaches and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same output, showcasing diverse solutions within the DSL constraints.
