## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (clusters of the same color) in the input grid and drawing a bounding box around them. However, the bounding box is expanded by one cell in each direction, including diagonally.

**Example:**

Consider a single '2' cell in the input grid. The expanded bounding box would look like this:

```
3 3 3
3 2 3
3 3 3
```

The program needs to identify all objects, calculate their expanded bounding boxes, and fill those boxes with the value '3' while keeping the original objects intact.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions for achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T)  # Find all non-background objects
  shifted_objs_up_left = mapply(lambda o: shift(o, (-1, -1)), objs)  # Shift objects up-left
  shifted_objs_down_right = mapply(lambda o: shift(o, (1, 1)), objs)  # Shift objects down-right
  expanded_boxes = mapply(lambda o: box(toindices(o)), shifted_objs_up_left) | mapply(lambda o: box(toindices(o)), shifted_objs_down_right)  # Calculate bounding boxes of all shifted objects
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(expanded_boxes))  # Fill the bounding boxes with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, F, T, T)` identifies all non-background objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Shift objects:** `shifted_objs_up_left` and `shifted_objs_down_right` are created by shifting each object one cell up-left and down-right, respectively.
3. **Calculate bounding boxes:** `expanded_boxes` is created by calculating the bounding boxes of all shifted objects using `box(toindices(o))` and merging them.
4. **Fill bounding boxes:** The `fill` function fills the calculated bounding boxes with the value '3' on the input grid `I` to produce the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T)  # Find all objects
  expanded_boxes =  mapply(lambda o: merge([box(shift(toindices(o), d)) for d in [(-1,-1),(-1,0),(-1,1),(0,-1),(0,1),(1,-1),(1,0),(1,1)]]), objs)
  O = fill(I, THREE, expanded_boxes)  # Fill the expanded boxes
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Calculate expanded boxes:** For each object, this version iterates through all eight neighboring directions, shifts the object indices, calculates the bounding box, and merges them into `expanded_boxes`.
3. **Fill bounding boxes:** Similar to version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T)  # Find all objects
  expanded_indices = mapply(lambda o: backdrop(toindices(o)), objs)  # Get the backdrop indices for each object
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(expanded_indices))  # Fill the backdrop indices with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Calculate expanded areas:** This version utilizes the `backdrop` function to directly obtain the indices representing the expanded bounding box for each object.
3. **Fill expanded areas:** Similar to version 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T) # Find all non-background objects
  object_indices = mapply(toindices, objs) # Extract indices of all objects
  expanded_indices = frozenset({n for idx in object_indices for n in neighbors(idx) if n[0] >= 0 and n[1] >= 0})  # Include neighbors for each index within bounds
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(expanded_indices)|object_indices) # Fill the expanded indices and original object indices with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects & Extract Indices:** Similar to previous versions, but additionally extracts object indices.
2. **Expand using Neighbors:** Utilizes the `neighbors` function to find all neighboring cells for each object index, filtering out any out-of-bounds indices.
3. **Fill Expanded Area:** Fills the grid with '3' at the expanded indices obtained from the neighbor search, effectively drawing the expanded bounding boxes.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T)  # Find all non-background objects
  shifted_objs = [shift(o, d) for o in objs for d in [(-1,-1),(-1,0),(-1,1),(0,-1),(0,1),(1,-1),(1,0),(1,1)]]
  expanded_boxes = mapply(lambda o: toindices(o), shifted_objs)  # Extract indices from shifted objects
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(expanded_boxes))  # Fill the expanded indices with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identifies non-background objects.
2. **Generate Shifted Objects:** Creates a list of shifted objects, with each object shifted in all eight possible directions.
3. **Extract Indices & Merge:** Extracts the indices of all shifted objects and merges them into a single set.
4. **Fill Expanded Area:** Uses the merged indices to fill the grid with '3', effectively creating the expanded bounding boxes.

These programs provide five distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation in the DSL. Each leverages different functions and strategies to accomplish the task, offering diverse solutions.
