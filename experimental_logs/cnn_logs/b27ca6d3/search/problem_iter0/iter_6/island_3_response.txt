## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**  The transformation identifies all non-zero elements in the input grid. For each non-zero element, it paints a horizontal line of '3's with the non-zero element as the center. The line extends to the left and right neighbors of the non-zero element.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:** This transformation follows the same logic as the previous one. It paints horizontal lines of '3's centered on each non-zero element in the input grid, extending to their left and right neighbors.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code in the DSL, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def paint_horizontal_line(index):
    i, j = index
    return frozenset({(i, j - 1), (i, j), (i, j + 1)})
  non_zero_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE) | ofcolor(I, TWO)
  line_indices = mapply(paint_horizontal_line, non_zero_indices)
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(line_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`paint_horizontal_line(index)` function:** This function takes the index of a non-zero element and returns a set of indices representing a horizontal line of length 3 centered at the input index. 
2.  **`non_zero_indices`:** This line identifies the indices of all non-zero elements (1 and 2) in the input grid `I`.
3.  **`line_indices`:** This line applies the `paint_horizontal_line` function to each non-zero index, creating a set of sets containing indices for horizontal lines. 
4.  **`merge(line_indices)`:** This merges all the individual line index sets into one set.
5.  **`fill(I, THREE, ...)`:** Finally, this fills the input grid `I` with the value `THREE` at all indices present in the merged `line_indices` set.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def horizontal_line(obj):
    i, j = centerofmass(obj)
    return frozenset({(i, j - 1), (i, j), (i, j + 1)})
  objects = fgpartition(I)
  lines = mapply(horizontal_line, objects)
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(lines))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`horizontal_line(obj)` function:** This function takes an object (set of cells with same color) and returns indices of a horizontal 3-cell line centered at the object's center of mass.
2. **`objects = fgpartition(I)`:** Partitions the input grid into objects excluding the background.
3. **`lines = mapply(horizontal_line, objects)`:**  Applies the `horizontal_line` function to each object, generating a set of sets containing horizontal line indices.
4. **`merge(lines)`:** Merges all line indices into a single set.
5. **`fill(I, THREE, ...)`:**  Fills the input grid with '3' at the calculated line indices.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  painted = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != ZERO:
        for dj in (-1, 0, 1):
          if 0 <= j + dj < width(I):
            painted = fill(painted, THREE, {(i, j + dj)})
  return painted
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`painted = I`:** Initializes a new grid `painted` with the input grid `I`.
2. **Nested loop:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
3. **`if val != ZERO`:** Checks if the cell value is non-zero.
4. **Inner loop:**  If the cell is non-zero, iterates through the current and neighboring columns (`j-1`, `j`, `j+1`).
5. **`painted = fill(...)`:** Fills the corresponding cell in `painted` with '3'.
6. **`return painted`:** Returns the modified grid. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def paint_line(indices):
    return frozenset((i, j) for i, j in indices if 0 <= j < width(I))
  non_zero = ofcolor(I, ONE) | ofcolor(I, TWO)
  shifted_lines = mapply(lambda idx: paint_line({(idx[0], idx[1] + dj) for dj in (-1, 0, 1)}), non_zero)
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(shifted_lines))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`paint_line(indices)` function:**  Takes a set of indices and filters out indices with column values outside the grid boundaries.
2. **`non_zero`:**  Gets indices of all non-zero cells.
3. **`shifted_lines`:** For each non-zero index, generates a horizontal line (including out-of-bounds indices), and applies `paint_line` to filter invalid indices.
4. **`merge(shifted_lines)`:** Merges all filtered line indices.
5. **`fill(I, THREE, ...)`:** Fills the input grid with '3' at the calculated line indices.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def expand_horizontal(obj):
    i, j = centerofmass(obj)
    left = (i, j - 1) if j > 0 else (i, j)
    right = (i, j + 1) if j < width(I) - 1 else (i, j)
    return frozenset({left, (i, j), right})
  objects = fgpartition(I)
  expanded_objects = mapply(expand_horizontal, objects)
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(expanded_objects))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`expand_horizontal(obj)` function:**  Takes an object, calculates its center, and returns indices for a horizontal line centered at the object's center, ensuring it stays within the grid boundaries. 
2. **`objects = fgpartition(I)`:** Partitions the input grid into objects excluding the background.
3. **`expanded_objects = mapply(expand_horizontal, objects)`:**  Applies `expand_horizontal` to each object, creating a set of sets containing expanded line indices.
4. **`merge(expanded_objects)`:** Merges all the expanded object indices into one set.
5. **`fill(I, THREE, ...)`:**  Fills the input grid with '3' at all indices within the merged expanded object index set. 


These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformation. They showcase different ways to manipulate indices, apply functions to sets, and leverage DSL functions for efficient and accurate code generation.
