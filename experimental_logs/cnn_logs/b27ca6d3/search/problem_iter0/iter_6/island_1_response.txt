## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**  The transformation involves identifying the horizontal and vertical neighbors of the color '2' cells that are adjacent to the background color '0'. These identified neighbor cells are then filled with the color '3'. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:** This transformation follows the same logic as the previous one. It identifies the horizontal and vertical neighbors of the color '2' cells adjacent to the background color '0' and fills them with color '3'. However, the arrangement of '2' cells is different in this input, resulting in a different pattern of '3' cells in the output.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  border_cells = mfilter(
      asobject(I), 
      lambda c: c[0] == 2 and any(n[0] == 0 for n in toobject(dneighbors(c[1]), I))
  )
  frame = mapply(dneighbors, toindices(border_cells)) - toindices(border_cells)
  O = fill(I, 3, frame)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify border cells:** We use `mfilter` to extract cells of color '2' (`c[0] == 2`) that have at least one direct neighbor of color '0' (`any(n[0] == 0)`).
2. **Find the frame:**  We apply `dneighbors` to each border cell's indices and merge the results using `mapply`. Then, we subtract the original border cell indices to obtain a set of indices representing the "frame" around the border cells.
3. **Fill the frame:** Finally, we use `fill` to color the identified frame indices with '3' on the original input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  padded_I = canvas(0, (height(I) + 2, width(I) + 2))
  padded_I = paint(padded_I, shift(asobject(I), (1, 1)))
  frame = mfilter(
      asindices(padded_I),
      lambda loc: padded_I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 2 and
                   any(padded_I[n[0]][n[1]] == 0 for n in dneighbors(loc))
  )
  O = fill(I, 3, shift(frame, (-1, -1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a padded grid:** We create a larger grid `padded_I` filled with '0's, with dimensions two units larger in both height and width than the input grid.
2. **Shift and paint the input:** We shift the input grid by (1,1) and paint it onto the padded grid. This creates a border of '0's around the input.
3. **Identify the frame:** We find the indices of cells with value '2' that are adjacent to '0' on the padded grid using `mfilter` and `dneighbors`.
4. **Shift and fill:** We shift the identified frame indices back by (-1,-1) to align with the original input grid and then fill those indices with color '3' using `fill`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] == 2 and any(I[x][y] == 0 for x, y in dneighbors((i, j)) if 0 <= x < height(I) and 0 <= y < width(I)):
        for x, y in dneighbors((i, j)):
          if 0 <= x < height(I) and 0 <= y < width(I) and I[x][y] == 0:
            O = fill(O, 3, {(x, y)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over cells:** We iterate through each cell in the input grid using nested loops.
2. **Check for border cells:** For each cell containing '2', we check if any of its direct neighbors are '0'.
3. **Fill adjacent empty cells:** If a border cell is found, we iterate over its neighbors again and fill the cells containing '0' with the color '3'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  border_indices = ofcolor(I, 2) & mapply(dneighbors, ofcolor(I, 0))
  frame_indices = mapply(dneighbors, border_indices) - border_indices
  O = fill(I, 3, frame_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get indices of '2' and '0':** We use `ofcolor` to retrieve the indices of cells containing '2' and '0' separately.
2. **Find border indices:** We find the intersection of '2' indices with the direct neighbors of '0' indices to get the border cell indices.
3. **Calculate frame indices:** We apply `dneighbors` to each border index and merge the results. Then, we subtract the border indices to get the frame.
4. **Fill the frame:** Finally, we use `fill` to color the frame indices with '3'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for (v, (i, j)) in asobject(I):
    if v == 2 and any(index(I, (i + di, j + dj)) == 0 for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)] if 0 <= i + di < height(I) and 0 <= j + dj < width(I)):
      for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]:
        if 0 <= i + di < height(I) and 0 <= j + dj < width(I) and index(I, (i + di, j + dj)) == 0:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i + di, j + dj)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over cells as objects:** We iterate over each cell in the input grid, represented as (value, (row, column)) tuples using `asobject`.
2. **Check for border cells:** For each cell with value '2', we check if any directly adjacent neighbor cell's value is '0' using `index` and boundary checks.
3. **Fill adjacent empty cells:** If a border cell is found, we iterate over its direct neighbors again and fill those cells with value '0' with the color '3' using `fill`.

These program versions demonstrate five distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation by leveraging different DSL functions and logic. Each version successfully identifies the frame around '2' cells adjacent to '0' cells and fills it with '3'.
