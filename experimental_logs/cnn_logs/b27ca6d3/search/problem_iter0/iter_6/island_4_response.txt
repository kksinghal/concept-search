## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the "outer perimeter" of each object in the grid and coloring those perimeter cells with the value '3'. Let's break it down for each example:

**Input_0:**

* **Objects:** We have several '2' objects scattered across the grid.
* **Outer Perimeter:** The cells directly surrounding each '2' object, which are originally '0', need to be changed to '3'. 
* **Example:** The '2' at (2, 2) gets surrounded by '3's, as do the two '2's at (11, 4) and (11, 8), etc.

**Input_1:**

*  The logic remains the same. We identify the outer perimeter of every '2' object and change the surrounding '0' cells to '3'. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T)  # Find all objects
  perimeter_cells = mapply(lambda obj: mapply(neighbors, toindices(obj)), objs) # Find all neighboring cells of objects
  filtered_perimeter = mfilter(lambda n: index(I, n) == 0, perimeter_cells) # Keep only neighbors that are '0'
  O = fill(I, THREE, filtered_perimeter)  # Fill those cells with '3'
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, F, T, T)`:** Identifies all objects (clusters of non-background values) in the input grid `I`.
2. **`perimeter_cells = mapply(lambda obj: mapply(neighbors, toindices(obj)), objs)`:** For each object, find all its neighboring cells using `neighbors` and `toindices`.
3. **`filtered_perimeter = mfilter(lambda n: index(I, n) == 0, perimeter_cells)`:** Filters the neighboring cells to keep only those that have a value of '0' in the original grid. This ensures we only target the outer perimeter.
4. **`O = fill(I, THREE, filtered_perimeter)`:**  Fills the identified perimeter cells with the value '3' in a copy of the input grid.
5. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = partition(I) # Partition the grid into objects
  expanded_perimeter = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for cell in toindices(obj):
      for neighbor in neighbors(cell):
        if index(I, neighbor) != color(obj): # If the neighbor is not part of the current object
          expanded_perimeter.add(neighbor)
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(expanded_perimeter))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = partition(I)`:** Partitions the grid into objects based on cell values.
2. **`expanded_perimeter = set()`:** Initializes an empty set to store perimeter cell indices.
3. **Iterate through objects and cells:**  For each object and each cell within that object, examine its neighbors.
4. **`if index(I, neighbor) != color(obj)`:** If a neighbor doesn't belong to the current object (different color), add it to the `expanded_perimeter` set.
5. **`O = fill(I, THREE, merge(expanded_perimeter))`:** Fill all identified perimeter cells with '3'.
6. **`return O`:** Return the modified grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) # Create an empty canvas of the same size as I
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T)
  for obj in objs:
    perimeter =  set(toindices(obj)) # Start with all cells of the object
    for cell in toindices(obj):
      for neighbor in neighbors(cell):
        if index(I, neighbor) == color(obj):
          perimeter.discard(neighbor) # Remove cells that have a same-colored neighbor
    O = fill(O, THREE, perimeter) # Fill the remaining perimeter cells with '3'
  O = cellwise(I, O, THREE) # Combine the original grid and the perimeter
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`:** Create a blank canvas of the same dimensions as the input.
2. **`objs = objects(I, F, T, T)`:**  Get all objects from the input grid.
3. **Iterate and refine perimeter:**  For each object, initially consider all its cells as perimeter. Then, iterate through its cells and their neighbors. If a neighbor has the same color, it's not on the perimeter, so remove it.
4. **`O = fill(O, THREE, perimeter)`:** Fill the remaining perimeter cells on the canvas with '3'.
5. **`O = cellwise(I, O, THREE)`:**  Merge the original grid with the perimeter grid, prioritizing values from the original grid unless empty (filled with '3' in this case).
6. **`return O`:**  Return the combined grid. 


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, F, T, T)
    perimeter = set()
    for obj in objs:
      obj_indices = toindices(obj)
      for cell in obj_indices:
        if any(n not in obj_indices for n in neighbors(cell)):  # Cell is on the perimeter if any neighbor is outside the object
          perimeter.add(cell)
    O = fill(I, THREE, perimeter)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, F, T, T)`:** Identify all objects in the input.
2. **`perimeter = set()`:** Initialize an empty set to store perimeter cell indices.
3. **Iterate and check neighbors:**  For each cell in each object, check if any of its neighbors are not part of the object. If so, the cell is on the perimeter. 
4. **`perimeter.add(cell)`:** Add perimeter cells to the set.
5. **`O = fill(I, THREE, perimeter)`:**  Fill the identified perimeter cells with '3'.
6. **`return O`:** Return the modified grid. 


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T) 
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    shifted_objs = [shift(obj, d) for d in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]]
    for shifted_obj in shifted_objs:
      O = underfill(O, THREE,  toindices(shifted_obj)) # Fill under shifted objects
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, F, T, T)`:**  Identify all objects in the input grid.
2. **`O = I`:** Initialize the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
3. **Iterate and shift:** For each object, create four shifted copies â€“ shifted up, down, left, and right by one unit.
4. **`O = underfill(O, THREE, toindices(shifted_obj))`:**  For each shifted object, fill the cells underneath it with '3' in the output grid `O`. `underfill` ensures that only cells with the background value (0) are filled.
5. **`return O`:** Return the modified grid.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to solving the task using different combinations of functions from the DSL. Each one identifies the outer perimeter of objects in the grid and marks them with the value '3'.
