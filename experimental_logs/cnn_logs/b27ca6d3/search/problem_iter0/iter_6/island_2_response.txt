## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve extending the non-zero cells horizontally to fill adjacent empty (0-valued) cells. However, this extension doesn't overwrite existing non-zero values and utilizes a new color (value 3).

**Input_0:**

* Each isolated '2' is extended horizontally with '3's to fill its immediate left and right neighbors if those neighbors are '0'. 
* Continuous stretches of '2's are treated as a single unit and extend similarly.

**Input_1:**

* The same logic applies as in Input_0. The extension happens horizontally with '3's, filling adjacent empty cells without overwriting existing non-zero values.

## Code Generation:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Version 1: Using object manipulation
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  extended_objs = mapply(lambda obj: {(color(obj), (i, j - 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j > 0 and I[i][j-1] == 0} |
                                     {(color(obj), (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j+1] == 0} | obj,
                          objs)
  return paint(I, merge(extended_objs))

```

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Version 2: Using shifting and cellwise operations
  shifted_left = hconcat(((0,),)*len(I), I)
  shifted_right = hconcat(I, ((0,),)*len(I))
  left_extension = cellwise(shifted_left, I, 0)
  right_extension = cellwise(shifted_right, I, 0)
  combined_extension = cellwise(left_extension, right_extension, 3)
  return cellwise(combined_extension, I, 0)
```

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Version 3: Iterative approach with conditional filling
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] != 0:
        if I[i][j-1] == 0:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j-1)})
        if I[i][j+1] == 0:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j+1)})
  return O
```

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Version 4: Functional approach with conditional mapping
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      3 if (j > 0 and row[j - 1] != 0 and v == 0) or (j < len(row) - 1 and row[j + 1] != 0 and v == 0) else v
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for row in I
  )
```

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Version 5: Using map and lambda for conciseness
  return tuple(map(lambda row: tuple(map(lambda j: 3 if (j > 0 and row[j-1] != 0 and row[j] == 0) or (j < len(row) - 1 and row[j+1] != 0 and row[j] == 0) else row[j], range(len(row))), range(len(row))), I))
```


## Explanation:

**Version 1:**

1. **Identify Objects:** It first identifies individual objects in the input grid using `objects(I, True, False, True)`. This ensures that each distinct group of connected non-zero cells is treated as a single entity.
2. **Extend Objects:**  For every object, it generates a set of new cells representing the extension. This is done by iterating through each cell of the object and checking its left and right neighbors. If a neighbor is empty (value 0), a new cell with the object's color is added to the extension set.
3. **Paint Extensions:** Finally, it paints the extended objects back onto the original grid using `paint`. This ensures that the extensions are placed correctly and the original object shapes are preserved.

**Version 2:**

1. **Shifting:** The input grid is shifted left and right by one cell, creating `shifted_left` and `shifted_right` grids.
2. **Extension Detection:** `cellwise` is used to compare the original grid with its shifted versions. If a cell is 0 in the original grid but non-zero in either shifted grid, it means it's adjacent to a non-zero cell and should be part of the extension.
3. **Combine Extensions:**  The left and right extensions are combined using `cellwise`, filling the extension cells with the value '3'.
4. **Finalize Output:**  The final output is generated by combining the combined extension with the original grid using `cellwise`, overwriting only the 0-valued cells.

**Version 3:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** The code iterates through each cell of the input grid. For each non-zero cell, it checks its left and right neighbors.
2. **Conditional Filling:** If a neighbor is empty (value 0), the `fill` function is used to change that neighbor's value to '3', effectively extending the object.

**Version 4:**

1. **Nested Iteration:** Uses nested loops to iterate through each row and cell within the input grid.
2. **Conditional Replacement:**  For every cell, it checks if it should be part of the extension. If it's a 0-valued cell adjacent to a non-zero cell, it's replaced with '3'. Otherwise, it retains its original value.

**Version 5:**

1. **Map and Lambda:** Employs Python's `map` function and lambda expressions for a more concise and functional approach.
2. **Inline Logic:**  The logic for extension detection and replacement is embedded within the lambda functions, making the code shorter but potentially less readable.

Each version achieves the desired transformation by identifying cells adjacent to non-zero values and filling them with '3' if they are empty. They utilize different DSL functions and strategies, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
