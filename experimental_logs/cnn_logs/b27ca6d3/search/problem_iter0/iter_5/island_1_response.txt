## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected components) of the color '2' in the input grid and drawing a frame around them using the color '3'. The frame is drawn one cell away from the object, effectively creating a border.

**Example:**

```
Input:
0 0 2
0 2 0
2 0 0

Output:
0 0 2
0 2 0
2 0 0
```

becomes:

```
Output:
0 3 2
3 2 3
2 3 0 
```


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  border_cells = mfilter(
      asobject(I), 
      lambda c: c[0] == 2 and any(n[0] == 0 for n in toobject(dneighbors(c[1]), I))
  )
  frame = mapply(dneighbors, toindices(border_cells)) - toindices(border_cells)
  O = fill(I, 3, frame)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify border cells:**
   - `asobject(I)` converts the grid `I` into a set of (value, (row, col)) tuples representing each cell.
   - `mfilter` filters this set, keeping cells with value '2' and having at least one directly adjacent neighbor with value '0' (background). These are the 'border cells'.
2. **Determine frame cells:**
   - `toindices` extracts the (row, col) indices from the `border_cells` set.
   - `mapply(dneighbors, ...)` applies the `dneighbors` function to each border cell index, generating a set of all indices directly adjacent to the border.
   -  Subtracting the original `border_cells` indices leaves only the indices of the surrounding frame.
3. **Fill the frame:**
   - `fill(I, 3, frame)` fills the input grid `I` with the value '3' at the indices contained in the `frame` set.
4. **Return the modified grid:** The function returns the modified grid `O` with the frame drawn.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  padded_I = canvas(0, (height(I) + 2, width(I) + 2))
  padded_I = paint(padded_I, shift(asobject(I), (1, 1)))
  frame = mfilter(
      asindices(padded_I),
      lambda loc: padded_I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 2 and
                   any(padded_I[n[0]][n[1]] == 0 for n in dneighbors(loc))
  )
  O = fill(I, 3, shift(frame, (-1, -1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a padded grid:**
   - `canvas(0, (height(I) + 2, width(I) + 2))` creates a new grid `padded_I` filled with '0' and two rows/columns larger than the input grid `I` in each dimension.
   - `paint(padded_I, shift(asobject(I), (1, 1)))` paints the input grid `I` onto the center of the `padded_I` grid, effectively padding it with a border of '0's.
2. **Identify frame cells in the padded grid:**
   - `mfilter` iterates over all indices of the `padded_I` grid.
   - For each cell, it checks if its value is '2' and if any of its direct neighbors are '0'. If so, the cell is part of the frame and is added to the result.
3. **Shift and fill the frame:**
   - `shift(frame, (-1, -1))` shifts the identified frame indices back by one row and one column to align with the original grid `I`.
   - `fill(I, 3, ...)` fills the original grid `I` with the value '3' at the shifted frame indices.
4. **Return the modified grid:** The function returns the modified grid `O` containing the frame.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    frame = mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj)) - toindices(obj)
    O = fill(O, 3, frame)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over objects:**
   - `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies all connected components (objects) of color '2' in the input grid `I`.
   - The loop iterates over each identified object.
2. **Determine frame for each object:**
    - `mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj))` generates a set of all indices directly adjacent to the current object.
    - Subtracting the object's indices from this set leaves only the frame indices.
3. **Fill the frame:**
    - `fill(O, 3, frame)` fills the current grid `O` with '3' at the identified frame indices.
4. **Return the modified grid:** After processing all objects, the function returns the final modified grid `O` with all frames drawn.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(1, height(I) - 1):
    for j in range(1, width(I) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == 2 and any(I[i + di][j + dj] == 0 for di in [-1, 1, 0, 0] for dj in [0, 0, -1, 1]):
        for di in [-1, 1, 0, 0]:
          for dj in [0, 0, -1, 1]:
            if 0 <= i + di < height(I) and 0 <= j + dj < width(I) and I[i + di][j + dj] == 0:
              O = fill(O, 3, {(i + di, j + dj)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over inner cells:**
   - The nested loops iterate over each cell in the input grid `I`, excluding the outer border.
2. **Check for border cells:**
    - For each cell, it checks if its value is '2' and if any of its direct neighbors are '0'. If so, the cell is considered a border cell.
3. **Fill surrounding frame cells:**
    - For each identified border cell, the code iterates again over its direct neighbors.
    - If a neighbor cell is within the grid bounds and has value '0', it's filled with '3'.
4. **Return the modified grid:** The function returns the modified grid `O` after processing all cells.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  border_indices = set()
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] == 2 and ((i > 0 and I[i-1][j] == 0) or (i < height(I)-1 and I[i+1][j] == 0) or (j > 0 and I[i][j-1] == 0) or (j < width(I)-1 and I[i][j+1] == 0)):
        border_indices.add((i, j))
  frame_indices = set()
  for (i, j) in border_indices:
    for di in [-1, 1, 0, 0]:
      for dj in [0, 0, -1, 1]:
        if 0 <= i + di < height(I) and 0 <= j + dj < width(I) and (i + di, j + dj) not in border_indices:
          frame_indices.add((i + di, j + dj))
  return fill(I, 3, frame_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify border cell indices:**
   - The first nested loop iterates through each cell in the grid.
   - It checks if the cell value is '2' and has at least one adjacent neighbor with value '0'. If so, the cell's indices are added to the `border_indices` set.
2. **Identify frame cell indices:**
   - The second nested loop iterates through each `border_indices`.
   - For each border cell, it checks its direct neighbors.
   - If a neighbor is within the grid bounds and not part of `border_indices`, it's considered a frame cell and added to the `frame_indices` set.
3. **Fill the frame and return:**
   - Finally, the function uses `fill` to set the value of all cells in `frame_indices` within the input grid `I` to '3'.
   - The modified grid with the drawn frame is returned.
