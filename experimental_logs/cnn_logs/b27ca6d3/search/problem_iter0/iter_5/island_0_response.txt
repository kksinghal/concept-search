## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently applies the following rules:

1. **Identify objects:** It recognizes individual connected components (objects) formed by the digit '2' within the input grid. 
2. **Expand object boundaries:** For each object, it extends the outline (box) by one cell to the left and right. However, the expansion only occurs if the adjacent cell contains the digit '0'.
3. **Fill expanded boundaries:** Finally, it fills these expanded boundary cells with the digit '3', effectively outlining the objects with a '3' border.

**Example:**

Let's take a section of Input_0:

```
0 0 2 0
0 0 2 0
0 0 0 0
```

The transformation identifies the '2's as a single object. It then expands the object's boundary to the left and right where possible:

```
0 0 2 0
0 0 2 0
0 0 0 0
```

Finally, it fills the expanded boundaries with '3':

```
0 0 2 0
0 0 2 0
0 0 0 0
```


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL from `dsl.py`:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Extract connected '2' objects
  expanded_outlines = mapply(lambda obj: outbox(obj) - box(obj), objs)  # Find cells adjacent to the object outline
  filtered_outlines = mapply(lambda indices: frozenset(loc for loc in indices if 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 0), expanded_outlines) # Filter cells containing '0'
  return underfill(I, THREE, merge(filtered_outlines))  # Fill filtered cells with '3' 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` extracts connected components of '2's, excluding the background.
2. **Expand outlines:** `outbox(obj) - box(obj)` calculates the set difference between the outer and inner outlines of each object, yielding adjacent cells.
3. **Filter cells:** The lambda function filters for adjacent cells containing '0' within the grid boundaries.
4. **Fill cells:** `underfill(I, THREE, merge(filtered_outlines))` fills the filtered cells with '3' on the original grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  extended_boxes = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in box(obj):
      for shift in [-1, 1]:
        if 0 <= j + shift < len(I[0]) and I[i][j + shift] == 0:
          extended_boxes = insert((i, j + shift), extended_boxes)
  return underfill(I, THREE, extended_boxes) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Iterate and expand:** It iterates through each cell of each object's box and checks for '0' in adjacent left/right cells within grid boundaries.
3. **Fill cells:** Similar to version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return underfill(I, THREE, 
                   merge(
                       mapply(lambda obj: 
                              sfilter(
                                  sfilter(dneighbors(centerofmass(obj)), 
                                          lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0])), 
                                  lambda loc: I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 0), 
                              objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Find neighbors of center:** It finds direct neighbors of each object's center of mass.
3. **Filter for valid cells:** It filters for neighbors within the grid and containing '0'.
4. **Fill cells:** Similar to previous versions.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  modified_grid = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    for i, j in box(obj):
      for di, dj in [(0, -1), (0, 1)]:  # Check left and right neighbors
        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
        if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] == 0:
          modified_grid = fill(modified_grid, THREE, {(ni, nj)})
  return modified_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and modify:** It iterates directly through objects and their outline cells, checking and filling adjacent cells directly.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, 
                 merge(
                     mapply(lambda obj: 
                            recolor(THREE, 
                                    sfilter(
                                        delta(obj), 
                                        lambda loc: any(I[n[0]][n[1]] == 2 for n in dneighbors(loc) if 0 <= n[0] < len(I) and 0 <= n[1] < len(I[0]))
                                    )
                                   ), 
                            objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Find delta cells:** It finds cells within the object's bounding box but not part of the object itself.
3. **Filter for adjacent '2':** It keeps delta cells that have a direct neighbor with the value '2'.
4. **Recolor and paint:** It recolors the filtered cells to '3' and paints them back onto the original grid.


These five program versions showcase different approaches to achieving the desired transformation. Each version utilizes distinct combinations of DSL functions and logic, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
