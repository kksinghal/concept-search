## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation identifies all non-zero digits (2 in this case) in the input grid. For each of these digits, it creates a 3x3 square centered on the digit's location and fills it with the digit '3'. The original non-zero digits remain unchanged.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** This transformation is similar to the previous one, but instead of squares, it creates a cross pattern around each non-zero digit (1 and 2 in this case).  A cross pattern consists of the eight surrounding cells, excluding the cell itself. These cross patterns are filled with the digit '3', while the original non-zero digits are preserved.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing the described transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def create_cross(index):
    i, j = index
    return frozenset({(i + di, j + dj) for di in range(-1, 2) for dj in range(-1, 2)}) - {(i, j)}
  non_zero_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE) | ofcolor(I, TWO)
  crosses = mapply(create_cross, non_zero_indices)
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(crosses))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`create_cross(index)`:** This function takes the index `(i, j)` of a cell and returns a set containing the indices of its surrounding cells in a cross pattern.
2. **`non_zero_indices`:** This line identifies the indices of all cells containing either '1' or '2' using `ofcolor`.
3. **`crosses`:** This line applies the `create_cross` function to each non-zero index and merges the resulting sets of indices using `mapply` and `merge`.
4. **`fill(I, THREE, merge(crosses))`:** This line fills all the indices within the combined `crosses` set with the digit '3' on the input grid `I`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != ZERO:
        I = fill(I, THREE, dneighbors((i, j)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through the grid:** The code iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`.
2. **Check for non-zero:** If a cell has a non-zero value, it calls the `fill` function.
3. **Fill with '3':** The `fill` function replaces the values of the directly adjacent neighbors (`dneighbors`) of the current non-zero cell with '3'.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def paint_cross(i, j):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    for di in (-1, 1):
      for dj in (-1, 1):
        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
        if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w:
          I = fill(I, THREE, {(ni, nj)})
    return I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val:
        I = paint_cross(i, j)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`paint_cross(i, j)`:** This function takes an index `(i, j)` and paints a cross pattern around it with the value '3', while staying within the grid boundaries.
2. **Iterating and painting:** The main function iterates through each cell, and if the cell is non-zero, it calls `paint_cross` to paint a cross around it.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def mark_neighbors(index):
    return dneighbors(index) | ineighbors(index) - {index}
  non_zero_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE) | ofcolor(I, TWO)
  marked_indices = mapply(mark_neighbors, non_zero_indices)
  return fill(I, THREE, marked_indices) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mark_neighbors(index)`:** This function returns the indices of all direct and diagonal neighbors (`dneighbors`, `ineighbors`) of a given index, excluding the index itself.
2. **Find non-zero indices:**  Identifies the indices of cells containing '1' or '2'.
3. **Mark neighbors:**  Applies `mark_neighbors` to each non-zero index to get a set of all indices needing to be filled.
4. **Fill the grid:** Fills all the identified neighbor indices with '3'.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def expand_cell(i, j):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    return frozenset({(i + di, j + dj) for di in range(-1, 2) for dj in range(-1, 2)}) - {(i, j)}
  new_grid = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, THREE, expand_cell(i, j))
  return cellwise(I, new_grid, THREE)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`expand_cell(i, j)`:** Returns a set of indices forming a cross pattern around a given cell.
2. **Create a blank canvas:** Initializes a new grid `new_grid` filled with zeros, having the same shape as the input grid `I`.
3. **Iterate and fill:** Iterates through the input grid, and for each non-zero cell, it fills the corresponding cross pattern on the `new_grid` with '3'.
4. **Combine grids:** Finally, it combines the original input grid `I` and the newly created `new_grid` using `cellwise`. This ensures that original non-zero values are preserved, and '3' is filled only in the desired cross patterns.

These five program versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the target transformation. Each version utilizes different DSL functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL for solving spatial reasoning tasks.
