## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying horizontally connected non-zero elements in the input grid and extending them by one cell to the left and right with the value '3'. However, the extension should only occur if the adjacent cell is currently a '0'.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The '2' elements at positions (2,2), (2,7), (3,7), (4,13) and their horizontal neighbors are extended with '3's. Notice that the extension doesn't happen if there's already a non-zero value next to them.
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the horizontally connected '2' elements are extended. Note how the extension respects the boundaries of the grid and doesn't "wrap around".

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code in the provided DSL, along with explanations:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, True, True)  # Extract objects, allow diagonals, without background
  extended_objs = mapply(lambda obj: {(v, (i, j - 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j > 0 and index(I, (i, j - 1)) == 0} | 
                                     {(v, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0} | obj,
                          objs)
  return paint(I, merge(extended_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, False, True, True)`:**  Extracts objects from the grid. `False` ensures we don't merge objects of different colors diagonally. `True` includes diagonally connected cells. `True` excludes the background color.
2. **`mapply(...)`:** Iterates over each object and applies a lambda function to it.
3. **`lambda obj: ...`:**  For each object:
    * **`{(v, (i, j - 1)) ... }`:** Creates a set of cells to the left of each object cell if the cell is '0'.
    * **`{(v, (i, j + 1)) ... }`:** Creates a set of cells to the right of each object cell if the cell is '0'.
    * **`| obj`:** Combines the original object with the extended cells.
4. **`merge(extended_objs)`:** Merges all extended objects into a single object.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the merged object onto the original grid.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_left = hconcat(((0,),)*len(I), I)
  shifted_right = hconcat(I, ((0,),)*len(I))
  left_extension = cellwise(shifted_left, I, 0)
  right_extension = cellwise(shifted_right, I, 0)
  combined_extension = cellwise(left_extension, right_extension, 3)
  return cellwise(combined_extension, I, 0)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_left`, `shifted_right`**: Create shifted copies of the input grid.
2. **`left_extension`, `right_extension`**: Use `cellwise` to identify cells where an extension is possible (value is 0 in the shifted grid and non-zero in the original).
3. **`combined_extension`**: Combines the left and right extensions, marking potential extension points with '3'.
4. **Final `cellwise`**: Combines the `combined_extension` with the original grid, keeping the original values unless an extension is marked with '3'.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] != 0:
        if I[i][j-1] == 0:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j-1)})
        if I[i][j+1] == 0:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j+1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through the grid**:  Uses nested loops to visit each cell.
2. **Check for non-zero values**:  If a cell is non-zero, checks its left and right neighbors.
3. **Extend if neighbor is zero**: If a neighbor is zero, `fill` is used to replace that cell with a '3'.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  extended = I
  for obj in objects(I, False, True, True):
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      for di, dj in ((0, 1), (0, -1)):
        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
        if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] == 0:
          extended = fill(extended, 3, {(ni, nj)})
  return extended
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, False, True, True)`**: Extracts objects from the grid, allowing diagonal connections and excluding background.
2. **Iterate through objects and cells**: For each cell in each object:
3. **Check neighbors**: Iterates through right and left neighbors (`(0, 1)` and `(0, -1)`)
4. **Fill with '3'**: If a neighbor is within the grid bounds and has a value of '0', it's filled with '3'.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) 
  for obj in objects(I, False, True, True):
    extended_indices = {(i, j - 1) for _, (i, j) in obj if j > 0 and index(I, (i, j - 1)) == 0} | \
                       {(i, j + 1) for _, (i, j) in obj if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0} | \
                       toindices(obj)
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, extended_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(0, shape(I))`**: Creates a blank canvas with the same size as the input grid.
2. **Iterate through objects**: Extracts objects and iterates through them.
3. **`extended_indices`**: Collects indices to be filled with '3':
    * Left of the object cell if it's a '0'.
    * Right of the object cell if it's a '0'.
    * The original object indices.
4. **`recolor(3, extended_indices)`**: Creates an object with the value '3' at the `extended_indices`.
5. **`paint(O, ...)`**: Paints the recoloured object onto the canvas. 

These are five different approaches to achieve the desired transformation. Each version utilizes a different set of DSL functions and logic to demonstrate the diversity of solutions possible within the provided DSL.
