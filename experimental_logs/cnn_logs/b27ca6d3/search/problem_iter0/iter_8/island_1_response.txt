## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects composed of '2's and adding a border of '3's around them if they are adjacent to the background color '0'. 

**Input_0:**
- Several scattered '2's exist.
- A frame of '3's is added around each '2' object if it touches a '0'.

**Input_1:**
- Again, we have scattered '2's forming objects.
-  '3's are used to create a border around objects adjacent to '0's.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1 (Inspired by finding border cells and their neighbors):**

```python
def solve(I):
  border_cells = mfilter(
      asobject(I),
      lambda c: c[0] == 2 and any(index(I, n) == 0 for n in dneighbors(c[1]))
  )
  frame = mapply(dneighbors, toindices(border_cells)) - toindices(border_cells)
  O = fill(I, 3, frame)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`border_cells = ...`**: This line identifies cells with value '2' that have at least one directly adjacent neighbor with value '0' (background).
2. **`frame = ...`**: It finds all direct neighbors of the `border_cells` and removes the original `border_cells` from this set, leaving only the indices for the frame.
3. **`O = ...`**:  Fills the `frame` indices with the value '3', effectively drawing the border.

**Version 2 (Using padding and filtering):**

```python
def solve(I):
    padded_I = canvas(0, (height(I) + 2, width(I) + 2))
    padded_I = paint(padded_I, shift(asobject(I), (1, 1)))
    frame = mfilter(
        asindices(padded_I),
        lambda loc: padded_I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 2 and
                    any(padded_I[n[0]][n[1]] == 0 for n in dneighbors(loc))
    )
    O = fill(I, 3, shift(frame, (-1, -1)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`padded_I = ...`**: Creates a canvas larger than the input grid `I` by two cells in each direction, filled with '0's.
2. **`padded_I = ...`**:  The input grid `I` is painted onto this canvas with an offset of (1, 1), effectively padding the grid.
3. **`frame = ...`**: Finds cells with value '2' in `padded_I` that have at least one '0' neighbor. These represent the border cells in the original grid.
4. **`O = ...`**:  Shifts the found `frame` indices back by (-1, -1) to match the original grid and fills them with '3' to draw the border. 

**Version 3 (Directly checking neighbor values):**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] == 2 and any(index(I, (i+di, j+dj)) == 0 for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]):
        for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]:
          if 0 <= i+di < height(I) and 0 <= j+dj < width(I) and O[i+di][j+dj] == 0:
            O = fill(O, 3, {(i+di, j+dj)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through each cell:** The code iterates through every cell in the grid `I`.
2. **Check for '2' and adjacent '0':** For each cell, it checks if the value is '2' and if it has an adjacent '0'. 
3. **Fill adjacent '0' with '3':** If the conditions are met, it fills the adjacent '0' cells with '3'.

**Version 4 (Using `objects` function):**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  border_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: any(index(I, n) == 0 for c in obj for n in dneighbors(c[1])))
  frame = mapply(lambda obj: mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj)), border_objs) - mapply(toindices, border_objs)
  O = fill(I, 3, frame)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = ...`**: Identifies all objects in the grid using the `objects` function.
2. **`border_objs = ...`**: Filters the objects to keep only those that have at least one cell directly adjacent to a background cell ('0').
3. **`frame = ...`**: Calculates the frame indices by finding the direct neighbors of all cells in the `border_objs` and then subtracting the indices of the `border_objs` themselves.
4. **`O = ...`**: Fills the `frame` indices with '3' to draw the border.

**Version 5 (Combining `partition` and filtering):**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = partition(I)
  border_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2 and any(index(I, n) == 0 for c in obj for n in dneighbors(c[1])))
  frame = mapply(lambda obj: mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj)), border_objs) - mapply(toindices, border_objs)
  O = fill(I, 3, frame)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = ...`**: Partitions the grid into objects based on cell values using the `partition` function.
2. **`border_objs = ...`**: Filters the objects to keep only those with color '2' that have at least one cell directly adjacent to a background cell ('0').
3. **`frame = ...`**:  Similar to Version 4, it calculates the frame indices by finding the direct neighbors of all cells in the `border_objs` and then removing the object indices.
4. **`O = ...`**:  Fills the `frame` indices with '3' to draw the border.
