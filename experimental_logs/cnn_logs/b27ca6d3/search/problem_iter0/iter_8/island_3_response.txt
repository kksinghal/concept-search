## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids seems to involve identifying non-zero elements and drawing a horizontal line of "3"s centered on these elements but only extending over other non-zero elements. 

* **Input_0:** Each "2" in the input grid has a horizontal line of "3"s drawn across it, extending only as far as it encounters another "2" or the edge of the grid. 

* **Input_1:** This follows the same pattern as Input_0. Notably, diagonally placed "2"s do not cause the lines to intersect; the line drawing appears to prioritize horizontal connections. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def paint_line(i, j):
    line = {(i, k) for k in range(j) if index(I, (i, k)) != ZERO}
    return frozenset() if len(line) == 0 else frozenset({(THREE, idx) for idx in connect(first(line)[1], last(line)[1])})
  painted = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != ZERO:
        painted = paint(painted, paint_line(i, j))
  return paint(painted,  frozenset({(THREE, idx) for idx in paint_line(i, len(I[0]))}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`paint_line(i, j)` function:** 
    - This function takes a row index (i) and a column index (j) as input. 
    - It identifies all non-zero cells in the row from the beginning to the given column index (j).
    - It then connects the first and last non-zero cells found with a line of "3"s, effectively painting a horizontal line over the non-zero elements encountered.
2. **Main loop:**
    - The program iterates through each cell in the input grid (`I`).
    - For each non-zero cell encountered, it calls the `paint_line` function to draw a horizontal line up to that cell's column.
    - The line is painted onto a copy of the input grid (`painted`) using the `paint` function.
3. **Final Line:**
    - After the loop, the program draws one final line for the last row to cover any remaining non-zero elements. 

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def hline_to_non_zero(i, j):
    return {(i, k) for k in range(width(I)) if index(I, (i, k)) != ZERO and k <= j}
  filled_grid = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != ZERO:
        line_indices = hline_to_non_zero(i, j)
        start_j = leftmost(line_indices)
        end_j = rightmost(line_indices)
        filled_grid = fill(filled_grid, THREE, {(i, k) for k in range(start_j, end_j + 1)})
  return filled_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`hline_to_non_zero(i, j)` function:**
    - Takes row (i) and column (j) indices.
    - Returns indices of non-zero cells in the row up to column j.
2. **Main Loop:**
    - Iterates through each cell of the grid.
    - If a non-zero cell is found:
      -  It determines the start and end column indices of the continuous line of non-zero cells up to the current cell's column.
      -  It fills the cells between those indices with the value "3".

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def extend_line(start, end, row_idx):
        return frozenset({(THREE, (row_idx, j)) for j in range(start, end + 1)})
    painted = I
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        non_zero_indices = [j for j, val in enumerate(row) if val != ZERO]
        if non_zero_indices:
            start_j = non_zero_indices[0]
            end_j = non_zero_indices[-1]
            painted = paint(painted, extend_line(start_j, end_j, i))
    return painted
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_line(start, end, row_idx)` function:** 
    - Creates a horizontal line of "3"s between the given start and end column indices on a specified row.
2. **Main Loop:**
    - Iterates through each row.
    - Finds the column indices of all non-zero elements in the row.
    - If non-zero elements exist:
      -  Gets the leftmost and rightmost non-zero column indices.
      -  Uses `extend_line` to create a line of "3"s spanning those columns on the current row.
      -  Paints the line onto the grid. 

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def line_segment(i, start_j, end_j):
    return {(THREE, (i, j)) for j in range(start_j, end_j + 1)}
  painted = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    current_segment_start = None
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != ZERO and current_segment_start is None:
        current_segment_start = j
      elif val == ZERO and current_segment_start is not None:
        painted = paint(painted, line_segment(i, current_segment_start, j - 1))
        current_segment_start = None
    if current_segment_start is not None:
      painted = paint(painted, line_segment(i, current_segment_start, len(row) - 1))
  return painted
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **`line_segment(i, start_j, end_j)` function:**
    -  Similar to previous versions, creates a horizontal line segment.
2. **Main Loop:** 
    - Iterates through each row, tracking the start index of a non-zero segment.
    - When a zero is encountered, it marks the end of the segment, draws the line, and resets the segment start. 
    - Handles the last segment of each row. 

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def paint_horizontal(grid, i):
    non_zero_cols = {j for j in range(width(grid)) if grid[i][j] != ZERO}
    if non_zero_cols:
      start_col = min(non_zero_cols)
      end_col = max(non_zero_cols)
      return fill(grid, THREE, {(i, j) for j in range(start_col, end_col + 1)})
    return grid
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in apply(lambda x: paint_horizontal(I, x), range(height(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`paint_horizontal(grid, i)` function:**
    -  Takes a grid and row index as input.
    -  Identifies non-zero column indices in the row.
    -  Fills a horizontal line with "3"s spanning the non-zero elements. 
2. **Main Logic:**
    -  Uses `apply` to apply the `paint_horizontal` function to each row index of the grid.
    -  Constructs and returns the modified grid. 

These five programs demonstrate different approaches to solving the transformation using the DSL. Each version leverages unique combinations of DSL functions and logic to achieve the desired output.
