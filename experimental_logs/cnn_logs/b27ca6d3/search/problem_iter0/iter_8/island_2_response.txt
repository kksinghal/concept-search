## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying non-zero objects and extending them horizontally by one cell to the left and right, but only if the adjacent cell is empty (contains a 0). The original object's color is used for the extension.

**Input_0 Example:**

- The '2' objects in the 3rd and 4th rows are extended to the left and right with '3's. 
- The single '2' in the 5th row is extended on both sides.
- The '2' objects in the 12th row are extended similarly. 

**Input_1 Example:**

- The '2 2' object in the first row is extended to the left and right.
- The lone '2's in the 2nd, 5th, 6th, and 15th rows are extended.
- Notice that the extension doesn't "jump over" existing non-zero cells.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the `Program_to_be_generated`:

**Program Version 1:** (Inspired by Program_A's loop structure and Program_B's conditional filling)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) 
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] != 0:
        if I[i][j - 1] == 0:
          O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, j - 1)})
        if I[i][j + 1] == 0:
          O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, j + 1)})
  return cellwise(O, I, 0) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** `O = canvas(0, shape(I))` creates an empty grid of the same size as the input.
2. **Iterate through Input:** The nested loops go through each cell of the input grid.
3. **Check for Non-Zero:**  If a cell is not 0 (meaning it's part of an object), we proceed.
4. **Extend Left and Right:** We check if the left and right neighbors are 0. If so, we fill the corresponding cells in the output grid `O` with the current cell's color using `fill`.
5. **Combine with Original:**  Finally, `cellwise(O, I, 0)` combines the extended objects in `O` with the original input `I`, using 0 as the fallback value for empty cells.

**Program Version 2:** (Using `objects` function and set comprehension for a more functional approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  extended_objs = frozenset({(color(obj), (i, j - 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j > 0 and I[i][j - 1] == 0} | 
                             {(color(obj), (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 0} | 
                             obj for obj in objs)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(extended_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objs = objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies all distinct objects in the input grid.
2. **Extend Objects:** The `extended_objs` set is created using set comprehension:
   - It iterates over each object `obj` in `objs`.
   - For each cell `(v, (i, j))` in an object, it checks if it can be extended to the left (`j > 0 and I[i][j - 1] == 0`) or right (`j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 0`). If so, it adds the extended cell to the set.
   - The original object `obj` is also added to `extended_objs`.
3. **Paint to Canvas:**  `paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(extended_objs))` creates an empty canvas and paints the extended objects onto it.

**Program Version 3:** (Utilizing `shift` for a more concise object manipulation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  extended_objs = frozenset(obj | 
                            (sfilter(shift(obj, (0, -1)), lambda c: index(I, c[1]) == 0)) | 
                            (sfilter(shift(obj, (0, 1)), lambda c: index(I, c[1]) == 0))
                            for obj in objs)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(extended_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Same as Version 2.
2. **Extend Objects:**
   - For each object, it uses `shift(obj, (0, -1))` and `shift(obj, (0, 1))` to create shifted copies one cell to the left and right.
   - `sfilter` is used to keep only the shifted cells that fall within the grid boundaries and have a value of 0 in the original input.
   - The original object is combined with the filtered shifted copies using set union (`|`).
3. **Paint to Canvas:**  Same as Version 2.

**Program Version 4:** (Focusing on horizontal lines and extending them)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  extended_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    if hline(obj):
      left_extension =  {(color(obj), (i, j - 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j > 0 and I[i][j - 1] == 0}
      right_extension = {(color(obj), (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 0}
      extended_objs = extended_objs | frozenset(obj | left_extension | right_extension)
    else:
      extended_objs = extended_objs | frozenset(obj)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(extended_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Same as Version 2.
2. **Extend Horizontal Lines:** 
    - It checks if an object `obj` is a horizontal line using `hline(obj)`. 
    - If it is, it extends the line to the left and right, similar to Version 2, but only if the adjacent cells are empty.
    - If the object is not a horizontal line, it's added to `extended_objs` without modification.
3. **Paint to Canvas:**  Same as Version 2. 

**Program Version 5:** (Using `hconcat` and `cellwise` for a different approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_left = hconcat(((0,),) * len(I), I)[:, :-1]
  shifted_right = hconcat(I, ((0,),) * len(I))[:, 1:]
  left_extension = cellwise(shifted_left, I, 0)
  right_extension = cellwise(shifted_right, I, 0)
  combined_extension = cellwise(left_extension, right_extension, 3) 
  return cellwise(combined_extension, I, 0) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Input:** 
   - `shifted_left` adds a column of zeros to the left of the input and then removes the rightmost column, effectively shifting the input one cell to the left. 
   - `shifted_right` does the same but shifts the input to the right.
2. **Identify Extension Areas:**
   - `left_extension` uses `cellwise` to compare the original input with the left-shifted input. If both cells have the same non-zero value, it indicates an area for leftward extension.
   - `right_extension` does the same for the rightward extension.
3. **Combine Extensions:** `combined_extension` merges the `left_extension` and `right_extension` grids, using a value of '3' for overlapping areas.
4. **Overlay on Original:**  Finally, `cellwise` combines the `combined_extension` with the original input, prioritizing the extensions while keeping the original objects intact.

These five programs demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation. Each version leverages unique combinations of DSL functions, offering diverse and creative solutions.
