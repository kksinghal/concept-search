## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking the input grid to the output grid involves the following steps:

1. **Identifying Border Cells:**  The program needs to identify cells containing the value '2' that are directly adjacent to a cell containing the value '0'. These are considered "border cells".

2. **Creating a Frame:**  The transformation then creates a "frame" around the identified border cells. This frame consists of the directly adjacent cells to the border cells, excluding the border cells themselves. 

3. **Filling the Frame:** Finally, the program fills the cells within the frame with the value '3'.

**Example:**

In Input_0, the cells at the following indices are identified as border cells: (2, 2), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 14), (8, 17), (11, 3), (11, 8), (12, 0), (14, 0), (14, 17). 

The frame is then created around these cells. For example, the frame around the border cell at (2, 2) would include the cells at (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 2), (2, 3).

Finally, all cells within the frame are filled with the value '3'.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  border_cells = mfilter(
    asobject(I),
    lambda c: c[0] == 2 and any(index(I, n) == 0 for n in dneighbors(c[1]))
  )
  frame = mapply(dneighbors, toindices(border_cells)) - toindices(border_cells)
  O = fill(I, 3, frame)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`border_cells = mfilter(...)`**: This line identifies the border cells. 
   - `asobject(I)` converts the input grid `I` into a set of (value, (i, j)) tuples.
   - `lambda c: c[0] == 2 and any(index(I, n) == 0 for n in dneighbors(c[1]))` is a filter function that selects tuples where the value is '2' and at least one directly adjacent neighbor has a value of '0'.
   - `mfilter` applies this filter to the object set and merges the results.

2. **`frame = mapply(...)`**: This line creates the frame.
   - `toindices(border_cells)` extracts the indices of the border cells.
   - `lambda loc: dneighbors(loc)` is a mapping function that generates the directly adjacent neighbors for each border cell index.
   - `mapply` applies the mapping function to each border cell index and merges the results.
   - `- toindices(border_cells)` removes the original border cell indices from the frame.

3. **`O = fill(...)`**: This line fills the frame with the value '3'.
   - `fill(I, 3, frame)` takes the input grid `I`, the value '3', and the frame indices, and fills the cells at those indices in a copy of `I` with '3'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(1, height(I) - 1):
    for j in range(1, width(I) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == 2 and any(index(I, (i+di, j+dj)) == 0 for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]):
        for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
          if 0 <= i + di < height(I) and 0 <= j + dj < width(I) and I[i+di][j+dj] != 2:
            O = fill(O, 3, {(i + di, j + dj)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each cell of the input grid, excluding the outermost border. If a cell contains '2' and has an adjacent '0', it fills its non-'2' neighbors with '3'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  border_cells = mfilter(asobject(I), lambda c: c[0] == 2 and any(index(I, n) == 0 for n in neighbors(c[1])))
  frame = mapply(neighbors, toindices(border_cells)) - toindices(border_cells)
  O = fill(I, 3, frame - toindices(border_cells))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

Similar to version 1, but uses `neighbors` instead of `dneighbors`, capturing both directly and diagonally adjacent cells for the frame.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  padded_I = canvas(0, (height(I) + 2, width(I) + 2))
  padded_I = paint(padded_I, shift(asobject(I), (1, 1)))
  frame = mfilter(
      asindices(padded_I),
      lambda loc: padded_I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 2 and any(padded_I[n[0]][n[1]] == 0 for n in dneighbors(loc))
  )
  O = fill(I, 3, shift(frame, (-1, -1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses padding to simplify the border checking process.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i, j in toindices(asobject(I)):
      if I[i][j] == 2 and any(0 <= i + di < height(I) and 0 <= j + dj < width(I) and I[i + di][j + dj] == 0 for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]):
          for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
              if 0 <= i + di < height(I) and 0 <= j + dj < width(I) and I[i + di][j + dj] == 0:
                  O = fill(O, 3, {(i + di, j + dj)})
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
This version iterates through each cell of the input grid. If a cell contains a '2' and has an adjacent '0', it finds the adjacent '0' cells and fills them with '3'. 



These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. Each version leverages different DSL functions and strategies to identify border cells, generate the frame, and perform the filling operation.
