## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of a specific color (2 in these examples) and drawing a border around them with another color (3 in these examples). The border extends one cell outward from the object's bounding box. 

**Input_0:**

- Each '2' is considered an individual object.
- A one-cell wide border of '3's is drawn around each object. 

**Input_1:**

- Same as Input_0, but with a denser configuration of '2's.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the `Program_to_be_generated` code in the provided DSL, each with an explanation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Identify objects
  return underfill(I, THREE,  # Fill with 3 under the condition...
                   merge(
                       mapply(lambda obj:  # ...for each object:
                               box(shift(toindices(obj), (1, 1))),  # Create a box shifted one cell outward
                              objs)))  # Merge all boxes
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The `objects` function finds all separate groups of '2's in the grid.
2. **Create Shifted Boxes:** For each object, we create a box using `box` around its indices. This box is then shifted diagonally downwards by one cell using `shift(..., (1, 1))`.
3. **Merge Boxes:** The boxes for all objects are merged using `merge`.
4. **Conditional Fill:** Finally, we use `underfill` to fill the merged boxes with the color '3', but only where the original grid `I` had the background color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  return paint(I, # Paint onto original grid
               merge(
                   mapply(lambda obj: 
                          recolor(THREE,  # Recolor to 3
                                  delta(  # Get the delta (border)
                                      toindices(obj))),  # Of the object's indices
                          objs))) # Merge all borders
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1, we use `objects` to find the '2' objects.
2. **Get Object Borders:** For each object, the `delta` function is used to get the indices of the cells forming a one-cell border around the object.
3. **Recolor Borders:**  These border indices are then recolored to '3' using `recolor`.
4. **Merge and Paint:** The borders of all objects are merged, and finally, the `paint` function draws these merged borders onto the original input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  return underfill(I, THREE,
                   merge(
                       mapply(lambda obj:
                              (connect((uppermost(obj)-1, leftmost(obj)-1), (uppermost(obj)-1, rightmost(obj)+1)) | # Top line
                               connect((lowermost(obj)+1, leftmost(obj)-1), (lowermost(obj)+1, rightmost(obj)+1)) | # Bottom line
                               connect((uppermost(obj)-1, leftmost(obj)-1), (lowermost(obj)+1, leftmost(obj)-1)) | # Left line
                               connect((uppermost(obj)-1, rightmost(obj)+1), (lowermost(obj)+1, rightmost(obj)+1))), # Right line
                              objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Similar to previous versions.
2. **Draw Lines:** For each object:
    - Four lines are drawn using `connect`, representing the top, bottom, left, and right sides of the border. 
    - Each line extends one cell beyond the object's boundaries.
3. **Merge and Fill:** The lines are merged, and `underfill` paints them with '3' only where the original grid has background color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  return paint(I,
               merge(
                   mapply(lambda obj:
                          recolor(THREE, 
                                  (sfilter(shift(box(toindices(obj)), (1, 0)), lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0])) |  # Right shift
                                   sfilter(shift(box(toindices(obj)), (-1, 0)), lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0])) |  # Left shift
                                   sfilter(shift(box(toindices(obj)), (0, 1)), lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0])) |  # Down shift
                                   sfilter(shift(box(toindices(obj)), (0, -1)), lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0])))),  # Up shift
                          objs))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Similar to previous versions.
2. **Shift and Filter:** For each object, its box is calculated and shifted in four directions: up, down, left, and right. The `sfilter` function ensures that only shifted indices that fall within the grid boundaries are kept.
3. **Recolor and Merge:** The shifted and filtered indices are then recolored to '3' and merged.
4. **Paint:** Finally, these border indices are painted onto the original grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  return underfill(I, THREE,
                   merge(
                       mapply(lambda obj:
                              (shoot((uppermost(obj)-1, leftmost(obj)), (0, 1)) |  # Top
                               shoot((lowermost(obj)+1, leftmost(obj)), (0, 1)) |  # Bottom
                               shoot((leftmost(obj)-1, uppermost(obj)), (1, 0)) |  # Left
                               shoot((leftmost(obj)-1, lowermost(obj)), (1, 0))), # Right
                              objs))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Shoot Lines:**  For each object:
   - The `shoot` function is used to create four lines that extend horizontally or vertically from the object's boundaries. 
3. **Merge and Fill:** The lines are merged, and `underfill` is used to fill the area under the merged lines with the color '3', but only where the original grid has background.
