## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation involves identifying horizontal runs of non-zero digits in the input grid. For each such run, a horizontal line filled with the digit '3' is drawn in the output grid, extending from the leftmost non-zero digit to the rightmost non-zero digit of the run.  The original non-zero digits are preserved.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the previous transformation, this one also focuses on horizontal runs of non-zero digits. However, instead of replacing the entire run with '3's, the transformation only replaces the zero-valued cells within each run with the digit '3'. The original non-zero digits are again preserved.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def paint_horizontal(grid, i):
    non_zero_cols = {j for j in range(width(grid)) if grid[i][j] != ZERO}
    if non_zero_cols:
      start_col = min(non_zero_cols)
      end_col = max(non_zero_cols)
      return fill(grid, THREE, {(i, j) for j in range(start_col, end_col + 1)})
    return grid
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in [paint_horizontal(I, i) for i in range(height(I))])

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`paint_horizontal(grid, i)`:** This function takes the grid and a row index `i` as input. It identifies the columns in row `i` containing non-zero values and stores them in the `non_zero_cols` set. If `non_zero_cols` is not empty, it finds the minimum and maximum column indices (`start_col` and `end_col`) representing the start and end of the horizontal run. It then uses the `fill` function to replace all cells in row `i` between `start_col` and `end_col` with the digit '3'.
2. **Main function:** It iterates through each row index `i` of the input grid `I`. For each row, it calls the `paint_horizontal` function. Finally, it reconstructs the grid from the modified rows and returns the result.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def paint_line(row):
    start = next((j for j, v in enumerate(row) if v != ZERO), len(row))
    end = next((len(row) - j for j, v in enumerate(row[::-1]) if v != ZERO), 0)
    return tuple(THREE if start <= j < len(row) - end else v for j, v in enumerate(row))
  return tuple(paint_line(row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`paint_line(row)`:** This function takes a single row of the grid as input. It finds the starting and ending indices (`start`, `end`) of the first non-zero run in the row. If no non-zero values are present, `start` and `end` are set to the row length and 0 respectively. It then creates a new row where every element between `start` and `len(row) - end` is replaced by '3', otherwise preserving the original value.
2. **Main function:** It iterates through each row of the input grid `I`, applying the `paint_line` function to each row.  The result is then combined back into a grid and returned.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(THREE if any(I[i][k] != ZERO for k in range(j+1)) and any(I[i][k] != ZERO for k in range(j, len(I[0]))) else I[i][j] for j in range(len(I[0]))) for i in range(len(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested list comprehensions to achieve the transformation within a single line. 

1. **Outer loop:** Iterates through each row `i` of the input grid `I`.
2. **Inner loop:** Iterates through each column `j` of the current row.
3. **Conditional:** For each cell (i, j), it checks if there exists a non-zero element in the current row both before the current column (`any(I[i][k] != ZERO for k in range(j+1))`) and after the current column (`any(I[i][k] != ZERO for k in range(j, len(I[0])))`). 
4. **Replacement:** If the condition is true (meaning the current cell lies within a horizontal run of non-zero elements), the cell value is replaced by `THREE`. Otherwise, the original value `I[i][j]` is kept.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_row(row):
    painting = False
    new_row = []
    for v in row:
      if v != ZERO:
        painting = True
      new_row.append(THREE if painting else v)
    return tuple(new_row)
  return tuple(process_row(row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`process_row(row)`:** This function takes a row as input and iterates through each element. A boolean flag `painting` indicates whether the current element is part of a non-zero run. It starts as `False` and is set to `True` once a non-zero element is encountered. The function constructs a new row, replacing elements with `THREE` if `painting` is True, otherwise keeping the original element.
2. **Main function:** It applies the `process_row` function to each row of the input grid `I` and returns the modified grid.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(THREE if any(I[i][k] != ZERO for k in range(len(I[0]))) else ZERO for j in range(len(I[0]))) if any(v != ZERO for v in I[i]) else tuple(ZERO for _ in range(len(I[0]))) for i in range(len(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version employs nested list comprehensions for a compact solution.

1. **Outer loop:** Iterates through each row `i` of the input grid `I`.
2. **Conditional:** Checks if any element in the current row is non-zero (`any(v != ZERO for v in I[i])`).
3. **True branch:** If a non-zero element exists in the row, it creates a new row where each cell is set to `THREE` if any cell in the original row is non-zero, otherwise set to `ZERO`. This effectively replaces zero-valued cells within a non-zero run with '3's.
4. **False branch:** If no non-zero element exists in the row, it creates a new row filled with `ZERO`s.
5. **Result:** The modified rows are combined into a new grid and returned.

These five versions provide distinct approaches and demonstrate the flexibility of the DSL in achieving the desired transformation. Each version leverages different functions and logic, showcasing diverse coding styles within the DSL's constraints.
