## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to extend horizontal lines (composed of a single color) by adding a "border" of value '3' around their ends, as long as these ends are adjacent to the background color '0'.

**Input_0:**

- The single '2' values remain unchanged.
- The horizontal lines of '2's get extended by one cell on each side with the value '3'. 

**Input_1:**

-  Similar to Input_0, only horizontal lines formed by the digit '2' are extended. 
-  Vertical lines and single '2' values are left untouched.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct code versions implementing the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:** (Inspired by Program_A's object iteration and Program_B's conditional filling)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if hline(obj):
      for v, (i, j) in obj:
        if j > 0 and I[i][j-1] == 0:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j-1)})
        if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j+1] == 0:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j+1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  We find all objects in the input grid 'I' using `objects(I, True, False, True)`, focusing on single-color objects without background.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** We iterate through each object. If an object is a horizontal line (`hline(obj)`), we check its left and right neighbors. If a neighbor is background '0', we fill it with '3' in the output grid 'O'.

**Program Version 2:** (Utilizing shifted grids for neighbor checks)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_left = hconcat(((0,),) * len(I), I)[:, :-1]
  shifted_right = hconcat(I, ((0,),) * len(I))[:, 1:]
  extension_left = cellwise(I, shifted_left, 0)
  extension_right = cellwise(I, shifted_right, 0)
  combined_extension = cellwise(extension_left, extension_right, 3)
  return cellwise(combined_extension, I, 0)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shifted Grids:** We create `shifted_left` and `shifted_right` grids by padding the input 'I' with a column of zeros on the left and right, respectively.
2. **Identify Extension Points:** We use `cellwise` to mark potential extension points. `extension_left` has the original value if the left neighbor is different, otherwise 0.  `extension_right` does the same for the right neighbor.
3. **Combine Extensions:** `combined_extension` uses `cellwise` again. If both left and right extensions are possible at a location, it gets value '3', otherwise it retains its value from `extension_left`.
4. **Final Output:**  Finally, we use `cellwise` to combine the `combined_extension` with the original input 'I', keeping the original values unless there's an extension ('3'). 

**Program Version 3:** (Focusing on object boundaries and extension)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    if hline(obj):
      extension = {(i, j - 1) for v, (i, j) in obj if j > 0 and I[i][j - 1] == 0} | \
                  {(i, j + 1) for v, (i, j) in obj if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 0} 
      O = paint(O, obj | recolor(3, extension))
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification and Canvas:** We identify objects and create an empty canvas 'O' of the same size as the input 'I'.
2. **Horizontal Line Extension:** For each horizontal line object, we compute the `extension` indices by directly checking left and right neighbors within the object. We recolor the extension to '3' and paint both the original object and the extension onto the canvas.
3. **Non-Horizontal Objects:** Non-horizontal objects are painted directly onto the canvas without modifications.

**Program Version 4:** (Leveraging `hperiod` to detect horizontal lines)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if hperiod(obj) == 1:  # Object is a horizontal line
      for v, (i, j) in obj:
        if j > 0 and I[i][j-1] == 0:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j-1)})
        if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j+1] == 0:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j+1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
This version is very similar to version 1 but uses `hperiod(obj) == 1` to check for horizontal lines, offering a slightly different approach to line detection.


**Program Version 5:** (Using `frontiers` to find extension points)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in frontiers(I):
    if color(obj) != 0 and hline(obj): # Only extend non-background horizontal frontiers
      for v, (i, j) in obj:
        if j > 0 and I[i][j - 1] == 0:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j - 1)})
        if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 0:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Frontiers:** We directly identify potential extension points using `frontiers(I)`, which efficiently gives us boundaries of single-color regions.
2. **Filter and Extend:** We iterate through frontiers. If a frontier is a horizontal line (`hline(obj)`) and not the background color (color != 0), we check its neighbors and extend it with '3's in the output 'O' as needed.
