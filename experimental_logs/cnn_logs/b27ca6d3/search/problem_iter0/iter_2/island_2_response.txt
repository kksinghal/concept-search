## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid and then expanding them horizontally by one cell on each side. The expanding color is a new color, 3, which does not appear in the input grid. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The '2' digits form distinct objects. Each object is expanded horizontally with '3's.  Notice that '2's at the edges of the grid are also expanded with '3's within the grid boundaries.
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, all '2' objects are expanded horizontally with '3's.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions for the "Program_to_be_generated" function:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j-1), (i, j+1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all connected regions of the same digit (objects) in the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate and Expand:** The code iterates through each object (`obj`) and each cell (`(i, j)`) within the object.
3. **Horizontal Expansion:** For each cell, it fills the cells to the left (`(i, j-1)`) and right (`(i, j+1)`) with the new color '3' using `fill(O, 3, {(i, j-1), (i, j+1)})`.
4. **Return Output:** Finally, the modified grid `O` (output) is returned.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v != 0:
        if j > 0:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j-1)})
        if j < len(row) - 1:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j+1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Grid:** This version iterates directly through the grid cells instead of identifying objects.
2. **Check for Non-Background:** It checks if a cell is not background (`v != 0`).
3. **Conditional Horizontal Expansion:** If the cell is not on the leftmost or rightmost edge, it fills the cell to the left and/or right with '3'.
4. **Return Output:** It returns the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expansion =  frozenset({(-1, 0), (1, 0)})
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = fill(O, 3, mapply(lambda loc: shift({loc}, (0, 1)).union(shift({loc}, (0, -1))), toindices(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Define Expansion:** It defines a set `expansion` representing the relative positions to expand.
3. **Apply Expansion:** For each object, it shifts the object indices left and right and fills those positions with '3'.
4. **Return Output:** It returns the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_left =  hconcat(((0,),)*len(I), trim(I))
  shifted_right = hconcat(trim(I), ((0,),)*len(I))
  O = cellwise(shifted_left, I, 3)
  O = cellwise(shifted_right, O, 3)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Shifted Grids:** Creates two grids, `shifted_left` and `shifted_right`, by shifting the input grid one cell to the left and right, respectively, filling the empty spaces with 0s.
2. **Apply Cellwise Comparison:** It uses `cellwise` to compare the original grid with the shifted grids, filling in '3' where they differ.
3. **Return Output:** It returns the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v != 0:
        O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j))})
        if j > 0:
          O = paint(O, {(3, (i, j-1))})
        if j < len(row) - 1:
          O = paint(O, {(3, (i, j+1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** Creates an empty grid `O` of the same size as the input, filled with '0's.
2. **Iterate and Paint:** Iterates through the input grid, and for each non-background cell, paints the corresponding cell in the output grid with the original color and expands horizontally with '3's.
3. **Return Output:** It returns the modified grid `O`.
