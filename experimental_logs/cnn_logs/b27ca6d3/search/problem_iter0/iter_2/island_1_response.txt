## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the border of objects with color "2" that are adjacent to the background color "0". Then, the background within the bounding box of these border cells is filled with the color "3". 

**Input_0:**

* The "2" objects at the top, bottom, and right edge of the grid are not fully enclosed by "0". Their border cells adjacent to "0" are identified.
* The bounding box of these border cells encompasses the space between them, which gets filled with "3".

**Input_1:**

* Similar to Input_0, the border cells of "2" objects adjacent to "0" are found.
* The bounding box of these cells is filled with "3", creating a "frame" around the "2" objects.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1 (Inspired by Program_A's use of `ofcolor` and Program_B's `fill`)**

```python
def solve(I):
  border_indices = mfilter(
      ofcolor(I, 2), 
      lambda loc: any(n in ofcolor(I, 0) for n in neighbors(loc))
  )
  O = fill(I, 3, backdrop(border_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`border_indices = ...`**: Identifies indices of cells with value "2" that have at least one neighbor with value "0" (background).
2. **`O = ...`**: Fills the `backdrop` (bounding box) of the `border_indices` with color "3".


**Version 2 (Using `objects` and iterating through them)**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2 and any(n in ofcolor(I, 0) for n in toindices(box(obj))):
      I = fill(I, 3, backdrop(toindices(obj)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = ...`**:  Extracts all objects from the grid, excluding the background.
2. **`for obj in objs...`**: Iterates through each object.
3. **`if color(obj) == 2 and ...`**: Checks if the object's color is "2" and if its bounding box (`box`) contains a background cell ("0").
4. **`I = ...`**: If both conditions are met, fill the object's backdrop with "3".


**Version 3 (Using nested `mfilter` for border detection)**

```python
def solve(I):
  border_indices = mfilter(
      ofcolor(I, 2), 
      lambda loc: mfilter(
          neighbors(loc), 
          lambda n: n in ofcolor(I, 0)
      )
  )
  O = fill(I, 3, backdrop(border_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`border_indices = ...`**:  Similar to Version 1, but uses a nested `mfilter` to find cells with "2" that have neighboring cells with "0".
2. **`O = ...`**: Fills the backdrop of the detected border indices with "3".


**Version 4 (Using `delta` to fill the inside)**

```python
def solve(I):
  border_indices = mfilter(
      ofcolor(I, 2), 
      lambda loc: any(n in ofcolor(I, 0) for n in neighbors(loc))
  )
  O = fill(I, 3, delta(border_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`border_indices = ...`**: Same as Version 1, identifying the border indices.
2. **`O = ...`**:  Instead of filling the backdrop, it fills the `delta` of `border_indices`, which are the indices within the bounding box but not part of the border itself.


**Version 5 (Using list comprehension and conditional filling)**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = tuple(
      tuple(
          3 if any(I[i+di][j+dj] == 0 
                   for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)] 
                   if 0<=i+di<h and 0<=j+dj<w) 
               else I[i][j] 
          for j in range(w)
      ) 
      for i in range(h)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h, w = ...`**: Get height and width of the input grid.
2. **`O = ...`**: Creates a new grid by iterating through each cell and checking its neighbors. 
3. **`if any(...) ...`**:  Checks if any directly adjacent neighbor is "0" (background). If true, the cell is filled with "3"; otherwise, it retains its original value from the input grid.

These five versions offer different approaches to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility of the DSL and providing alternative code solutions.
