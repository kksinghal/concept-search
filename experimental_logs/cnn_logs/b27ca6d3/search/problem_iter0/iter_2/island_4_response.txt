## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (groups of connected, non-background cells) in the input grid and drawing a 3x3 box around them, filled with the value '3'. The box extends outwards from the object's bounding box, effectively creating a one-cell buffer zone around the object.

**Input 0:**

- Objects are formed by the digit '2' on a background of '0'.
- The output shows 3x3 boxes filled with '3' surrounding each '2' object.

**Input 1:**

- Similar to Input 0, objects are formed by the digit '2'.
- The 3x3 boxes are drawn around the '2' objects, filled with '3'.


## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T) # Find all non-background objects
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda o: shift(o, (-1, -1)), objs) # Shift each object one cell up and left
  expanded_boxes = mapply(lambda o: box(toindices(o)), shifted_objs) # Calculate bounding boxes of shifted objects
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(expanded_boxes)) # Fill the bounding boxes with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find objects:** `objects(I, F, T, T)` identifies all non-background objects.
2. **Shift objects:** `shifted_objs` shifts each object one cell up and left using `shift(o, (-1, -1))`.
3. **Calculate expanded boxes:** `expanded_boxes` calculates the bounding boxes of the shifted objects using `box(toindices(o))`, effectively creating the 3x3 box.
4. **Fill boxes:** `fill(I, THREE, merge(expanded_boxes))` fills the merged bounding boxes with the value '3'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T)  # Find all non-background objects
  expanded_boxes = mapply(lambda o: outbox(toindices(o)), objs) # Calculate the outbox of each object
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(expanded_boxes))  # Fill the outboxes with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find objects:** `objects(I, F, T, T)` identifies all non-background objects.
2. **Calculate expanded boxes:** `expanded_boxes` calculates the outbox of each object's indices using `outbox(toindices(o))`, directly resulting in the 3x3 box.
3. **Fill boxes:** `fill(I, THREE, merge(expanded_boxes))` fills the merged outboxes with the value '3'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T) # Find all non-background objects
  surrounding_cells = mapply(lambda o: delta(backdrop(toindices(o))), objs) # Find cells in bounding box but not part of the object
  expanded_boxes = mapply(lambda o: backdrop(toindices(o)), objs) # Calculate the bounding boxes of each object
  O = fill(fill(I, THREE, merge(expanded_boxes)), ZERO, merge(surrounding_cells)) # Fill bounding boxes with '3', then replace the delta with '0'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find objects:** `objects(I, F, T, T)` identifies all non-background objects.
2. **Find surrounding cells:** `surrounding_cells` uses `delta(backdrop(toindices(o)))` to find cells within the object's bounding box but not part of the object itself.
3. **Calculate bounding boxes:** `expanded_boxes` calculates the bounding boxes using `backdrop(toindices(o))`.
4. **Fill boxes and replace:** First, the bounding boxes are filled with '3' using `fill(I, THREE, merge(expanded_boxes))`. Then, the `delta` cells are replaced with '0' using `fill(..., ZERO, merge(surrounding_cells))`, effectively leaving only the 3x3 box filled with '3'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T) # Find all non-background objects
  object_indices = mapply(toindices, objs) # Extract indices of all objects
  expanded_indices = mapply(lambda idx: neighbors(idx) | idx, object_indices) # For each object index, include its neighbors and itself
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(expanded_indices)) # Fill the expanded indices with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find objects and extract indices:** Identify objects and obtain their indices using `objects` and `mapply(toindices, objs)`.
2. **Expand indices:** Utilize `neighbors(idx) | idx` to include neighboring cells for each object index, effectively expanding the selection to a 3x3 area.
3. **Fill expanded area:** Fill the expanded indices with the value '3' using `fill(I, THREE, merge(expanded_indices))`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, F, T, T) # Find all objects in the grid
    expanded_boxes = set()
    for obj in objs:
        for cell in obj:
            i, j = cell[1]
            for di in range(-1, 2):
                for dj in range(-1, 2):
                    expanded_boxes.add((i + di, j + dj))
    O = fill(I, THREE, frozenset(expanded_boxes)) # Fill the expanded boxes in the grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find objects:** `objects(I, F, T, T)` identifies all non-background objects.
2. **Iterate and expand:** Iterates through each cell of each object. For each cell, it creates a 3x3 box around it by adding offsets `di` and `dj` ranging from -1 to 1.
3. **Fill boxes:** `fill(I, THREE, frozenset(expanded_boxes))` fills the identified box indices with the value '3'.

These are just a few examples; many other variations are possible within the DSL. Remember that the goal is to achieve the desired output, and different approaches can be equally valid.
