## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation involves identifying the horizontal and vertical lines formed by the digit '2' in the input grid. A new object consisting of the digit '3' is then drawn, centered around each '2', extending one cell in each direction (up, down, left, right).

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  The transformation is similar to the previous one. The difference lies in the shape of the object drawn around the digit '2'. In this case, it forms a plus sign shape with an extra cell on the right and left ends of the horizontal line, using the digit '3'. 

## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve_29ec7d0e(I):
    # Identify the non-zero objects in the input grid
    objs = difference(partition(I), colorfilter(partition(I), ZERO))

    # Create a set to store the '3' shaped objects
    new_objs = initset(frozenset())

    # Iterate over each non-zero object
    for obj in objs:
        # Calculate the center of the current object
        center_i, center_j = centerofmass(obj)
        
        # Create the '3' shaped object around the center
        new_obj = (
            {(THREE, (center_i - 1, center_j - 1)), (THREE, (center_i - 1, center_j)), (THREE, (center_i - 1, center_j + 1)),
             (THREE, (center_i, center_j - 1)), (THREE, (center_i, center_j)), (THREE, (center_i, center_j + 1)),
             (THREE, (center_i + 1, center_j - 1)), (THREE, (center_i + 1, center_j)), (THREE, (center_i + 1, center_j + 1))}
        )
        
        # Add the newly created object to the set
        new_objs = combine(new_objs, {new_obj})

    # Paint all the new objects onto the input grid
    O = paint(I, merge(new_objs))

    return O
```

**Explanation:** This program first identifies all the non-zero objects in the input grid. For each object, it determines the center and then constructs a new object shaped like '3' centered at that point. Finally, it paints all the new objects onto the input grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve_29ec7d0e(I):
    # Get indices of all '2' cells
    two_indices = ofcolor(I, TWO)

    # Generate '3' shaped patch centered at (0, 0)
    base_patch = frozenset({(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)})

    # Shift and paint '3' shape for each '2' cell
    O = I
    for i, j in two_indices:
        O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, shift(base_patch, (i, j))))

    return O
```

**Explanation:** This version directly locates the '2' cells. It then defines a base '3' shaped patch and shifts it to each '2' cell's location before painting it onto the grid.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve_29ec7d0e(I):
    # Find all objects in the grid
    objects = partition(I)

    # Filter out the background (assumed to be the most common color)
    objects = difference(objects, {mostcommon(objects)})

    # Define a function to create the '3' shape around a given index
    def create_shape(index):
        i, j = index
        return frozenset({(THREE, (i - 1, j - 1)), (THREE, (i - 1, j)), (THREE, (i - 1, j + 1)),
                          (THREE, (i, j - 1)), (THREE, (i, j)), (THREE, (i, j + 1)),
                          (THREE, (i + 1, j - 1)), (THREE, (i + 1, j)), (THREE, (i + 1, j + 1))})

    # Create the new objects by applying the shape function to each cell of the existing objects
    new_objects = mapply(create_shape, objects)

    # Paint the new objects onto a copy of the input grid
    O = paint(I, merge(new_objects))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**  This version first separates the grid into objects. It then iterates through each cell of the non-background objects and generates a new '3' shaped object centered at that cell. Finally, it overlays these new objects onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve_29ec7d0e(I):
    # Define the '3' shape as a list of offsets from the center
    shape_offsets = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]

    # Find the indices of all non-zero cells
    non_zero_indices = ofcolor(I, 2)

    # Create a new grid filled with the background color
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))

    # Iterate over each non-zero index
    for i, j in non_zero_indices:
        # For each offset, calculate the new cell's position
        for di, dj in shape_offsets:
            new_i, new_j = i + di, j + dj
            # Check if the new cell's position is within the grid's bounds
            if 0 <= new_i < height(I) and 0 <= new_j < width(I):
                # Paint the new cell with the color '3'
                O = paint(O, {(THREE, (new_i, new_j))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**  This version focuses on efficiency by directly manipulating the grid cells. It iterates over non-zero cells and applies pre-defined offsets to draw the '3' shape around them.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve_29ec7d0e(I):
    # Create a function to generate the '3' shaped object
    def generate_shape(i, j):
        return frozenset({(THREE, (i - 1, j - 1)), (THREE, (i - 1, j)), (THREE, (i - 1, j + 1)),
                         (THREE, (i, j - 1)), (THREE, (i, j)), (THREE, (i, j + 1)),
                         (THREE, (i + 1, j - 1)), (THREE, (i + 1, j)), (THREE, (i + 1, j + 1))})

    # Apply the function to all cells of the input grid
    new_grid = prapply(generate_shape, range(height(I)), range(width(I)))

    # Filter the generated shapes to only keep those centered on a '2' cell in the original grid
    filtered_grid = sfilter(new_grid, lambda obj: index(I, centerofmass(obj)) == 2)

    # Paint the filtered shapes onto a copy of the original grid
    O = paint(I, merge(filtered_grid))
    return O
```

**Explanation:** This version applies a function to every cell in the grid to generate the '3' shape. It then filters the generated shapes to keep only those centered around the '2' cells from the original grid before painting them.
