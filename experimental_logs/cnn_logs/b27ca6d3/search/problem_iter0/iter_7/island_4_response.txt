## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the input grid and then expanding them by one layer of cells, but only if the expansion goes into background cells (value 0). The expanded cells are then filled with the value 3.

**Input 0:**

* Objects (2) are identified.
* The perimeter of each object is expanded by one cell, filling in the background cells (0) with the value 3.

**Input 1:**

* Similar to Input 0, objects (2) are identified.
* The perimeter of each object is expanded, filling in the background cells (0) with the value 3. 

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, T, T)  # Find all objects
  expanded_perimeter = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for cell in toindices(obj):
      neighbors_set = neighbors(cell)
      for neighbor in neighbors_set:
        if index(I, neighbor) == 0: # If the neighbor is a background cell
          expanded_perimeter.add(neighbor)
  O = fill(I, THREE, frozenset(expanded_perimeter)) # Fill the expanded perimeter with 3
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, F, T, T)` identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Expand Perimeter:** 
   - Iterate through each object and its cells.
   - For each cell, find its neighbors using `neighbors(cell)`.
   - If a neighbor is a background cell (value 0), add it to the `expanded_perimeter` set.
3. **Fill Expanded Perimeter:** `fill(I, THREE, frozenset(expanded_perimeter))` fills all cells in the `expanded_perimeter` with the value 3.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = partition(I)  # Partition into objects
  bg = mostcolor(I)  # Identify the background color
  expanded = mapply(lambda obj: mfilter(lambda n: index(I, n) == bg, mapply(neighbors, toindices(obj))), objs)
  O = fill(I, THREE, expanded) # Fill the expanded cells with 3
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition:** `partition(I)` divides the grid into objects based on cell values.
2. **Identify Background:** `mostcolor(I)` identifies the background color.
3. **Expand and Filter:**
   - For each object, find the neighbors of all its cells using nested `mapply` and `neighbors`.
   - Filter these neighbors, keeping only those that match the background color using `mfilter`.
4. **Fill:** `fill(I, THREE, expanded)` fills the identified background neighbor cells with 3.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return cellwise(I, fill(I, THREE, mapply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), objects(I, F, T, T))), I) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, F, T, T)` finds all objects in the grid.
2. **Find Delta:** For each object, `delta(toindices(obj))` identifies cells in the object's bounding box that are not part of the object.
3. **Fill Delta:** `fill(I, THREE, ...)` fills the identified delta cells with the value 3.
4. **Cellwise Merge:** `cellwise(I, ..., I)` merges the original grid with the filled grid, prioritizing the original grid's values.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Initialize output as input
  for obj in objects(I, F, T, T):
    for cell in toindices(obj):
      for n in neighbors(cell):
        if 0 <= n[0] < height(I) and 0 <= n[1] < width(I) and index(I, n) == 0:
          O = fill(O, THREE, {n})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize and Iterate:**  Start with the output grid `O` as a copy of the input `I`. Iterate through each object and its cells.
2. **Check Neighbors:** For each cell, examine its neighbors using `neighbors(cell)`.
3. **Boundary and Background Check:** Ensure the neighbor is within the grid boundaries and has a value of 0 (background) in the input grid `I`.
4. **Fill if Condition Met:** If a neighbor meets the criteria, fill that cell in the output grid `O` with the value 3.

**Program Version 5:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def expand_object(obj):
        return delta(toindices(obj)) 
    expanded_cells = mapply(expand_object, objects(I, F, T, T))
    return fill(I, THREE, expanded_cells)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `expand_object`:** A helper function to find the delta (surrounding background cells) for a given object.
2. **Map `expand_object`:**  Apply `expand_object` to all objects in the input grid using `mapply`, effectively finding the expandable perimeter around each object.
3. **Fill Expanded Cells:**  Finally, fill the identified `expanded_cells` with the value 3 using the `fill` function.

These five programs demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation. They showcase the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
