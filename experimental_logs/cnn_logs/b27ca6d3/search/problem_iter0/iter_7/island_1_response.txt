## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** The program identifies cells with value '2' that are horizontally or vertically adjacent to cells with value '0'. It then creates a frame around these cells using value '3', effectively outlining them. 

**Input_1 -> Output_1:** Similar to the first transformation, the program finds cells with value '2' adjacent to '0' cells. However, it builds a frame extending diagonally upwards and to the right, using value '3'.


## Program Versions & Explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  border_cells = mfilter(
      asobject(I), 
      lambda c: c[0] == 2 and any(n[0] == 0 for n in toobject(dneighbors(c[1]), I))
  )
  frame = mapply(dneighbors, toindices(border_cells)) - toindices(border_cells)
  O = fill(I, 3, frame)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify border cells:** `border_cells` stores objects containing cells with value '2' that are directly adjacent to cells with value '0'.
2. **Create the frame:** `frame` stores the indices surrounding the `border_cells` by applying `dneighbors` to each border cell and removing the original border cell indices.
3. **Fill the frame:** The input grid `I` is then filled with the value '3' at the indices specified by `frame`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    padded_I = canvas(0, (height(I) + 2, width(I) + 2))
    padded_I = paint(padded_I, shift(asobject(I), (1, 1)))
    frame = mfilter(
        asindices(padded_I),
        lambda loc: padded_I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 2 and
                    any(padded_I[n[0]][n[1]] == 0 for n in dneighbors(loc))
    )
    O = fill(I, 3, shift(frame, (-1, -1)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a padded grid:** A new grid `padded_I` is created with a border of '0' cells around the original grid.
2. **Paint the original grid onto the padded grid:** The original grid `I` is shifted by (1,1) and painted onto `padded_I`.
3. **Find the frame indices:**  Similar to version 1, `frame` stores indices of cells in `padded_I` that meet the border criteria.
4. **Shift and fill:** The `frame` is shifted back by (-1,-1) to align with the original grid, and the original grid `I` is filled with '3' at those indices. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  two_cells = ofcolor(I, 2)
  adjacent_to_zero = mapply(dneighbors, two_cells)
  frame = sfilter(adjacent_to_zero, lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0)
  O = fill(I, 3, frame)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get indices of '2' cells:** `two_cells` stores indices of cells with value '2'.
2. **Find adjacent cells:** `adjacent_to_zero` gets all neighbors of `two_cells`.
3. **Filter for frame cells:** `frame` keeps only those cells in `adjacent_to_zero` whose value in the original grid `I` is '0'.
4. **Fill the frame:**  The input grid `I` is filled with '3' at the indices specified by `frame`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  border_cells = mfilter(
      asobject(I),
      lambda c: c[0] == 2 and any(index(I, n) == 0 for n in dneighbors(c[1]))
  )
  frame = mapply(lambda loc: sfilter(dneighbors(loc), lambda n: index(I, n) == 0), toindices(border_cells))
  O = fill(I, 3, frame)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify border cells:** `border_cells` stores objects with cells having value '2' and directly adjacent to cells with value '0'.
2. **Find adjacent '0' cells:** For each cell in `border_cells`, the program finds its direct neighbors with value '0' and stores them in `frame`.
3. **Fill the frame:** The input grid `I` is filled with '3' at the indices specified by `frame`.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  twos = partition(I)
  filtered_twos = sfilter(twos, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2 and any(index(I, n) == 0 for cell in obj for n in dneighbors(cell[1])))
  frame_indices = mapply(lambda obj: mapply(lambda cell: sfilter(dneighbors(cell[1]), lambda n: index(I, n) == 0), obj), filtered_twos)
  O = fill(I, 3, frame_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Partition by color:** `twos` stores sets of cells, each set representing an object with the same color.
2. **Filter for relevant '2' objects:** `filtered_twos` keeps only objects with color '2' and at least one cell directly adjacent to a '0' cell.
3. **Extract frame indices:** For each relevant object, the code identifies its neighboring cells with value '0' and stores them in `frame_indices`.
4. **Fill the frame:** The input grid `I` is filled with '3' at the `frame_indices`.

Each version utilizes different DSL functions and approaches to achieve the desired transformations, providing a diverse set of solutions.
