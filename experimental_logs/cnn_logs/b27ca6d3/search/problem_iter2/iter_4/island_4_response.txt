## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves shrinking and recoloring objects based on their size.  Let's break it down:

**Common Pattern:**

1. **Object Identification:** The input grid is analyzed to identify distinct objects (connected groups of the same digit).
2. **Size-Based Shrinking:** Each object is shrunk. The shrinking factor seems inversely proportional to the object's size – larger objects shrink more.
3. **Recoloring:** All shrunk objects are recolored to '2'.
4. **Placement:** The shrunk and recolored objects are placed on a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid, maintaining their relative positions.

**Specific Observations:**

* **Input_0:** The large 3x8 and 17x3 rectangles shrink significantly, while smaller objects like the single '3's remain mostly in their original form.
* **Input_1:**  A similar pattern is observed where the larger 3x6 and 10x2 rectangles shrink more drastically.  

## Code Generation:

Since the exact shrinking formula isn't immediately obvious, we'll use a heuristic approach.  We'll leverage the provided DSL functions to:

1. **Calculate Shrinking Factors:**  We'll experiment with different functions that generate shrinking factors based on object size.
2. **Apply Shrinking:**  We'll use these factors to calculate new object positions after shrinking. 

Below are five distinct program versions using different shrinking logic and DSL function combinations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  shrunk_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    s = size(obj) 
    factor = 4 // (s // 3 + 1) # Heuristic shrinking factor
    i, j = centerofmass(obj) # Using center of mass for position
    new_loc = (i // factor * factor, j // factor * factor) 
    shrunk_objs.add(frozenset({(TWO, new_loc)}))
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(shrunk_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Analysis:** Identify objects, background color.
2. **Shrinking Factor:**  `factor = 4 // (s // 3 + 1)` is a heuristic; larger `s` leads to smaller `factor`.
3. **New Location:** `centerofmass` gives a central point.  Division and multiplication by `factor` ensure the new location aligns to a grid determined by the shrinking factor.
4. **Recoloring and Painting:**  Shrunk objects are painted onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  shrunk_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    s = size(obj)
    factor = max(1, 5 - s // 2) # Different shrinking factor calculation
    i, j = ulcorner(obj) 
    new_loc = (i // factor, j // factor) 
    shrunk_objs.add(recolor(TWO, {(new_loc)})) 
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(shrunk_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Shrinking Factor:** Uses `max(1, 5 - s // 2)` – a different formula with a size threshold.
* **New Location:** Calculates the new location based on the upper-left corner and shrinking factor. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  shrunk_objs = frozenset(recolor(TWO, {(centerofmass(obj)[0] // (4 - len(obj) // 4), centerofmass(obj)[1] // (4 - len(obj) // 4))}) for obj in objs)
  O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(shrunk_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Concise Formula:**  Combines shrinking, recoloring, and placement into a single line using a generator expression.  

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
    for obj in objs:
        size_factor = max(1, 4 - size(obj) // 3)
        new_obj = {(TWO, (i // size_factor, j // size_factor)) for _, (i, j) in obj}
        O = paint(O, new_obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Iterative Painting:**  Instead of creating a separate set for shrunk objects, this version iterates through the objects, shrinks and recolors them, and directly paints them onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    shrinking_factors = {obj: max(1, 5 - size(obj) // 2) for obj in objs} 
    shrunk_objs = frozenset(recolor(TWO, {divide(ulcorner(obj), shrinking_factors[obj])}) for obj in objs)
    O = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(shrunk_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* **Pre-calculated Factors:**  Calculates shrinking factors for each object upfront and stores them in a dictionary (`shrinking_factors`) for efficient reuse.

## Note: 

These are examples, and you might need to further refine the shrinking factor logic or experiment with different DSL function combinations to achieve a perfect score.
