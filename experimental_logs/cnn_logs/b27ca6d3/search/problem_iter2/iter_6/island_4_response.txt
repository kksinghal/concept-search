## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves shrinking specific objects within the input grid while retaining their relative positions. Here's a detailed breakdown:

**Common Pattern:**

1. **Object Identification:** Identify all distinct objects (connected components of the same digit) in the input grid, excluding the background color (most frequent color).
2. **Shrinking:** Shrink each object to a single cell. The new cell's location is determined by shifting the object's upper-left corner one cell down and one cell to the right.
3. **Recoloring:** The shrunk object's cell is assigned a new color (2 in the provided examples).

**Input 0:** 

- Three '3' objects are identified.
- Each '3' object is shrunk to a single '2' located one cell down and one cell right from the original top-left corner.

**Input 1:**

- Several '3' objects are identified.
- Each '3' object is shrunk to a single '2' using the same logic as in Input 0.


## Program to be generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def shrink_objects_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects, univalued, no diagonals, without background
  bg = mostcolor(I)           # Identify the background color
  shrunk_objs = mapply(lambda obj: {(2, add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1)))}, objs)  # Shrink objects and recolor to 2
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), shrunk_objs)  # Paint shrunk objects on a blank canvas
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `objects(I, T, F, T)`: Extracts objects from the input grid `I`. The parameters specify that objects are univalued (all cells have the same value), connected without diagonals, and the background color should be excluded.
2.  `bg = mostcolor(I)`:  Identifies the background color of the input grid.
3.  `shrunk_objs = mapply(lambda obj: {(2, add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1)))}, objs)`: This line performs the shrinking and recoloring. 
    - `lambda obj: {(2, add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1)))}`: Defines an anonymous function that takes an object as input and returns a set containing a single tuple. The tuple represents the shrunk object: `(2, add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1)))`
        - `2`: The new color of the shrunk object.
        - `add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1))`: Calculates the new location of the shrunk object by adding (1, 1) to the upper-left corner of the original object.
    - `mapply`: Applies the anonymous function to each object in the `objs` set.
4. `return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), shrunk_objs)`: Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid filled with the background color (`bg`). Then, it paints the shrunk objects (`shrunk_objs`) onto this canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def shrink_objects_v2(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    shrunk_objects = frozenset()
    for i in range(1, height(I)):
        for j in range(1, width(I)):
            if index(I, (i-1, j-1)) != bg:
                shrunk_objects = shrunk_objects | {(2, (i,j))}
    return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), shrunk_objects)
```

**Explanation:**

1. `bg = mostcolor(I)`:  Identifies the background color of the input grid.
2. Two for loops iterate through the grid, offset by one to check the previous row and column.
3. `if index(I, (i-1, j-1)) != bg`: If the cell in the previous row and column is not background, it means an object was present there.
4. `shrunk_objects = shrunk_objects | {(2, (i,j))}`: A new cell with color 2 is added at the current position (i, j) to represent the shrunk object.
5. `return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), shrunk_objects)`: Creates a blank canvas and paints the shrunk objects similar to Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def shrink_objects_v3(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), 
                 mapply(lambda obj: {(2, add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1)))} if size(obj) > 1 else {(2, ulcorner(obj))}, 
                        objects(I, T, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version is a more concise version of Version 1. 
- It directly uses `mapply` with a lambda function to shrink and recolor objects. 
- The `if size(obj) > 1` condition ensures that single-cell objects are not shifted.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def shrink_objects_v4(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            2 if any(index(I, (i - 1, j - 1)) != bg for (i, j) in neighbors((k, l))) else bg
            for l in range(width(I))
        )
        for k in range(height(I))
    )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a nested generator expression to iterate through the grid and check for object presence in the neighborhood of each cell.

- `any(index(I, (i - 1, j - 1)) != bg for (i, j) in neighbors((k, l)))`: This part checks if any neighboring cell in the previous row and column was not background, indicating an object presence.
- `2 if ... else bg`: If an object was present, the current cell is set to 2, otherwise it retains the background color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def shrink_objects_v5(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    new_grid = canvas(bg, shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(2, add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1)))})
    return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through the identified objects and paints each shrunk object individually onto a new grid.

- `new_grid = canvas(bg, shape(I))`: A new grid is created filled with the background color.
- `for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)`: Iterates through each identified object.
- `new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(2, add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1)))})`:  Paints the shrunk object (recolored to 2) at the calculated position.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL. Each version utilizes different functions and logic, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
