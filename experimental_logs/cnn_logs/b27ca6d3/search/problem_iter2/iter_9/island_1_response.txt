## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**  The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) and drawing a "2" at their upper-left and lower-right corners.  The original object is also recolored to "2".

**Input_1 to Output_1:** This transformation is similar to the first but adds an extra step: Before corner marking, the object is shifted one unit to the right. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct code versions achieving the desired transformations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    ul = ulcorner(obj)
    lr = lrcorner(obj)
    O = paint(O, {(2, ul), (2, lr)})  
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(toindices(obj), (0,1)))) # Shift right by 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Program_A, this version identifies objects in the input grid (`I`) using `objects(I, False, False, True)`.
2. **Create Canvas:**  A blank canvas (`O`) of the same size as the input is created.
3. **Iterate and Transform:** The code iterates through each object (`obj`):
   - **Corner Marking:**  The upper-left (`ul`) and lower-right (`lr`) corners are determined, and a "2" is painted at these locations on the canvas.
   - **Recoloring and Shifting:** The object is recolored to "2" using `recolor(2, toindices(obj))` and then shifted one unit to the right using `shift(toindices(obj), (0,1))` before being painted onto the canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != 0:
        if i == 0 or i == len(I) - 1 or j == 0 or j == len(row) - 1 or \
           (i > 0 and I[i-1][j] == 0) or (i < len(I) - 1 and I[i+1][j] == 0) or \
           (j > 0 and I[i][j-1] == 0) or (j < len(row) - 1 and I[i][j+1] == 0):
          O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j)), (2, (i, j+1))})  # Mark corners (shifted right)
          O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j+1)) for i, j in ofcolor(I, val)})  # Recolor and shift
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:**  A canvas (`O`) is initialized with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Check:** The code iterates through each cell in the input grid. If a cell is not background (value 0):
   - **Border/Neighbor Check:** It checks if the cell is on the grid border or has a background neighbor. If true, it marks the cell and the cell to its right with "2".
   - **Recolor and Shift:** It then recolors all cells of the same value as the current cell to "2" and shifts them one unit right. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), {(2, ulcorner(obj)) for obj in objs} | 
                               {(2, (lrcorner(obj)[0], lrcorner(obj)[1]+1)) for obj in objs}) # Corners, shifted
  return paint(O, merge({recolor(2, shift(toindices(obj), (0, 1))) for obj in objs}))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a more functional approach:

1. **Object and Canvas:** Like before, it identifies objects and creates a blank canvas.
2. **Corner Painting:**  It directly paints all upper-left corners of objects onto the canvas using set comprehension. The lower-right corners are also painted, but shifted one unit right.
3. **Recoloring, Shifting, and Merging:** It then uses a set comprehension to recolor each object, shift it to the right, and merges all the shifted objects using `merge` before painting them onto the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for val in palette(I) - {0}:  # For each non-background color
    obj_indices = ofcolor(I, val)
    O = paint(O, {(2, ul) for ul in {ulcorner(obj_indices)}})
    O = paint(O, {(2, (lr[0], lr[1] + 1)) for lr in {lrcorner(obj_indices)}})  # Shifted corner
    O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j + 1)) for i, j in obj_indices}) # Shift and recolor
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Modification:** This version modifies the input grid (`I`) directly to produce the output (`O`). 
2. **Iterate by Color:** It iterates through each unique color (`val`) in the input (excluding background color 0).
3. **Find, Mark, Shift, Recolor:** For each color:
   - It finds the indices of all cells with that color (`obj_indices`).
   - It marks the upper-left corner and the shifted lower-right corner of the color region with "2".
   - Finally, it recolors all cells of that color to "2" and shifts them one unit to the right.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(2 if (i == 0 or i == len(I) - 1 or j == 0 or j == len(row) - 1 or \
                            (i > 0 and I[i-1][j] == 0) or (i < len(I) - 1 and I[i+1][j] == 0) or \
                            (j > 0 and I[i][j-1] == 0) or (j < len(row) - 1 and I[i][j+1] == 0) or \
                            I[i][j] != 0) else 0 \
                     for j in range(len(row))) for i, row in enumerate(I))
```

**Explanation:**

This version aims for a highly compact solution using nested list comprehensions:

1. **Single Expression:** The entire transformation is performed within a single expression.
2. **Iterate and Check:** It iterates through each cell and uses a conditional expression (`2 if ... else 0`) to determine the output color.
3. **Combined Logic:** The condition checks for both the corner/border conditions (similar to Program_B) and the presence of a non-background color to combine corner marking and shifting/recoloring in one step. 

These five programs demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, using various DSL functions and programming paradigms. They showcase the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
