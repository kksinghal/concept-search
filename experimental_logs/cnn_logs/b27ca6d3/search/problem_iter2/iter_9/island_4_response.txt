## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves shrinking objects by one cell in each dimension and shifting them one cell down and to the right. The shrinking process preserves the object's original color, but only the upper-left corner cell is kept after shrinking.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- Each connected component of '3's is treated as an object.
- Every object shrinks to a single '2' representing its top-left corner.
- The resulting '2' is then shifted one cell down and one cell to the right.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The same shrinking and shifting logic applies.
- Notice how object edges that touch the grid boundary result in the shrunk cell being placed one cell away from the boundary in both directions.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1: Using `ulcorner` and `shift`**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects
  shrunk_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift({(color(obj), ulcorner(toindices(obj)))}, (1, 1)), objs)  # Shrink and shift
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), shrunk_objs)  # Paint on blank canvas
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all connected components of non-background colors as individual objects.
2. **Shrink and Shift:** For each `obj`, we:
    - Find the `ulcorner` (upper-left corner) of its `toindices`.
    - Create a new object containing only the corner cell with the original `color`.
    - Shift this new object one cell down and to the right using `shift( , (1, 1))`.
3. **Paint on Canvas:**
    - Create a blank canvas of the same `shape` as the input, filled with the `mostcolor` (background color).
    - `paint` the shrunk and shifted objects onto this canvas.

**Version 2: Iterating through indices**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  shrunk_indices = set()
  for i in range(h - 1):
    for j in range(w - 1):
      if I[i][j] != bg:
        shrunk_indices.add((I[i][j], (i + 1, j + 1)))
  return paint(canvas(bg, (h, w)), frozenset(shrunk_indices))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate and Shrink:** Loop through each cell except the last row and column. 
   - If the cell is not the background color, add its color and the shifted index to `shrunk_indices`.
2. **Paint:** Similar to Version 1, create a blank canvas and paint the shrunk objects.

**Version 3: Utilizing `crop` and `shift`**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  shrunk_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    corner = ulcorner(toindices(obj))
    shrunk_obj = shift(crop(I, corner, (1, 1)), (1, 1))
    shrunk_objs.add((color(obj), (0, 0)))
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), frozenset(shrunk_objs))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Crop and Shift:**
   - For each object, `crop` a 1x1 grid at its upper-left corner.
   - Shift this cropped grid using `shift`.
2. **Recolor and Paint:**
   - Recolor the shifted 1x1 grid with the original object color.
   - Paint all shifted and recolored grids onto a blank canvas.

**Version 4: Combining `ulcorner` and `fill`**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  output = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    i, j = add(ulcorner(toindices(obj)), (1, 1))
    output = fill(output, color(obj), {(i, j)})
  return output
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate and Fill:**
   - For each object, calculate the shifted coordinates of its upper-left corner.
   - Fill a single cell on the output grid with the object's color at the calculated location.

**Version 5: Leveraging `rapply` and set comprehension**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  shifted_corners = rapply(lambda obj: {add(ulcorner(toindices(obj)), (1, 1))}, objs)
  shrunk_objs = {(color(obj), corner) for obj, corners in zip(objs, shifted_corners) for corner in corners}
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), frozenset(shrunk_objs))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Shifted Corners:** Calculate the shifted coordinates of each object's upper-left corner using `rapply`.
2. **Set Comprehension:** Create a set `shrunk_objs` containing tuples of (object color, shifted corner) using a set comprehension.
3. **Paint:** Similar to previous versions, paint these shrunk objects onto a blank canvas.

These five versions utilize different DSL functions and logic to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL and offering diverse solutions.
