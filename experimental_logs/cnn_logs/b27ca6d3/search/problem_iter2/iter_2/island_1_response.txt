## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects in the input grid and drawing a border around them using the color '2'.  Here's a breakdown:

**Common Logic:**

1. **Object Identification:** The program first identifies all distinct objects (connected components of the same color) in the input grid, excluding the background color (most common).
2. **Border Drawing:** For each object, it draws a border using color '2'. The border encompasses the object, including any internal holes.
3. **Corner Highlighting:** Additionally, the bottom-left and top-right corners of each object's border are also highlighted with color '2'.

**Example Breakdown:**

- **Input_0:**  The input has several scattered '3's forming distinct objects. The output draws a '2' border around each of these objects, highlighting the specified corners.
- **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the '3's form objects that are outlined with a '2' border, and the corresponding corners are marked.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, each with a different approach:

**Program Version 1:** (Inspired by iterating over object boundaries)

```python
def gajbcdedhfcaeaaeiacichfaefcebbei(I):
    def paint_edge(O, obj, start, end, direction, color):
        if start == end:
            return O
        if index(O, start) != color:
            O = paint(O, {(color, start)})
        return paint_edge(O, obj, add(start, direction), end, direction, color)
    
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {llcorner(obj), urcorner(obj)}))
        O = paint_edge(O, obj, (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj) + 1), (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj)), RIGHT, 2)
        O = paint_edge(O, obj, (lowermost(obj), leftmost(obj) + 1), (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj)), RIGHT, 2)
        O = paint_edge(O, obj, (uppermost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj)), (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj)), DOWN, 2)
    return O

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`paint_edge` Function:** This recursive function paints a line of a specified `color` from `start` to `end` along a given `direction` on the grid `O`. It ensures that only empty cells or cells already of the target `color` are painted. 
2. **Object Iteration:** It iterates through each identified object.
3. **Corner Painting:** Paints the bottom-left and top-right corners of the object's bounding box with color '2'.
4. **Edge Painting:**  Calls `paint_edge` three times to draw the top, bottom, and right edges of the object's bounding box.

**Program Version 2:** (Inspired by using bounding boxes)

```python
def gajbcdedhfcaeaaeiacichfaefcebbei(I):
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {llcorner(obj), urcorner(obj)}))
        for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
            for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1):
                if i == uppermost(obj) or i == lowermost(obj) or j == leftmost(obj) or j == rightmost(obj):
                    if index(O, (i,j)) != 2:
                        O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each identified object.
2. **Corner Painting:** Paints the bottom-left and top-right corners of the object's bounding box with color '2'.
3. **Boundary Iteration:**  Iterates through all cells within the object's bounding box and paints those on the edge with '2', excluding the already painted corners.

**Program Version 3:** (Inspired by set operations on bounding boxes)

```python
def gajbcdedhfcaeaaeiacichfaefcebbei(I):
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        bbox = box(obj)
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, bbox | {llcorner(obj), urcorner(obj)}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(mostcolor(I), bbox - toindices(obj)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each identified object.
2. **Bounding Box and Corners:** Calculates the bounding box (`bbox`) of the object and paints it with color '2'. It also paints the specified corners.
3. **Internal Clearing:**  Paints the cells within the bounding box but not part of the object with the background color.

**Program Version 4:** (Inspired by shifting and combining object outlines)

```python
def gajbcdedhfcaeaaeiacichfaefcebbei(I):
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        outline = box(obj)
        shifted_outline = shift(outline, (1, 0)) & asindices(I)
        combined_outline = outline | shifted_outline | {llcorner(obj), urcorner(obj)}
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, combined_outline))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each identified object.
2. **Outline Generation:**  Calculates the outline (`outline`) of the object using the `box` function.
3. **Outline Shifting:** Shifts the `outline` down by one unit to create `shifted_outline`, ensuring it stays within the grid boundaries.
4. **Outline Combining:** Combines the original and shifted outlines, along with the specified corners, to create `combined_outline`.
5. **Painting:** Paints the `combined_outline` with color '2'.

**Program Version 5:** (Inspired by drawing lines for each edge)

```python
def gajbcdedhfcaeaaeiacichfaefcebbei(I):
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        top_left = ulcorner(obj)
        top_right = urcorner(obj)
        bottom_left = llcorner(obj)
        bottom_right = lrcorner(obj)
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, {bottom_left, top_right}))
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, connect(top_left, top_right)))
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, connect(top_right, bottom_right)))
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, connect(bottom_right, bottom_left)))
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, connect(bottom_left, top_left)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each identified object.
2. **Corner Identification:** Identifies all four corners of the object's bounding box.
3. **Corner Painting:** Paints the bottom-left and top-right corners with color '2'.
4. **Edge Drawing:**  Uses the `connect` function to draw lines between consecutive corners, effectively drawing the border of the object. 

These five versions represent distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation, each leveraging different DSL functions and logic.
