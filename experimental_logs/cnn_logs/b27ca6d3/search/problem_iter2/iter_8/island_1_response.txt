## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by connected '3's (excluding diagonal connections). Each object is then transformed as follows:
* The cell at the upper-left corner of the object's bounding box is colored '2'.
* The cell at the lower-right corner of the object's bounding box is colored '2'.
* All other cells within the bounding box, but not part of the object itself, are removed (set to '0').

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

This transformation again focuses on objects formed by connected '3's (excluding diagonal connections). Each object undergoes the following changes:
* For each cell in the object, a new cell of the same color ('3') is created one step closer to the center of the object. 
* If a cell is already at the center (horizontally or vertically), it remains in place.
* If multiple cells are shifted to the same location, they overlap and only one '3' remains.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions for the "Program_to_be_generated":

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    ul = ulcorner(obj)
    lr = lrcorner(obj)
    O = paint(O, {(2, ul), (2, lr)})
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, toindices(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objs = objects(I, False, False, True)` identifies objects formed by connected non-background values in the input grid `I`.
2. **Initialize Output:** `O = canvas(0, shape(I))` creates an empty canvas `O` with the same dimensions as the input.
3. **Iterate and Transform:** The code iterates through each identified object (`obj` in `objs`):
    * `ul = ulcorner(obj)` and `lr = lrcorner(obj)` get the coordinates of the upper-left and lower-right corners of the object's bounding box.
    * `O = paint(O, {(2, ul), (2, lr)})` paints '2' at the corner positions on the output canvas.
    * `O = paint(O, recolor(2, toindices(obj)))` paints the object itself (with color '2') onto the output canvas. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, {ulcorner(obj), lrcorner(obj)}))
    O = underfill(O, 0, box(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Iterate and Transform:**
   * `O = paint(O, recolor(2, {ulcorner(obj), lrcorner(obj)}))` directly colors the corner cells of the object's bounding box to '2' on the input grid.
   * `O = underfill(O, 0, box(obj))` fills all background cells ('0's) within the object's bounding box with '0', effectively removing non-object cells.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
      for j, val in enumerate(row):
          if val == 3:
              ul = ulcorner(extract(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda obj: (i,j) in toindices(obj)))
              lr = lrcorner(extract(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda obj: (i,j) in toindices(obj)))
              O = paint(O, {(2, ul), (2, lr), (2, (i,j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** An empty canvas is created.
2. **Iterate Through Cells:** The program iterates through every cell in the input grid.
3. **Process '3' Cells:** If a cell has value '3':
   * It identifies the object to which the cell belongs.
   * It gets the upper-left and lower-right corners of that object's bounding box.
   * It paints '2' at the corners and the current cell's location on the output canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      O = paint(O, {(2, (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj))), (2, (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj))), (2, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Iterate and Paint:**  The program iterates through each object and its individual cells:
   * For each cell in the object, it colors the upper-left, lower-right, and the cell itself to '2' on the output grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
      for j, val in enumerate(row):
          if val == 3:
            O = paint(O, {(2, ulcorner(extract(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda obj: (i,j) in toindices(obj))))})
            O = paint(O, {(2, lrcorner(extract(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda obj: (i,j) in toindices(obj))))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Identify:** The program iterates over each cell of the input grid.
2. **Process '3' Cells:** For cells containing '3', it:
    * Extracts the object to which the cell belongs.
    * Finds the upper-left and lower-right corners of the object.
    * Colors these corners to '2' on the output grid.

These five program versions demonstrate a variety of approaches to achieve the desired transformation, using different combinations of DSL functions and logic. Each version accomplishes the same result while showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
