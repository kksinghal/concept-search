## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place involves identifying horizontal stretches of the digit '0' adjacent to the digit '2'. These stretches of '0' are then replaced with the digit '3'. The transformation can be summarized as "fill horizontal stretches of '0' bordered by '2' with the digit '3'".

**Input_0:**

- Several horizontal stretches of '0' are present.
- Only those stretches adjacent to a '2' are targeted.
- Notice how isolated '2's or '2's touching only diagonally don't trigger the fill.

**Input_1:**

- This input showcases the importance of horizontal adjacency.
- Even though some '0's are close to a '2' diagonally, they are not filled.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1: Two-Pass Approach**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(grid):
  # First pass: Mark cells right of a '2' with a temporary value ('4')
  marked_grid = tuple(
    tuple(4 if j > 0 and row[j-1] == 2 and val == 0 else val for j, val in enumerate(row))
    for row in grid
  )

  # Second pass: Replace '4's adjacent to a '2' on the left with '3'
  return tuple(
    tuple(3 if (j > 0 and row[j-1] == 2) or (j < len(row)-1 and row[j+1] == 2) and val == 4 else val for j, val in enumerate(row))
    for row in marked_grid
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Marking:** This version iterates through the grid, marking cells to the right of a '2' with a temporary value '4'. This ensures that only '0's directly following a '2' are considered in the next pass.
2. **Filling:** The second pass iterates again, replacing marked cells ('4') that are either preceded or followed by a '2' with '3'.

**Version 2: Single-Pass with Lookahead**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
        3 if val == 0 and (
            (j > 0 and row[j-1] == 2) or
            (j < len(row) - 1 and row[j+1] == 2 and all(v == 0 for v in row[j+1:min(len(row), j+2)]))
        )
        else val
        for j, val in enumerate(row)
    ) for row in grid
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Single Iteration:** This version processes the grid in a single pass.
2. **Lookahead:** For each '0', it checks if it's adjacent to a '2' on either side. If a '2' is found on the right, it also verifies that the following cells (until the next '2' or the end of the row) are all '0's to ensure it's a continuous stretch.

**Version 3: Object-Based Approach**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(grid):
  objects = objects(grid, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  twos = colorfilter(objects, 2)
  for two in twos:
    for i, j in toindices(two):
      for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1)]:
        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
        if 0 <= ni < height(grid) and 0 <= nj < width(grid) and grid[ni][nj] == 0:
          grid = fill(grid, 3, shoot((ni, nj), (di, dj)))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:**  It identifies all objects (connected components) within the grid.
2. **'2' Filtering:** It isolates objects consisting only of the digit '2'.
3. **Neighbor Check & Fill:** For each cell within a '2' object, it examines its left and right neighbors. If a '0' is found, it fills a horizontal line starting from that neighbor using `shoot` function to ensure continuous filling.

**Version 4: Modified Program_B**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          3 if (0 < y < w - 1 and (I[i][y - 1] == 2 or I[i][y + 1] == 2) and x == 0)
          else x
          for y, x in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

 This version adapts Program_B to achieve the desired outcome. It checks for '0's adjacent to '2's on either side within the same row and fills them with '3'.

**Version 5: Functional Approach with `papply`**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def fill_condition(left, current, right):
    return 3 if current == 0 and (left == 2 or right == 2) else current

  return tuple(
    tuple(papply(fill_condition, (2, *row), (*row, 2), circular=False))
    for row in grid
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`papply` for Parallel Application:** This version utilizes the `papply` function to apply a `fill_condition` function to each cell and its neighbors simultaneously. 
2. **`fill_condition` Logic:**  This function checks if the current cell is '0' and if either of its neighbors is '2'. If both conditions are met, it returns '3'; otherwise, it returns the original cell value.
3. **Padding for Edge Cases:**  The `(2, *row)` and `(*row, 2)` constructs pad each row with '2's at the beginning and end, handling edge cases seamlessly.


These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation in the given DSL, each offering varying levels of complexity and readability.
