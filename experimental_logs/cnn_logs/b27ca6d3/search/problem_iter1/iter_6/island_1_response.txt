## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to connect individual non-background pixels horizontally with a line of '3's, effectively extending them to the left and right until they hit another non-background pixel or the edge of the grid.

**Input_0:**

* Each isolated '2' is extended horizontally with a line of '3's.
* Notice how the extension stops when it encounters another '2' or reaches the boundary.

**Input_1:**

* The same logic applies. Isolated '2's are extended with '3's.
* Existing connected components of '2's are unaffected. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:** (Inspired by Program A's direct replacement and Program B's individual cell checks)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  # Initialize with background
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I): 
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))}) # Paint the non-background cell
        # Extend left
        left = j - 1
        while left >= 0 and I[i][left] == mostcommon(I):
          O = paint(O, {(3, (i, left))}) # Paint with 3
          left -= 1
        # Extend right
        right = j + 1
        while right < len(I[0]) and I[i][right] == mostcommon(I):
          O = paint(O, {(3, (i, right))}) # Paint with 3
          right += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** A canvas filled with the background color is created.
2. **Iteration:** The code iterates through each cell of the input grid.
3. **Non-background Pixel:** When a non-background pixel is found:
   - It is directly painted onto the output grid.
   - Two loops (left and right) start extending from the current cell's position.
4. **Extension:** These loops continue as long as they are within the grid boundaries and encounter only background pixels. In each iteration, a '3' is painted on the output grid.
5. **Termination:** The loops stop when they hit a non-background pixel or the edge of the grid.

**Version 2:** (Inspired by Program A's row-wise iteration and Program B's conditional filling)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Start with a canvas of background color
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    start = None
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != mostcommon(I) and start is None: # Start of a segment
        start = j
      elif val != mostcommon(I) and start is not None: # End of a segment
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, frozenset((i, k) for k in range(start, j))))
        start = j
      elif val == mostcommon(I) and start is not None: # Inside a segment
        O = paint(O, {(3, (i, j))})
    if start is not None: # Handle the last segment
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, frozenset((i, k) for k in range(start, len(row)))))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates a canvas filled with the background color.
2. **Row Iteration:**  Iterates through each row of the input grid.
3. **Segment Tracking:**  Uses `start` variable to keep track of the beginning of a non-background segment.
4. **Segment Handling:**
   -  If a non-background pixel is found and `start` is `None`, it marks the beginning of a segment.
   - If a non-background pixel is found and `start` has a value, it means the previous segment ended, and it fills the segment with '3's. 
   - If a background pixel is encountered within a segment (`start` is not `None`), it fills the cell with '3'. 
5. **Last Segment:** After each row, checks if a segment is still open and fills it.

**Version 3:** (Inspired by Program B's use of `fill` and object detection)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Start with background
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    O = paint(O, obj) # Paint the object
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj): 
      left_fill = frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j - 1, -1, -1) if I[i][k] == mostcommon(I))
      right_fill = frozenset((i, k) for k in range(j + 1, len(I[0])) if I[i][k] == mostcommon(I))
      O = fill(O, 3, left_fill) # Fill left
      O = fill(O, 3, right_fill) # Fill right
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates a canvas filled with the background color.
2. **Object Detection:** Identifies objects (connected components of non-background pixels) in the input grid.
3. **Object Painting:**  Paints each object directly onto the output grid. 
4. **Horizontal Extension:** For each cell in the object:
   - Identifies the indices to the left and right that are background and need to be filled with '3'.
   - Uses the `fill` function to efficiently paint '3's in these regions. 


**Version 4:** (Inspired by Program B's individual checks and using `hfrontier`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Start with background
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != mostcommon(I):
        O = paint(O, {(val, (i, j))})
        hfrontier_indices = hfrontier((i, j))
        to_fill = sfilter(hfrontier_indices, lambda x: 0 <= x[1] < len(I[0]) and I[x[0]][x[1]] == mostcommon(I))
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, to_fill)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates a canvas filled with the background color.
2. **Iteration:**  Iterates through each cell of the input.
3. **Non-Background Pixel Handling:** When a non-background pixel is found:
   - The pixel is painted onto the output grid.
   -  `hfrontier`  is used to get indices along the row.
   - `sfilter` keeps only the indices within grid boundaries and containing the background color.
   - The filtered indices are then recolored to '3' and painted onto the output.


**Version 5:**  (Inspired by Program A's row-wise iteration and using sets for extension)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Start with background
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    to_fill = set()
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != mostcommon(I):
        O = paint(O, {(val, (i, j))}) 
        to_fill |= set((i, k) for k in range(j - 1, -1, -1) if k >= 0 and I[i][k] == mostcommon(I))
        to_fill |= set((i, k) for k in range(j + 1, len(row)) if k < len(row) and I[i][k] == mostcommon(I))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, frozenset(to_fill)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Creates a canvas filled with the background color.
2. **Iteration:** Iterates through each row of the input.
3. **Extension Tracking:** Uses a set `to_fill` to keep track of indices to fill with '3'.
4. **Non-Background Pixels:** For each non-background pixel:
   - It's painted to the output.
   - Indices to its left and right containing the background color are added to `to_fill`.
5. **Filling:** After processing each row, all indices in `to_fill` are recolored to '3' and painted onto the output.
