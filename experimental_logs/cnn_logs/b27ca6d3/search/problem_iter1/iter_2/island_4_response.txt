## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions) of the digit '2' and drawing a horizontal line with the digit '3' extending left and right from these objects until they hit a non-zero digit or the edge of the grid.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The '2' digits on rows 3, 4, 9, 12, and 14 each have horizontal lines of '3's drawn outwards from them. The lines stop when encountering other '2's or the grid boundary.
* **Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0, horizontal lines of '3's are drawn from the '2' objects, stopping at other non-zero digits or the grid edges.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def hline_extension(grid, i, j):
    line = set()
    for k in range(j, -1, -1): # Extend left
      if index(grid, (i, k)) != 0:
        break
      line.add((i, k))
    for k in range(j + 1, len(grid[0])): # Extend right
      if index(grid, (i, k)) != 0:
        break
      line.add((i, k))
    return line
  filled_grid = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 2:
        filled_grid = fill(filled_grid, 3, hline_extension(I, i, j))
  return filled_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`hline_extension` function:** 
    * Takes the grid, row index `i`, and column index `j` of a '2' digit as input.
    * Extends a line to the left and right from the given `(i, j)` location until it encounters a non-zero digit or the grid edge.
    * Returns the set of indices for this line.
2. **Main loop:**
    * Iterates through each cell in the grid.
    * If the cell value is '2':
        * Calls `hline_extension` to get the line indices.
        * Uses `fill` to change the values at those indices to '3' in the `filled_grid`.
3. **Returns:** The modified `filled_grid`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def hline_from_object(obj):
    i = uppermost(obj)
    return {(i, j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1) if index(I, (i, j)) == 0}
  return fill(I, 3, merge({hline_from_object(obj) for obj in objects(I, True, False, False) if color(obj) == 2}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`hline_from_object` function:**
    * Takes an object (a set of connected '2' cells) as input.
    * Determines the uppermost row index `i` of the object.
    * Generates a set of indices for a horizontal line spanning the object's width on row `i`, but only including cells with a '0' value in the original grid.
2. **Main expression:**
    * Uses `objects` to extract all connected regions of '2's in the grid.
    * For each '2' object:
        * Calls `hline_from_object` to get the line indices.
    * Uses `merge` to combine the line indices from all objects.
    * Finally, uses `fill` to change the values at the merged indices to '3' in the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_line(grid, i, j, direction):
    line = set()
    current_j = j
    while 0 <= current_j < len(grid[0]) and grid[i][current_j] == 0:
      line.add((i, current_j))
      current_j += direction
    return line
  filled_grid = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 2:
        filled_grid = fill(filled_grid, 3, extend_line(I, i, j, -1)) # Extend left
        filled_grid = fill(filled_grid, 3, extend_line(I, i, j, 1))  # Extend right
  return filled_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_line` function:**
    * Takes the grid, row index `i`, column index `j`, and a direction (`-1` for left, `1` for right) as input.
    * Extends a line from `(i, j)` in the given direction until hitting a non-zero digit or the edge.
    * Returns the indices of the extended line.
2. **Main loop:**
    * Iterates over each cell in the grid.
    * If the cell value is '2':
        * Calls `extend_line` twice, once for each direction, to get the left and right extensions.
        * Uses `fill` to update the grid with '3's at the extended line indices.
3. **Returns:** The modified grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def hline_segment(grid, i, j):
    left_j = j 
    while left_j >= 0 and grid[i][left_j] == 0:
      left_j -= 1
    right_j = j
    while right_j < len(grid[0]) and grid[i][right_j] == 0:
      right_j += 1
    return {(i, k) for k in range(left_j + 1, right_j)}
  return fill(I, 3, merge({hline_segment(I, i, j) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, val in enumerate(row) if val == 2}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`hline_segment` function:**
    * Takes the grid, row `i`, and column `j` of a '2' cell.
    * Finds the leftmost and rightmost non-zero cells (or edges) on that row.
    * Generates the indices for the horizontal line segment between those boundaries.
2. **Main expression:**
    * Iterates over each cell, finding '2's.
    * For each '2', calls `hline_segment` to get the line indices.
    * Merges all the line indices.
    * Uses `fill` to modify the grid with '3's at the merged indices.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def fill_horizontal(grid, i, j):
    if j < 0 or j >= len(grid[0]) or grid[i][j] != 0:
      return
    grid[i][j] = 3
    fill_horizontal(grid, i, j - 1)
    fill_horizontal(grid, i, j + 1)

  grid_list = [list(row) for row in I]  # Convert to list of lists for modification
  for i, row in enumerate(grid_list):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 2:
        fill_horizontal(grid_list, i, j)
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in grid_list)  # Convert back to tuple of tuples
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_horizontal` function:**
    * Recursive function to fill horizontally.
    * Base case: Stop if out of bounds or current cell is not '0'.
    * Otherwise, set the current cell to '3' and recursively call itself for left and right neighbors.
2. **Main loop:**
    * Convert the input grid to a list of lists to allow in-place modification.
    * Iterate over each cell. If a '2' is found, initiate `fill_horizontal` from that cell.
3. **Return:** Convert the modified list of lists back to a tuple of tuples (grid format).


These are just five examples. Many other valid and distinct solutions are possible using the provided DSL.
