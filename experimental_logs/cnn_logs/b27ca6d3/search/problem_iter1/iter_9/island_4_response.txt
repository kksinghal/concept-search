## Transformation Analysis:

The task involves identifying and filling "gaps" between occurrences of the digit '2' under certain conditions. 

**General Logic:**

1. **Identify Target Cells:** The program aims to fill cells with the digit '3' if they are:
    * Currently empty (contain the digit '0').
    * Horizontally adjacent (left or right) to the digit '2'.
    * Not vertically connected to other non-zero cells.

2. **Horizontal Connection:**  The presence of '2' on either side of an empty cell triggers the fill. It doesn't matter if the '2's are part of the same object or different ones.

3. **Vertical Isolation:** The target empty cell should not have any non-zero values directly above or below it. This ensures that only "gaps" or "bridges" between '2's are filled.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** Notice how '3's form bridges between horizontally adjacent '2's. For instance, in row 2, a '3' bridge connects the two '2's.  Crucially, no '3's are placed below the solitary '2' in row 4, as it would be vertically connected to another '2'.

* **Input_1:** The logic is consistent. A '3' bridge spans the '2's in row 1. Similarly, in row 5, a '3' connects the '2's, but only the empty cell directly next to them is filled, respecting the vertical isolation rule.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions in the provided DSL to achieve the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = height(grid), width(grid)
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      3 if (
        grid[i][j] == 0 and 
        (j > 0 and grid[i][j - 1] == 2 or j < w - 1 and grid[i][j + 1] == 2) and 
        (i == 0 or grid[i - 1][j] == 0) and 
        (i == h - 1 or grid[i + 1][j] == 0)
      ) else grid[i][j] 
      for j in range(w)
    ) for i in range(h)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:**  Iterates through each cell in the grid using nested loops.
2. **Check Conditions:** For every cell, it verifies if all conditions are met:
    * **Empty Cell:** `grid[i][j] == 0`
    * **Horizontal '2':**  `(j > 0 and grid[i][j - 1] == 2 or j < w - 1 and grid[i][j + 1] == 2)`
    * **Vertical Isolation:**  `(i == 0 or grid[i - 1][j] == 0) and (i == h - 1 or grid[i + 1][j] == 0)`
3. **Fill or Retain:** If all conditions are true, it fills the cell with '3'; otherwise, it retains the original value.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def fill_condition(left, current, right, above, below):
    return 3 if current == 0 and (left == 2 or right == 2) and above == 0 and below == 0 else current
  padded_grid = ((0,) * (width(grid) + 2),) + tuple((0,) + row + (0,) for row in grid) + ((0,) * (width(grid) + 2),)
  return tuple(
    tuple(fill_condition(padded_grid[i][j - 1], padded_grid[i][j], padded_grid[i][j + 1], padded_grid[i - 1][j], padded_grid[i + 1][j]) for j in range(1, width(grid) + 1))
    for i in range(1, height(grid) + 1)
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Padding:** Creates a padded grid to avoid boundary checks.
2. **`fill_condition` Function:** Defines a function to encapsulate the filling logic based on the current cell and its neighbors.
3. **Apply and Extract:** Applies the `fill_condition` function to the padded grid and then extracts the original grid portion.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def check_and_fill(i, j):
    h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    if 0 <= i < h and 0 <= j < w and grid[i][j] == 0:
      if (j > 0 and grid[i][j - 1] == 2) or (j < w - 1 and grid[i][j + 1] == 2):
        if (i == 0 or grid[i - 1][j] == 0) and (i == h - 1 or grid[i + 1][j] == 0):
          return 3
    return grid[i][j]
  return tuple(tuple(check_and_fill(i, j) for j in range(width(grid))) for i in range(height(grid)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`check_and_fill` Function:** A helper function that encapsulates the logic of checking the neighborhood of a cell and deciding whether to fill it.
2. **Apply to Each Cell:**  Iterates over the grid and applies the  `check_and_fill` function to each cell.

**Program Version 4:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = height(grid), width(grid)
  new_grid = [list(row) for row in grid] # Convert to list of lists for in-place modification
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if grid[i][j] == 0 and (j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] == 2 or j < w-1 and grid[i][j+1] == 2):
        if (i == 0 or grid[i-1][j] == 0) and (i == h-1 or grid[i+1][j] == 0):
          new_grid[i][j] = 3 
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid) # Convert back to tuple of tuples
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Modifiable Grid:**  Converts the input grid to a list of lists to allow for in-place modification.
2. **Iterate and Modify:**  Iterates through the grid, applying the transformation logic directly.
3. **Return Tuple:** Converts the modified grid back to a tuple of tuples.

**Program Version 5:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def fill_horizontal_gaps(row):
    new_row = list(row)
    for j in range(1, len(row) - 1):
      if row[j] == 0 and (row[j - 1] == 2 or row[j + 1] == 2):
        new_row[j] = 3
    return tuple(new_row)

  def apply_with_isolation(grid):
    h = height(grid)
    new_grid = [list(row) for row in grid]
    for i in range(h):
      new_grid[i] = list(fill_horizontal_gaps(grid[i]))
      if i > 0:
        for j in range(len(new_grid[i])):
          if new_grid[i][j] == 3 and new_grid[i - 1][j] != 0:
            new_grid[i][j] = 0
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
  return apply_with_isolation(grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fill_horizontal_gaps` Function:** Handles filling horizontal gaps between '2's within a row.
2. **`apply_with_isolation` Function:** Applies the horizontal gap filling and then ensures vertical isolation.
3. **Two-Step Process:** This version separates the logic into horizontal filling and then vertical isolation.

These five programs represent distinct approaches to the same task. They highlight the flexibility of DSLs and the potential for creative problem-solving.
