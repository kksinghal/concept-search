## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying non-background objects and drawing horizontal lines extending from the left and right edges of the object to the edges of the grid, but only within the object's bounding box. The lines are drawn using a specific color (3 in this case).

**Example Breakdown:**

Let's analyze Input_0, focusing on the '2' object at the top:

```
0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0
```

The output should be:

```
0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0
0 0 3 3 3 3 3 2 0
```

Notice how the line is drawn only within the horizontal span of the '2' object.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions that achieve the desired transformation:

### Program Version 1

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
    rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      O = fill(O, 3, {(i, k) for k in range(leftmost_j, rightmost_j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas `O` with the same dimensions as the input `I` and filled with the most common color in `I` (background).
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each non-background object `obj` in `I`.
3. **Object Painting:**  Paints the current `obj` onto the canvas `O`.
4. **Horizontal Line Drawing:**
    - Finds the leftmost (`leftmost_j`) and rightmost (`rightmost_j`) column indices of the object.
    - For each cell `(i, j)` in the object, draws a horizontal line from `(i, leftmost_j)` to `(i, rightmost_j)` using the color '3'.
5. **Return Output:** Returns the modified canvas `O`.

### Program Version 2

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    for (i, _) in toindices(obj):
      O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version directly modifies the input grid `I`.
- It iterates through objects and fills a horizontal line spanning the object's width for each row the object occupies.

### Program Version 3

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      O = fill(O, 3, connect((i, leftmost(obj)), (i, rightmost(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Similar to version 1, but uses `connect` function to draw the horizontal lines. 

### Program Version 4

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    min_j, max_j = leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj)
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      for j in range(len(I[0])):
        if min_j <= j <= max_j:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates through all grid cells within the object's bounding box and fills them with '3'.

### Program Version 5

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    box_indices = backdrop(obj)
    for i, j in box_indices:
      if uppermost(obj) <= i <= lowermost(obj):
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Uses `backdrop` to get indices within the object's bounding box and then fills the cells within the object's vertical span. 

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation, using different DSL functions and logic. Choose the one that best suits your needs or serves as a starting point for further customization.
