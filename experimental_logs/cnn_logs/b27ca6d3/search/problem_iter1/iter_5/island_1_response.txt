## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending non-background objects horizontally to connect with other non-background objects or the edge of the grid, filling the extended area with the value '3'.

**Input_0:**  Objects (value '2') are extended left and right with '3's until they hit another '2' or the edge of the grid. 

**Input_1:**  The same logic applies. Note how some extensions create bridges between objects, while others reach the grid edge. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1 (Iterative Approach):**

```python
def generate_output(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Start with a canvas of background color
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I): # Found a non-background cell
        O[i][j] = I[i][j] # Copy the cell to the output
        # Extend left
        left = j - 1
        while left >= 0 and I[i][left] == mostcommon(I):
          O[i][left] = 3
          left -= 1
        # Extend right
        right = j + 1
        while right < len(I[0]) and I[i][right] == mostcommon(I):
          O[i][right] = 3
          right += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create an output grid `O` filled with the background color using `canvas`.
2. **Iterate:** Loop through each cell of the input grid `I`.
3. **Non-background Check:** If a cell's value is not the background color, copy it to the output grid.
4. **Left Extension:** Extend the object to the left by filling with '3' until a non-background cell or the grid edge is encountered.
5. **Right Extension:** Similarly, extend the object to the right.

**Version 2 (Functional Approach with `sfilter` and `paint`):**

```python
def generate_output(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      left_extensions = sfilter(interval(-1, j, -1), lambda x: I[i][x] == mostcommon(I))
      right_extensions = sfilter(interval(j + 1, len(I[0])), lambda x: I[i][x] == mostcommon(I))
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, frozenset((i, x) for x in left_extensions)))
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, frozenset((i, x) for x in right_extensions)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterate through non-background objects using `objects`.
3. **Paint Object:** Paint the current object onto the output grid.
4. **Extension Logic:** For each cell in the object:
   - Use `sfilter` and `interval` to find valid left and right extension indices.
   - Use `recolor` to create sets of cells with value '3' for extensions.
   - Paint these extensions onto the output grid.

**Version 3 (Using `hfrontier` and Set Operations):**

```python
def generate_output(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      extension_area = hfrontier((i, j))
      valid_area = backdrop(obj) | toindices(obj)
      fill_area = extension_area - valid_area
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, fill_area))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterate through non-background objects.
3. **Paint Object:** Paint the object onto the output grid.
4. **Extension with Set Operations:**
   - Use `hfrontier` to get all indices on the same row as the current cell.
   - Define `valid_area` as the area already covered by the object or its bounding box.
   - Calculate `fill_area` by subtracting `valid_area` from `extension_area`.
   - Paint `fill_area` with '3' on the output grid.

**Version 4 (Combining `hsplit` and `hconcat`):**

```python
def generate_output(I):
  O = []
  for row in I:
    segments = hsplit(
        tuple(
            tuple(3 if c == mostcommon(I) and any(n != mostcommon(I) for n in segment) else c for c in segment) 
            for segment in hsplit((row,), len(row))
        ), 
        len(row)
    )
    O.append(tuple(c for segment in segments for c in segment))
  return tuple(O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty list `O` to store the output grid.
2. **Row-wise Processing:** Iterate through each row of the input grid.
3. **Split and Extend:**
   - Split the row into individual cells using `hsplit`.
   - For each cell (segment), if it's the background color and any cell in the row is not the background color, change its value to 3. Otherwise, keep the original value.
   - Concatenate the modified cells back into a row using `hconcat`.
4. **Append to Output:** Append the processed row to the `O` list.
5. **Return Output Grid:** Convert the `O` list into a tuple to represent the output grid.

**Version 5 (Leveraging `papply` for Parallel Processing):**

```python
def generate_output(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    indices = sorted(toindices(obj), key=lambda x: x[1])
    left_extensions = papply(
        lambda i, j: tuple(range(j - 1, -1, -1)) if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I) else tuple(), 
        tuple(i for i, j in indices), 
        tuple(j for i, j in indices)
    )
    right_extensions = papply(
        lambda i, j: tuple(range(j + 1, len(I[0]))) if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I) else tuple(),
        tuple(i for i, j in indices),
        tuple(j for i, j in indices)
    )
    for (i, j), left, right in zip(indices, left_extensions, right_extensions):
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, frozenset((i, x) for x in left)))
      O = paint(O, recolor(3, frozenset((i, x) for x in right)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterate through non-background objects.
3. **Paint Object:** Paint the object onto the output grid.
4. **Parallel Extension Calculation:**
   - Sort object indices by column using `sorted`.
   - Use `papply` to calculate left and right extensions for each object cell in parallel. If a cell is not background, generate a range of indices for extension; otherwise, an empty tuple.
5. **Paint Extensions:** Iterate through object cells, their corresponding left extensions, and right extensions, and paint them with '3' on the output grid.
