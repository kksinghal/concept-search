## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation involves identifying horizontal lines of the digit '2' and extending them to the left until they encounter another non-zero digit or reach the grid's edge. The extension is filled with the digit '3'. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:** This transformation is similar to the previous one. It extends horizontal lines of the digit '2' to the left until they encounter a non-zero digit or grid edge, filling the extension with the digit '3'. However, it also extends these lines to the right until encountering a non-zero digit or the grid edge.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" inspired by the provided examples and achieving the desired transformations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_line(i, j, direction):
    current_j = j + direction
    while 0 <= current_j < width(I) and index(I, (i, current_j)) == ZERO:
      I = fill(I, THREE, {(i, current_j)})
      current_j += direction
    return I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == TWO:
        I = extend_line(i, j, -1) # Extend left
        I = extend_line(i, j, 1) # Extend right
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **extend_line(i, j, direction):**  This helper function takes a starting position (i, j) and a direction (-1 for left, 1 for right). It iterates in the given direction, filling cells with '3' until it encounters a non-zero value or the grid edge. 
2. **Main Loop:** The program iterates through each cell. If it encounters a '2', it calls `extend_line` twice, once to extend left and once to extend right.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def hline_indices(i, j):
    return frozenset((i, k) for k in range(width(I)) if index(I, (i, k)) == TWO and k <= j)
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      THREE if any(k == j for i in range(height(I)) for k in toindices(hline_indices(i, j))) else v 
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **hline_indices(i, j):** This function returns indices of a horizontal line containing '2's up to the given column j.
2. **Main Loop:** The program utilizes nested comprehensions. It iterates through each cell and checks if it belongs to any horizontal line containing a '2' using `hline_indices`. If it does, the cell is filled with '3'; otherwise, the original value is kept.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def connected_twos(i, j):
    return {(i, k) for k in range(width(I)) if contained((TWO, (i, k)), asobject(I)) and abs(k - j) <= 1}
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      THREE if any(len(connected_twos(i, j)) > 1 for i in range(height(I))) else v
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    ) 
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **connected_twos(i, j):** This function identifies horizontally adjacent '2's around a given position (i, j).
2. **Main Loop:**  The program iterates through each cell. If it finds any cell in the same column belonging to a horizontal line of '2's (checked using `connected_twos`), it fills the current cell with '3'; otherwise, it retains the original value.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False):
    if color(obj) == TWO and hline(toindices(obj)):
      start_j = leftmost(obj)
      end_j = rightmost(obj)
      for j in range(start_j, end_j + 1):
        I = fill(I, THREE, {(uppermost(obj), j)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Detection:** It identifies all horizontal lines of '2's using `objects` with specific parameters.
2. **Line Extension:** For each detected line, it determines the start and end columns and fills the corresponding row in the grid with '3'.


**Program Version 5:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def fill_neighbors(i, j):
    if index(I, (i, j)) == TWO:
      for dj in [-1, 1]:
        if 0 <= j + dj < width(I) and index(I, (i, j + dj)) == ZERO:
          I = fill(I, THREE, {(i, j + dj)})
          I = fill_neighbors(i, j + dj)
    return I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      I = fill_neighbors(i, j)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **fill_neighbors(i, j):**  This recursive helper function starts at a cell containing '2'. It fills its left and right neighbors with '3' if they are '0' and recursively calls itself on the newly filled neighbors. 
2. **Main Loop:**  The program iterates through each cell, calling `fill_neighbors` to initiate the recursive filling process.


These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the target transformation using the DSL functions. Each leverages different logic and function combinations, showcasing diversity in problem-solving.
