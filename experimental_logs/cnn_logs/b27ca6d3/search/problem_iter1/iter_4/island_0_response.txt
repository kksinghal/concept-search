## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying horizontal lines of the color '2' (specifically, those with a width of 2 cells), extending those lines one cell to the right, and then shifting the entire extended line down by one cell. The newly created cells are filled with the color '3'.

**Input_0 Example:**

- There are three horizontal '2' lines with a width of 2 cells.
- Each line is extended one cell to the right.
- The entire extended line (3 cells wide) is shifted down by one cell.
- The new cells in the shifted position are filled with '3'.

**Input_1 Example:**

- The same logic is applied, identifying the horizontal '2' lines of width 2, extending, shifting, and filling with '3'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  horizontal_pairs = sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == TWO and width(obj) == 2 and height(obj) == 1)
  extended_pairs = mapply(lambda obj: connect(ulcorner(obj), (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)), horizontal_pairs)
  shifted_lines = mapply(lambda line: shift(line, DOWN), extended_pairs)
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(shifted_lines))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`horizontal_pairs = sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == TWO and width(obj) == 2 and height(obj) == 1)`:** 
   - Identify all objects (connected components) in the input grid `I` that are of color '2', have a width of 2, and height of 1. This gives us the horizontal lines we need to work with.

2. **`extended_pairs = mapply(lambda obj: connect(ulcorner(obj), (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)), horizontal_pairs)`:**
   - For each identified horizontal pair, create a line connecting the upper-left corner of the object to a point one cell to the right of its rightmost point. This effectively extends the line by one cell.

3. **`shifted_lines = mapply(lambda line: shift(line, DOWN), extended_pairs)`:**
   - Shift each extended line down by one cell using the `DOWN` direction vector.

4. **`return fill(I, THREE, merge(shifted_lines))`:**
   - Fill the input grid `I` with the color '3' at the indices specified by the merged set of shifted lines.


**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  twos = ofcolor(I, TWO)
  horizontal_pairs = sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == TWO and width(obj) == 2 and height(obj) == 1)
  right_edges = mapply(lambda obj: (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj)), horizontal_pairs)
  shifted_edges = mapply(lambda edge: add(edge, DOWN + RIGHT), right_edges)
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(shifted_edges))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`twos = ofcolor(I, TWO)`:** Get the indices of all cells with color '2'.
2. **`horizontal_pairs = ...`:** Same as Version 1.
3. **`right_edges = mapply(lambda obj: (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj)), horizontal_pairs)`:**  Get the indices of the rightmost cells of each horizontal pair.
4. **`shifted_edges = mapply(lambda edge: add(edge, DOWN + RIGHT), right_edges)`:** Shift each right edge one cell down and one cell to the right.
5. **`return fill(I, THREE, merge(shifted_edges))`:** Fill the input grid with '3' at the shifted edge indices.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  horizontal_pairs = sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == TWO and width(obj) == 2 and height(obj) == 1)
  extended_lines = mfilter(horizontal_pairs, lambda obj: connect(ulcorner(obj), (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)))
  return fill(I, THREE, shift(extended_lines, DOWN)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`horizontal_pairs = ...`:** Same as Version 1.
2. **`extended_lines = mfilter(horizontal_pairs, lambda obj: connect(ulcorner(obj), (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)))`:**  Extend the horizontal pairs by one cell to the right and merge them into a single set of indices.
3. **`return fill(I, THREE, shift(extended_lines, DOWN))`:**  Shift the entire set of extended line indices down by one cell and fill those positions in the input grid with '3'.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grid = fill(I, THREE, shift(ofcolor(I, TWO), DOWN + RIGHT))
  return cellwise(shifted_grid, I, ZERO) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_grid = fill(I, THREE, shift(ofcolor(I, TWO), DOWN + RIGHT))`:** Create a new grid where all '2's are shifted down and right by one cell and replaced with '3's.
2. **`return cellwise(shifted_grid, I, ZERO)`:** Compare the shifted grid with the original, keeping '3's from the shifted grid only where there was a '0' in the original grid.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  w = width(I)
  new_grid = canvas(ZERO, (h, w))
  for i in range(h-1):
    for j in range(w-1):
      if I[i][j] == TWO and I[i][j+1] == TWO:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, THREE, {(i+1, j), (i+1, j+1), (i+1, j+2)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h = height(I)`:** Get the height of the input grid.
2. **`w = width(I)`:** Get the width of the input grid.
3. **`new_grid = canvas(ZERO, (h, w))`:** Create a new grid filled with '0's with the same dimensions as the input grid.
4. **`for i in range(h-1):`:** Iterate through the rows of the grid (except the last one).
5. **`for j in range(w-1):`:** Iterate through the columns of the grid (except the last one).
6. **`if I[i][j] == TWO and I[i][j+1] == TWO:`:** Check if the current cell and the cell to its right both have the value '2'.
7. **`new_grid = fill(new_grid, THREE, {(i+1, j), (i+1, j+1), (i+1, j+2)})`:** If they do, fill the corresponding cells in the new grid, one row below and extending one cell to the right, with the value '3'.
8. **`return new_grid`:** Return the new grid. 

This version directly iterates through the grid and applies the transformation based on the neighboring cell values.
