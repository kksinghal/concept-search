## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying non-background objects and extending them horizontally by one cell to the left and right, but only if those adjacent cells are originally the background color. 

**Input_0:**

- The '2' objects are extended with '3's to their left and right if those positions were originally '0's. 

**Input_1:**

- Similar to Input_0, '2' objects are extended with '3's horizontally. For example, the two '2's on the top row become a group of four with '3's extending them on both sides.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def extend_objects_horizontally(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Create a canvas of background color
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True): # Loop through non-background objects
    O = paint(O, obj) # Paint the object onto the canvas
    for i, j in toindices(obj): # Loop through each cell of the object
      if j > 0 and I[i][j - 1] == mostcommon(I): # Check for left extension condition
        O = paint(O, {(3, (i, j - 1))}) 
      if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == mostcommon(I): # Check for right extension condition
        O = paint(O, {(3, (i, j + 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Creates a blank canvas filled with the background color using `canvas` and `mostcommon`.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each non-background object identified by `objects`.
3. **Object Painting:**  Paints the current object onto the canvas using `paint`.
4. **Horizontal Extension:** For each cell in the object:
    - **Left Extension:** Checks if the cell to the left exists (`j > 0`) and is the background color (`I[i][j - 1] == mostcommon(I)`). If true, paints a '3' at that location.
    - **Right Extension:** Checks for the right extension condition analogously. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def extend_objects_horizontally_v2(I):
  O = I
  bg = mostcommon(I)
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != bg:  # Found a non-background cell
        if j > 0 and I[i][j - 1] == bg:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j - 1)})
        if j < len(row) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == bg:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Initializes the output grid `O` with the input grid `I` and retrieves the background color `bg`.
2. **Grid Traversal:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid using nested loops.
3. **Non-Background Cell Detection:** Checks if the current cell value `val` is not the background color.
4. **Horizontal Extension:** If a non-background cell is found:
   - **Left Extension:** Checks if a left neighbor exists and is the background color. If true, fills the left neighbor with a '3' using `fill`.
   - **Right Extension:** Checks the right neighbor analogously.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def extend_objects_horizontally_v3(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    extended_indices = mpapply(lambda x: ((x[0] - 1, x[1]), (x[0] + 1, x[1])), toindices(obj))
    filtered_indices = sfilter(extended_indices, lambda x: 0 <= x[0] < len(I) and 0 <= x[1] < len(I[0]) and I[x[0]][x[1]] == mostcommon(I))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, filtered_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to version 1, creates a blank canvas.
2. **Object Handling:** Iterates through non-background objects.
3. **Extension Calculation:** Uses `mpapply` to generate potential extension indices (left and right) for each cell in the object.
4. **Index Filtering:** Filters the generated indices using `sfilter` to keep only valid indices within the grid bounds and having the background color in the input grid.
5. **Painting:**  Recolors the filtered indices to '3' using `recolor` and paints them onto the output grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def extend_objects_horizontally_v4(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I):
        O = branch(j > 0 and I[i][j - 1] == mostcommon(I), fill(O, 3, {(i, j - 1)}), O)
        O = branch(j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == mostcommon(I), fill(O, 3, {(i, j + 1)}), O)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Modification:**  This version modifies the input grid `I` directly.
2. **Cell Traversal:** Iterates through each cell in the grid.
3. **Non-Background Check:**  Checks if the current cell is not the background color.
4. **Conditional Extension:** Uses the `branch` function for conditional extension:
   - **Left Extension:** If a left neighbor exists and is the background color, fills it with a '3'.
   - **Right Extension:**  Similarly handles the right neighbor.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def extend_objects_horizontally_v5(I):
  O = I
  bg = mostcommon(I)
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    extension = mfilter(toindices(obj), lambda x: (x[1] > 0 and I[x[0]][x[1] - 1] == bg) or (x[1] < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[x[0]][x[1] + 1] == bg))
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, extension))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Initializes output `O` with input `I` and gets background color `bg`.
2. **Object Processing:**  Iterates through non-background objects.
3. **Extension Identification:**  Uses `mfilter` to find cells within the object that can be extended (have a background neighbor to their left or right).
4. **Painting:** Recolors the identified extension cells to '3' and paints them onto the output grid.
