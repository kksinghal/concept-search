## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 

The transformation involves identifying objects (clusters of the same digit) and extending them horizontally to the right by one cell.  However, this extension only occurs if the extending cell is initially filled with the background color (0 in this case).

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

Similar to the first transformation, objects are identified. This time, they are extended both to the right and down by one cell, again only if the extending cells are initially the background color. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, False, True, True):
    right_extension = {(i, j + 1) for _, (i, j) in obj if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0}
    down_extension = {(i + 1, j) for _, (i, j) in obj if i < len(I) - 1 and index(I, (i + 1, j)) == 0}
    extended_indices = toindices(obj) | right_extension | down_extension
    O = paint(O, recolor(index(I, first(toindices(obj))), extended_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create a blank canvas `O` of the same size as the input `I` filled with the background color (0).
2. **Object Iteration:**  Iterate over each object in the input grid `I`.
3. **Extension Calculation:** For each object, calculate the indices to extend to the right (`right_extension`) and down (`down_extension`), only if the cell at that index is the background color.
4. **Index Union:** Combine the original object indices, right extension indices, and down extension indices.
5. **Painting:** Paint the combined indices onto the canvas `O` using the original object's color.
6. **Return Output:** Return the transformed canvas `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), asobject(I))
  for obj in objects(I, False, True, True):
    for direction in [RIGHT, DOWN]:
      shifted_obj = shift(toindices(obj), direction)
      O = underpaint(O, recolor(index(I, first(toindices(obj))), shifted_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Create a blank canvas and paint the input objects onto it. 
2. **Object & Direction Iteration:** Iterate through each object and each direction (RIGHT and DOWN).
3. **Shift and Paint:** Shift the object's indices in the current direction. Underpaint (paint only on background cells) the shifted object with its original color.
4. **Return Output:** Return the transformed canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != 0: 
        if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j+1] == 0:
          O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, j+1)})
        if i < len(I) - 1 and I[i+1][j] == 0:
          O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i+1, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Initialize the output `O` as a copy of the input `I`.
2. **Cell Iteration:** Iterate over every cell in the grid.
3. **Extension Check:** If a cell is not background, check its right and bottom neighbors.
4. **Fill Extension:** If the neighbor is a background cell, fill it with the current cell's color.
5. **Return Output:** Return the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = [[0 for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(h)]
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] != 0:
        O[i][j] = I[i][j]
        if j < w - 1:
          O[i][j + 1] = I[i][j] if O[i][j + 1] == 0 else O[i][j + 1]
        if i < h - 1:
          O[i + 1][j] = I[i][j] if O[i + 1][j] == 0 else O[i + 1][j]
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create a new grid `O` of the same size as input `I`, initialized with zeros.
2. **Cell-by-Cell Copy & Extension:** Copy non-zero values from `I` to `O`. If a cell in `I` is non-zero, extend its color one cell to the right and down in `O`, but only if the target cells in `O` are still zero.
3. **Return Output:** Return the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  right_shifted = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shift(asobject(I), RIGHT))
  down_shifted = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shift(asobject(I), DOWN))
  O = cellwise(I, right_shifted, mostcommon(I))
  O = cellwise(O, down_shifted, mostcommon(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shifted Grids:** Create two shifted versions of the input grid: one shifted right and one shifted down.
2. **Combine with Cellwise:** Use the `cellwise` function to combine the original grid with each shifted grid. Where they differ (meaning an object was present), keep the original color; otherwise, use the background color.
3. **Return Output:**  Return the final combined grid.
