## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) within the input grid, excluding the background color (most frequent color). Then, a new object is created by extending each existing object by adding a "border" of a new digit (3 in this case) around it. This border extends horizontally by one cell to the left and right, and vertically by one cell above.  

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

**Input_0:**

- The object of interest is the digit '2'.
- In the output, each '2' is surrounded by '3's, forming a border on the top and sides.

**Input_1:**

- Similar to Input_0, the digit '2' is the object of interest.
- The output again shows a '3' border around each '2', extending one cell up, left, and right. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  output = I
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      output = fill(output, THREE, {(i-1,j-1),(i-1,j),(i-1,j+1),(i,j-1),(i,j+1)})
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts objects from the input grid `I`, considering only directly connected cells (`T, F`) and excluding the background color (`T`).
2. **Iterate and Fill:** The code iterates through each object and each cell within the object. For each cell, it fills the cells above, to the left, and to the right with the digit '3'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  border_cells = mapply(lambda obj: mapply(lambda c: {(c[0]-1,c[1]-1),(c[0]-1,c[1]),(c[0]-1,c[1]+1),(c[0],c[1]-1),(c[0],c[1]+1)}, toindices(obj)), objs)
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(border_cells)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1, `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts the objects.
2. **Calculate Border Cells:**  For each object, the code maps a function to its indices that generates the coordinates of the border cells. It then merges all these border cell coordinates. 
3. **Fill Border Cells:** Finally, it uses the `fill` function to paint the collected border cells with the digit '3'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, shift(obj, (-1, 0))) | recolor(THREE, shift(obj, (-1, 1))) | recolor(THREE, shift(obj, (-1, -1))) | recolor(THREE, shift(obj, (0, -1))) | recolor(THREE, shift(obj, (0, 1))), objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Similar to previous versions, it first identifies the objects using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Generate Shifted Objects:** For each object, it creates five shifted copies: one up, one up-right, one up-left, one left, and one right. It recolors these shifted copies with the digit '3'. 
3. **Merge and Paint:**  It merges all the shifted objects and paints them onto the original input grid `I`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  output = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
      output = underpaint(output, recolor(THREE, shift(obj, (-1, 0))))
      output = underpaint(output, recolor(THREE, shift(obj, (-1, 1))))
      output = underpaint(output, recolor(THREE, shift(obj, (-1, -1))))
      output = underpaint(output, recolor(THREE, shift(obj, (0, -1))))
      output = underpaint(output, recolor(THREE, shift(obj, (0, 1))))
  return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Objects:**  Iterates through each identified object.
2. **Shift, Recolor, and Underpaint:** For every object, it creates five shifted copies (similar to Version 3) and recolors them with '3'. Then, it uses `underpaint` to paint these shifted objects onto the output grid but only where the background color exists.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def border(obj):
    return  mapply(lambda c: {(c[0]-1,c[1]-1),(c[0]-1,c[1]),(c[0]-1,c[1]+1),(c[0],c[1]-1),(c[0],c[1]+1)}, toindices(obj))
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(apply(border, objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define 'border' Function:** Defines a helper function 'border' that takes an object and returns the indices of its border cells. 
2. **Apply and Fill:** Applies the 'border' function to each object, merges the resulting border cells, and finally fills them with the digit '3' on the input grid.

These five versions utilize different strategies and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same transformation. They highlight the flexibility and expressiveness of DSLs in solving spatial reasoning problems.
