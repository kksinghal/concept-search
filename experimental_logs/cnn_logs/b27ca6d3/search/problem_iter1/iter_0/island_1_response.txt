## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**  The transformation involves identifying objects (groups of connected '2's) and extending them horizontally by one cell to the left and right with the value '3'. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:** This transformation is similar to the first one. However, instead of extending all objects, only the '2' objects are extended with '3's to the left and right.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:


### Program Version 1:
**Code:**
```python
def transform(I):
  O = I
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if j > 0:
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j - 1)})
      if j < len(I[0]) - 1:
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Uses `objects()` to find connected groups of non-background values (here, '2').
2. **Extend Horizontally:** Iterates through each cell of each object.
3. **Fill with '3':** If a cell is not on the edge of the grid, it fills the left and right neighboring cells with '3'.

### Program Version 2:
**Code:**
```python
def transform(I):
  O = replace(I, 2, 3)
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Replace and Paint:** Replaces all occurrences of '2' with '3' using `replace()`. Then, it repaints the original '2' objects onto the grid using `paint()`.


### Program Version 3:
**Code:**
```python
def transform(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == 2:
        if I[i][j - 1] == 0:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j - 1)})
        if I[i][j + 1] == 0:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** Iterates through every cell of the grid.
2. **Extend if '2':** If a cell contains '2', checks its left and right neighbors. 
3. **Fill with '3':** If a neighbor is '0', it gets replaced with '3'.


### Program Version 4:
**Code:**
```python
def transform(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    indices = toindices(obj)
    extended_indices = set()
    for i, j in indices:
      extended_indices.add((i, j-1))
      extended_indices.add((i, j+1))
    O = underfill(O, 3, extended_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Objects and Indices:** Identifies objects and gets their cell indices.
2. **Extend Indices:** Creates a set of extended indices by adding the left and right neighbors of each object cell.
3. **Underfill:** Uses `underfill()` to fill the extended indices with '3' only if the original cell was background ('0').


### Program Version 5:
**Code:**
```python
def transform(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  extended_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    new_obj = set()
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      new_obj.add((v, (i, j)))
      if j > 0:
        new_obj.add((3, (i, j - 1)))
      if j < len(I[0]) - 1:
        new_obj.add((3, (i, j + 1)))
    extended_objs.add(frozenset(new_obj))
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in extended_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Extended Objects:** Identifies objects and creates new objects with extended cells containing '3'.
2. **Paint on Blank Canvas:** Creates a blank canvas grid filled with '0's and then paints the extended objects onto it.


These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation within the constraints of the DSL. Each version utilizes different functions and logic, demonstrating the flexibility of the DSL in solving spatial reasoning tasks.
