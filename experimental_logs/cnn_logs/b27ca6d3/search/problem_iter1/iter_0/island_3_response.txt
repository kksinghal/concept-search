## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by connected '2' digits in the input grid and then drawing a bounding box around these objects using the digit '3' in the output grid. The original '2' digits are preserved. 

**Let's break down the transformation:**

1. **Object Identification:**  Identify groups of connected '2' digits. Two '2's are considered connected if they are directly adjacent (up, down, left, right).
2. **Bounding Box Creation:** For each identified object:
    - Find the topmost, bottommost, leftmost, and rightmost '2' of the object.
    - Draw a rectangular box using '3' as the border, encompassing the entire object from its outermost '2' digits.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  painted = I
  for obj in objs:
    painted = fill(painted, THREE, box(toindices(obj)))
  return painted 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, True, False, True)`**:  Extracts connected objects formed by the digit '2' (excluding background).
2. **`painted = I`**: Initializes a new grid `painted` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
3. **`for obj in objs`**: Iterates through each identified object.
4. **`painted = fill(painted, THREE, box(toindices(obj)))`**:  Draws a bounding box filled with '3' around the current object (`obj`) on the `painted` grid. `box` function computes the indices forming the outline of the object.
5. **`return painted`**: Returns the transformed grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  for obj in objs:
    top, left = ulcorner(obj)
    bottom, right = lrcorner(obj)
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
      for j in range(left, right + 1):
        if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or j == right:
          I = fill(I, THREE, {(i, j)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, True, False, True)`**: Extracts connected '2' objects (excluding background).
2. **`for obj in objs`**: Iterates through each object.
3. **`top, left = ulcorner(obj)`**:  Gets the row and column indices of the upper-left corner of the object.
4. **`bottom, right = lrcorner(obj)`**:  Gets the row and column indices of the lower-right corner of the object.
5. **`for i in range(top, bottom + 1):`**:  Iterates through rows from the top to the bottom of the object's bounding box.
6. **`for j in range(left, right + 1)`**: Iterates through columns from the left to the right of the object's bounding box.
7. **`if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or j == right:`**:  Checks if the current cell (i, j) lies on the border of the bounding box.
8. **`I = fill(I, THREE, {(i, j)})`**: Fills the border cell with '3'. 
9. **`return I`**: Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  painted = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == TWO:
        for di in (-1, 0, 1):
          for dj in (-1, 0, 1):
            if (di != 0 or dj != 0) and 0 <= i + di < height(I) and 0 <= j + dj < width(I):
              if I[i + di][j + dj] == ZERO:
                painted = fill(painted, THREE, {(i + di, j + dj)})
  return painted
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`painted = I`**:  Initializes a copy of the input grid.
2. **`for i, row in enumerate(I)`**: Iterates through each row of the grid.
3. **`for j, val in enumerate(row)`**:  Iterates through each cell in the row.
4. **`if val == TWO`**:  Checks if the current cell contains a '2'.
5. **`for di in (-1, 0, 1):`**: Iterates through vertical offsets.
6. **`for dj in (-1, 0, 1):`**: Iterates through horizontal offsets.
7. **`if (di != 0 or dj != 0) and 0 <= i + di < height(I) and 0 <= j + dj < width(I)`**: Ensures the offset is valid and within the grid boundaries.
8.  **`if I[i + di][j + dj] == ZERO`**: Checks if the neighboring cell is a background cell (contains '0').
9. **`painted = fill(painted, THREE, {(i + di, j + dj)})`**: Fills the background neighbor cell with '3'.
10. **`return painted`**: Returns the modified grid. 


**Program Version 4**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(apply(box, apply(toindices, objs)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, True, False, True)`**: Extracts connected '2' objects.
2. **`apply(toindices, objs)`**: Applies the `toindices` function to each object in `objs`, converting them to sets of indices. 
3. **`apply(box, ...)`**: Applies the `box` function to each set of indices, generating sets of indices representing bounding boxes for each object.
4. **`merge(...)`**: Merges all the bounding box indices into a single set.
5. **`fill(I, THREE, ...)`**: Fills the cells at the merged bounding box indices in the input grid `I` with '3'.
6. **`return ...`**: Returns the modified grid. 


**Program Version 5**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  painted = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    painted = fill(painted, THREE, 
                   frozenset((i + di, j + dj)
                            for i, j in toindices(obj) 
                            for di in (-1, 0, 1) 
                            for dj in (-1, 0, 1) 
                            if (di != 0 or dj != 0) and (0 <= i + di < height(I) and 0 <= j + dj < width(I))
                            and index(I, (i + di, j + dj)) == ZERO))
  return painted
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`painted = I`**: Initializes a copy of the input grid.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)`**:  Iterates through connected '2' objects.
3. **`painted = fill(painted, THREE, frozenset((...)))`**:  Fills cells in `painted` with '3' based on the indices generated by the nested loop.
    - **`(i + di, j + dj) for i, j in toindices(obj)`**: Iterates through neighbor indices of each cell in the object.
    - **`for di in (-1, 0, 1) for dj in (-1, 0, 1)`**:  Generates offsets for neighbor cells.
    - **`if (di != 0 or dj != 0) and (0 <= i + di < height(I) and 0 <= j + dj < width(I))`**:  Ensures the neighbor is valid and within the grid.
    - **`and index(I, (i + di, j + dj)) == ZERO`**: Checks if the neighbor is a background cell.
4. **`return painted`**:  Returns the modified grid.

These five versions provide different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
