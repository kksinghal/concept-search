## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects made of the digit '2' and then extending those objects horizontally by one cell on either side, filling those cells with the digit '3'. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:** 
- Several single-cell '2' objects exist.
- Each of these objects is extended to the left and right by a single cell containing '3'.
- Where objects are close enough that their extensions would overlap, the '3's are simply placed adjacently.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**
- This example showcases a variety of object sizes and arrangements.
- The extension logic remains consistent: every '2' object is horizontally padded with '3's.
- Notice the top-rightmost '2' in the input. It results in two '3's directly below it, as extending to the right would be beyond the grid boundary.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions for achieving this transformation, each with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  painted = I
  for obj in objs:
    left_edge = leftmost(obj) - 1  
    right_edge = rightmost(obj) + 1
    for x in range(left_edge, right_edge + 1):
      if 0 <= x < width(I):
        painted = fill(painted, THREE, {(uppermost(obj), x)})
  return painted
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Program_B, it first identifies '2' objects using `objects(I, True, False, True)`.
2. **Iterate and Extend:**  It iterates through each object (`obj`). For each object, it calculates its `left_edge` and `right_edge` by subtracting and adding 1 from the leftmost and rightmost column indices, respectively.
3. **Horizontal Filling:** It fills the cells at the top row of the object's bounding box, from the `left_edge` to the `right_edge`, with the digit '3'. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  painted = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      painted = fill(painted, THREE, {(i, leftmost(obj) - 1)})
      painted = fill(painted, THREE, {(i, rightmost(obj) + 1)})
  return painted
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find Objects:** Like before, it starts by identifying '2' objects.
2. **Extend Vertically:**  It iterates over each object and then within each object's row span (from `uppermost` to `lowermost`), it directly fills in the cells to the left (`leftmost(obj) - 1`) and right (`rightmost(obj) + 1`) of the object with '3'. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  modified_grid = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == TWO:
        if j > 0:
          modified_grid = fill(modified_grid, THREE, {(i, j - 1)})
        if j < width(I) - 1:
          modified_grid = fill(modified_grid, THREE, {(i, j + 1)}) 
  return modified_grid
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Direct Iteration:** This version iterates directly through the grid, cell by cell, without explicitly extracting objects.
2. **Check and Fill:**  If a cell contains '2', it checks if its left and right neighbors are within the grid bounds. If so, it fills them with '3'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  return paint(
      fill(I, THREE, prapply(lambda i, j: {(i, j-1), (i, j+1)}, *shape(I))),
      asobject(I)
  )
```
**Explanation:**

1. **Create Extension Mask:**  `prapply(lambda i, j: {(i, j-1), (i, j+1)}, *shape(I))` generates a set of indices representing all cells one step to the left and right of every cell in the grid. This essentially creates a "mask" for the extension.
2. **Fill the Mask:** `fill(I, THREE, ...)` fills the grid `I` with '3' at the positions specified by the extension mask.
3. **Overlay Original:**  `asobject(I)` converts the original grid `I` into an object representation. `paint(..., asobject(I))` then "paints" this original object onto the modified grid (filled with '3's), ensuring the original '2's are preserved.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      THREE if 0<j<w-1 and (I[i][j-1]==TWO or I[i][j+1]==TWO) else cell
      for j, cell in enumerate(row)
    ) for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```
**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Grid Manipulation:** This version directly manipulates the grid using nested loops and conditional replacement.
2. **Check Neighbors:** For each cell, it checks:
   - If it's not on the edge (`0 < j < w-1`).
   - If either of its horizontal neighbors is '2' (`I[i][j-1] == TWO or I[i][j+1] == TWO`).
3. **Conditional Fill:** If both conditions are met, the cell is replaced with '3'; otherwise, it remains unchanged.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation using the provided DSL, showcasing the flexibility and potential for varied solutions within the given constraints.
