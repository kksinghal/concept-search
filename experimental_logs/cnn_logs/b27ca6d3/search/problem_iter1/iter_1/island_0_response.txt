## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by connected cells of the same color (excluding the background color 0) and then drawing a border around them using the color 3. The border extends outwards from the object and does not replace existing cells within the object.

**Input_0:** 
- Objects are identified based on connected cells of color 2. 
- A 1-cell thick border of color 3 is drawn around each object.

**Input_1:**
- The same logic applies as in Input_0, with objects identified based on connected cells of color 2.
- A 1-cell thick border of color 3 is drawn around each object.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" in the provided DSL:

### Program Version 1: 

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  borders = mapply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), objs)
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(borders)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the grid `I`. Objects are defined as connected components of the same color, excluding the background (color 0), and considering only direct neighbors (no diagonals).
2. **`borders = mapply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), objs)`:** For each object, this extracts the indices of its border cells using `delta` function. `delta` returns the cells surrounding the object (its bounding box) but not part of the object itself.
3. **`return fill(I, THREE, merge(borders))`:** Finally, the code fills the input grid `I` with the color 3 at the indices defined by the merged set of all object borders. 

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, delta(toindices(obj))), objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies all objects (connected components excluding background).
2. **`apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, delta(toindices(obj))), ...)`:**  For each object, calculates its border cells using `delta`, and then recolors these border cells to 3.
3. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the re-colored border cells of all objects.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged border cells onto the original input grid `I`.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def make_border(obj):
    return recolor(THREE, mapply(lambda c: dneighbors(c), toindices(obj)) - toindices(obj))
  return paint(I, merge(apply(make_border, objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`make_border(obj)`:** This inner function takes an object as input and computes its border.
    - `mapply(lambda c: dneighbors(c), toindices(obj))`: Generates all direct neighbor cells of the object's cells.
    - `... - toindices(obj)`: Removes the original object cells from the set of neighbors, leaving only the border cells.
    - `recolor(THREE, ...)`: Recolors the border cells to 3.
2. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid.
3. **`apply(make_border, ...)`:** Applies the `make_border` function to each object.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges all the border cells from each object.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged border cells onto the original grid.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def border_cells(obj):
    return difference(mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(apply(border_cells, objects(I, T, F, T)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`border_cells(obj)`:** Inner function to find border cells of an object.
    - `mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj))`: Generates the direct neighbors of all object cells.
    - `difference(..., toindices(obj))`: Removes the original object cells from the neighbor set, leaving only the border cells.
2. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies all objects in the input grid.
3. **`apply(border_cells, ...)`:** Applies the `border_cells` function to each identified object.
4. **`merge(...)`:**  Merges the border cells from all objects into a single set.
5. **`fill(I, THREE, ...)`:** Fills the original grid `I` with color 3 at the positions defined by the merged border cell set.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def expand_obj(obj):
    return difference(mapply(neighbors, toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))
  expanded_objs = apply(expand_obj, objects(I, T, F, T))
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(expanded_objs)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`expand_obj(obj)`:**  This inner function takes an object and returns a set of cells surrounding it (including diagonals) but excluding the object's cells.
2. **`expanded_objs = apply(expand_obj, objects(I, T, F, T))`:** 
    - `objects(I, T, F, T)`: Finds all objects in the grid.
    - `apply(expand_obj, ...)`: Applies `expand_obj` to each object, creating a set of expanded cells for each.
3. **`fill(I, THREE, merge(expanded_objs))`:** 
    - `merge(expanded_objs)`: Combines all expanded cell sets into a single set.
    - `fill(I, THREE, ...)`:  Fills the input grid `I` with color 3 at the positions of the merged expanded cells.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the desired border-drawing transformation, offering distinct solutions to the problem.
