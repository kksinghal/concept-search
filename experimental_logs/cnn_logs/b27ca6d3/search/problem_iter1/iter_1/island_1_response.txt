## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (clusters of non-zero digits) and extending their horizontal span by replacing the adjacent background cells (cells with value 0) with the digit '3'. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The '2' digits form distinct objects. The transformation replaces the '0' cells immediately to the left and right of each '2' with a '3'. 
* **Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0, the '2' digits form objects. The '0' cells to their left and right are replaced with '3'. Notice how objects on the edge of the grid are also extended.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    for cell in obj:
      i, j = cell[1]
      if j > 0:
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j - 1)})
      if j < len(I[0]) - 1:
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:**  The code iterates through each object in the input grid using `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`.
2. **Extend Horizontally:** For each cell within an object, it checks if there's a cell to its left and right. If so, it uses the `fill` function to replace these adjacent cells with '3'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != 0:
        if j > 0:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j - 1)})
        if j < len(I[0]) - 1:
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:**  This version iterates directly through every cell in the grid.
2. **Check for Non-Zero:** It checks if the cell is part of an object (non-zero value). 
3. **Extend if Object Cell:**  If it's an object cell, it replaces the left and right adjacent cells with '3', making sure to stay within the grid boundaries.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
        indices = toindices(obj)
        left_indices = {(i, j - 1) for i, j in indices if j > 0}
        right_indices = {(i, j + 1) for i, j in indices if j < len(I[0]) - 1}
        O = underfill(O, 3, left_indices | right_indices) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Object Indices:**  Similar to Version 1, this iterates through objects and gets their indices using `toindices`.
2. **Calculate Adjacent Indices:** It efficiently calculates the sets of indices to the left (`left_indices`) and right (`right_indices`) of the object.
3. **Fill in One Go:**  It uses `underfill` to replace the background cells at the calculated left and right indices with '3' in a single operation.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(1, len(I[0]) - 1):
            if I[i][j] != 0:
                if I[i][j - 1] == 0:
                    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j - 1)})
                if I[i][j + 1] == 0:
                    O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j + 1)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Iteration & Boundary Check:** Iterates through cells, excluding the first and last columns.
2. **Check Adjacent Cells Directly:**  For each non-zero cell, it directly checks if the adjacent cells are 0 (background) before filling with '3'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) 
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    indices = toindices(obj)
    extension = {(i, j - 1) for i, j in indices if j > 0} | {(i, j + 1) for i, j in indices if j < len(I[0]) - 1}
    O = underfill(O, 3, extension)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** Starts with an empty canvas of the same size as the input using `canvas`.
2. **Paint Objects:** Paints the original objects onto the canvas.
3. **Calculate and Fill Extension:** Calculates the indices to extend and uses `underfill` to fill them with '3'. This ensures only the background around objects is modified. 

Each of these program versions uses different strategies and DSL function combinations to achieve the same transformation.
