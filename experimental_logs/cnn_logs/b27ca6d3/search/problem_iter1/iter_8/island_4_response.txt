## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 

The transformation identifies horizontal lines of '2's (connected or with single '0' gaps) and replaces the '0's within and immediately surrounding these lines with '3's. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

This transformation applies the same logic as the previous one, replacing '0's within and adjacent to horizontal lines of '2's with '3's. However, it only modifies '0's that are not directly above or below another non-zero digit. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code in the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = height(grid), width(grid)
  objects = objects(grid, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  twos = colorfilter(objects, 2)
  for two in twos:
    upper = uppermost(two) - 1
    lower = lowermost(two) + 1
    left = leftmost(two) - 1
    right = rightmost(two) + 1
    for i in range(upper, lower + 1):
      for j in range(left, right + 1):
        if 0 <= i < h and 0 <= j < w and grid[i][j] == 0 and not (0 < i < h - 1 and (grid[i - 1][j] != 0 or grid[i + 1][j] != 0)):
          grid = fill(grid, 3, {(i, j)})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify objects (connected regions) in the grid using `objects`.
2. **Filter by Color:** Extract objects consisting only of the color '2' using `colorfilter`.
3. **Iterate Objects:** For each object of '2's:
    - **Find Boundaries:** Determine the upper, lower, left, and right boundaries of the object.
    - **Iterate Neighborhood:** Loop through indices within and adjacent to the object boundaries.
    - **Conditional Fill:**  If an index contains '0' and is not directly above or below a non-zero digit, replace it with '3' using `fill`. 
4. **Return Grid:** Return the modified grid. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def fill_condition(above, left, current, right, below):
    return 3 if current == 0 and (left == 2 or right == 2) and (above == 0 and below == 0) else current
  padded_grid = ((0,) * (width(grid) + 2),) + tuple((0,) + row + (0,) for row in grid) + ((0,) * (width(grid) + 2),)
  return tuple(
    tuple(papply(fill_condition, (0, *row[:-1]), (0, *row[1:]), row, (0, *row[2:]), (0, *row[3:])))
    for row in padded_grid[1:-1]
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Pad Grid:** Add a border of '0's around the grid using tuple concatenation.
2. **Define Fill Condition:** Create a function `fill_condition` that checks for '0' surrounded by '2's horizontally and '0's vertically.
3. **Apply Fill Condition:** Utilize `papply` to apply `fill_condition` to each cell, considering its five neighbors.
4. **Return Grid:** Return the modified grid without the padding.

**Program Version 3:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = height(grid), width(grid)
  def fill_line(start, end, row_idx):
    for j in range(start, end + 1):
      if 0 <= row_idx < h and 0 <= j < w:
        grid = fill(grid, 3, {(row_idx, j)})
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    j = 0
    while j < w:
      if row[j] == 2:
        start_j = j
        while j < w and (row[j] == 2 or (j > 0 and row[j - 1] == 2) or (j < w - 1 and row[j + 1] == 2)):
          j += 1
        fill_line(start_j - 1, j, i)
        fill_line(start_j - 1, j, i - 1)
        fill_line(start_j - 1, j, i + 1)
      j += 1
  return grid
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **Iterate Rows:** Loop through each row of the grid.
2. **Find '2' Sequences:** Identify contiguous sequences of '2's, including single '0' gaps.
3. **Fill with '3's:** For each '2' sequence:
    - Determine the start and end indices.
    - Fill the corresponding horizontal lines with '3's, including the lines above and below.
4. **Return Grid:** Return the modified grid. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def expand_line(indices):
    return frozenset((i + di, j + dj) for i, j in indices for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)])
  objects = objects(grid, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  twos = colorfilter(objects, 2)
  for two in twos:
    expanded_indices = expand_line(toindices(two))
    grid = fill(grid, 3, expanded_indices & asindices(grid))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **Define Expansion:** Create a function `expand_line` to get indices surrounding a given set of indices.
2. **Identify Objects:** Identify objects (connected regions) in the grid.
3. **Filter by Color:** Extract objects consisting only of the color '2'.
4. **Iterate Objects:** For each object of '2's:
    - **Expand Indices:** Get surrounding indices using `expand_line`.
    - **Intersect with Grid:** Keep only valid indices within the grid boundaries.
    - **Fill Grid:** Fill the selected indices with '3' using `fill`. 
5. **Return Grid:** Return the modified grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 2:
        if (j > 0 and grid[i][j - 1] == 0 and not (0 < i < height(grid) - 1 and (grid[i - 1][j - 1] != 0 or grid[i + 1][j - 1] != 0))):
          grid = fill(grid, 3, {(i, j - 1)})
        if (j < width(grid) - 1 and grid[i][j + 1] == 0 and not (0 < i < height(grid) - 1 and (grid[i - 1][j + 1] != 0 or grid[i + 1][j + 1] != 0))):
          grid = fill(grid, 3, {(i, j + 1)})
        if (i > 0 and grid[i - 1][j] == 0):
          grid = fill(grid, 3, {(i - 1, j)})
        if (i < height(grid) - 1 and grid[i + 1][j] == 0):
          grid = fill(grid, 3, {(i + 1, j)})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Grid:** Loop through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check for '2':**  If a cell contains '2':
    - **Check Adjacent '0's:** Examine each adjacent cell (left, right, up, down).
    - **Conditional Fill:** If an adjacent cell is '0' and meets the criteria (not directly above or below a non-zero for horizontal adjacency), fill it with '3'.
3. **Return Grid:** Return the modified grid.
