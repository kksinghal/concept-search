## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of non-background color) and extending horizontal lines of the background color (most common color) from the left and right edges of each object until they hit another object or the grid boundary.

**Example:**

In Input_0, consider the object formed by the digit '2' at coordinates (2,2),(3,7),(4,14). 

1. **Object Identification:** The program identifies this as a single object.
2. **Horizontal Line Extension:**  
    *  From the leftmost point (2,2), a line of '0's is extended leftwards until it reaches the grid boundary. 
    *  From the rightmost point (4,14), a line of '0's is extended rightwards until it reaches the grid boundary.
    *  Similar extensions are done for the other points of the object.
3. **Filling with '3':** These extended lines of '0's are then replaced with the digit '3'. 

This process is repeated for all identified objects in the grid.

## Program to be Generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      O = fill(O, 3, connect((i,j), (i,0)))  # Fill left to edge
      O = fill(O, 3, connect((i,j), (i,len(I[0])-1))) # Fill right to edge
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** `O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))` creates an output grid `O` of the same size as input `I`, filled with the most common color in `I` (background).
2. **Object Iteration:** `for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):` iterates through each object in `I`, excluding the background.
3. **Object Painting:** `O = paint(O, obj)` paints the current object onto the output grid `O`.
4. **Horizontal Line Filling:**  For each cell `(i, j)` in the object:
    *  `O = fill(O, 3, connect((i,j), (i,0)))` fills a line of '3's from the cell leftwards to the grid edge (j=0).
    * `O = fill(O, 3, connect((i,j), (i,len(I[0])-1)))` fills a line of '3's from the cell rightwards to the grid edge (j = last column).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I 
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for obj in objects(crop(I, (i,0), (1, len(I[0]))), univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
      leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
      rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
      O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for j in range(0, leftmost_j)})
      O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for j in range(rightmost_j + 1, len(I[0]))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Modification:**  This version modifies the input grid `I` directly to create the output `O`.
2. **Row-wise Processing:**  The code iterates through each row `i` of the grid.
3. **Horizontal Object Identification:**  `objects(crop(I, (i,0), (1, len(I[0]))), univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies horizontally connected objects within the current row.
4. **Left and Right Filling:**  For each object in the row:
    *  `leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)` finds the column index of the leftmost cell of the object.
    *  `rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)` finds the column index of the rightmost cell of the object.
    *  `O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for j in range(0, leftmost_j)})` fills a line of '3's from the left edge of the grid to the leftmost cell of the object.
    *  `O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for j in range(rightmost_j + 1, len(I[0]))})` fills a line of '3's from the rightmost cell of the object to the right edge of the grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I):
        O = fill(O, 3, connect((i, j), (i, 0)))
        O = fill(O, 3, connect((i, j), (i, len(I[0]) - 1)))
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Cell-wise Iteration:** Iterates through each cell `(i, j)` in the input grid `I`.
3. **Non-Background Cell Handling:** If a cell's value is not the background color:
    *  `O = fill(O, 3, connect((i, j), (i, 0)))`: Fills leftwards with '3's to the grid edge.
    *  `O = fill(O, 3, connect((i, j), (i, len(I[0]) - 1)))`: Fills rightwards with '3's to the grid edge.
    *  `O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))})`: Paints the cell itself onto the output grid `O` (to overwrite any '3's that might have been filled over the object).

**Program Version 4:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      left = j - 1
      while left >= 0 and I[i][left] == mostcommon(I):
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, left)})
        left -= 1
      right = j + 1
      while right < len(I[0]) and I[i][right] == mostcommon(I):
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, right)})
        right += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Modification:** Similar to Version 2, modifies `I` directly.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through objects excluding the background.
3. **Expanding from Object Cell:**  For each cell `(i, j)` in the object:
    *  **Leftward Expansion:**  Uses a `while` loop to move left from the cell (decreasing `left`) as long as the cell's value is the background color. Fills each encountered background cell with '3'.
    *  **Rightward Expansion:** Uses a similar `while` loop to move right (increasing `right`) and fill with '3's.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      O = fill(O, 3, hfrontier((i,j)) - toindices(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas & Object Painting:**  Initializes the canvas and paints objects similar to previous versions.
2. **Horizontal Frontier Filling:** For each cell `(i, j)` in an object:
   *  `hfrontier((i,j))`: Generates the entire horizontal line of cells at row `i`.
   *  `hfrontier((i,j)) - toindices(obj)`:  Subtracts the object's cells from the line, leaving only the background cells on that line.
   *  `O = fill(O, 3, ...)`: Fills the resulting background cells with '3'.

These are five different versions of the program, each using a distinct approach to achieve the same transformation. You can choose the one you find most readable and efficient for your needs.
