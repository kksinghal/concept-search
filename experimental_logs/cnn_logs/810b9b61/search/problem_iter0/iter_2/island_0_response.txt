## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying objects formed by the digit '1' and recoloring them to '3'. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**  All objects formed by '1' are recolored to '3'.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:** Same as above.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:** Same as above.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Identifies objects formed by '1' and recolors them to '3'.
  """
  # Find indices of '1's in the grid.
  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE) 
  # Create a blank canvas.
  canvas = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))  
  # Fill the canvas with '3' at the indices of '1's.
  O = fill(canvas, THREE, ones_indices) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version directly targets the '1' cells and replaces them with '3' on a blank canvas, effectively recoloring the objects formed by '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Replaces '1's in the grid with '3's.
  """
  # Replace all occurrences of '1' with '3' directly in the input grid.
  O = replace(I, ONE, THREE)  
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version simplifies the process by directly substituting '1' with '3' in the input grid, utilizing the `replace` function.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Recolors objects containing '1' to '3'.
  """
  # Identify all objects in the grid.
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)  
  # Filter for objects containing '1'.
  ones_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE)  
  # Recolor the filtered objects to '3'.
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj), ones_objs)  
  # Paint the recolored objects onto a blank canvas.
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))  
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version first identifies all objects and then specifically targets those containing '1' for recoloring. It demonstrates a more selective approach.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Fills a blank canvas with '3' at locations of objects containing '1'.
  """
  # Identify objects in the grid.
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)  
  # Find indices of objects containing '1'.
  ones_indices = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE, toindices) 
  # Fill a blank canvas with '3' at the identified indices.
  O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), THREE, ones_indices)  
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version focuses on finding the indices of objects containing '1' and then utilizes these indices to fill a blank canvas with '3'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Iterates through the grid, recoloring cells with '1' to '3'.
  """
  # Get grid dimensions.
  h, w = shape(I)  
  # Create a blank grid.
  O = canvas(ZERO, (h, w)) 
  # Iterate and recolor.
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == ONE:
        O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j)})  
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version utilizes a nested loop to iterate through every cell of the grid. If a cell contains '1', it is recolored to '3' on a separate output grid.

Each of these program versions showcases a distinct approach to achieving the desired transformation, highlighting the flexibility and diverse capabilities of the provided DSL.
