## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring all objects except the object with the color '1'. The new color for these objects is '3'.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0, Output_0:** All objects formed by digits '0' and '2' are recolored to '3'. Objects formed by digit '1' remain unchanged.
* **Input_1, Output_1:**  Similar to Input_0, all objects with digits other than '1' are recolored to '3'.
* **Input_2, Output_2:**  Again, only objects formed by digit '1' keep their original color, while others are changed to '3'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)  # Extract all objects excluding background
  recolored_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) != 1) # Filter objects not containing color '1'
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), recolored_objs) # Recolor the filtered objects
  O = paint(I, merge(recolored_objs)) # Paint the recolored objects onto the original grid
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid `I`, excluding the background.
2. **`recolored_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) != 1)`:** Filters the extracted objects, keeping only those whose color is not '1'.
3. **`recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), recolored_objs)`:** Applies the `recolor` function to each of the filtered objects, changing their color to '3'.
4. **`O = paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))`:** Merges all recolored objects and paints them onto the original input grid `I`, resulting in the final output grid `O`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  unchanged_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1) # Extract objects with color '1'
  O = paint(canvas(3, shape(I)), merge(unchanged_objs))  # Create canvas with '3' and paint unchanged objects 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:**  Extracts all objects from the input grid `I`, excluding the background.
2. **`unchanged_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)`:**  Filters for objects with color '1'.
3. **`O = paint(canvas(3, shape(I)), merge(unchanged_objs))`:**  Creates a new canvas filled with '3' having the same shape as the input grid and paints the unchanged objects (color '1') onto it.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Initialize output as input
  for v in palette(I) - {1, mostcommon(I)}:  # Iterate over colors except '1' and background
    O = replace(O, v, 3)  # Replace each color with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:**  Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **`for v in palette(I) - {1, mostcommon(I)}:`:** Iterates over all distinct colors present in the grid except color '1' and the background color.
3. **`O = replace(O, v, 3)`:** Replaces all occurrences of the current color `v` in the grid with '3'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices_to_recolor = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, 1)) # Find indices not containing '1'
  O = fill(I, 3, indices_to_recolor) # Fill those indices with '3' 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`indices_to_recolor = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, 1))`:**  Calculates the set of indices in the grid that do not contain the color '1'.
2. **`O = fill(I, 3, indices_to_recolor)`:**  Fills the identified indices with the color '3', effectively recoloring all objects except those with color '1'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(3, shape(I)) # Create a canvas filled with '3'
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1) # Get indices of color '1'
  O = fill(O, 1, one_indices) # Fill the '3' canvas with '1' at those indices
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(3, shape(I))`:**  Creates a new grid `O` filled with the color '3', having the same dimensions as the input grid `I`.
2. **`one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)`:**   Identifies the indices of all cells in the input grid `I` that have the color '1'.
3. **`O = fill(O, 1, one_indices)`:** Overwrites the newly created canvas `O` at the identified indices with the color '1', effectively replicating the objects formed by '1' from the input grid onto the new canvas.
