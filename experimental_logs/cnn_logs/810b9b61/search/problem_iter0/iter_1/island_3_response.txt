## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves replacing all occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid with the digit '3' in the output grid. All other digits and their positions remain unchanged.

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_22eb0ac0(I):
  O = replace(I, ONE, THREE)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This program directly utilizes the `replace` function from the DSL. It takes the input grid `I`, replaces all occurrences of `ONE` (which is a constant defined as 1 in the DSL) with `THREE` (defined as 3), and returns the resulting grid `O`.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_22eb0ac0(I):
  objs = asobject(I)
  modified_objs = frozenset({(THREE if value == ONE else value, index) for value, index in objs})
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), modified_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Convert to Object:** The input grid `I` is converted into an object representation using `asobject`.
2.  **Replace in Object:** The `modified_objs` set is created by iterating through the object and replacing the value with `THREE` if it's `ONE`, otherwise keeping the original value.
3.  **Paint on Canvas:** A blank canvas of the same size as the input grid is created using `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`, and the modified object is painted onto it using `paint`.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_22eb0ac0(I):
  indices_to_change = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  O = fill(I, THREE, indices_to_change)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify Target Indices:** The function `ofcolor(I, ONE)` identifies the indices of all cells containing the value `ONE`.
2.  **Fill Target Indices:**  The `fill` function then replaces the values at those indices with `THREE`.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_22eb0ac0(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) == ONE:
        O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This program iterates through every cell of the grid and checks if the value at the current index is equal to `ONE`. If it is, it uses the `fill` function to replace the value at that index with `THREE`. 

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_22eb0ac0(I):
    objs = partition(I)
    modified_objs = frozenset(recolor(THREE, obj) if color(obj) == ONE else obj for obj in objs)
    O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(modified_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Partition into Objects:**  The grid is partitioned into objects based on color using `partition(I)`.
2.  **Recolor Target Objects:** The code iterates through each object. If the object's color (`color(obj)`) is `ONE`, it recolors the entire object to `THREE` using `recolor(THREE, obj)`. 
3.  **Paint on Canvas:** Similar to version 2, a blank canvas is created, and the modified objects are painted onto it.

These five program versions showcase diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL, ranging from direct function application to object manipulation and grid traversal.
