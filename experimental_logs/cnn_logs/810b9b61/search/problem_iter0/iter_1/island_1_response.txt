## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying objects formed by connected pixels of the value '1' in the input grid and recoloring them to the value '3' in the output grid.  All other values in the grid remain unchanged.

**Here's a breakdown of the transformation logic:**

1. **Object Detection:** Identify groups of connected '1' pixels, treating them as distinct objects. 
2. **Recoloring:** Change the value of all pixels within these detected objects to '3'.
3. **Preservation:** Maintain all other pixel values from the input grid in the output grid.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Version 1: Using `objects` and `recolor` **

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  recolored_objs = frozenset(recolor(THREE, obj) for obj in objs if color(obj) == ONE)
  O = paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, False)`:** Detects objects in the input grid 'I'. The parameters specify that objects are formed by connected pixels of the same value (`univalued=True`), connectivity is defined only horizontally and vertically (`diagonal=False`), and the background is not excluded (`without_bg=False`).
2. **`recolor(THREE, obj)`:**  Iterates through each detected object `obj` where `color(obj) == ONE` and creates a new object with its color changed to '3'.
3. **`paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))`:** Merges all the recolored objects and paints them onto a copy of the input grid 'I', resulting in the output grid 'O'.


**Version 2: Using `partition` and `recolor` **

```python
def solve(I):
    parts = partition(I)
    recolored = frozenset(recolor(THREE, part) for part in parts if color(part) == ONE)
    O = paint(I, merge(recolored))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`partition(I)`:** Partitions the input grid 'I' into objects where each object contains all cells of a specific color.
2. **`recolor(THREE, part)`:** Iterates through each partition `part` where `color(part) == ONE` and creates a new object with its color changed to '3'.
3. **`paint(I, merge(recolored))`:** Merges all the recolored objects and paints them onto a copy of the input grid 'I', resulting in the output grid 'O'.


**Version 3: Using nested loops and conditional replacement**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(ZERO, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == ONE:
        O = fill(O, THREE, {(i,j)})
      else:
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(ZERO, (h, w))`:** Creates an empty output grid 'O' of the same dimensions as the input grid 'I'.
2. **Nested Loops:** Iterates through each cell (i, j) of the input grid 'I'.
3. **Conditional Replacement:**  If the cell value in 'I' is '1', it fills the corresponding cell in 'O' with '3'. Otherwise, it copies the cell value from 'I' to 'O'.


**Version 4: Using `replace` function**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = replace(I, ONE, THREE)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`replace(I, ONE, THREE)`:**  Directly replaces all occurrences of '1' in the input grid 'I' with '3', creating the output grid 'O'.


**Version 5: Using list comprehension**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = tuple(tuple(THREE if v == ONE else v for v in row) for row in I)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **List Comprehension:** Uses nested list comprehension to iterate over each cell value 'v' in each row of the input grid 'I'. If 'v' is '1', it replaces it with '3'; otherwise, it keeps the original value. This creates the output grid 'O'.

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the same transformation using the provided DSL. Each version leverages different functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
