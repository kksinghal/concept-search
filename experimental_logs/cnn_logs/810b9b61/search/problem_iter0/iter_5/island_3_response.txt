## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces all occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid with the digit '3' in the output grid. All other digits and their positions remain unchanged. 

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_22eb0ac0(I):
    O = replace(I, 1, 3) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly utilizes the `replace` function from the DSL. It takes the input grid `I`, identifies all instances of the value '1', and replaces them with the value '3', effectively achieving the desired transformation.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_22eb0ac0(I):
    objs = partition(I)
    filtered_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1)
    recolored_objs = apply(rbind(recolor, 3), filtered_objs)
    O = paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version first identifies all objects in the input grid `I` using `partition`. It then filters these objects to select only those with color '1' using `colorfilter`.  The selected objects are then recolored to '3' using `recolor`. Finally, the recolored objects are painted back onto the input grid to generate the output grid `O`.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_22eb0ac0(I):
    indices_to_replace = ofcolor(I, 1)
    O = fill(I, 3, indices_to_replace)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version first identifies the indices of all cells in the input grid `I` that have the value '1' using `ofcolor`.  It then uses the `fill` function to replace the values at these indices with '3', generating the output grid `O`.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_22eb0ac0(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] == 1:
                O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`. If a cell contains the value '1', it uses the `fill` function to replace that specific cell with '3' in the output grid `O`.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_22eb0ac0(I):
    obj = asobject(I)
    filtered_obj = sfilter(obj, lambda x: x[0] == 1)
    recolored_obj = apply(lambda x: (3, x[1]), filtered_obj)
    O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolored_obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version first converts the input grid `I` into an object representation using `asobject`. It then filters this object to keep only cells with color '1'.  The filtered cells are then individually recolored to '3'.  Finally, a new canvas of the same size as the input grid is created, and the recolored object is painted onto it, generating the output grid `O`.
