## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the input grid and changing their color to 3. An object is defined as a group of connected cells with the same value, excluding the background color (most frequent color).

**Input_0 to Output_0:** All objects in the input grid have their color changed to 3 in the output grid.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Only the largest object in the input grid has its color changed to 3 in the output grid.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** Similar to Input_0, all objects in the input grid have their color changed to 3 in the output grid.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Identify all objects in the grid
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), objs) # Recolor all objects to 3
  painted_grid = paint(I, merge(recolored_objs)) # Paint the recolored objects back onto the grid
  return painted_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` extracts all objects from the input grid (`I`) by considering connected cells with the same value, excluding the background color.
2.  **Recolor objects:** `apply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), objs)` applies the `recolor` function to each object in `objs`, changing their color to 3.
3.  **Paint objects:** `paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))` merges all the recolored objects and paints them onto a copy of the input grid, resulting in the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(3, merge(objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version condenses the previous logic into a single line by chaining functions:

1.  **Identify and merge objects:** `merge(objects(I, True, False, True))` extracts all objects and merges them into a single set of cells.
2.  **Recolor merged object:** `recolor(3, ...)` recolors the merged object to 3.
3.  **Paint object:** `paint(I, ...)` paints the recolored object onto a copy of the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  return fill(I, 3, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, loc) != mostcommon(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a different approach:

1.  **Get all indices:** `asindices(I)` retrieves all cell indices in the grid.
2.  **Filter for non-background cells:** `mfilter(...)` keeps only indices where the cell value is not the background color (`mostcommon(I)`).
3.  **Fill with target color:** `fill(I, 3, ...)` fills the cells at the filtered indices with color 3.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  filtered_grid = tuple(tuple(3 if v != mostcommon(I) else v for v in r) for r in I)
  return filtered_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through the grid directly:

1.  **Iterate and recolor:** It iterates through each row and cell, replacing the value with 3 if it doesn't match the background color (`mostcommon(I)`), effectively recoloring all objects.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  return apply(lambda row: tuple(3 if v != mostcommon(I) else v for v in row), I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes `apply` for concise code:

1.  **Apply recoloring function:** It applies a lambda function to each row of the grid. This function replaces the cell value with 3 if it's not the background color, effectively recoloring all objects.

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformation. Each leverages different DSL functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
