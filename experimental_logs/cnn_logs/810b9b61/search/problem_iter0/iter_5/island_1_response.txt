## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve recoloring all objects in the input grid that have a color value of 1 to a color value of 3. 

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** All occurrences of digit '1' are replaced with digit '3'.
**Input_1 to Output_1:**  All occurrences of digit '1' are replaced with digit '3'.
**Input_2 to Output_2:** All occurrences of digit '1' are replaced with digit '3'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, False)  # Extract all objects from the grid
  modified_objs = frozenset({recolor(3, obj) if color(obj) == 1 else obj for obj in objs})  # Recolor objects with color 1 to color 3
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), modified_objs)  # Paint the modified objects onto a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, False, False, False)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid `I`. 
2. **`modified_objs = frozenset({...})`:**  Iterates through each object (`obj`) in the extracted objects. If the `color(obj)` is 1, it recolors the object to 3 using `recolor(3, obj)`. Otherwise, it keeps the object as is.
3. **`paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), modified_objs)`:**  Creates a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input grid and paints the modified objects onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = replace(I, 1, 3) # Directly replaces 1 with 3 in the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`replace(I, 1, 3)`:** This function directly replaces all occurrences of '1' with '3' in the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices_to_change = ofcolor(I, 1)  # Get indices of cells with color 1
  O = fill(I, 3, indices_to_change) # Fill those indices with color 3
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`:**  Identifies and returns the indices of all cells in the grid `I` that have the color value 1.
2. **`fill(I, 3, indices_to_change)`:** Fills the cells at the identified indices with the color value 3, effectively replacing all '1's with '3's. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I # Create a copy of input grid
    h, w = shape(I) # Get height and width of input
    for i in range(h):
      for j in range(w):
        if O[i][j] == 1: # Check if cell value is 1
          O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j)}) # Fill the cell with color 3 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`**: Creates a copy of the input grid `I` to avoid modifying the original.
2. **`h, w = shape(I)`**: Extracts the height and width of the input grid `I` to define the iteration range.
3. **`for i in range(h): ...`**: Iterates through each cell of the grid.
4. **`if O[i][j] == 1: ...`**: If the cell value at the current index (i, j) is 1, it proceeds to fill the cell with 3.
5. **`O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j)})`**:  Uses the `fill` function to replace the value at the current index (i, j) with 3. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    change_color = lambda x: 3 if x == 1 else x # Define a function to change color 
    O = apply(lambda row: tuple(apply(change_color, row)), I) # Apply the function to each cell
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`change_color = lambda x: 3 if x == 1 else x`**: This defines an anonymous function (`lambda`) that takes a single argument `x` (representing a cell value). If `x` is 1, it returns 3; otherwise, it returns the original value `x`.
2. **`O = apply(lambda row: ..., I)`**: This part applies a transformation to each row of the input grid `I` using the `apply` function.
3. **`tuple(apply(change_color, row))`**: For each row, it applies the `change_color` function to each cell within that row using another `apply` function. This ensures that every single cell in the grid is processed by the `change_color` function.

These five program versions offer different approaches to achieve the same transformation in the DSL.
