## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to all input grids is the same:

**Transformation Logic:** All occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid are replaced with the digit '3' in the output grid.  All other digits remain unchanged.

## Program Version 1

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = replace(I, ONE, THREE)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`solve(I)`:** This line defines the main function `solve` that takes the input grid `I` as an argument.
2. **`O = replace(I, ONE, THREE)`:** This line calls the `replace` function, which substitutes all occurrences of the value `ONE` (which is 1) in the input grid `I` with the value `THREE` (which is 3), and assigns the result to the output grid `O`.
3. **`return O`:** This line returns the transformed grid `O`.


## Program Version 2

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = partition(I)
  filtered_objs = colorfilter(objs, ONE)
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj), filtered_objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`solve(I)`:** This line defines the main function `solve` that takes the input grid `I` as an argument.
2. **`objs = partition(I)`:** This line partitions the input grid `I` into objects based on cell values, assigning the result to the `objs` variable.
3. **`filtered_objs = colorfilter(objs, ONE)`:** This line filters the `objs` set to keep only objects with the color `ONE` (which is 1), assigning the result to `filtered_objs`.
4. **`recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj), filtered_objs)`:** This line applies a lambda function to each object in `filtered_objs`. The lambda function uses `recolor` to change the color of each object to `THREE` (which is 3), assigning the result to `recolored_objs`.
5. **`O = paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))`:** This line merges all the recolored objects from `recolored_objs` and paints them onto a copy of the input grid `I`, assigning the result to the output grid `O`.
6. **`return O`:** This line returns the transformed grid `O`.

## Program Version 3

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  O = fill(I, THREE, indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`solve(I)`:** This line defines the main function `solve` that takes the input grid `I` as an argument.
2. **`indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)`:**  This line identifies the indices of all cells in the input grid `I` that have the color `ONE` (which is 1), assigning the result to the `indices` variable.
3. **`O = fill(I, THREE, indices)`:** This line calls the `fill` function to replace the values at the specified `indices` in the input grid `I` with the value `THREE` (which is 3), assigning the result to the output grid `O`.
4. **`return O`:** This line returns the transformed grid `O`.


## Program Version 4

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == ONE:
        O = fill(O, THREE, {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`solve(I)`:**  This line defines the main function `solve` that takes the input grid `I` as an argument.
2. **`O = I`:** This line initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
3. **`for i in range(len(I))`:** This line starts a loop that iterates through each row index `i` of the input grid.
4. **`for j in range(len(I[0]))`:** This line starts a nested loop that iterates through each column index `j` of the current row.
5. **`if I[i][j] == ONE`:** This line checks if the value at the current cell `(i, j)` in the input grid `I` is equal to `ONE` (which is 1).
6. **`O = fill(O, THREE, {(i,j)})`:** If the condition in the previous line is true, this line calls the `fill` function to replace the value at the current index `(i, j)` in the output grid `O` with the value `THREE` (which is 3).
7. **`return O`:**  This line returns the transformed grid `O`.

## Program Version 5

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def recolor_one(value, index):
    return (THREE, index) if value == ONE else (value, index)
  O = asobject(I)
  O = frozenset(recolor_one(v, i) for v, i in O)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), O)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`solve(I)`:**  This line defines the main function `solve` that takes the input grid `I` as an argument.
2. **`def recolor_one(value, index)`:** This line defines a helper function `recolor_one` that takes a value and its index as input. It returns `(THREE, index)` if the value is `ONE`, otherwise it returns `(value, index)`.
3. **`O = asobject(I)`:** This line converts the input grid `I` into an object representation `O` using the function `asobject`.
4. **`O = frozenset(recolor_one(v, i) for v, i in O)`:** This line iterates through each value `v` and its index `i` in the object `O` and applies the `recolor_one` function. The result is converted back into a frozenset and assigned back to `O`.
5. **`O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), O)`:**  This line creates a new canvas filled with `ZERO` (which is 0) with the same dimensions as the input grid `I` and then paints the transformed object `O` onto it. The result is assigned back to `O`.
6. **`return O`:** This line returns the transformed grid `O`.
