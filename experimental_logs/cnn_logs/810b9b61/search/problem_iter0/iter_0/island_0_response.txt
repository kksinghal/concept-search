## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying objects within the input grid and recoloring them based on a specific condition. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:** All objects formed by the digit '1' are recolored to '3'.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**  Similar to the previous transformation, objects formed by '1' are recolored to '3'.  The position and shape of objects remain unchanged.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**  Again, objects formed by '1' are identified and recolored to '3'. The transformation affects all occurrences of '1' objects.

## Code Generation:

Based on the analysis, the core logic is to identify objects formed by the digit '1' and recolor them to '3'.  We can achieve this in various ways using the DSL functions. Below are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated":

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_007(I):
    # Identify all objects in the grid
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T) 
    # Recolor objects formed by '1' to '3'
    recolored_objs = frozenset({recolor(THREE, obj) if color(obj) == ONE else obj for obj in objs})  
    # Paint the recolored objects onto a blank canvas 
    O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs)) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`**: Identifies all connected objects in the input grid (`I`).
2. **`recolor(THREE, obj) if color(obj) == ONE else obj`**:  Iterates through each object. If the object's color is '1', it's recolored to '3'; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
3. **`paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))`**: Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input and paints the recolored objects onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_007(I):
    # Directly recolor '1' to '3' in the input grid
    O = replace(I, ONE, THREE)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`replace(I, ONE, THREE)`**:  This approach simplifies the process by directly replacing all occurrences of '1' with '3' in the input grid. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_007(I):
    # Identify indices of cells containing '1'
    indices_to_recolor = ofcolor(I, ONE)
    # Fill those indices with '3'
    O = fill(I, THREE, indices_to_recolor)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`ofcolor(I, ONE)`**: Finds the indices of all cells in the grid containing the value '1'.
2. **`fill(I, THREE, indices_to_recolor)`**: Fills the cells at the identified indices with the value '3'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_007(I):
    # Create a function to check if a cell value is '1'
    is_one = matcher(identity, ONE)
    # Apply recoloring based on cell value
    O = apply(lambda row: tuple(THREE if is_one(v) else v for v in row), I)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`matcher(identity, ONE)`**: Creates a function `is_one` that checks if a given value is equal to '1'.
2. **`lambda row: tuple(THREE if is_one(v) else v for v in row)`**:  A lambda function that iterates through each row of the grid and recolors cells containing '1' to '3'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_007(I):
    # Partition the grid into objects
    objs = partition(I) 
    # Filter objects to find those with color '1'
    target_objs = colorfilter(objs, ONE) 
    # Recolor the target objects to '3'
    recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj), target_objs)  
    # Paint the recolored objects onto a blank canvas
    O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))  
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`partition(I)`**: Divides the input grid into objects based on connected components of the same color.
2. **`colorfilter(objs, ONE)`**: Extracts objects that have the color '1'.
3. **`recolor(THREE, obj)`**:  Recolors the extracted objects to have the color '3'.
4.  **`paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))`**: Creates a blank canvas and paints the recolored objects onto it.


Each of these program versions provides a distinct approach to achieving the required transformation by leveraging different combinations of DSL functions.
