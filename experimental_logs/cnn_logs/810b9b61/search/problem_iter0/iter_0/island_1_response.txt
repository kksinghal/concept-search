## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation replaces all occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid with the digit '3' in the output grid. All other digits and their positions remain unchanged.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = replace(I, 1, 3)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly uses the `replace` function from the DSL. It takes the input grid `I`, replaces all occurrences of '1' with '3', and returns the modified grid `O`.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = partition(I)
  filtered_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1)
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), filtered_objs)
  covered_grid = cover(I, merge(filtered_objs))
  O = paint(covered_grid, merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version first partitions the input grid `I` into objects based on color using `partition`. Then, it filters for objects with color '1' using `colorfilter`. It recolors these objects to '3' using `recolor` and `apply`. Finally, it covers the original '1' objects in the input grid using `cover` and `merge` and paints the recolored objects onto the covered grid using `paint` and `merge`.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  indices_to_change = ofcolor(I, 1)
  O = fill(I, 3, indices_to_change)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version first identifies the indices of all cells with color '1' using `ofcolor`. Then, it uses the `fill` function to change the color of those indices to '3' in the input grid `I` and returns the modified grid `O`.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) == 1:
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through every cell of the input grid `I`. If the cell's value is '1', it uses the `fill` function to change the color of that cell to '3' in the output grid `O`.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  condition = lambda x: x == 1
  change_function = lambda x: 3 if condition(x) else x
  O = tuple(tuple(change_function(v) for v in r) for r in I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a `condition` function to check if a cell's value is '1' and a `change_function` to change the cell value to '3' if the condition is met. It then uses nested list comprehensions to apply the `change_function` to every cell in the input grid `I` and returns the modified grid `O`.
