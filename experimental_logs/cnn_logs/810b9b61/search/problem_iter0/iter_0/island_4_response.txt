## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring all objects in the input grid except the object with the most common color (which appears to be the background). The recoloring uses the value '3'. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- All objects formed by digits '1', '6' are recolored to '3'.
- The background object formed by digit '0' remains unchanged.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The object formed by digit '1' is recolored to '3'.
- The background object formed by digit '0' remains unchanged.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- The object formed by digit '1' is recolored to '3'.
- The background object formed by digit '0' remains unchanged.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" in the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  recolored = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj), objs)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(recolored))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, False, False, True)` finds all distinct objects in the input grid `I`, excluding the background.
2. **Recolor Objects:** `recolor(THREE, obj)` changes the color of each object `obj` to '3'. `mapply` applies this recoloring to all objects found in the previous step.
3. **Create Canvas:** `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` generates a blank canvas with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid.
4. **Paint Objects:** `paint` draws the recolored objects onto the canvas.
5. **Return Output:** The function returns the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = tuple(tuple(THREE if v != bg else v for v in r) for r in I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Background Color:** `mostcolor(I)` determines the most frequent color in the input grid, representing the background.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:** The code iterates through each cell in the grid. If the cell value is not the background color, it's replaced with '3'. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.
3. **Return Output:** The function returns the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  recolored_objs = frozenset(recolor(THREE, obj) for obj in objs if color(obj) != mostcolor(I))
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Partition Objects:** `fgpartition(I)` divides the input grid into objects based on cell values, excluding the background.
2. **Recolor Non-Background Objects:**  The code iterates through the objects and recolors those that don't have the background color to '3'.
3. **Create Canvas and Paint:** Similar to Version 1, it creates a blank canvas and paints the recolored objects onto it.
4. **Return Output:** The function returns the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = apply(lambda r: tuple(THREE if v != bg else v for v in r), I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Background Color:** Similar to Version 2.
2. **Apply Recoloring to Rows:** This version utilizes `apply` to apply a lambda function to each row of the input grid. The lambda function replaces non-background cell values with '3'.
3. **Return Output:** The function returns the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  indices = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, mostcolor(I)))
  O = fill(I, THREE, indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Non-Background Indices:** `asindices(I)` gets all cell indices, and `ofcolor(I, mostcolor(I))` gets indices of background cells. `difference` finds indices that are not background.
2. **Fill with New Color:** `fill(I, THREE, indices)` fills the identified non-background indices with the value '3'.
3. **Return Output:** The function returns the modified grid `O`.


Each of these program versions provides a different approach to achieving the desired transformation while using only the functions provided in the DSL.
