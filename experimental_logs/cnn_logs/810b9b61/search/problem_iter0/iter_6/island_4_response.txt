## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring all non-background objects in the input grid except for the object with the least common color. The recoloring uses the color '3'.

**Input 0:** All objects formed by '1' are recolored to '3' except for the single cell object with '1' at the bottom center. 

**Input 1:**  Similar to Input 0, all objects formed by '1' are recolored to '3', leaving the small '1' objects unchanged.

**Input 2:** The large object formed by '1' is recolored to '3', while the smaller '1' object remains unchanged.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  least_common_obj = argmin(objs, lambda obj: colorcount(I, color(obj)))
  recolored_objs = frozenset(
      recolor(3, obj) if obj != least_common_obj else obj
      for obj in objs
  )
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, True, False, True)`:**  Extract all non-background objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **`least_common_obj = argmin(objs, lambda obj: colorcount(I, color(obj)))`:**  Find the object with the least common color.
3. **`recolored_objs = ...`:** Iterate through each object and recolor it to '3' if it's not the least common object, otherwise keep it unchanged.
4. **`O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))`:** Create a canvas filled with the background color and paint the recolored objects onto it. 


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  non_bg_indices = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, bg))
  color_counts = {c: colorcount(I, c) for c in palette(I) if c != bg}
  least_common_color = min(color_counts, key=color_counts.get)
  colored_indices = frozenset(
      idx for idx in non_bg_indices if I[idx[0]][idx[1]] != least_common_color
  )
  O = fill(I, 3, colored_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:** Identify the background color.
2. **`non_bg_indices = ...`:** Get indices of all cells that are not background.
3. **`color_counts = ...`:** Create a dictionary storing the count of each non-background color.
4. **`least_common_color = ...`:**  Find the least common color based on the counts.
5. **`colored_indices = ...`:** Get indices of non-background cells that don't have the least common color.
6. **`O = fill(I, 3, colored_indices)`:** Fill the identified indices with '3' on the input grid.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  non_bg_cells = frozenset(
      (I[i][j], (i, j)) 
      for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0])) 
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I)
  )
  color_counts = {c: sum(1 for v, _ in non_bg_cells if v == c) for c in palette(I)}
  least_common_color = min(color_counts, key=color_counts.get)
  recolored_cells = frozenset(
      (3, idx) if v != least_common_color else (v, idx)
      for v, idx in non_bg_cells
  )
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolored_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`non_bg_cells = ...`:**  Create a set of tuples containing the color and index of each non-background cell.
2. **`color_counts = ...`:**  Count occurrences of each color within the non-background cells.
3. **`least_common_color = ...`:** Find the least common color from the counts.
4. **`recolored_cells = ...`:** Create a new set of cells where non-least common colors are replaced with '3'.
5. **`O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolored_cells)`:**  Paint the recolored cells onto a blank canvas filled with the background color.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = partition(I)
  color_counts = {color(obj): len(obj) for obj in objs if color(obj) != mostcolor(I)}
  least_common_color = min(color_counts, key=color_counts.get)
  recolored_objs = frozenset(
      recolor(3, obj) if color(obj) != least_common_color else obj
      for obj in objs
  )
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = partition(I)`:** Divide the input grid into objects based on cell color.
2. **`color_counts = ...`:** Calculate the size (number of cells) for each non-background object.
3. **`least_common_color = ...`:**  Determine the color of the smallest object. 
4. **`recolored_objs = ...`:**  Recolor all objects except the one with the least common color to '3'.
5. **`O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))`:**  Paint the recolored objects onto a canvas filled with the background color.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  non_bg_objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  color_counts = {color(obj): len(obj) for obj in non_bg_objs}
  least_common_color = min(color_counts, key=color_counts.get)
  O = paint(
      canvas(bg, shape(I)), 
      merge(
          recolor(3, obj) if color(obj) != least_common_color else obj
          for obj in non_bg_objs
      )
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:**  Determine the background color.
2. **`non_bg_objs = objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Extract all non-background objects.
3. **`color_counts = ...`:**  Count the number of cells in each non-background object.
4. **`least_common_color = ...`:**  Identify the color of the smallest object.
5. **`O = paint(..., ...)`:** Paint the recolored objects onto a canvas filled with the background color. Objects with the least common color are left unchanged.
