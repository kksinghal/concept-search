## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying objects formed by the digit '1' in the input grid and recoloring them to the digit '3' in the output grid. All other digits and their positions remain unchanged. 

Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** All occurrences of '1' are replaced with '3'. Notice the shape and relative positions of the objects formed by '1' remain the same.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:** Similar to the previous example, only the '1' digits are replaced by '3', maintaining the structure of the objects.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**  Again, we observe the consistent replacement of '1' with '3', leaving other grid elements untouched.


## Code Generation:

Based on the analysis, we can create multiple versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL functions. Here are five distinct versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)  # Extract objects formed by same-valued cells
  filtered_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1) # Filter objects with color 1
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), filtered_objs)  # Recolor filtered objects to 3
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolored_objs)  # Paint recolored objects on a blank canvas
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, True, False, False)`: Extracts objects from the input grid (`I`) where objects are formed by connected cells with the same value (univalued = True). 
2. `colorfilter(objs, 1)`: Filters the extracted objects, keeping only those with color value '1'.
3. `apply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), filtered_objs)`: Applies the `recolor` function to each filtered object, changing their color to '3'.
4. `paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolored_objs)`: Creates a blank canvas with the same dimensions and background color as the input, then paints the recolored objects onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)  # Get indices of cells with color 1
  O = fill(I, 3, target_indices)  # Fill those indices with color 3
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `ofcolor(I, 1)`: Directly identifies and returns the indices of all cells in the input grid containing the value '1'.
2. `fill(I, 3, target_indices)`: Modifies the input grid by replacing the values at the identified indices with the value '3'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = replace(I, 1, 3)  # Directly replace all occurrences of 1 with 3
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

1. `replace(I, 1, 3)`: This function directly iterates through the input grid and replaces all instances of the value '1' with the value '3', effectively achieving the desired transformation in a single step.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_condition(cell): return cell[0] == 1  # Condition: cell color is 1
  recolored_grid = apply(lambda row: tuple(3 if recolor_condition((v, (0, 0))) else v for v in row), I) # Apply recoloring row-wise
  O = recolored_grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `recolor_condition(cell)`: Defines a condition function that checks if a cell's value is '1'.
2.  The code iterates through each row of the input grid (`I`) and applies a lambda function to each row. This lambda function further iterates through each value (`v`) in the row and applies the `recolor_condition` to determine if the value should be replaced with '3'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  condition = lambda v: v == 1  # Condition: cell value is 1
  new_grid = tuple(tuple(3 if condition(v) else v for v in row) for row in I)  # Apply condition to each cell
  O = new_grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `condition(v)`:  Defines a lambda function to check if a cell value is equal to '1'.
2.  The code uses nested list comprehensions to iterate through each cell of the input grid.  For each cell value (`v`), it applies the `condition` and replaces the value with '3' if the condition is true, otherwise, it retains the original value. 


Each of these program versions demonstrates a different approach to achieving the same transformation using the provided DSL, showcasing the flexibility and diverse problem-solving capabilities within the given constraints.
