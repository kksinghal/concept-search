## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying objects formed by a specific digit ('1' in this case) and recoloring them to another digit ('3'). Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 
- All objects formed by '1' are recolored to '3'.
- The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- Same as above, only objects formed by '1' are recolored.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- Again, only objects formed by '1' are targeted and recolored.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Identify all objects in the grid
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  # Filter objects containing only the digit '1'
  target_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE)
  # Recolor the filtered objects to '3'
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj), target_objs)
  # Combine the recolored objects with the original grid
  O = paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, T, T)` finds all objects in the grid.
2. **Filter by Color:** `sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE)` selects objects consisting only of the digit '1'.
3. **Recolor:** `apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj), target_objs)` applies the `recolor` function to each filtered object, changing '1' to '3'.
4. **Combine with Grid:** `paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))` paints the recolored objects onto the original grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Create a blank canvas of the same size as the input
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  # Iterate over each cell in the input grid
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      # If the cell contains '1', change it to '3'
      if I[i][j] == ONE:
        O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j)})
      # Otherwise, keep the original value
      else:
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))` creates a blank grid of the same dimensions as the input.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:** The program iterates through each cell. If the cell value is '1', it fills the corresponding cell in the output grid with '3'. Otherwise, it keeps the original value.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find indices of all cells containing '1'
  target_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Fill those indices with '3' in the input grid
  O = fill(I, THREE, target_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Indices:** `ofcolor(I, ONE)` directly identifies the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **Fill:** `fill(I, THREE, target_indices)` replaces the values at those indices with '3'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Define a lambda function to recolor cells
  recolor_cell = lambda v: THREE if v == ONE else v
  # Apply the function to each row of the input grid
  O = tuple(tuple(map(recolor_cell, row)) for row in I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Recolor Function:** A lambda function `recolor_cell` is defined to recolor a single cell based on its value.
2. **Apply to Rows:** The `map` function applies `recolor_cell` to each element in every row of the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Get the shape of the input grid
  h, w = shape(I)
  # Use list comprehension to iterate and recolor
  O = tuple(tuple(THREE if I[i][j] == ONE else I[i][j] for j in range(w)) for i in range(h))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Shape:** `shape(I)` obtains the height and width of the input grid.
2. **List Comprehension:**  Nested list comprehension efficiently iterates through all cells and recolors those containing '1' while keeping other values unchanged.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same goal, showcasing the flexibility and diversity of the provided DSL. Each version successfully identifies and recolors objects formed by '1' to '3', effectively transforming the input grid to the desired output.
