## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring all objects in the input grid to the color **3**. 

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** All objects formed by the digits '1' are recolored to '3'. The background (digit '0') remains unchanged.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:** Same as above. All '1' digit objects are recolored to '3', with the '0' background remaining unchanged.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**  Again, the transformation holds. All objects formed by the digit '1' are recolored to '3', while the '0' background remains the same.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions utilizing the provided DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = partition(I)  # Partition the grid into individual objects
  recolored_objs = apply(rbind(recolor, 3), objs)  # Recolor each object to value 3
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))  # Paint the recolored objects onto a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`partition(I)`:** This function divides the input grid `I` into individual objects based on connected pixels of the same value.
2. **`apply(rbind(recolor, 3), objs)`:** This applies the `recolor` function to each object in `objs`. `rbind(recolor, 3)` creates a new function that fixes the second argument of `recolor` to 3, effectively recoloring all objects to the value 3. 
3. **`paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))`:** This paints the recolored objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid. `canvas(0, shape(I))` creates a grid filled with 0s (representing the background) with the same dimensions as the input grid. `merge(recolored_objs)` combines all the recolored objects into a single set.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Initialize output as input
  for v in palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}:  # Iterate over colors except background
    O = replace(O, v, 3)  # Replace each non-background color with 3
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** The output grid `O` is initialized as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **`for v in palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}:`:** This loop iterates through each color present in the input grid `I`, excluding the most common color, which is assumed to be the background.
3. **`O = replace(O, v, 3)`:**  This line replaces all occurrences of the current color `v` in the output grid `O` with the color `3`. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    colored_indices = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, mostcommon(I))) # Get indices of non-background cells
    recolored_obj = recolor(3, colored_indices) # Recolor all non-background cells to 3
    O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolored_obj) # Paint on a blank canvas
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`colored_indices = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, mostcommon(I)))`:**  This finds the indices of all cells that don't belong to the background. It first gets all indices in the grid and then removes the indices corresponding to the most common color (background).
2. **`recolored_obj = recolor(3, colored_indices)`:** This creates a new object by recoloring all the indices obtained in the previous step to the color 3. 
3. **`O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolored_obj)`:** Similar to version 1, this paints the recolored object onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(3 if cell != mostcommon(I) else cell for cell in row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested list comprehensions for a more concise approach. It iterates over each cell in the input grid and replaces its value with 3 if it's not the background color, otherwise keeping the original value. 


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I) # Partition the grid into objects, excluding background
    recolored_objs = map(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), objs) # Recolor each object to 3
    O = paint(I, set.union(*recolored_objs)) # Paint the recolored objects back onto the original grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:** This function partitions the input grid into objects, excluding the background.
2. **`recolored_objs = map(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), objs)`:** This applies the `recolor` function to each object, changing their color to 3.
3. **`O = paint(I, set.union(*recolored_objs))`:** This paints the recolored objects back onto the original input grid, effectively replacing the original objects with their recolored versions.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation goal within the provided DSL. They highlight the flexibility and expressive power of the DSL for spatial reasoning tasks.
