## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves replacing all occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid with the digit '3' in the output grid. All other digits and their positions remain unchanged.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = replace(I, 1, 3)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly utilizes the `replace` function from the DSL. It takes the input grid `I`, identifies all occurrences of the value '1', and replaces them with the value '3'. This effectively implements the observed transformation.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, False)
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj) if color(obj) == 1 else obj, objs)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), recolored_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version first identifies all objects in the input grid `I` using the `objects` function.  Then, for each object, if its color (determined by the `color` function) is '1', it is recolored to '3' using the `recolor` function. Finally, the modified objects are painted onto a blank canvas (created with the `canvas` function) using the `paint` function. This approach achieves the desired transformation while demonstrating a more complex object-based approach.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices_to_replace = ofcolor(I, 1)
  O = fill(I, 3, indices_to_replace)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version first identifies the indices of all cells containing the value '1' using the `ofcolor` function. It then utilizes the `fill` function to replace the values at these indices with '3' in the input grid 'I'.  The result is a grid where all '1's have been replaced by '3's.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = tuple(tuple(3 if I[i][j] == 1 else I[i][j] for j in range(w)) for i in range(h))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each cell of the input grid 'I' and constructs a new grid 'O'. For each cell, if its value is '1', it is replaced by '3' in the output grid. Otherwise, the original value is retained. This direct approach achieves the transformation without relying on higher-level DSL functions.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = apply(lambda row: tuple(3 if v == 1 else v for v in row), I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses the `apply` function to process the input grid 'I' row by row.  For each row, it uses a lambda function to iterate through the values. If a value is '1', it is replaced by '3'.  Otherwise, the original value is retained. This approach offers a concise way to perform the transformation using functional programming concepts within the DSL.
