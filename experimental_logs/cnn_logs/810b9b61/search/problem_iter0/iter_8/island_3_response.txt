## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring all objects consisting entirely of the digit "1" to the digit "3" while leaving all other digits and their configurations untouched. 

**Example:**

* **Input:** An object formed by the digit "2" remains as "2".
* **Input:** An object formed by a combination of "1" and "2" remains unchanged.
* **Input:** An object formed solely by the digit "1" is recolored to an object formed solely by the digit "3".

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = partition(I) # Partition grid into individual objects.
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: palette(obj) == {1}) # Filter objects consisting solely of '1'.
  recolored_objs = apply(rbind(recolor, 3), filtered_objs) # Recolor filtered objects to '3'.
  O = paint(I, merge(recolored_objs)) # Paint recolored objects onto the original grid.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition:** Divide the input grid into individual objects based on connected components of the same digit.
2. **Filter:** Select only those objects whose color palette consists solely of the digit '1'.
3. **Recolor:** Change the color of the filtered objects from '1' to '3'.
4. **Paint:** Overlay the recolored objects onto the original input grid, preserving the positions and colors of other elements.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I) # Partition the grid into objects, excluding background.
  recolored_objs = [recolor(3, obj) if all(v == 1 for v, _ in obj) else obj for obj in objs] # Recolor if all cells are 1.
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs)) # Paint onto a new canvas with the original background.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Foreground Partition:** Similar to Version 1, but excludes the background color from object formation.
2. **Conditional Recoloring:** Iterate through each object, recoloring to '3' only if all its cells have the value '1'.
3. **Canvas Reconstruction:** Create a blank canvas with the same dimensions and background color as the input, then paint the (potentially recolored) objects onto it.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  condition = lambda obj: numcolors(obj) == 1 and color(obj) == 1 # Define condition for objects with only color '1'.
  changed_indices = mfilter(partition(I), lambda obj: toindices(obj) if condition(obj) else set()) # Get indices of objects to change.
  O = fill(I, 3, changed_indices) # Fill '3' at the identified indices.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Condition Definition:**  Establish a clear condition that identifies objects consisting solely of the digit '1'.
2. **Index Extraction:**  Filter objects based on the defined condition and extract their indices on the grid.
3. **Direct Fill:**  Instead of recoloring and painting, directly fill the value '3' at the extracted indices on the original grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1) # Get indices of all cells with the value '1'.
  potential_objects = objects(I, True, False, False) # Find all single-color objects.
  target_objects = sfilter(potential_objects, lambda obj: toindices(obj).issubset(ones)) # Select objects entirely within '1' indices.
  recolored_grid = paint(I, merge(apply(rbind(recolor, 3), target_objects))) # Recolor and paint target objects.
  return recolored_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Ones Identification:** Identify all indices on the grid occupied by the digit '1'.
2. **Object Segmentation:** Find all contiguous single-color objects within the grid.
3. **Target Selection:**  Filter objects to retain only those that fall entirely within the previously identified '1' indices.
4. **Recoloring and Painting:** Recolor the target objects to '3' and paint them onto the original grid. 

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  threes = mfilter(partition(I), lambda obj: toindices(obj) if len(palette(obj)) == 1 and first(obj)[0] == 1 else set()) # Extract indices of objects with only color '1' and store as 'threes'
  O = fill(I, 3, threes)  # Fill '3' at the indices stored in 'threes'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Threes Identification:** Identify the indices of objects that are composed solely of the color '1' and store these indices as 'threes'.
2. **Direct Fill:** Directly fill the value '3' at the indices stored in 'threes' on the original grid.

These five programs offer distinct approaches to the same transformation problem, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version leverages different combinations of functions, illustrating the diverse paths possible within the DSL to achieve the desired outcome.
