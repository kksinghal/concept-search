## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces the color '1' with the color '3' across all input grids. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** All occurrences of '1' in the input grid are replaced with '3' in the output grid.

**Pair 1:** Similar to Pair 0, every instance of '1' is changed to '3'.

**Pair 2:**  Again, all '1's in the input grid are transformed into '3's in the output grid.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return replace(I, 1, 3) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages the `replace` function directly. It takes the input grid `I`, finds all instances of the value '1', and substitutes them with the value '3', achieving the desired color replacement.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1)
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), target_objs)
  painted_grid = I
  for obj in recolored_objs:
    painted_grid = paint(painted_grid, obj)
  return painted_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version identifies all objects in the input grid `I` using `objects`. It filters these objects to find those with color '1' using `colorfilter`.  It then iterates through these target objects, recolors them to '3' using `recolor`, and paints them back onto the grid using `paint`, effectively replacing '1' with '3'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices_to_replace = ofcolor(I, 1)
  return fill(I, 3, indices_to_replace)
```

**Explanation:**

This version first identifies the indices of all cells with color '1' in the input grid 'I' using the `ofcolor` function. Then, it uses the `fill` function to replace the values at those specific indices with '3', achieving the color replacement.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  painted_grid = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i,j)) == 1:
        painted_grid = fill(painted_grid, 3, {(i, j)})
  return painted_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates over each cell in the input grid `I`. If the cell's color is '1', it uses `fill` to replace that specific cell with the color '3'. This iterative approach achieves the desired transformation.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return switch(switch(I, 1, 2), 2, 3)
```

**Explanation:**

This version cleverly uses the `switch` function twice. First, it switches all occurrences of '1' to a temporary color '2'. Then, it switches all occurrences of '2' to the target color '3'.  This two-step switching effectively replaces all '1's with '3's in the input grid 'I'.
