## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring all objects formed by the digit '1' to the digit '3', while leaving all other digits and their arrangements unchanged.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**  All occurrences of '1' are replaced with '3'. 
**Input_1 to Output_1:**  Similar to Input_0, '1' is replaced by '3'.
**Input_2 to Output_2:**  Same pattern as above, demonstrating consistency across varying input grids.

## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Version 1 (Inspired by Program_A's object filtering and Program_B's conciseness):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(ZERO, shape(I)),
      merge(
          frozenset(
              {
                  recolor(THREE, obj) if color(obj) == ONE else obj
                  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T)
              }
          )
      ),
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`, including diagonal connections and excluding the background.
2. **`recolor(THREE, obj) if color(obj) == ONE else obj`:** Iterates through each object, recoloring those formed by '1' to '3' and leaving others unchanged.
3. **`frozenset{...}`:** Creates a new set of objects with the recolored objects.
4. **`merge(...)`:**  Combines all objects into a single set.
5. **`paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), ...)`:** Paints the merged objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input, effectively replacing all '1's with '3's.

**Version 2 (Using `apply` for recoloring):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(ZERO, shape(I)),
      merge(
          apply(
              lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj) if color(obj) == ONE else obj,
              objects(I, T, T, T),
          )
      ),
  )
```

**Explanation:** This version is very similar to Version 1, but instead of using a set comprehension for recoloring, it utilizes the `apply` function for a more functional approach.

**Version 3 (Direct recoloring without object extraction):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(THREE if v == ONE else v for v in row) for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:** This version simplifies the process by directly iterating through the grid cells and replacing '1' with '3' without explicitly extracting objects.

**Version 4 (Leveraging `replace` function for direct substitution):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return replace(I, ONE, THREE)
```

**Explanation:** This version uses the specialized `replace` function for a more direct and efficient color substitution.

**Version 5 (Utilizing `cellwise` for conditional replacement):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return cellwise(I, canvas(ONE, shape(I)), THREE) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(ONE, shape(I))`:** Creates a grid of the same size as input `I` filled with '1's.
2. **`cellwise(I, ..., THREE)`:** Compares the input grid with the '1's grid. If the values match (i.e., a cell in the input grid contains '1'), it replaces it with '3'. Otherwise, it retains the original value from the input grid.

Each of these versions achieves the desired transformation by identifying and recoloring objects or directly replacing the target color in different ways, showcasing the versatility of the provided DSL.
