## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring all objects in the grid to the value '3', except for the object that contains the bottom-right corner cell. 

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 - Output_0:** The object at the bottom-right corner (containing the cell (14,14)) remains unchanged, while all other objects are recolored to '3'.
* **Input_1 - Output_1:**  Similarly, the bottom-right corner object (containing (14,14)) is preserved, and all other objects are recolored to '3'.
* **Input_2 - Output_2:** The object containing the cell (8,8) at the bottom-right remains unchanged. All other objects are recolored to '3'.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" in the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Extract all objects from the grid
  corner_index = (height(I) - 1, width(I) - 1) # Determine the index of the bottom-right corner
  corner_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: corner_index in toindices(obj)) # Find the object containing the bottom-right corner
  other_objs = difference(objs, {corner_obj}) # Get all objects except the corner object
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj), other_objs) # Recolor other objects to 3
  return paint(I, merge(recolored_objs)) # Paint the recolored objects back onto the grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts all objects from the input grid `I`. `T, F, T`  specifies that objects should be univalued, not consider diagonal connections, and exclude the background.
2. **Identify Corner Object:**  `corner_index` stores the bottom-right corner's index.  `extract` finds the object containing this corner index.
3. **Isolate Other Objects:**  `difference` creates a set of objects excluding the `corner_obj`.
4. **Recolor:**  `apply` applies the `recolor` function to each object in `other_objs`, changing their color to '3'.
5. **Paint and Return:** `paint` draws the recolored objects onto the original grid, effectively replacing the original objects with their recolored versions.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  corner_color = I[-1][-1] # Directly access the color of the bottom-right corner
  return tuple(tuple(THREE if (v != corner_color) else v for v in row) for row in I) # Recolor based on corner color
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Corner Color:**  Directly access the color of the bottom-right corner cell using `I[-1][-1]`.
2. **Conditional Recoloring:** Iterate through each cell in the grid. If a cell's color doesn't match the `corner_color`, recolor it to '3'; otherwise, keep its original color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = partition(I) # Partition the grid into objects based on color
  corner_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: lrcorner(obj) == (height(I)-1, width(I)-1)) # Find the corner object
  return paint(canvas(THREE, shape(I)), corner_obj)  # Create a canvas filled with '3' and paint the corner object on top 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition Grid:**  `partition(I)` divides the grid into objects where all cells with the same color belong to the same object.
2. **Locate Corner Object:**  `extract` finds the object whose lower-right corner (`lrcorner`) matches the grid's bottom-right corner.
3. **Canvas and Paint:**  `canvas(THREE, shape(I))` creates a new grid filled entirely with '3'.  The `corner_obj` is then painted onto this canvas, preserving its original color and position.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(replace(I, I[-1][-1], THREE), I[-1][-1], toindices(objects(I,T,F,T)[-1])) # Replace all occurrences of the corner color with 3, then refill the corner object
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Replace Corner Color:** `replace(I, I[-1][-1], THREE)` replaces all instances of the corner color in the grid with '3'.
2. **Refill Corner Object:** `fill(..., I[-1][-1], ...)` refills the area covered by the corner object with its original color, effectively undoing the replacement in the corner object.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  return tuple(tuple(THREE if (i, j) not in toindices(objects(I,T,F,T)[-1]) else I[i][j] for j in range(w)) for i in range(h))  # Iterate and recolor based on object membership
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Grid Dimensions:**  `h, w = len(I), len(I[0])` retrieves the height and width of the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:** The code iterates through each cell in the grid. If a cell's index is not part of the corner object's indices (`toindices(objects(I,T,F,T)[-1])`), it's recolored to '3'; otherwise, its original color is preserved. 


These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation. Each leverages different DSL functions and logic, highlighting the flexibility of the provided DSL for solving this spatial reasoning task.
