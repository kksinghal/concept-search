## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring all occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid to the digit '3' in the output grid, while preserving all other digits. 

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 to Output_0:** All instances of '1' are replaced with '3', while the positions and values of '0' remain unchanged.
* **Input_1 to Output_1:**  The same logic applies - '1' becomes '3', and '0' remains the same.
* **Input_2 to Output_2:** Identical transformation -  replace all '1' with '3', keep other digits unchanged.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = replace(I, ONE, THREE)
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version leverages the `replace` function from the DSL. It directly substitutes all occurrences of the value `ONE` (which represents the digit '1') with the value `THREE` (representing '3') within the input grid `I`, producing the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = tuple(tuple(THREE if v == ONE else v for v in r) for r in I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version utilizes nested list comprehensions. It iterates through each row `r` and each value `v` within the input grid `I`.  If the value `v` equals `ONE`, it's replaced with `THREE`; otherwise, it's left unchanged. This modified structure is then converted back into a tuple of tuples, forming the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = asobject(I)
  recolored = frozenset(((THREE if v == ONE else v), i) for v, i in objs)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), recolored)
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version utilizes a more object-oriented approach:
1. It converts the input grid `I` into an object representation using `asobject`.
2. It then iterates through each (value, index) pair in the object, replacing values of `ONE` with `THREE`.
3. Finally, it creates an empty canvas using `canvas` and paints the recolored object onto it with `paint`, producing the output grid `O`. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices_one = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  O = fill(I, THREE, indices_one)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**  This version focuses on identifying the indices of the target value:
1. It uses `ofcolor` to find all indices where the value is `ONE`.
2. It then employs the `fill` function to replace the values at these specific indices in the input grid `I` with `THREE`, generating the output grid `O`. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v == ONE:
        O = paint(O, {(THREE, (i,j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version iterates directly over the grid and modifies it using `paint`:
1. It creates a copy of the input grid `I` as `O`.
2. It then iterates through each cell, and if the cell value is `ONE`, it uses `paint` to directly modify the corresponding cell in `O` to `THREE`.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to solving the problem using the provided DSL. Each leverages different functions and logic, demonstrating the flexibility of the DSL and the variety of solutions possible.
