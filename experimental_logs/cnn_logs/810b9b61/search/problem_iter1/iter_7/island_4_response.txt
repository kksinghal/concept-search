## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** All objects formed by the digit '1' have their color changed to '3', except for the object at the bottom right corner, which remains unchanged.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** All objects formed by the digit '1' have their color changed to '3', except for the object at the bottom center, which remains unchanged.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**  All objects formed by the digit '1' have their color changed to '3'. This input-output pair serves as a baseline for the recoloring transformation. 


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, True, False)
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1 and lrcorner(obj) != (len(I)-1, len(I[0])-1))
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), filtered_objs)
  O = I
  for obj in recolored_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, True, False)` identifies all objects in the grid `I`, considering diagonally connected cells and including the background.
2. **Filter Objects:** `sfilter(...)` keeps only objects with color '1' and whose lower right corner is not at the bottom right corner of the grid.
3. **Recolor Objects:** `apply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), filtered_objs)` recolors the filtered objects to have the color '3'.
4. **Paint Objects:** The code iterates through the `recolored_objs` and paints them onto a copy of the input grid `O`, effectively changing the color of the desired objects.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, T, F)
    target_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE and lrcorner(obj) == (len(I)-1, len(I[0])-1))
    recolored_objs = frozenset({recolor(THREE, obj) if obj != target_obj else obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == ONE})
    O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, T, F)` identifies all objects in the grid `I`, considering diagonally connected cells and including the background.
2. **Find Target Object:** `extract(...)` finds the object with color '1' located at the bottom right corner of the grid. This object will not be recolored.
3. **Recolor Other Objects:** A set comprehension is used to recolor all objects with color '1' except for the `target_obj`.
4. **Paint Objects:** `paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), ...)` paints the recolored objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, True, False)
  bottom_right = (len(I) - 1, len(I[0]) - 1)
  recolored_objs = frozenset(
      recolor(3, obj) if (color(obj) == 1 and lrcorner(obj) != bottom_right) else obj
      for obj in objs
  )
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, True, False)` identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Calculate Bottom Right:** `bottom_right` stores the indices of the bottom right corner.
3. **Recolor Objects:** A set comprehension recolors objects that meet two conditions: their color is '1', and their lower right corner is not the `bottom_right`.
4. **Paint Objects:**  The recolored objects are then painted onto a blank canvas of the same dimensions as the input grid.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, F)
  condition = lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE and not (lrcorner(obj)[0] == len(I) - 1 and lrcorner(obj)[1] == len(I[0]) - 1)
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj) if condition(obj) else obj, objs)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Similar to previous versions, it identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Define Condition:** A lambda function `condition` checks if an object is color '1' and not located at the bottom right corner.
3. **Recolor Objects:** `apply(...)` applies a lambda function that recolors objects based on the `condition`. 
4. **Paint Objects:** The recolored objects are painted onto a blank canvas.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bottom_right_obj = toobject((len(I)-1, len(I[0])-1), I)
  objs_to_recolor = sfilter(objects(I, T, T, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE and obj != bottom_right_obj)
  recolored_grid = I
  for obj in objs_to_recolor:
    recolored_grid = paint(recolored_grid, recolor(THREE, obj))
  return recolored_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Bottom Right Object:** `toobject((len(I)-1, len(I[0])-1), I)` identifies the object at the bottom right corner.
2. **Filter Objects to Recolor:** `sfilter(...)` finds objects with color '1' that are not the `bottom_right_obj`.
3. **Iterative Recoloring:** The code iterates through `objs_to_recolor` and recolors each to '3' directly on a copy of the input grid.

These five program versions demonstrate diverse ways of achieving the desired transformation using different DSL function combinations and logic. Each version offers a unique approach to identifying, filtering, and recoloring objects within the grid while preserving the object at the bottom right corner.
