## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation recolors objects with the value '1' to the value '3' while leaving other objects unchanged. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:** All objects with value '1' are recolored to '3'. The background and the object with value '11' remain unchanged. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the previous transformation, only objects with value '1' are recolored to '3'.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**  Again, only objects with value '1' are recolored to '3', leaving the object with value '11' intact. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1: Using 'objects' and 'apply'**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_condition(obj):
    return color(obj) == ONE
  
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj) if recolor_condition(obj) else obj, objects(I, T, T, T))
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`recolor_condition(obj)`:** This helper function checks if the color of an object is '1'.
2. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid 'I'.
3. **`apply(...)`:** Applies a lambda function to each object. The lambda function recolors the object to '3' if its color is '1' (using `recolor_condition`), otherwise, it keeps the object unchanged. 
4. **`paint(canvas(...), merge(...))`:** Paints the recolored objects onto a blank canvas with the same shape as the input grid.


**Version 2:  Using 'sfilter' and 'apply'**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_objs = sfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE)
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj), target_objs)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid 'I'.
2. **`sfilter(...)`:** Filters the objects, keeping only those where the object's color is '1'.
3. **`apply(...)`:** Applies a lambda function to each filtered object, recoloring it to '3'.
4. **`paint(canvas(...), merge(...))`:**  Paints the recolored objects onto a blank canvas with the same shape as the input grid.


**Version 3: Iterative Recoloring**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == ONE:
        O = paint(O, {(THREE, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid 'O' as a copy of the input grid 'I'.
2. **Iterates through each cell:** The nested loops iterate through every cell of the input grid.
3. **Conditional Recoloring:** If the cell value is '1', it recolors that specific cell in the output grid 'O' to '3' using `paint`.

**Version 4:  Using 'replace'**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = replace(I, ONE, THREE)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`replace(I, ONE, THREE)`:** This function directly replaces all occurrences of '1' in the input grid 'I' with '3' and returns the modified grid as the output 'O'.

**Version 5: Using 'cellwise'**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = cellwise(I, canvas(ONE, shape(I)), THREE)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(ONE, shape(I))`:** Creates a canvas with the same shape as the input grid 'I', filled with the value '1'.
2. **`cellwise(I, canvas(...), THREE)`:**  Performs a cell-by-cell comparison between the input grid and the created canvas. If the values match (both are '1'), the corresponding cell in the output grid 'O' is set to '3'; otherwise, it retains the original value from the input grid.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, providing diverse solutions within the DSL.
