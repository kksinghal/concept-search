## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by connected pixels of the same color in the input grid and then changing the color of some of these objects to the color '3' in the output grid. Let's break down the specific logic for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** All objects formed by the digit '1' that are not connected to the border of the grid are recolored to '3'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  Only the object formed by the digit '1' at the top of the grid is recolored to '3'. 

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The two objects formed by the digit '1' that are on the left side of the grid are left unchanged, while the object on the right side is recolored to '3'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL functions:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Identify all objects in the grid
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I)) # Filter objects that are not bordering
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj), filtered_objs) # Recolor the filtered objects
  O = I
  for obj in recolored_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj) # Paint the recolored objects onto the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all connected regions of the same color in the input grid `I`, treating it as a single-colored object and excluding background.
2. **Filter Objects:** `sfilter(objs, lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I))` filters the objects, keeping only those not touching the grid border.
3. **Recolor Objects:** `apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj), filtered_objs)` recolors the filtered objects to the value '3'.
4. **Paint Objects:** The code iterates through the recolored objects and paints them onto a copy of the input grid `O`. 

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T) # Identify all objects in the grid
  top_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: uppermost(obj) < 2) # Extracts the object closest to the top
  O = fill(I, THREE, toindices(top_obj)) # Recolors the extracted object to 3
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all connected regions of the same color in the input grid `I`, treating it as a single-colored object and excluding background.
2. **Find Top Object:** `extract(objs, lambda obj: uppermost(obj) < 2)`  finds the object with its uppermost row index less than 2 (effectively the topmost object).
3. **Recolor Top Object:** `fill(I, THREE, toindices(top_obj))` recolors the entire area covered by the top object to '3' in the input grid `I`. 

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T) # Identify all objects in the grid
  right_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: rightmost(obj) > width(I) // 2 ) # Extracts the object on the right side
  O = fill(I, THREE, toindices(right_obj)) # Recolors the extracted object to 3
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all connected regions of the same color in the input grid `I`, treating it as a single-colored object and excluding background.
2. **Find Right Object:** `extract(objs, lambda obj: rightmost(obj) > width(I) // 2 )` finds the object whose rightmost point's column index is greater than half the grid width, essentially targeting the object on the right side.
3. **Recolor Right Object:** `fill(I, THREE, toindices(right_obj))` recolors the entire area covered by the right object to '3' in the input grid `I`. 

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T) # Identify all objects in the grid
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: centerofmass(obj)[1] > width(I) // 2) # Filters the objects on the right half
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj), filtered_objs)  # Recolor the filtered objects
  O = I
  for obj in recolored_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj) # Paint the recolored objects onto the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Filter Right Objects:** `sfilter(objs, lambda obj: centerofmass(obj)[1] > width(I) // 2)` filters objects, keeping only those whose center of mass is on the right half of the grid.
3. **Recolor Objects:** `apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj), filtered_objs)` recolors the filtered objects to '3'.
4. **Paint Objects:**  Iterates through the recolored objects and paints them onto a copy of the input grid `O`.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T) # Identify all objects in the grid
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: all(index(I, loc) != mostcommon(I) for loc in outbox(obj))) # Filters objects surrounded by same color
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj), filtered_objs)  # Recolor the filtered objects
  O = I
  for obj in recolored_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj) # Paint the recolored objects onto the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Filter Enclosed Objects:** `sfilter(objs, lambda obj: all(index(I, loc) != mostcommon(I) for loc in outbox(obj)))` filters for objects where all cells in their 'outbox' (area directly surrounding them) have a color different from the most common color in the grid. This essentially identifies objects fully enclosed by another color.
3. **Recolor Objects:** `apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj), filtered_objs)` recolors the filtered objects to '3'.
4. **Paint Objects:** Iterates through the recolored objects and paints them onto a copy of the input grid `O`. 

These five programs offer different approaches to achieve the desired transformation, demonstrating a range of logic and function combinations within the provided DSL.
