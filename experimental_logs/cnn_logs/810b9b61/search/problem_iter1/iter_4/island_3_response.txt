## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves replacing all occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid with the digit '3' in the output grid. All other digits and their positions remain unchanged.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return replace(I, ONE, THREE)
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages the `replace` function from the DSL. It directly substitutes all instances of `ONE` (which represents the digit '1') with `THREE` (representing the digit '3') in the input grid `I`. 


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    O = paint(O, recolor(THREE, ofcolor(I, ONE)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a loop iterating through the rows of the input grid `I`. For each row, it identifies the indices of all cells containing `ONE` using `ofcolor`. It then recolors those indices to `THREE` using `recolor` and paints the changes onto a copy of the input grid `O` using `paint`.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=False)
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, ONE)
  result = I
  for obj in target_objs:
    result = paint(result, recolor(THREE, toindices(obj)))
  return result
```

**Explanation:**

This version first extracts all objects from the input grid `I` using `objects`. It then filters these objects to keep only those containing the color `ONE` using `colorfilter`. Finally, it iterates through the filtered objects and recolors them to `THREE` before painting them back onto a copy of the input grid.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, canvas(THREE, shape(I)), I) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version cleverly uses the `cellwise` function. It creates a canvas of the same size as the input grid `I`, filled entirely with `THREE`. The `cellwise` function then compares the input grid with this canvas. If the values match, it keeps the input value (which would be '3' from the canvas). If they don't match, it keeps the original input value. Since the canvas is all '3's, only the '1's in the input grid will be replaced. 


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == ONE:
        O = paint(O, {(THREE, (i,j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`. If the cell value is `ONE`, it paints a single-cell object with the color `THREE` at that location on a copy of the input grid `O`. This effectively replaces all '1's with '3's.
