## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring specific objects within the input grid while preserving the position and shape of all other objects. 

* **Objects formed by the digit '1' are recolored to the digit '3'.** 
* **All other objects retain their original color.**

This applies to all input-output pairs.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  recolored_objs = frozenset({recolor(THREE, obj) if color(obj) == ONE else obj for obj in objs})
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objs = objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all distinct objects within the input grid `I`.
2. **Selective Recoloring:** `recolored_objs = frozenset({recolor(THREE, obj) if color(obj) == ONE else obj for obj in objs})` iterates through each object. If the object's color is '1', it's recolored to '3' using `recolor(THREE, obj)`. Otherwise, the object remains unchanged.
3. **Painting on Canvas:** A blank canvas of the same size as the input grid is created using `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`. The recolored objects are then painted onto this canvas using `paint` and `merge`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I,(i,j)) == ONE:
        O = fill(O, THREE, {(i,j)})
      else:
        O = fill(O, index(I,(i,j)), {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** Initializes an empty canvas `O` of the same dimensions as input `I`.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid. If a cell contains '1', it fills the corresponding cell in the output canvas with '3'. Otherwise, it copies the original cell value.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = replace(I, ONE, THREE)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Replacement:** This version utilizes the `replace` function to directly substitute all occurrences of '1' in the input grid `I` with '3', generating the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
  def recolor_condition(cell):
    return cell[0] == ONE

  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  target_objs = sfilter(objs, recolor_condition)
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj), target_objs)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Recoloring Condition:** Defines a function `recolor_condition` to identify cells with the value '1'.
2. **Filter Target Objects:** Uses `sfilter` to extract objects containing cells that satisfy the `recolor_condition`.
3. **Apply Recoloring:** Applies the `recolor` function to each target object, changing their color to '3'.
4. **Paint and Return:**  Paints the recolored objects onto a blank canvas and returns the result.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
  def recolor_object(obj):
    return recolor(THREE, obj) if color(obj) == ONE else obj
  
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  recolored_objs = apply(recolor_object, objs)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Recolor Function:** Defines a function `recolor_object` to recolor an object to '3' if its color is '1', otherwise keeping the original color.
2. **Apply to Objects:** Uses `apply` to apply `recolor_object` to each object in the input.
3. **Paint and Combine:** Paints the resulting objects onto a new canvas and returns the final grid.

Each of these program versions effectively implements the same transformation logic using different combinations of DSL functions, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
