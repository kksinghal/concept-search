## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring all objects in the input grid that are not the background color. The target color for recoloring is consistently 3. 

**Example Breakdown:**

- **Input_0, Output_0:** All objects formed by digits '1' are recolored to '3'. The background color '0' remains unchanged.
- **Input_1, Output_1:** The object formed by digits '1' is recolored to '3'. Background '0' is preserved.
- **Input_2, Output_2:** The object formed by digits '1' is recolored to '3'. Background '0' is preserved.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def recolor_non_background(I):
    return paint(canvas(3, shape(I)), asobject(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shape(I)`:**  Determines the height and width of the input grid `I`.
2. **`canvas(3, shape(I))`:** Creates a new grid of the same size as `I` filled entirely with the color '3'.
3. **`asobject(I)`:** Converts the input grid `I` into an object representation, preserving color and location information.
4. **`paint(canvas(...), asobject(...))`:**  Paints the object representation of `I` onto the canvas filled with '3'.  This effectively overwrites the '3's on the canvas with the original colors from `I` except for the background, which remains '3'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def recolor_non_background(I):
  return fill(I, 3, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, loc) != mostcommon(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mostcommon(I)`:** Identifies the background color in the grid `I` (the most frequent color).
2. **`asindices(I)`:**  Creates a set of all cell indices within the grid `I`.
3. **`lambda loc: index(I, loc) != mostcommon(I)`:** Defines a lambda function to check if the color at a given location `loc` is different from the background color.
4. **`mfilter(asindices(I), lambda ...)`:** Filters the indices, keeping only those where the cell color is not the background color.
5. **`fill(I, 3, mfilter(...))`:** Fills the input grid `I` with color '3' at the filtered indices (non-background cells).

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def recolor_non_background(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True) # Get all non-background objects
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, recolor(3, obj)) # Recolor each object to color 3 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, False, False, True)`:** Extracts all non-background objects from the input grid `I`, considering connected cells with potentially different colors.
2. **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterates through each identified object.
3. **`recolor(3, obj)`:**  Changes the color of the current object `obj` to '3'.
4. **`paint(O, recolor(...))`:**  Paints the recolored object onto a copy of the input grid (`O`). 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def recolor_non_background(I):
  non_background_indices = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, mostcommon(I)))
  return paint(I, recolor(3, non_background_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mostcommon(I)`:** Determines the background color of the grid.
2. **`ofcolor(I, mostcommon(I))`:** Retrieves the indices of all cells with the background color.
3. **`asindices(I)`:** Gets the indices of all cells in the grid.
4. **`difference(..., ...)`:** Calculates the set difference, resulting in indices of non-background cells.
5. **`recolor(3, ...)`:** Recolors the patch represented by the non-background indices to '3', essentially creating an object with color '3' at those locations.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the recolored object onto the input grid, effectively recoloring the non-background cells.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def recolor_non_background(I):
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if value != mostcommon(I):
                I = paint(I, {(3, (i, j))})
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`for i, row in enumerate(I)`:** Iterates through each row (`i` is the row index, `row` is the row content).
2. **`for j, value in enumerate(row)`:** Iterates through each cell in the current row (`j` is the column index, `value` is the cell color).
3. **`if value != mostcommon(I)`:** Checks if the current cell's color is not the background color.
4. **`paint(I, {(3, (i, j))})`:** If the cell is not background, it paints a single-cell object with color '3' at the cell's location (`(i, j)`) onto the grid `I`.
