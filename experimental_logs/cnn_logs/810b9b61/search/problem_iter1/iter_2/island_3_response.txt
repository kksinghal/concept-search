## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces all occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid with the digit '3' in the output grid, while preserving all other digits and their positions.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return replace(I, 1, 3)
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly utilizes the `replace` function from the DSL. It takes the input grid `I` and replaces all instances of the value `1` with the value `3`, achieving the desired transformation in a single step.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=True, without_bg=False)
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1)
  result = I
  for obj in target_objs:
    result = paint(result, recolor(3, toindices(obj)))
  return result
```

**Explanation:**

This version identifies all objects in the input grid `I`, then filters for objects with the color `1`. It iterates through these objects and repaints them with the color `3` on the input grid, effectively replacing all '1's with '3's.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(3 if v == 1 else v for v in r) for r in I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested list comprehensions to iterate through each cell in the input grid `I`. If the cell value `v` is equal to `1`, it replaces it with `3`, otherwise, it retains the original value.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  return fill(I, 3, indices)
```

**Explanation:**

This version first identifies all indices in the input grid `I` where the value is `1` using `ofcolor`. Then, it utilizes the `fill` function to replace the values at these indices with `3`.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  f = lambda x: 3 if x == 1 else x
  return apply(lambda row: tuple(apply(f, row)), I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a lambda function `f` that replaces the value `1` with `3` and keeps other values unchanged. It then utilizes nested `apply` functions to apply this transformation to each cell in the input grid `I`, effectively replacing all '1's with '3's.
