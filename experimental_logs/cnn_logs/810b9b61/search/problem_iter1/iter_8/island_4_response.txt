## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves selectively recoloring objects composed of the digit '1' to the digit '3' while leaving other objects and the background unchanged. The key is to identify and exclude a specific '1' object from the recoloring process. 

**Across all input-output pairs:**

- The object formed by the digit '1' in the bottom right corner of the grid is always excluded from recoloring. 

**Example:**

In **Input_0**, the '1' object at the bottom right corner (spanning rows 12-14 and columns 10-13) remains unchanged in **Output_0**. All other '1' objects are recolored to '3'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  bottom_right_corner = (len(I) - 1, len(I[0]) - 1)
  objs = objects(I, T, T, F)
  recolored_objs = frozenset(
      recolor(THREE, obj) if color(obj) == ONE and lrcorner(obj) != bottom_right_corner else obj
      for obj in objs
  )
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Bottom Right Corner:** Determine the index of the bottom right corner of the grid.
2. **Extract Objects:**  Identify all connected objects in the grid using `objects`.
3. **Selective Recoloring:** Iterate through each object and recolor it to '3' if it meets the following conditions:
    - The object's color is '1'.
    - The object's lower-right corner does not coincide with the grid's bottom right corner.
4. **Paint Objects:** Paint the recolored objects onto a blank canvas of the same dimensions as the input.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  objs = objects(I, T, T, F)
  recolored_objs = frozenset(
      recolor(THREE, obj) if color(obj) == ONE and (h-1, w-1) not in toindices(obj) else obj
      for obj in objs
  )
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Grid Dimensions:** Obtain the height and width of the grid.
2. **Extract Objects:** Identify all connected objects in the grid.
3. **Selective Recoloring:**  Iterate through each object and recolor it to '3' if:
    - The object's color is '1'.
    - The grid's bottom right corner index is not present in the object's indices.
4. **Paint Objects:** Paint the recolored objects onto a blank canvas.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, F)
  bottom_right_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: (len(I)-1, len(I[0])-1) in toindices(obj))
  recolored_objs = frozenset(
    recolor(THREE, obj) if color(obj) == ONE and obj != bottom_right_obj else obj
    for obj in objs
  )
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify all connected objects in the grid.
2. **Identify Bottom Right Object:**  Find the specific object that contains the grid's bottom right corner index.
3. **Selective Recoloring:**  Iterate through each object and recolor it to '3' if:
    - The object's color is '1'.
    - The object is not the identified bottom right object.
4. **Paint Objects:**  Paint the recolored objects onto a blank canvas.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  recolored_grid = I
  objs = objects(I, T, T, F)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == ONE and lrcorner(obj) != (len(I) - 1, len(I[0]) - 1):
      recolored_grid = paint(recolored_grid, recolor(THREE, obj)) 
  return recolored_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output Grid:** Start with the input grid as the base for recoloring.
2. **Extract Objects:** Identify all connected objects in the grid.
3. **Iterate and Recolor:** For each object:
    - If the object's color is '1' and its lower-right corner is not the grid's bottom right corner, recolor the object to '3' and paint it directly onto the output grid.
4. **Return Modified Grid:**  Return the modified grid, which now has the selected objects recolored.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, F)
  bottom_right_indices = {(len(I) - 1, len(I[0]) - 1)}
  recolored_objs = frozenset(
      recolor(THREE, obj) if color(obj) == ONE and not intersection(toindices(obj), bottom_right_indices) else obj
      for obj in objs
  )
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify all connected objects in the grid.
2. **Define Bottom Right Indices:** Create a set containing the index of the bottom right corner.
3. **Selective Recoloring:** Iterate through each object and recolor it to '3' if:
    - The object's color is '1'.
    - There is no intersection between the object's indices and the bottom right indices set.
4. **Paint Objects:** Paint the recolored objects onto a blank canvas.
