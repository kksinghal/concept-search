## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves selectively recoloring digits in the input grid based on their value. Here's a breakdown:

* **Digit 1:** Remains unchanged.
* **Digit other than 1:**  Recolored to 3.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(1 if v == 1 else 3 for v in r) for r in I)
```

**Explanation:** This version directly iterates through each cell in the grid. If the cell value is 1, it remains unchanged. Otherwise, it's replaced with 3.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return apply(lambda r: tuple(1 if v == 1 else 3 for v in r), I)
```

**Explanation:** This version utilizes the `apply` function to apply a lambda function to each row of the input grid. The lambda function performs the same logic as in version 1, replacing all digits other than 1 with 3.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  f = lambda v: 1 if v == 1 else 3
  return tuple(tuple(map(f, r)) for r in I)
```

**Explanation:** This version defines a separate function `f` that encapsulates the recoloring logic. It then uses nested loops and the `map` function to apply the `f` function to each cell in the grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(branch(v == 1, 1, 3) for v in r) for r in I)
```

**Explanation:** This version leverages the `branch` function to conditionally recolor cells. It iterates through each cell and checks if the value is equal to 1. If true, it retains the value as 1; otherwise, it sets it to 3.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return replace(replace(I, 0, 3), 2, 3)
```

**Explanation:** This version utilizes the `replace` function multiple times to achieve the desired recoloring. It first replaces all occurrences of 0 with 3, and then replaces all occurrences of 2 with 3. This effectively recolors all digits except 1 to 3.
