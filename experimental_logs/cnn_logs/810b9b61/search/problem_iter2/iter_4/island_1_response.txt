## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces all occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid with the digit '3' in the output grid, while preserving all other digits and their positions.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return replace(I, 1, 3) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages the `replace` function directly to substitute all instances of '1' with '3' in the input grid `I`.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)  # Find indices of all '1's.
  return fill(I, 3, ones_indices) # Fill those indices with '3'.
```

**Explanation:**

This version first identifies the indices of all cells containing '1' using `ofcolor`. Then, it utilizes the `fill` function to replace the values at those specific indices with '3'.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_cell(value, index): # Define a cell-wise recoloring function.
    return (3, index) if value == 1 else (value, index)
  return paint(I, mapply(recolor_cell, asobject(I))) # Apply & paint. 
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines an auxiliary function `recolor_cell` to handle the replacement logic for each cell. It converts the grid to an object using `asobject`, applies `recolor_cell` to each cell using `mapply`, and paints the resulting object back onto the grid.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            3 if v == 1 else v for v in row 
        ) for row in I
    )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested list comprehensions to iterate through each cell in the grid. If the cell value is '1', it's replaced with '3'; otherwise, it remains unchanged. 

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False) # Extract objects from the grid.
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), 
               merge(*((recolor(3, obj) if color(obj) == 1 else obj) for obj in objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version extracts objects from the input grid and then iterates over them. If an object's color is 1, it's recolored to 3. Finally, all objects are merged and painted onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.
