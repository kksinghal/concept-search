## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves swapping the colors of the most common object and the least common object (excluding the background color, 0) in the grid. 

**Example:**

* **Input_0:** Most common object is color 1, least common is color 3.
* **Output_0:**  Color 1 is replaced with 3, and color 3 is replaced with 1.

Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:

* **Input_0 -> Output_0:** 1 (most common) swaps with 3 (least common)
* **Input_1 -> Output_1:** 1 swaps with 3 
* **Input_2 -> Output_2:**  No change needed as the most and least common objects are already in their correct positions.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_b60334d2(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  bg = mostcolor(I) 
  color_counts = [(colorcount(I, color(obj)), color(obj)) for obj in objs]
  least_common = min(color_counts)[1]
  most_common = max(color_counts)[1]
  O = replace(I, least_common, most_common)
  O = replace(O, most_common, least_common)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` finds all objects (excluding background) in the grid.
2. **Find Background:** `bg = mostcolor(I)` determines the background color.
3. **Count Color Occurrences:**  `color_counts = [(colorcount(I, color(obj)), color(obj)) for obj in objs]` calculates the count of each color in the grid, excluding the background.
4. **Find Most and Least Common:** `least_common = min(color_counts)[1]` and `most_common = max(color_counts)[1]` extract the colors with the least and most occurrences.
5. **Swap Colors:** `O = replace(I, least_common, most_common)` and `O = replace(O, most_common, least_common)` perform the color swapping.
6. **Return:** The modified grid `O` is returned.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_b60334d2(I):
  def score(obj):
    return colorcount(I, color(obj))
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  least_common_obj = argmin(objs, score) 
  most_common_obj = argmax(objs, score)
  O = replace(I, color(least_common_obj), color(most_common_obj))
  O = replace(O, color(most_common_obj), color(least_common_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Score Function:**  A helper function `score(obj)` is defined to calculate the count of a given object's color in the grid.
2. **Find Objects:**  `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` retrieves all non-background objects.
3. **Find Objects with Min/Max Score:** `least_common_obj = argmin(objs, score)` and `most_common_obj = argmax(objs, score)`  find the objects with the least and most frequent colors respectively.
4. **Swap Colors:** `O = replace(I, color(least_common_obj), color(most_common_obj))` and `O = replace(O, color(most_common_obj), color(least_common_obj))` swaps the colors of the identified objects. 
5. **Return:** The transformed grid `O` is returned. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_b60334d2(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  obj_colors = apply(color, objs)
  least_common = leastcommon(obj_colors)
  most_common = mostcommon(obj_colors)
  O = replace(I, least_common, most_common)
  O = replace(O, most_common, least_common)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` finds all non-background objects.
2. **Get Object Colors:** `obj_colors = apply(color, objs)` creates a container with just the colors of the objects.
3. **Find Most/Least Common Colors:**  `least_common = leastcommon(obj_colors)` and `most_common = mostcommon(obj_colors)` efficiently determine the least and most frequent colors from the extracted color list.
4. **Perform Color Swap:**  The code then swaps the colors in the grid using `replace`.
5. **Return:** The modified grid `O` is returned.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_b60334d2(I):
  def count_occurrences(value):
    return colorcount(I, value)
  palette_without_bg = palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}
  least_common = min(palette_without_bg, key=count_occurrences)
  most_common = max(palette_without_bg, key=count_occurrences)
  O = replace(I, least_common, most_common)
  O = replace(O, most_common, least_common)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Helper Function:** `count_occurrences` counts the occurrences of a given color value in the grid.
2. **Extract Colors (Excluding Background):** `palette_without_bg = palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}` gets the set of unique colors in the grid, excluding the background.
3. **Find Most/Least Common:**  `min` and `max` functions with the custom `key=count_occurrences` efficiently find the colors with the minimum and maximum occurrences.
4. **Swap Colors:**  The code then swaps the most and least common colors in the grid. 
5. **Return:** The transformed grid `O` is returned. 


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_b60334d2(I):
  def score(value):
    return colorcount(I, value)
  color_counts = [(score(v), v) for v in palette(I) if v != mostcolor(I)]
  least_common = min(color_counts)[1]
  most_common = max(color_counts)[1]
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v == least_common:
        O = fill(O, most_common, {(i, j)})
      elif v == most_common:
        O = fill(O, least_common, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Helper Function:** `score` is defined to calculate the count of a specific color in the grid.
2. **Count Occurrences:** `color_counts = [(score(v), v) for v in palette(I) if v != mostcolor(I)]` generates a list of tuples containing (count, color) for each color in the grid, excluding the background.
3. **Identify Most/Least Common:** The `min` and `max` functions on `color_counts` determine the least and most common colors.
4. **Iterate and Replace:** The code iterates through each cell of the grid. If a cell's color matches `least_common`, it's replaced with `most_common` and vice-versa using the `fill` function.
5. **Return:** The modified grid `O` is returned. 

Each of these five versions provides a distinct approach to achieve the desired transformation while adhering to the provided DSL. They demonstrate different strategies for object identification, color counting, and color swapping, showcasing the flexibility and power of the DSL.
