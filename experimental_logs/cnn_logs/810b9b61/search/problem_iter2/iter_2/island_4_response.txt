## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to switch the colors 1 and 3 in the input grid, while leaving all other colors unchanged.

**Input_0 to Output_0:** All occurrences of digit '1' are replaced with '3' and all occurrences of '3' are replaced with '1'. The remaining digits and their positions remain unchanged.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the above transformation, digits '1' and '3' are switched. The background and the arrangement of digits remain the same.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**  This example confirms that only digits '1' and '3' are swapped, with the rest of the grid remaining identical.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  This version uses nested replace functions for a direct color swap.
  """
  O = replace(replace(I, ONE, THREE), THREE, ONE)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This program directly replaces all instances of '1' with '3' and then replaces all instances of '3' with '1', effectively swapping the two colors.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  This version iterates through each cell and applies the color swap.
  """
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(ZERO, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == ONE:
        O = fill(O, THREE, {(i,j)})
      elif I[i][j] == THREE:
        O = fill(O, ONE, {(i,j)})
      else:
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This program iterates through each cell of the input grid and creates a new output grid. If the cell value is '1', it places a '3' in the corresponding cell of the output grid, and vice versa.  Other values are copied directly.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  This version utilizes objects and color filtering for the swap.
  """
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  ones = colorfilter(objs, ONE)
  threes = colorfilter(objs, THREE)
  recolored_ones = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj), ones)
  recolored_threes = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(ONE, obj), threes)
  O = paint(paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), recolored_ones), recolored_threes)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This program identifies objects of color '1' and '3', recolors them to the opposite value, and then paints them onto a blank canvas to create the output.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  This version uses switch function for a concise swap.
  """
  O = switch(I, ONE, THREE)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This program directly utilizes the `switch` function to swap the colors '1' and '3' in the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  This version uses lambda function and apply for a functional approach.
  """
  swap_color = lambda v: THREE if v == ONE else (ONE if v == THREE else v)
  O = apply(lambda row: tuple(apply(swap_color, row)), I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This program defines a lambda function `swap_color` that performs the color swap logic for individual values. It then uses nested `apply` functions to apply this swap to each cell in the grid.


These five programs demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation using the provided DSL, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the language.
