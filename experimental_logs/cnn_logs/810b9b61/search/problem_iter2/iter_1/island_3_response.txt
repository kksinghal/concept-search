## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently swaps the colors '1' and '3' in the input grids. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**  All occurrences of '1' are replaced with '3', and vice versa.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the first example, '1's become '3's and '3's become '1's.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**  The color swap is applied here as well.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  """
  Swaps colors 1 and 3 in the input grid.
  """
  return replace(replace(I, 1, 3), 3, 1) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested `replace` functions. 
1. The inner `replace(I, 1, 3)` replaces all occurrences of '1' with '3' in the input grid `I`.
2. The outer `replace` then operates on the result of the inner `replace`, replacing all occurrences of '3' (which were originally '1's) with '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  """
  Swaps colors 1 and 3 in the input grid.
  """
  return switch(I, 1, 3)
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages the `switch` function, which directly swaps the values of two specified colors ('1' and '3' in this case) within the input grid. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  """
  Swaps colors 1 and 3 in the input grid.
  """
  objs = objects(I, False, False, False)
  swapped_objs = frozenset({recolor(1 if color(obj) == 3 else 3 if color(obj) == 1 else color(obj), obj) for obj in objs})
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(swapped_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses object-based manipulation:
1. It identifies all objects in the grid using `objects`.
2. For each object, it checks its color using `color`. If the color is '1', it recolors the object to '3', and vice versa. Other colors remain unchanged.
3. Finally, it paints the modified objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  """
  Swaps colors 1 and 3 in the input grid.
  """
  return cellwise(I, replace(replace(I, 1, 3), 3, 1), 0)
```

**Explanation:**

This version combines `cellwise` and `replace`:
1. It creates a modified grid by swapping '1' and '3' using nested `replace` functions, similar to Program Version 1.
2. Then, it uses `cellwise` to compare the original grid `I` with the modified grid. If the values at a specific cell match, the original value is kept. Otherwise, it defaults to '0'. Since '1' and '3' are swapped in the modified grid, this effectively swaps them in the output.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  """
  Swaps colors 1 and 3 in the input grid.
  """
  grid = tuple(tuple(3 if v == 1 else 1 if v == 3 else v for v in row) for row in I)
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly iterates through the input grid and modifies the values:
1. It uses nested tuple comprehensions to traverse each cell in the grid. 
2. For every cell, it checks if the value `v` is '1' or '3' and swaps them accordingly. Other values are left unchanged.
3. This modified grid is then returned as the output.
