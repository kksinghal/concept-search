## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently swaps the colors of the objects initially colored '1' and '3' in the input grids.

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
- The object initially formed by '1's now consists of '3's.
- The object initially formed by '3's now consists of '1's.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- Same color swap as in the previous example.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
- Same color swap as in the previous examples.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F) 
    ones = colorfilter(objs, ONE)
    threes = colorfilter(objs, THREE)
    recolored_ones = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj), ones)
    recolored_threes = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(ONE, obj), threes)
    O = paint(paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)),recolored_ones), recolored_threes)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify objects:** It identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Filter by color:** It separates the objects with color '1' and '3'.
3. **Recolor objects:** It recolors objects initially '1' to '3' and vice-versa.
4. **Paint on canvas:** It paints the recolored objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = replace(replace(I, ONE, EIGHT), THREE, ONE)
  O = replace(O, EIGHT, THREE)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Replace with temporary color:** Replace all occurrences of '1' with a temporary color '8'.
2. **Swap colors:** Replace all '3's with '1's.
3. **Replace temporary color:** Replace the temporary color '8' with '3's.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == ONE:
        O = fill(O, THREE, {(i,j)})
      elif I[i][j] == THREE:
        O = fill(O, ONE, {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through grid:** Loop through each cell in the grid.
2. **Swap colors:** If the cell is '1', change it to '3'. If it's '3', change it to '1'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = ofcolor(I, ONE)
    x2 = ofcolor(I, THREE)
    x3 = fill(I, ZERO, x1)
    x4 = fill(x3, ZERO, x2)
    x5 = fill(x4, THREE, x1)
    O = fill(x5, ONE, x2)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get indices of colors:** Find the indices of all '1's and '3's in the grid.
2. **Clear the colors:** Replace all '1's and then all '3's with '0's.
3. **Fill with swapped colors:** Fill the indices where '1's were with '3's and vice-versa.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    threes = objects(replace(I, ONE, ZERO), T, F, F)
    ones = objects(replace(I, THREE, ZERO), T, F, F)
    recolored_ones = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, obj), ones)
    recolored_threes = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(ONE, obj), threes)
    O = paint(paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)),recolored_ones), recolored_threes)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Isolate colors:** Create grids containing only '3's and only '1's by replacing the other color with '0's.
2. **Identify objects:** Extract the objects from the isolated color grids.
3. **Recolor and paint:**  Recolor the objects and paint them onto a blank canvas as in Version 1.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same color swapping transformation, showcasing the flexibility and diversity of the DSL.
