## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring all objects in the input grid that have a value of 1 to a value of 3. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 
- All occurrences of the digit '1' are replaced with the digit '3'. Other digits remain unchanged.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- Same as above, all '1' digits become '3' digits.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- Again, only the '1' digits are replaced with '3' digits.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:** (Using `objects` and list comprehension)

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False) # Extract objects from the grid.
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)),  # Create an empty canvas.
               merge(tuple(recolor(3, obj) if color(obj) == 1 else obj for obj in objs))) # Recolor and merge objects. 
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`objects(I, True, False, False)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid `I`. 
2. **`canvas(0, shape(I))`:** Creates an empty canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the value 0.
3. **`(recolor(3, obj) if color(obj) == 1 else obj for obj in objs)`:** Iterates through each extracted object. If the object's color (value) is 1, it recolors it to 3; otherwise, it keeps the object unchanged.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges all the modified (or unmodified) objects back together.
5. **`paint(...)`:** Paints the merged objects onto the empty canvas, creating the output grid.

**Version 2:** (Using `asobject` and cell-wise recoloring)

```python
def solve(I):
  def recolor_cell(cell):  # Define cell-wise recoloring function.
    value, index = cell
    return (3, index) if value == 1 else (value, index)
  return paint(I, mapply(recolor_cell, asobject(I)))  # Apply & paint.
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`asobject(I)`:** Converts the input grid `I` into an object representation, where each cell is represented as (value, (row, col)).
2. **`recolor_cell(cell)`:** Defines a function that takes a cell tuple (value, (row, col)) and returns a new tuple with the value changed to 3 if the original value was 1.
3. **`mapply(recolor_cell, asobject(I))`:** Applies the `recolor_cell` function to every cell in the object representation of the grid.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the recoloured cells onto the input grid `I` to generate the output grid.

**Version 3:** (Using nested loops and conditional recoloring)

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])  # Get grid dimensions.
  O = canvas(0, (h, w)) # Create an empty canvas.
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        O = paint(O, {(3, (i, j))}) # Paint with 3 if value is 1.
      else:
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, j))}) # Otherwise, paint original value.
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 
1. **`len(I), len(I[0])`:**  Gets the height and width of the input grid.
2. **`canvas(0, (h, w))`:** Creates an empty canvas of the same size as the input.
3. **Nested loops:** Iterates through each cell in the input grid.
4. **Conditional Recoloring:** For each cell, if its value is 1, it paints the corresponding cell on the canvas with the value 3. Otherwise, it paints the corresponding cell with the original value.

**Version 4:** (Using `replace`)

```python
def solve(I):
    return replace(I, 1, 3) # Replace all occurrences of 1 with 3.
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`replace(I, 1, 3)`:** Replaces all occurrences of the value 1 with the value 3 in the input grid `I`. This concisely achieves the desired recoloring.

**Version 5:** (Using `apply` and a lambda function)

```python
def solve(I):
  recolor_row = lambda row: tuple(3 if v == 1 else v for v in row)
  return tuple(apply(recolor_row, I)) # Apply recoloring to each row.
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`recolor_row = lambda row: ...`:** Defines a lambda function that takes a row and recolors any cell with value 1 to 3.
2. **`apply(recolor_row, I)`:** Applies the `recolor_row` function to each row in the input grid `I`, effectively recoloring all cells with the value 1 to 3.
3. **`tuple(...)`:** Converts the result back into a tuple to represent the output grid. 

These versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the same grid transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL.
