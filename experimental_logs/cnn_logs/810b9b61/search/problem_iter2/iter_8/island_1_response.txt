## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**  The transformation involves identifying all objects formed by the digit '1' and then changing the color of all digits directly surrounding those objects to '3'. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the previous transformation, this one focuses on objects formed by the digit '1'. However, instead of changing the color of surrounding digits, this transformation changes the color of the '1' objects themselves to '3'.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** This transformation appears to be the identity transformation, meaning the output grid is the same as the input grid.

## Program_to_be_generated:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(fill(I, THREE, delta(ofcolor(I, ONE))), asobject(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, ONE)`:** Identifies the indices of all cells in the input grid `I` that have the value '1'.
2. **`delta(...)`:** Finds the indices surrounding the object(s) formed by the '1's.
3. **`fill(I, THREE, ...)`:** Creates a new grid where the cells at the identified surrounding indices are filled with the value '3'. 
4. **`asobject(...)`:** Converts the original input grid `I` into an object representation.
5. **`paint(..., ...)`:**  Overlays the object representation of the original grid onto the grid with the filled surrounding cells, effectively preserving the original values except for the changes made in step 3.

This approach ensures that only the surrounding cells are modified, leaving the original '1' object intact.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(THREE, ofcolor(I, ONE))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, ONE)`:**  Identifies the indices of all cells in the input grid `I` that have the value '1'.
2. **`recolor(THREE, ...)`:** Creates a new object by replacing the color of the object formed by the '1' indices with the value '3'.
3. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the newly recolored object onto the original input grid `I`, effectively replacing the '1' object with a '3' object. 

This version directly modifies the color of the object instead of manipulating the surrounding cells.


### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def change_color(v, i):
    return (THREE, i) if v == ONE else (v, i)
  return paint(I, frozenset(mpapply(change_color, totuple(asobject(I)), totuple(asindices(I)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asobject(I)`:** Converts the input grid `I` into an object representation.
2. **`totuple(...)`:** Converts the object and indices to tuples to be used with `mpapply`.
3. **`asindices(I)`:** Gets the indices of all cells in the grid.
4. **`mpapply(change_color, ..., ...)`:** Applies the `change_color` function to each cell in the object representation, changing the color to '3' if the original value is '1'.
5. **`frozenset(...)`:**  Converts the result back into a frozenset, representing the modified object.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the modified object onto the original grid `I`.

This version iterates through each cell and conditionally changes its color based on the original value.


### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  return fill(I, THREE, branch(size(ones) > 0, delta(ones), ones))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)`:**  Gets the indices of all '1' cells in the input grid.
2. **`size(ones) > 0`:** Checks if any '1's exist in the grid.
3. **`branch(..., delta(ones), ones)`:** If '1's exist, it uses `delta(ones)` to get the surrounding cells; otherwise, it uses `ones` itself (effectively an identity operation for grids without '1's).
4. **`fill(I, THREE, ...)`:**  Fills the selected cells (either the surrounding cells or the '1' cells themselves) with the value '3'.

This version uses a conditional branch to either modify the surrounding cells or perform an identity operation based on the presence of '1's in the grid. 


### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return branch(ONE in  totuple(palette(I)), paint(fill(I, THREE, delta(ofcolor(I, ONE))), asobject(I)), I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ONE in totuple(palette(I))`:** Checks if the color '1' exists in the grid's palette.
2. **`branch(..., ..., I)`:** If the color '1' is present, it performs the transformation; otherwise, it returns the original input grid `I`.
3. The transformation part is identical to Program Version 1, modifying the surrounding cells of '1' objects.

This version adds an extra check to determine whether the transformation is necessary at all, making it more efficient for grids that don't contain the target color.
