## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids consistently involves identifying objects based on connected pixels of the same color and then swapping the color of a specific object with the background color. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** The color '1' representing the connected objects (shapes like 'H' and 'U') is swapped with the background color '0'.

**Pair 1:** Similar to Pair 0, the color '1' (forming a 'H' shape) is swapped with the background color '0'.

**Pair 2:** Again, the color '1' (forming a 'U' shape) is swapped with the background color '0'.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using functions from the provided DSL (`dsl.py`):

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Identify objects with connected pixels of the same color
    objs = objects(I, T, T, F)
    # Find the object with the color '1'
    target_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE) 
    # Swap the color of the target object with the background color 
    O = paint(cover(I, target_obj), recolor(mostcolor(I), target_obj))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, T, T, F)`: Identifies all connected objects in the grid `I`.
2. `extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE)`: Finds the object with color '1'.
3. `cover(I, target_obj)`: Removes the target object from the grid by replacing it with the background color.
4. `recolor(mostcolor(I), target_obj)`: Recolors the target object with the background color.
5. `paint(..., ...)`: Paints the recolored object back onto the grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Directly find indices of cells with color '1'
    target_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE) 
    # Swap the color at these indices with the background color
    O = fill(I, mostcolor(I), target_indices)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `ofcolor(I, ONE)`: Gets the indices of all cells with color '1'.
2. `fill(I, mostcolor(I), target_indices)`: Fills the cells at `target_indices` with the background color.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Replace color '1' with background color directly
    O = replace(I, ONE, mostcolor(I))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `replace(I, ONE, mostcolor(I))`: Replaces all occurrences of color '1' with the background color.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Get all objects in the grid
    objs = objects(I, T, T, F)
    # Paint all objects except the one with color '1' onto a blank canvas
    O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) != ONE)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, T, T, F)`:  Identifies all connected objects.
2. `sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) != ONE)`:  Filters out the object with color '1'.
3. `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`: Creates a blank canvas filled with the background color.
4. `paint(..., ...)`: Paints the remaining objects onto the canvas.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Create a function to check for color '1'
    is_target_color = matcher(identity, ONE) 
    # Apply the function to each cell and invert the result to get the desired output
    O = apply(compose(flip, is_target_color), I)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `matcher(identity, ONE)`:  Creates a function that checks if a value is equal to '1'.
2. `compose(flip, is_target_color)`:  Composes a function that first checks if a value is '1' and then inverts the result (True becomes False and vice versa).
3. `apply(..., I)`:  Applies the composed function to each cell of the grid.

Each of these versions implements the same color swapping logic but utilizes different combinations of functions from the provided DSL, showcasing the flexibility and diversity of solutions possible.
