## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of a specific color (color '1' in all given examples) and changing their color to another specific color (color '3' in all given examples).

**Input_0 to Output_0:** All objects with color '1' are recolored to '3'.
**Input_1 to Output_1:** All objects with color '1' are recolored to '3'.
**Input_2 to Output_2:** All objects with color '1' are recolored to '3'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return replace(I, ONE, THREE)
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the `replace` function directly. It iterates through the grid and substitutes all occurrences of '1' with '3'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def change_color(v, i):
    return (THREE, i) if v == ONE else (v, i)
  return paint(I, frozenset(mpapply(change_color, totuple(asobject(I)), totuple(asindices(I)))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes `asobject`, `asindices`, `mpapply`, and `paint` functions:

1. `asobject(I)` converts the grid 'I' into an object containing (value, index) pairs for each cell.
2. `asindices(I)` extracts all indices of the grid 'I'.
3. `totuple` converts the object and indices to tuples for `mpapply`.
4. `mpapply(change_color, ...)` applies the `change_color` function to every cell, replacing '1' with '3' while maintaining other colors.
5. `paint(I, ...)` paints the modified object back onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = objects(I, True, False, False)
  obj_to_change = colorfilter(obj, ONE)
  modified_obj = recolor(THREE, merge(obj_to_change))
  return paint(I, modified_obj) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses `objects`, `colorfilter`, `recolor`, `merge`, and `paint`:

1. `objects(I, True, False, False)` identifies all objects in the grid 'I', considering each cell with the same value as part of the same object.
2. `colorfilter(obj, ONE)` filters the identified objects, selecting only those with color '1'.
3. `merge(obj_to_change)` merges the selected objects into a single object.
4. `recolor(THREE, ...)` recolors the merged object to '3'.
5. `paint(I, modified_obj)` paints the modified object onto the original grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return fill(I, THREE, ofcolor(I, ONE))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes `fill` and `ofcolor`:

1. `ofcolor(I, ONE)` identifies the indices of all cells in the grid 'I' with the color '1'.
2. `fill(I, THREE, ...)` fills the grid 'I' with color '3' at the indices identified in the previous step.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_cell(v):
    return THREE if v == ONE else v
  return tuple(tuple(recolor_cell(v) for v in row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes nested loops and a helper function `recolor_cell`:

1. `recolor_cell(v)`: This helper function takes a cell value 'v' and returns '3' if the value is '1', otherwise, it returns the original value.
2. The nested loops iterate over each row and each cell within the row of the input grid 'I'.
3. For each cell, the `recolor_cell` function is applied, and the modified value is used to construct the output grid.

These are five distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL. Each version demonstrates different combinations of DSL functions, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the language.
