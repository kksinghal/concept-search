## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of a specific color (in this case, the digit '2') and moving them upwards until they hit either another object or the top of the grid. 

**Input_0:**
- The object consisting of '2's is moved upwards by 5 units.

**Input_1:**
- The object consisting of '2's in the middle is moved upwards by 4 units.
- The object consisting of '2's at the bottom right is moved upwards by 1 unit.

**Input_2:**
- The object consisting of '2's is moved upwards by 4 units.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve_version_1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  movable_objs = colorfilter(objs, TWO)
  for obj in movable_objs:
    i = 1
    while index(I, add(ulcorner(obj), (i, 0))) == ZERO and i < height(I):
      i += 1
    O = move(I, obj, (i - 1, 0))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** We use `objects(I, T, T, T)` to find all objects in the grid, including diagonally connected ones and excluding the background.
2. **Filter movable objects:**  We use `colorfilter(objs, TWO)` to select only the objects that consist of the digit '2'.
3. **Iterate over objects and move:**  For each movable object, we iterate upwards (increasing 'i') from its upper-left corner until we encounter a non-zero cell or reach the top of the grid. Then, we move the object upwards by `(i - 1, 0)`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve_version_2(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for i in range(height(I) - 1):
      if index(O, (i, j)) == ZERO and index(O, (i + 1, j)) == TWO:
        O = switch(O, index(O, (i, j)), index(O, (i + 1, j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through grid columns:**  For each column 'j' in the grid.
2. **Iterate through grid rows:** For each row 'i' from bottom to top, check if the current cell is zero and the cell below it is '2'.
3. **Swap if conditions are met:** If the conditions are met, swap the values of the two cells. This effectively moves the '2' upwards.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve_version_3(I):
  twos = ofcolor(I, TWO)
  shifted_twos = mapply(lambda loc: (0, loc[1]), twos)
  O = paint(cover(I, twos), recolor(TWO, shifted_twos))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '2' locations:**  Find the indices of all cells with the digit '2' using `ofcolor`.
2. **Calculate target locations:** Map the identified locations to their target positions by setting their row index to 0 (top row).
3. **Modify the grid:** Cover the original '2's and paint new ones at the calculated target locations.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve_version_4(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    if color(obj) == TWO:
      while uppermost(obj) > 0 and index(O, add(ulcorner(obj), (-1, 0))) == ZERO:
        O = move(O, obj, (-1, 0))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** For each object in the grid.
2. **Check for '2' color:** If the object consists of the digit '2'.
3. **Move until blocked:** Move the object upwards one cell at a time until it reaches the top or encounters a non-zero cell.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve_version_5(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    column = tuple(I[i][j] for i in range(height(I)))
    filtered_column = tuple(v for v in column if v != ZERO)
    new_column = tuple(ZERO for _ in range(height(I) - len(filtered_column))) + filtered_column
    for i, v in enumerate(new_column):
      O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create an empty canvas:**  Initialize an empty grid with the same dimensions as the input.
2. **Iterate through columns:** For each column in the input grid.
3. **Extract and filter column:** Extract the column as a tuple and remove all zeroes.
4. **Create a new column:** Create a new column by padding the filtered column with zeroes at the beginning.
5. **Paint the new column:** Paint the new column onto the canvas, effectively moving the '2's upwards.


These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation using different combinations of DSL functions and logic. Each version offers a unique perspective on solving the problem and highlights the flexibility of the provided DSL.
