## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to rotate the input grid 90 degrees counterclockwise.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The rightmost column of the input grid becomes the top row of the output grid, read from bottom to top.
* Similarly, the other columns become rows, effectively rotating the grid counterclockwise.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* Same rotation logic applied as in the first example, on a larger grid.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* Again, the same counterclockwise rotation is evident.


## Code Generation:

Since the transformation is simply a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation, we can directly utilize the `rot270` function from the DSL.

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = rot270(I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This code directly applies the `rot270` function to the input grid `I`, resulting in the desired counterclockwise rotation stored in the output grid `O`. 

### Program Version 2: 

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = rot90(rot180(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version achieves the 270-degree counterclockwise rotation by chaining two other rotation functions from the DSL:
* First, the `rot180` function rotates the input grid `I` by 180 degrees.
* Then, the `rot90` function rotates the intermediate result by another 90 degrees clockwise, effectively resulting in a total 270-degree counterclockwise (or 90-degree clockwise) rotation.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = hmirror(dmirror(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses mirroring functions to achieve the rotation:
* `dmirror(I)` mirrors the input grid `I` along the main diagonal.
* `hmirror(...)` then mirrors the result horizontally. The combination of these two mirroring operations is equivalent to a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = vmirror(dmirror(hmirror(I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a sequence of three mirroring operations:
* `hmirror(I)` mirrors the input grid `I` horizontally.
* `dmirror(...)` then mirrors the result diagonally.
* Finally, `vmirror(...)` mirrors the intermediate result vertically.  The combination of these three mirroring operations results in a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = astuple(len(I), len(I[0]))
    x2 = canvas(ZERO, x1)
    x3 = prapply(lambda i, j: index(I, (j, x1[1]-i-1)), interval(ZERO, x1[0], ONE), interval(ZERO, x1[1], ONE))
    O = fill(x2, ONE, x3)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version takes a more procedural approach to construct the rotated grid:
* `astuple(len(I), len(I[0]))` stores the dimensions of the input grid.
* `canvas(ZERO, x1)` creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid, filled with zeros.
* `prapply(...)` iterates over all cell indices of the output grid and calculates the corresponding value from the input grid using the rotation logic (j, x1[1]-i-1).
* `fill(x2, ONE, x3)` fills the initially empty canvas with the calculated values from the input grid, effectively creating the rotated output grid.

These five versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the same 90-degree counterclockwise rotation using various DSL functions, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
