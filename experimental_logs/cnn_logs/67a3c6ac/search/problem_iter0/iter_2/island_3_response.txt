## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves two steps:

1. **Shifting:** The grid is cyclically shifted to the right. The amount of shift is determined by the index of the smallest element in the first row of the grid.
2. **Mirroring:** The shifted grid is then mirrored vertically. 

Let's illustrate with an example using Input_0:

**Input_0:**
```
6 6 6 2
6 1 6 2
7 2 7 2
1 7 2 2
```

1. **Shifting:** The smallest element in the first row is '2' at index 3 (zero-based indexing). So, we shift the grid 3 positions to the right. 

```
2 6 6 6 
2 6 1 6 
2 7 2 7 
2 2 1 7 
```

2. **Mirroring:** Finally, we mirror the shifted grid vertically:

```
2 6 6 6
2 6 1 6
2 7 2 7
2 2 7 1
```

This matches the **Output_0**. The same logic applies to the other input-output pairs.


## Program to be Generated:


### Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def program(I):
  min_index = argmin(interval(0, width(I), 1), lambda j: I[0][j])
  shifted_grid = tuple(r[min_index:] + r[:min_index] for r in I)
  return vmirror(shifted_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Finding Shift:**  `argmin(interval(0, width(I), 1), lambda j: I[0][j])` finds the index of the minimum element in the first row.
2. **Shifting:** `shifted_grid = tuple(r[min_index:] + r[:min_index] for r in I)` performs the right cyclic shift by the calculated `min_index`.
3. **Mirroring:**  `vmirror(shifted_grid)` performs the vertical mirroring of the shifted grid.

### Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def program(I):
  shift_amount =  width(I) - argmin(I[0], identity)[0]
  shifted_grid = rot90(rot90(I, shift_amount))
  return vmirror(shifted_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Finding Shift:**  `width(I) - argmin(I[0], identity)[0]`  calculates the shift amount using `argmin` on the first row and subtracting from the width.
2. **Shifting:**  `shifted_grid = rot90(rot90(I, shift_amount))` achieves the right cyclic shift using two 90-degree rotations with `rot90`.
3. **Mirroring:** `vmirror(shifted_grid)` performs the vertical mirroring.


### Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def program(I):
  min_value = min(I[0])
  min_index = I[0].index(min_value)
  shifted_grid = hconcat(crop(I, (0, min_index), (height(I), width(I) - min_index)), crop(I, (0, 0), (height(I), min_index)))
  return vmirror(shifted_grid) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Finding Shift:** `min_value = min(I[0])` and `min_index = I[0].index(min_value)` find the minimum value and its index in the first row.
2. **Shifting:** `hconcat` and `crop` are used to split the grid at the `min_index` and concatenate the right part followed by the left part, effectively shifting the grid.
3. **Mirroring:** `vmirror(shifted_grid)` performs the vertical mirroring.

### Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def program(I):
    min_index =  argmin(interval(0, width(I), 1), lambda j: index(I,(0,j)))
    return vmirror(tuple(tuple(I[i][(j + min_index) % width(I)] for j in range(width(I))) for i in range(height(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Finding Shift:** Similar to previous versions, it finds the `min_index` in the first row.
2. **Shifting and Mirroring:** It combines shifting and mirroring by directly accessing and rearranging grid elements with modulo operation `%` for cyclic behavior and then using `vmirror` for vertical mirroring.

### Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def program(I):
  shift_amount = min(enumerate(I[0]), key=lambda x: x[1])[0]
  shifted_rows = [row[shift_amount:] + row[:shift_amount] for row in I]
  return tuple(tuple(reversed(row)) for row in shifted_rows)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Finding Shift:**  Uses `min` with a lambda function to find the index of the smallest element in the first row.
2. **Shifting:** Shifts each row by `shift_amount` using slicing and concatenation.
3. **Mirroring:** Uses list comprehension and `reversed` to mirror the shifted rows vertically. 


These five versions offer different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility of DSL and diverse programming styles.
