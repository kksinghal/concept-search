## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place in each input-output pair involves shifting the columns of the input grid to the right, with the rightmost column wrapping around to the leftmost position. The number of positions each column shifts appears to correlate with the value of the topmost digit in that column.  

Let's analyze each example:

**Input_0:**

- The column with top digit '6' shifts right by 6 positions.
- The column with top digit '1' shifts right by 1 position.
- The column with top digit '7' shifts right by 7 positions.
- The column with top digit '2' shifts right by 2 positions.

**Input_1:**

- Follows the same pattern as Input_0 with each column shifting right according to its top digit value.

**Input_2:**

- Again, the pattern holds true, confirming our observation.

## Code Generation:

Since the provided DSL doesn't contain a direct function for cyclic column shifting, we need to break down the problem and leverage existing functions to achieve the desired outcome.  Here are five distinct code versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    O = move(O, toobject(asindices(hsplit(O, width(I))[j]), O), (0, index(I, (0, j))))
  return O

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over columns:** The code iterates through each column of the grid using `width(I)` and `hsplit`.
2. **Extract and shift object:**  For each column, it extracts the column as an object (`toobject`) and shifts it horizontally by the value of the topmost digit in that column using `move` and `index`.
3. **Update grid:** The shifted column is then used to update the output grid `O`. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    O = paint(O, shift(toobject(asindices(hsplit(I, width(I))[j]), I), (0, index(I, (0, j)))))
  return O

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create blank canvas:** This version starts by creating a blank canvas (`canvas`) of the same size and background color as the input.
2. **Iterate and paint:**  It iterates through each column, extracts it as an object, shifts it according to the top digit's value, and then paints it onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = tuple(tuple(I[i][(j + index(I, (0, j))) % w] for j in range(w)) for i in range(h))
  return O

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct indexing with modulo:**  This version uses a more mathematical approach, directly calculating the new index for each cell using modulo (`%`) to handle the wrap-around behavior.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for _ in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)-1, 0, -1):
      value = index(O, (0, j))
      O = move(O, toobject(asindices(hsplit(O, width(O))[j]), O), (0, value))
  return O

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and shift from right:** This version iterates through the columns from right to left, shifting each column by its top digit's value. This avoids overwriting data while shifting.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = tuple(tuple(I[i][(j - index(I, (0, j))) % width(I)] for j in range(width(I))) for i in range(height(I)))
  return O

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct indexing with negative modulo:** Similar to version 3, this version uses direct indexing with modulo, but it uses a negative shift (`-`) to move columns to the right.


These five program versions showcase different approaches to achieving the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and power of the provided DSL. Each version leverages a unique combination of functions and logic, highlighting the diversity of solutions possible within the DSL's constraints.
