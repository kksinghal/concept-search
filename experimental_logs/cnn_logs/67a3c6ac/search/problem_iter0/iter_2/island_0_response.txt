## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise. However, instead of simply transposing and reversing rows like a standard rotation, it seems to shift the position of elements within each row based on their original column index. 

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

- The first column of the input becomes the first row of the output, but each element is shifted one position to the right (with wraparound).
- This pattern continues for each subsequent column, with the shift amount increasing by one for each new row in the output.

**Input_1:**

-  The same pattern holds as in Input_0, demonstrating the transformation is consistent across different grid sizes.

**Input_2:**

-  Again, the same pattern is observed, reinforcing the clockwise rotation and column-dependent shift logic.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using functions from the provided DSL, along with explanations for each version:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """ Rotates the grid 90 degrees clockwise with a column-based shift. """
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(0, (w, h)) 
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      O = fill(O, I[i][j], ((j, (i + j) % h),))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Initialization:** Creates a canvas `O` with dimensions swapped from the input `I` to accommodate the rotation.
2.  **Iteration:** Iterates through each cell `(i, j)` of the input grid.
3.  **Shift and Fill:** Calculates the new position `(j, (i + j) % h)` by swapping row and column indices and applying a modulo operation for the shift. This ensures elements wrap around when reaching the edge of the row. Finally, it fills the corresponding cell in the output canvas with the value from the input.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    """ Rotates the grid by constructing each row individually. """
    O = tuple()
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    for j in range(w):
        row = tuple(I[(i - j) % h][j] for i in range(h))
        O = O + (row,)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty tuple `O` to store the output grid.
2. **Row Construction:**  Iterates through each column `j` of the input grid, constructing a new row for the output.
3. **Shift and Append:**  For each row, iterates through all rows `i` in the input and calculates the shifted index `(i - j) % h`. This retrieves the correct element based on the column-dependent shift. The retrieved elements are appended to form the new row, which is then added to the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    """ Rotates the grid by transposing and applying a custom shift function. """
    def shift_row(row, n):
        return row[-n:] + row[:-n]
    
    transposed = rot90(I)  # Counter-clockwise rotation is transpose then reverse rows
    O = tuple(shift_row(row, i) for i, row in enumerate(transposed))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Helper Function:** Defines a `shift_row` function that shifts the elements in a row `n` positions to the right (with wraparound).
2. **Transpose:** Performs a counter-clockwise 90-degree rotation using `rot90`, essentially transposing the grid.
3. **Shift and Combine:** Iterates through each row of the transposed grid and applies the `shift_row` function with the row index `i` as the shift amount. This aligns with the column-dependent shift requirement.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    """ Rotates the grid using nested list comprehensions and modulo operation. """
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    return tuple(
        tuple(I[(k - j) % h][j] for j in range(w))
        for k in range(h)
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Nested Comprehensions:** Employs nested list comprehensions to construct the rotated grid concisely.
2. **Outer Loop:** The outer loop iterates over rows `k` of the output grid.
3. **Inner Loop and Shift:** The inner loop iterates over columns `j` of the input grid. It calculates the element index using `(k - j) % h` for the column-dependent shift and retrieves the value from the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    """ Rotates the grid using functional programming techniques. """
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    return tuple(
        tuple(map(lambda x: I[x][j], [(i - j) % h for i in range(h)]))
        for j in range(w)
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Functional Approach:**  Utilizes functional programming concepts like `map` and lambda functions for a more abstract and potentially efficient solution.
2. **Column Iteration:**  The outer loop iterates over columns `j` of the input grid.
3. **Mapping and Shifting:** For each column, a `map` function is used with a lambda function to apply the column-dependent shift. The lambda function takes an index `x` and calculates the shifted row index `(i - j) % h`.  This retrieves the correct element from the input grid for each position in the output row. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. Each version provides a unique perspective on how to decompose and solve the problem using different functions and programming paradigms.
