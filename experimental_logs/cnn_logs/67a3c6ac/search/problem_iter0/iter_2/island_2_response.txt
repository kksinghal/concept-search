## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves rotating the input grid 90 degrees clockwise and then mirroring it horizontally. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

1. **Rotation:** The input grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. For example, the top row (6 6 6 2) becomes the rightmost column (2 6 6 6).

2. **Mirroring:** The rotated grid is then mirrored horizontally. For example, the top row of the rotated grid (2 6 6 6) remains the same in the final output. 

**Input_1 & Input_2:** 
The same logic of rotation followed by mirroring applies to these inputs as well.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = hmirror(rot90(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **rot90(I):** Rotates the input grid `I` by 90 degrees clockwise.
2. **hmirror(...):** Mirrors the rotated grid horizontally.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = rot270(vmirror(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **vmirror(I):** Mirrors the input grid `I` vertically.
2. **rot270(...):** Rotates the mirrored grid 270 degrees clockwise (equivalent to 90 degrees anticlockwise), achieving the same final orientation as horizontal mirroring after 90-degree clockwise rotation.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = dmirror(rot180(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **rot180(I):** Rotates the input grid `I` by 180 degrees.
2. **dmirror(...):** Mirrors the rotated grid along the main diagonal, achieving the target transformation. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = cmirror(rot180(dmirror(I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **dmirror(I):** Mirrors the input grid `I` along the main diagonal.
2. **rot180(...):** Rotates the mirrored grid by 180 degrees.
3. **cmirror(...):** Mirrors the result along the counter-diagonal, achieving the desired outcome.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    h = len(I)
    w = len(I[0])
    O = canvas(0, (w, h))
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            O[j][h - 1 - i] = I[i][j]
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly manipulates the grid cells to achieve the transformation:

1. **canvas(0, (w, h)):** Creates a new grid `O` with swapped dimensions of input grid `I` and filled with zeros.
2. **Nested loops:**  Iterate through each cell of the input grid `I`.
3. **O[j][h - 1 - i] = I[i][j]:**  Places the value from the input grid `I` at the calculated position in the output grid `O` to achieve rotation and mirroring simultaneously. 

These five program versions provide diverse solutions to the transformation problem using different combinations of DSL functions. They showcase the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL in solving spatial reasoning tasks.
