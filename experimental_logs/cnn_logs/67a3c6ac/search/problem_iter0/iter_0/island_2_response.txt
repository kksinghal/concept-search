## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves rotating the input grid 90 degrees counterclockwise.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_rotation(I):
  O = rot270(I)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

This code directly uses the `rot270` function from the DSL to rotate the input grid (`I`) by 270 degrees counterclockwise, effectively achieving a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation. The result is stored in the output grid (`O`) and returned.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_rotation(I):
  O = rot90(rot180(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a combination of `rot90` (90-degree clockwise rotation) and `rot180` (180-degree rotation) functions. By first rotating the input grid 180 degrees and then rotating the result 90 degrees clockwise, we achieve the desired 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_rotation(I):
  O = dmirror(vmirror(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This code utilizes mirroring to achieve the rotation. By first mirroring the input grid vertically (`vmirror`) and then mirroring the result diagonally (`dmirror`), we effectively perform a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_rotation(I):
  O = tuple(zip(*I[::-1]))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses native Python functions within the DSL framework. It first reverses the input grid (`I[::-1]`), then unpacks and transposes it using `zip(*...)`. This directly constructs the rotated grid without relying on specific DSL rotation functions.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_rotation(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = tuple(tuple(I[j][w-i-1] for j in range(h)) for i in range(w))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through the input grid's dimensions (`h`, `w`) and constructs a new grid (`O`) by directly calculating the new indices for each element based on the 90-degree counterclockwise rotation logic. This approach avoids explicit rotation or mirroring functions. 

## Code Extraction:

To extract the code for any version, simply copy the code between the "**Code:**" and "**Explanation:**" sections and paste it into your programming environment.
