## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking the input grid and rotating it 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The original top row (6 6 6 2) becomes the rightmost column (2 6 6 6) in reverse order.
- Similarly, other rows become columns, with elements in reverse order.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- Same rotation logic as Input_0, but with a larger grid.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
-  Same rotation logic as previous examples.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code using the provided DSL:

**Version 1:** (Direct Rotation)

```python
def solve(I):
    """ Rotates the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise. """
    O = rot270(I)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- `rot270(I)`: This function directly rotates the input grid `I` by 270 degrees clockwise, which is equivalent to a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.

**Version 2:** (Transpose and Reverse)

```python
def solve(I):
    """ Rotates the input grid by transposing and reversing each row. """
    x1 = dmirror(I)  # Transpose the grid
    O = tuple(tuple(row[::-1]) for row in x1)  # Reverse each row
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- `x1 = dmirror(I)`: Transposes the grid (swaps rows and columns).
- `O = tuple(tuple(row[::-1]) for row in x1)`: Iterates through each row of the transposed grid and reverses the order of elements.

**Version 3:** (Cell-by-Cell Mapping)

```python
def solve(I):
    """ Rotates the grid by mapping each cell to its new position. """
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    O = tuple(
        tuple(I[j][w - i - 1] for j in range(w)) for i in range(h)
    )
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Calculates the height (`h`) and width (`w`) of the input grid.
- Creates a new grid (`O`) where each cell at position `(i, j)` is filled with the value from the input grid at position `(j, w - i - 1)`, effectively performing the rotation.

**Version 4:** (Shifting Rows)

```python
def solve(I):
    """ Rotates the grid by shifting each row and stacking them. """
    O = tuple()
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
        row = tuple(I[i][j] for i in range(len(I) - 1, -1, -1))
        O = (row,) + O
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Iterates through each column (`j`) of the input grid.
- For each column, it constructs a row by taking the elements from the bottom to the top (`range(len(I) - 1, -1, -1)`) and appending it to the beginning of the output grid (`(row,) + O`).

**Version 5:** (Recursive Decomposition)

```python
def solve(I):
    """ Recursively rotates the grid by splitting and rotating quadrants. """
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    if h == 1 or w == 1:
        return I
    else:
        a = solve(crop(I, (0, 0), (h // 2, w // 2)))
        b = solve(crop(I, (0, w // 2), (h // 2, w - w // 2)))
        c = solve(crop(I, (h // 2, w // 2), (h - h // 2, w - w // 2)))
        d = solve(crop(I, (h // 2, 0), (h - h // 2, w // 2)))
        return vconcat(hconcat(d, a), hconcat(c, b))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version recursively divides the grid into four quadrants, rotates each quadrant, and then combines the rotated quadrants to produce the final rotated grid.
- This approach, while more complex, demonstrates a different way to think about the problem.

Each of these versions achieves the same result of rotating the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise using different DSL function combinations and logic.
