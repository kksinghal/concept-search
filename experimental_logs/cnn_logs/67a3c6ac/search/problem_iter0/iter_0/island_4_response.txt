## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves rotating the grid 90 degrees counterclockwise.  Let's break down how this applies to each example:

**Input_0:**
```
6 6 6 2
6 1 6 2
7 2 7 2
1 7 2 2 
```
**Output_0:**
```
2 6 6 6
2 6 1 6
2 7 2 7
2 2 7 1
```
Here, each row in the input grid becomes a column in the output grid, but in reverse order. 

**Input_1 & Output_1, Input_2 & Output_2:** These examples follow the same pattern of a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation. 

## Code Generation:

Given the transformation analysis, we can generate code utilizing the `rot270` function from the provided DSL. Below are five distinct versions of the program, each with a different approach to achieving the 90-degree counterclockwise rotation:

**Program Version 1:**

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
    O = rot270(I)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
This version directly applies the `rot270` function to the input grid `I` to produce the rotated output grid `O`. It's the most straightforward implementation of the observed transformation.

**Program Version 2:**

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
    O = rot90(rot180(I))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
Instead of directly using `rot270`, this version achieves the same result by chaining two other rotation functions from the DSL. Rotating the grid 180 degrees with `rot180` and then another 90 degrees with `rot90` effectively results in a 270-degree rotation (which is equivalent to a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation).

**Program Version 3:**

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
    O = hmirror(dmirror(I))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
This version takes advantage of mirroring functions to perform the rotation. First, it mirrors the input grid diagonally using `dmirror`.  Then, it mirrors the resulting grid horizontally using `hmirror`. The combination of these two mirror operations is equivalent to a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.

**Program Version 4:**

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
    O = vmirror(dmirror(hmirror(I)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
Similar to version 3, this version utilizes a chain of mirroring operations. It first mirrors horizontally with `hmirror`, then diagonally with `dmirror`, and finally vertically with `vmirror`. This sequence also results in the desired 90-degree counterclockwise rotation. 

**Program Version 5:**

**Code:**
```python
def solve(I):
    O = cmirror(dmirror(cmirror(I)))
    return O
```
**Explanation:**
This version employs counter-diagonal mirroring with `cmirror` alongside diagonal mirroring with `dmirror`. Mirroring counter-diagonally, then diagonally, and again counter-diagonally effectively rotates the grid 90 degrees counterclockwise. 

Each of these programs utilizes different DSL functions or combinations, offering distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation while adhering to the provided DSL constraints.
