## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves shifting the columns of the grid to the left, wrapping the leftmost column around to the rightmost position. The number of columns shifted is equal to the index of the column containing the minimum value in the first row of the input grid.

**Input_0:**

* The minimum value in the first row (6 6 6 **2**) is 2, located at index 3 (zero-based indexing).
* Therefore, the grid is shifted 3 columns to the left, wrapping the elements around.

**Input_1:**

* The minimum value in the first row (7 7 7 6 6 6 **2**) is 2, located at index 6.
* The grid is shifted 6 columns to the left, wrapping the elements around.

**Input_2:**

* The minimum value in the first row (**1** 2 7 1 1 1) is 1, located at index 0.
* The grid is shifted 0 columns to the left, resulting in no change.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" in the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  min_index = argmin(interval(0, width(I), 1), lambda j: I[0][j])
  shifted_grid = tuple(r[min_index:] + r[:min_index] for r in I)
  return shifted_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **argmin(interval(0, width(I), 1), lambda j: I[0][j])**: Finds the index of the minimum value in the first row of the grid 'I'. 
2.  **shifted_grid = tuple(r[min_index:] + r[:min_index] for r in I)**:  For each row 'r' in the grid, it slices the row from the 'min_index' to the end and concatenates it with the slice from the beginning to the 'min_index', effectively shifting the columns.
3.  **return shifted_grid**: Returns the transformed grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  min_val = minimum(set(I[0]))
  O = rot270(I)
  for i in range(width(I)):
    if index(O, (0, i)) == min_val:
      O = rot90(O)
      break
    else:
      O = rot90(O)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **min_val = minimum(set(I[0]))**: Finds the minimum value in the first row.
2.  **O = rot270(I)**: Rotates the input grid counter-clockwise by 270 degrees.
3.  **for loop**: Iterates through the columns of the rotated grid ('O'). 
    *   **if index(O, (0, i)) == min_val**: If the current column's top element matches the 'min_val', rotate 'O' clockwise by 90 degrees and exit the loop.
    *   **else**: Rotate 'O' clockwise by 90 degrees and continue to the next column.
4.  **return O**: Returns the rotated grid, which represents the shifted input grid. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  shift_amount = argmin(I[0], lambda x: x)
  shifted_rows = apply(lambda r: r[shift_amount:] + r[:shift_amount], I)
  return tuple(shifted_rows)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **shift_amount = argmin(I[0], lambda x: x)**:  Determines the shift amount by finding the index of the minimum value in the first row.
2.  **shifted_rows = apply(lambda r: r[shift_amount:] + r[:shift_amount], I)**: Applies a lambda function to each row 'r' in the grid 'I', shifting the elements by 'shift_amount'.
3.  **return tuple(shifted_rows)**: Returns the transformed grid as a tuple.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  min_col = argmin(range(len(I[0])), lambda j: I[0][j]) 
  return tuple(tuple(I[i][(j + min_col) % len(I[0])] for j in range(len(I[0]))) for i in range(len(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **min_col = argmin(range(len(I[0])), lambda j: I[0][j])**: Finds the index of the column with the minimum value in the first row.
2. **return tuple(...)**: Returns the transformed grid, constructed using nested loops.
   * **(j + min_col) % len(I[0])**:  Calculates the new column index after the shift, ensuring wrapping.
   *  The nested loops iterate through each cell of the grid and place it in its correct position in the output grid based on the calculated new index.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def shift_row(r, amount):
    return r[amount:] + r[:amount]
  
  min_index = argmin(I[0], lambda v: v)
  return tuple(shift_row(r, min_index) for r in I) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **def shift_row(r, amount): ...**: Defines a helper function to shift a single row by a given amount.
2. **min_index = argmin(I[0], lambda v: v)**:  Gets the index of the minimum value in the first row.
3.  **return tuple(shift_row(r, min_index) for r in I)**: Applies the `shift_row` function to each row of the input grid with the determined 'min_index' as the shift amount. 

These are just five examples; many other variations are possible using the provided DSL functions. Each version utilizes different function combinations and logic to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
