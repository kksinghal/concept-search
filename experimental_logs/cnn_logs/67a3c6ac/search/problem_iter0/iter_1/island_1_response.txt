## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves rotating the input grid 90 degrees counterclockwise. 

Let's illustrate with Input_0:

**Input_0:**
```
6 6 6 2
6 1 6 2
7 2 7 2
1 7 2 2 
```

**Output_0:**
```
2 6 6 6
2 6 1 6
2 7 2 7
2 2 7 1
```

As you can see, the top row of the input becomes the rightmost column of the output, the second row of the input becomes the second rightmost column of the output, and so on.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the `Program_to_be_generated` function, each utilizing different DSL functions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = rot270(I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly employs the `rot270` function from the DSL, which performs a 270-degree counterclockwise rotation on the input grid (`I`). The result (`O`) is then returned.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = dmirror(hmirror(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version achieves the rotation through a combination of mirroring operations. First, the input grid (`I`) is mirrored horizontally using `hmirror`. Then, the resulting grid is mirrored along the diagonal using `dmirror`. The final output (`O`) represents a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = tuple(zip(*I[::-1]))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes Python's built-in `zip` and list slicing to perform the rotation. `I[::-1]` reverses the order of rows in the input grid. Then, `zip(*...)` transposes the grid, effectively swapping rows and columns. The result is converted back into a tuple to match the DSL's grid representation.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(0, (w, h))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(j, h - 1 - i)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates over the input grid (`I`) cell by cell. For each cell at index `(i, j)`, it fills the corresponding cell in the output grid (`O`) at index `(j, h - 1 - i)` with the original cell's value. This explicitly performs the coordinate mapping required for a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(I[j][len(I) - 1 - i] for j in range(len(I))) for i in range(len(I[0])))
```

**Explanation:**

This version employs nested list comprehensions to achieve the rotation. The outer comprehension iterates over columns (using `i` as index) while the inner comprehension iterates over rows (using `j` as index).  It directly accesses the cell at the rotated index `(j, len(I) - 1 - i)` in the input grid (`I`) and places it at index `(i, j)` in the output grid. 

These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieving the 90-degree counterclockwise rotation using the provided DSL. Each version leverages different combinations of DSL functions and Python features, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
