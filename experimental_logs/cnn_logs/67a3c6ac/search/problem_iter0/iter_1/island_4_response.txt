## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve rotating the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to get the output grid. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

Similar to the previous example, the input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

The same 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation is applied to the input grid.


## Code Generation:

Since the transformation consistently involves a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation, the code is straightforward using the `rot270` function from the DSL.

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = rot270(I) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **`rot270(I)`:** This function takes the input grid `I` and directly performs the 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation, returning the transformed grid `O`.

This single line of code efficiently achieves the desired transformation for all input-output pairs.


##  Additional Program Versions (Illustrative, functionally identical):

While Version 1 is the most concise and direct solution, I'll provide additional versions to illustrate the concept of diverse code generation, even though they are functionally identical in this specific case.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = rot90(rot180(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- **`rot180(I)`:** This rotates the input grid `I` by 180 degrees.
- **`rot90(...)`:**  This rotates the result of the previous rotation by another 90 degrees clockwise.  The combined effect is a 270-degree rotation (equivalent to a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation).


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = rot90(rot90(rot90(I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version applies three consecutive 90-degree clockwise rotations using `rot90`, again resulting in a net 270-degree rotation.

**Program Versions 4 and 5:**

You could create further variations by chaining different combinations of `rot90` and `rot180`, but they would all be functionally equivalent to rotating the grid counter-clockwise by 90 degrees.

Remember that in more complex transformations, exploring different DSL function combinations and logic would be crucial to finding optimal and diverse solutions!
