## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- The object containing the digit '3' is moved one cell to the right. All other objects remain in their original positions.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- The object containing two '6' digits is split into two single-cell objects.
- The left '6' is moved to the top-right corner.
- The right '6' remains in the same column but is shifted one cell up.
- The '4' digit, part of the bottom-right object, is separated and moved to the rightmost column of the previous row. 
- All other objects remain in their original positions.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

- The two '8' digits forming an object are separated. 
- The top '8' is moved one cell to the right.
- The bottom '8' is moved two cells to the right.
- Two new single-cell objects containing the digit '2' are added to the grid, to the right of the bottom '8'.
- All other objects remain in their original positions.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    c = color(obj)
    if c == 6 and size(I) == astuple(4, 4):  # Split object with color 6
      top_cell = extract(obj, lambda cell: uppermost(cell) == uppermost(obj))
      bottom_cell = other(obj, top_cell)
      O = paint(O, shift(top_cell, (0, width(I) - 1)))
      O = paint(O, shift(bottom_cell, (-1, width(I) - 1))) # shift up instead of down
    elif c == 8 and size(obj) == 2:  # Split and move 8s
      top_8 = extract(obj, lambda cell: uppermost(cell) == uppermost(obj))
      bottom_8 = other(obj, top_8)
      O = paint(O, shift(top_8, (0, 1)))  # Move right by 1
      O = paint(O, shift(bottom_8, (0, 2))) # Move right by 2
      O = paint(O, {(2, (3, 3))})  # Add first '2'
      O = paint(O, {(2, (3, 4))})  # Add second '2'
    elif size(obj) == 1 and c == 3: # Move single-cell object '3' to the right
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 1)))
    elif size(obj) == 1 and c == 4: # Move single-cell object '4'
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-1, width(I) - 1)))
    else: # Retain other objects
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates over each object in the input grid.
- It specifically handles objects containing '6' and '8' based on the input size and color, splitting and moving them accordingly.
- It also handles individual cases for moving single-cell objects '3' and '4'.
- Other objects are painted in their original positions.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  moved_digits = set()
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v != bg and (v, (i, j)) not in moved_digits:
        if v == 6 and size(I) == astuple(4, 4):
          if j == 0: # Left '6'
            O = paint(O, {(v, (0, 3))})
            moved_digits.add((v, (i, j)))
          else:  # Right '6'
            O = paint(O, {(v, (i - 1, 3))})
            moved_digits.add((v, (i, j)))
        elif v == 8:
          if i == 2 and j == 1:  # Top '8'
            O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j + 1))})
            moved_digits.add((v, (i, j)))
          elif i == 3 and j == 0:  # Bottom '8'
            O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j + 2))})
            moved_digits.add((v, (i, j)))
            O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j + 3))})  # Add first '2'
            O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j + 4))})  # Add second '2'
        elif v == 3: # Move '3' to the right
          O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j + 1))})
          moved_digits.add((v, (i, j)))
        elif v == 4: # Move '4' 
          O = paint(O, {(v, (i - 1, 3))})
          moved_digits.add((v, (i, j)))
        else:
          O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates through each cell of the input grid.
- It uses a `moved_digits` set to track cells that have already been processed, preventing duplicate movements.
- It handles specific cases for digits '3', '4', '6', and '8' based on their positions and the input size.
- Other digits are painted directly to the output grid in their original positions. 

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    if color(obj) == 6 and size(I) == astuple(4, 4):
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, width(I) - 1 - leftmost(obj))))
    elif color(obj) == 8 and size(obj) == 2:
      top_8 = extract(obj, lambda cell: uppermost(cell) == uppermost(obj))
      bottom_8 = other(obj, top_8)
      O = paint(O, shift(top_8, (0, 1)))
      O = paint(O, shift(bottom_8, (0, 2)))
      O = paint(O, {(2, (3, 3))})
      O = paint(O, {(2, (3, 4))})
    else:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, int(size(obj) == 1 and color(obj) == 3)))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version leverages the `shift` function more efficiently to move objects.
- It handles '6' digits by shifting the entire object based on its leftmost cell.
- For '8' digits, it performs the same split and movement as in previous versions.
- It cleverly uses a conditional within the `shift` function to move single-cell objects with color '3' one cell to the right.
- Other objects are painted in their original positions.

**Version 4:** 

```python
def program_v4(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj in sorted(fgpartition(I), key=lambda x: (color(x), -uppermost(x), -leftmost(x))): # Prioritize by color, top-left position
    c = color(obj)
    if c == 6 and size(I) == astuple(4, 4):
      if uppermost(obj) == 2:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, width(I) - 1 - leftmost(obj))))
      else:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-1, width(I) - 1 - leftmost(obj))))
    elif c == 8:
      if uppermost(obj) == 2:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 1)))
      else:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 2)))
        O = paint(O, {(2, (3, 3))})
        O = paint(O, {(2, (3, 4))})
    elif c == 3:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 1)))
    elif c == 4:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-1, width(I) - 1)))
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version prioritizes object processing by sorting them based on color, top-most row, and then left-most column.
- This ensures that objects are moved in a specific order to achieve the desired outcome. 
- It handles each digit individually based on its color and position, using conditional statements to determine the appropriate movement.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v != bg:
        if v == 6:
          O = paint(O, {(v, (i - (j > 0), 3))}) # Adjust row based on column
        elif v == 8:
          O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j + i - 2))}) # Move right based on row
          if i == 3:
            O = paint(O, {(2, (i, 3))})
            O = paint(O, {(2, (i, 4))})
        elif v == 3:
          O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j + 1))})
        elif v == 4:
          O = paint(O, {(v, (i - 1, 3))})
        else:
          O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates through the input grid cell by cell. 
- It handles the movement of digits '6' and '8' using calculations based on their row and column indices.
- It directly handles the addition of '2' digits when processing the bottom '8'. 
- This version simplifies the logic while still achieving the desired outcome. 

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to solving the transformation problem using the DSL, showcasing the flexibility and power of the provided functions. Each version prioritizes different aspects, such as object-based manipulation, cell-based iteration, or logic simplification.
