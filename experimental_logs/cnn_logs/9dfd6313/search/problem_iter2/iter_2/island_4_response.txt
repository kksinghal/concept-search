## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves shifting objects within each column of the grid to bring similar digits together, effectively "sorting" the columns based on their digit values while preserving the original digit order within each object. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The '3' in the second row, first column is moved up to be adjacent to the '5' in the first row, first column.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- In the last column, the '4' is moved down to be below the '5', and the two '6's are moved up to the top.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- Multiple shifts occur in different columns: '8's in the third column are moved up, '2's in the fourth column are moved up, and the '1' in the fifth column is moved up one position.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for i in range(height(I) - 1):
      if O[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and O[i+1][j] != mostcolor(I):
        O = move(O, {(O[i+1][j], (i+1, j))}, (-1, 0))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each column and checks for adjacent non-background cells. If found, it moves the lower cell up, effectively "bubbling" the digits to their sorted positions within the column.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for j in range(width(I)):
        for v in palette(crop(I, (0, j), (height(I), 1))):
            if v != mostcolor(I):
                obj = {(v, (i, j)) for i in range(height(I)) if I[i][j] == v}
                O = move(O, obj, (-uppermost(obj), 0))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each column and each color in that column. It identifies the object of that color and moves it to the top of the column, effectively grouping objects of the same color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    column = tuple(I[i][j] for i in range(height(I)))
    for v in palette(column) - {mostcolor(column)}:
      indices = [(i, j) for i in range(height(I)) if column[i] == v]
      for k in range(len(indices)-1):
        O = move(O, {(v, indices[k+1])}, subtract(indices[k], indices[k+1]))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each column and identifies the indices of each non-background color. It then iteratively moves each occurrence of that color to be adjacent to the previous one, starting from the top.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for i in range(height(I)-1, 0, -1):
      if O[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        current_obj = {(O[i][j], (i, j))}
        k = i - 1
        while k >= 0 and O[k][j] != mostcolor(I):
          current_obj.add((O[k][j], (k, j)))
          k -= 1
        O = move(O, current_obj, (-uppermost(current_obj), 0))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each column from bottom to top. When it encounters a non-background cell, it groups it with any adjacent non-background cells above it and moves the entire group to the topmost available position in the column.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for j in range(width(I)):
        top_pos = 0
        for v in palette(crop(I, (0, j), (height(I), 1))):
            if v != mostcolor(I):
                obj = {(v, (i, j)) for i in range(height(I)) if I[i][j] == v}
                O = paint(O, shift(obj, (top_pos, 0)))
                top_pos += height(obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version initializes the output grid with the background color. Then, it iterates through each column and color, painting the objects of each color onto the output grid starting from the top and moving downwards. This effectively sorts and compacts the objects within each column.

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic. They demonstrate the flexibility and power of the provided DSL for solving spatial reasoning problems.
