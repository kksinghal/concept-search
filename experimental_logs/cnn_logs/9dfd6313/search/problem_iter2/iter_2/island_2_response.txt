## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The object containing the digit '3' is moved one cell to the right.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** The objects containing the digits '6' and '4' are moved to the rightmost column of the grid, maintaining their relative vertical positions.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The objects containing the digits '8' and '2' are moved to the rightmost column of the grid, maintaining their relative vertical positions. Additionally, the object containing the digit '1' is moved one cell to the right. 


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in sorted(objects(I, True, True, True), key=lambda obj: (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj))):
    target_j = width(I) - 1 - sum(width(obj2) for obj2 in objects(I, True, True, True) if uppermost(obj2) <= uppermost(obj) and leftmost(obj2) > leftmost(obj)) 
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, target_j - leftmost(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** A canvas of the same size as the input grid is created, filled with the most common color from the input grid.
2. **Object Iteration:** The program iterates through each object in the input grid, sorted by their uppermost and leftmost positions.
3. **Target Calculation:** For each object, a target column (`target_j`) is calculated. This target column is determined by the width of the grid minus the cumulative width of objects positioned to the right and above the current object. 
4. **Object Shifting:** The object is then shifted horizontally to its calculated target column.
5. **Painting:** The shifted object is painted onto the canvas.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I 
  for obj in objects(I, True, True, True):
    target_j = rightmost(objects(I, True, True, True))
    if leftmost(obj) != target_j:
        O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (0, target_j - leftmost(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** The output grid (`O`) is initialized as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Object Iteration:** The code iterates through each object in the input grid.
3. **Target Determination:** The rightmost column (`target_j`) among all objects is determined.
4. **Conditional Shifting:** If the current object's leftmost position is not already at the target column, the object is shifted. 
5. **Painting on Canvas:** The original position of the object is cleared (`cover`), and the shifted object is painted onto the output grid (`O`). 

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, True, True)
  O = paint(cover(I, objs), shift(objs, (0, width(I) - 1 - rightmost(objs))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** All objects are extracted from the input grid.
2. **Target Calculation:** The target column for shifting is determined to be the rightmost column of the grid minus the rightmost position of any object. 
3. **Simultaneous Shifting and Painting:** All objects are simultaneously shifted horizontally to the calculated target column and painted onto a canvas initially containing the input grid with the objects removed.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in sorted(objects(I, True, True, True), key=lambda obj: -leftmost(obj)):
    if leftmost(obj) != width(I) - 1:
      O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (0, width(I) - 1 - leftmost(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Grid Initialization:** The output grid (`O`) is initialized with the input grid (`I`).
2. **Sorted Iteration:** The code iterates through each object, starting with the rightmost object first (sorting by `-leftmost(obj)`). 
3. **Right Edge Check:** For each object, it checks if the object's leftmost position aligns with the grid's rightmost column (`width(I) - 1`).
4. **Shifting and Painting:** If the object is not on the right edge, it's shifted horizontally to align its left edge with the grid's right edge and painted onto the output grid (`O`). The object's original position is cleared before painting (`cover`).

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    offset = 0
    for obj in sorted(objects(I, True, True, True), key=lambda obj: (-uppermost(obj), -leftmost(obj))):
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, width(I) - width(obj) - offset)))
        offset += width(obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:**  A blank canvas (`O`) is created with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Offset Initialization:** An `offset` variable is initialized to 0. This variable will track the horizontal displacement for positioning objects.
3. **Sorted Object Iteration:** The code iterates through each object in the input grid. The objects are sorted first by their uppermost row (descending) and then by their leftmost column (descending). This ensures that objects are processed from top to bottom, right to left.
4. **Object Placement:**  For each object:
   - It's shifted horizontally using the `offset`. 
   - The shifted object is then painted onto the canvas (`O`).
   - The `offset` is updated by adding the width of the current object, preparing for the next object's placement.
