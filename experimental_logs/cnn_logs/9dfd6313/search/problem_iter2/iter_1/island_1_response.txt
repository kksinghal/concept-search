## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be moving all non-5 objects to the right edge of the grid, maintaining their relative vertical positions. The order in which objects are moved seems to be based on their color, with lower values being moved first.

**Example:**

In Input_1:

* The object with '6' (lower color value) is moved before the object with '4'. 
* Both objects maintain their relative vertical positioning after the shift.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = I
  for color in sorted(palette(I) - {FIVE}):
    for obj in colorfilter(objects(I, T, T, F), color):
      O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through colors:** The program first iterates through all unique colors in the grid (excluding 5), sorted in ascending order.
2. **Iterate through objects of each color:** For each color, it iterates through all objects of that color.
3. **Shift to the right edge:** Each object is shifted to the right edge of the grid, aligning its rightmost cell with the grid's right edge.
4. **Paint on a blank canvas:** The object is painted onto a copy of the input grid with its original position cleared.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    column = frozenset((I[i][j], (i, j)) for i in range(height(I)))
    if any(v != FIVE for v, _ in column):
      obj = next(obj for obj in objects(I, T, T, F) if any((i, j) in toindices(obj) for i in range(height(I))))
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a blank canvas:** Starts with a canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate through columns:** Iterates through each column of the input grid from left to right.
3. **Identify non-5 objects:** Checks if the column contains any value other than 5.
4. **Find the object:** If a non-5 value is found, it identifies the entire object present in that column.
5. **Shift and paint:** The object is shifted to the right edge and painted onto the canvas.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = I
  objects_to_move = sorted(objects(I, T, T, F) - colorfilter(objects(I, T, T, F), FIVE), key=lambda obj: color(obj))
  for obj in objects_to_move:
    O = move(O, obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get movable objects:** Identifies all objects in the grid excluding those with color 5, and sorts them by color.
2. **Move objects:** Iterates through the sorted list of objects and moves each to the right edge.
3. **Paint in place:** Uses the `move` function to directly paint the object at the new location on the grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  non_fives = sorted(((color(obj), obj) for obj in objects(I, T, T, F) if color(obj) != FIVE), key=lambda x: x[0])
  for i, (_, obj) in enumerate(non_fives):
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, i)))
  return paint(O, toobject(ofcolor(I, FIVE), I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Prepare canvas and objects:** Creates a blank canvas and collects non-5 objects sorted by color.
2. **Place non-5 objects:** Places each non-5 object sequentially from left to right on the canvas.
3. **Paint 5s:** Finally, paints the object containing 5s onto the canvas, preserving its original position.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    row_objects = sorted(((color(toobject(frozenset({(I[i][j], (i, j))}), I)), toobject(frozenset({(I[i][j], (i, j))}), I)) for j in range(width(I)) if I[i][j] != FIVE), key=lambda x: x[0])
    for j, (_, obj) in enumerate(row_objects):
      O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (0, j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** Iterates through each row of the grid.
2. **Sort objects in row:** Identifies and sorts objects within each row based on their color, excluding objects with color 5.
3. **Shift and paint:** Shifts each sorted object in the row to its corresponding position from left to right and paints it onto the grid.


Each of these versions offers a distinct approach to achieve the same visual transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
