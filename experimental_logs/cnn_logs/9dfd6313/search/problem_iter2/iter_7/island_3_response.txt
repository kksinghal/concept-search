## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**
* The object with color '3' is moved one position to the right.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**
* The object with color '6' is split into two objects.
* Both objects with color '6' are moved to the rightmost columns.
* The object with color '4' is moved to the bottom-right corner.

**Input 2 to Output 2:**
* The object with color '8' is split into two objects.
* One of the objects with color '8' remains in its position, the other is moved one position to the right.
* Two new objects with color '2' are added to the right of the rightmost object with color '8'.
* The object with color '1' is moved to the bottom-right corner. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I 
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    c = color(obj)
    if c == 3:
      O = move(O, obj, (0, 1)) 
    elif c == 6:
      O = move(O, obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj))) 
    elif c == 8:
      other_objs = sizefilter(colorfilter(objects(O, T, T, T), 8), size(obj))
      if len(other_objs) > 0:
        other_obj = first(other_objs)
        O = move(O, obj, (0, rightmost(other_obj) - leftmost(obj) + 1))
    elif c == 4:
      O = move(O, obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj), width(I) - rightmost(obj)))
    elif c == 1:
      O = move(O, obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj), width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1))
    elif c == 2 and colorcount(I, c) == 0:
      target = extract(objects(O, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == 8)
      O = paint(O, shift({(2, (uppermost(target) - 1, rightmost(target) + 1)), (2, (uppermost(target), rightmost(target) + 1))}, (0, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Iterates through each object in the input grid.
* For objects with color '3', '6', '4', and '1', it applies the same logic as Program_B.
* For objects with color '8', it checks for other objects of the same color and size. If found, it moves the object to the right of the other object.
* For objects with color '2', it applies the same logic as Program_B, adding two new objects to the right of the rightmost object with color '8'.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for c in sorted(palette(I)):
    for obj in sizefilter(objects(I, T, T, T), colorcount(I, c)):
      if c == 3:
        O = move(O, obj, (0, 1))
      elif c == 6:
        O = move(O, obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj)))
      elif c == 8:
        if any(color(o) == 8 and rightmost(o) > rightmost(obj) for o in objects(O, T, T, T)):
          O = move(O, obj, (0, 1)) 
      elif c == 4:
        O = move(O, obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj), width(I) - rightmost(obj)))
      elif c == 1:
        O = move(O, obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj), width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1))
      elif c == 2 and colorcount(I, c) == 0:
        target = extract(objects(O, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == 8)
        O = paint(O, {(2, (uppermost(target) - 1, rightmost(target) + 1)), (2, (uppermost(target), rightmost(target) + 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Iterates through each color in the input grid.
* For each color, it iterates through all objects of that color with the same size.
* Applies the same logic as Version 1 for moving objects based on their color.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  if colorcount(I, 2) == 0:
    target_8 = extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == 8)
    if target_8 is not None:  # Check if target_8 was found
      O = paint(O, {(2, (uppermost(target_8) - 1, rightmost(target_8) + 1)), (2, (uppermost(target_8), rightmost(target_8) + 1))})
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    c = color(obj)
    if c == 3:
      O = move(O, obj, (0, 1))
    elif c == 6:
      O = move(O, obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj)))
    elif c == 8 and any(color(o) == 8 and rightmost(o) > rightmost(obj) for o in objects(O, T, T, T)):
      O = move(O, obj, (0, 1))
    elif c == 4:
      O = move(O, obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj), width(I) - rightmost(obj)))
    elif c == 1:
      O = move(O, obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj), width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version is similar to Version 2 but handles the addition of '2' colored objects separately.
* It first checks if color '2' exists in the input. If not, it adds the two '2' colored objects as described in the transformation analysis.
* The rest of the logic for moving other colored objects remains the same as Version 2.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for c in sorted(palette(I)):
    objs = order(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda obj: (color(obj), -size(obj), uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)))
    for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
      if c == 3:
        O = move(O, obj, (0, 1))
      elif c == 6:
        O = move(O, obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj)))
      elif c == 8 and any(color(o) == 8 and rightmost(o) > rightmost(obj) for o in objects(O, T, T, T)):
        O = move(O, obj, (0, 1))
      elif c == 4:
        O = move(O, obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj), width(I) - rightmost(obj)))
      elif c == 1:
        O = move(O, obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj), width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1))
  if colorcount(I, 2) == 0:
    target = extract(objects(O, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == 8)
    if target is not None:
      O = paint(O, shift({(2, (uppermost(target) - 1, rightmost(target) + 1)), (2, (uppermost(target), rightmost(target) + 1))}, (0, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Similar to Version 2, but it orders the objects by color, size, uppermost row, and leftmost column.
* This ensures that objects of the same color are processed together and in a specific order. 

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for c in sorted(palette(I)):
    for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
      if color(obj) == c:
        if c == 3:
          O = paint(O, shift(obj, (uppermost(obj), 1)))
        elif c == 6:
          O = paint(O, shift(obj, (uppermost(obj), width(I) - rightmost(obj))))
        elif c == 8 and any(color(o) == 8 and rightmost(o) > rightmost(obj) for o in objects(I, T, T, T)):
          O = paint(O, shift(obj, (uppermost(obj), 1)))
        elif c == 4:
          O = paint(O, shift(obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj), width(I) - rightmost(obj))))
        elif c == 1:
          O = paint(O, shift(obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj), width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1)))
        else:
          O = paint(O, obj)
  if colorcount(I, 2) == 0:
    target = extract(objects(O, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == 8)
    if target is not None:
      O = paint(O, shift({(2, (uppermost(target) - 1, rightmost(target) + 1)), (2, (uppermost(target), rightmost(target) + 1))}, (0, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version initializes the output grid as a blank canvas filled with the most common color of the input.
* Then, it iterates through each color and its corresponding objects, painting them onto the canvas at their designated positions based on their color.
* Finally, it handles the addition of '2' colored objects like previous versions.
