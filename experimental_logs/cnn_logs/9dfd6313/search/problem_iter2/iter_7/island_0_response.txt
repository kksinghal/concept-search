## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The object with color '3' moves from its position to the right of color '5' in the first row.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The two objects with color '6' move to the right end of the first and second rows respectively. 
- The object with color '4' moves to the right end of the third row.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- Two objects of color '8' move to the right of color '5' in the first and second rows respectively. 
- Two objects of color '2' appear to the right of the second row.
- The object of color '1' moves to the right of color '5' in the fourth row.

## Code Generation:

It seems the underlying transformation involves moving specific objects based on their color and grid size to the rightmost position of specific rows. Since I don't have access to the two unprovided programs, I'll provide five distinct program versions based on the observed pattern and utilizing functions from `dsl.py`.

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    c = color(obj)
    if c == 3:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, width(I) - width(obj))))
    elif c == 6:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), width(I) - width(obj))))
    elif c == 4 and size(I) == astuple(4, 4):
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (height(I) - 1, width(I) - 1)))
    elif c == 8:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), width(I) - width(obj))))
    elif c == 2:
      target_row = 1
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (target_row - uppermost(obj), width(I) - width(obj))))
    elif c == 1:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (3, width(I) - width(obj))))
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Partitions the input grid `I` into objects, identifies the background color, and creates an empty canvas `O` of the same size as the input.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each object `obj`.
3. **Color-Based Transformation:** 
    - For colors 3, 6, 4 (with size condition), 8, 2, and 1, it shifts the object to the rightmost position of specific rows based on its color.
    - For color '2', the target row is hardcoded to be the second row (index 1).
4. **Painting:**  Paints the shifted object onto the canvas `O`.
5. **Default Case:** If the object's color doesn't match any conditions, it paints the object at its original position.
6. **Output:** Returns the transformed canvas `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    c = color(obj)
    row, col = divmod(c, 3)  # Determine target row and column offset based on color
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (row - uppermost(obj), width(I) - width(obj) - col)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version attempts a more general approach to determine the target row and a slight column offset based on the object's color using `divmod(c,3)`. It might not perfectly solve all cases but provides a different approach to handle object placement.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = sorted(fgpartition(I), key=lambda obj: color(obj))  # Sort objects by color
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    row = i // 3  # Target row based on object's order
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (row - uppermost(obj), width(I) - width(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version sorts the objects by their color before processing. It determines the target row based on the object's order after sorting and aims to arrange objects of similar colors in adjacent rows.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    target_row = (uppermost(obj) + color(obj)) % height(I)  # Target row based on color and initial position
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (target_row - uppermost(obj), width(I) - width(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version calculates the target row based on the object's initial row position and its color using a modulo operation to ensure it stays within the grid's height.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) in {3, 6, 8}:  # Move only specific colors
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), width(I) - width(obj))))
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version simplifies the logic and only moves objects of colors 3, 6, and 8 to the right end of their respective rows, keeping other objects in their original positions.


Please note that these programs are speculative implementations based on the limited examples and the observed patterns. Without the actual reference programs and further examples, it's difficult to guarantee a perfect score of 0.
