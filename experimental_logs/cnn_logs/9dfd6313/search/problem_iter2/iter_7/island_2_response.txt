## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to move non-background objects within the grid to new positions without changing their shape or orientation. The movement pattern seems to be influenced by the object's color and its relative position within the grid.

**Input 0:** 
- The object with color '3' moves to the rightmost empty space in its row.

**Input 1:**
- The objects with color '6' move to the rightmost empty spaces in their respective rows.

**Input 2:** 
- The object with color '8' moves to the rightmost empty space in its row.
- Two new objects with color '2' appear in the rightmost empty spaces of the second row.

##  Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1 (Inspired by Program_B, focuses on iterating through colors):**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = I
  for c in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
    for i, r in enumerate(O):
        empty_indices = [(i, j) for j, v in enumerate(r) if v == mostcolor(O)]
        object_indices = [(i, j) for j, v in enumerate(r) if v == c]
        for k in range(min(len(empty_indices), len(object_indices))):
          O = paint(cover(O, recolor(c, {object_indices[k]})), recolor(c, {empty_indices[k]}))
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through Colors:** The code iterates through each unique color ('c') in the input grid ('I'), excluding the background color.
2. **Find Empty Indices:** For each row ('i') in the grid, it identifies the indices of empty cells (containing the background color) and the indices of cells belonging to the current color ('c').
3. **Move Objects:** It iterates through the minimum of either the empty indices or object indices. For each iteration, it covers the object at its original position and paints it onto the corresponding empty index in the same row.

**Version 2 (Inspired by Program_A, focuses on object manipulation):**

```python
def program_v2(I):
    O = I
    objs = objects(I, True, True, True)
    for obj in objs:
      c = color(obj)
      row = uppermost(obj)
      empty_indices = [(row, j) for j, v in enumerate(O[row]) if v == mostcolor(O)]
      if empty_indices:
        target_index = empty_indices[-1]
        shifted_obj = shift(obj, subtract(target_index, ulcorner(obj)))
        O = paint(cover(O, obj), shifted_obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Get Objects:**  Extracts all objects from the input grid ('I'), excluding the background.
2. **Iterate Through Objects:**  For each object, it determines its color ('c') and the row it occupies.
3. **Find Rightmost Empty Index:** It identifies the rightmost empty index within the object's row.
4. **Shift and Paint:** If an empty index is found, it calculates the shift required to move the object to that index and paints the shifted object onto the grid after covering the original object.

**Version 3 (Combines color iteration and object manipulation):**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = I
  for c in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
    objs = colorfilter(objects(O, True, True, True), c)
    for obj in objs:
      empty_indices = [(uppermost(obj), j) for j in range(len(O[0])) if O[uppermost(obj)][j] == mostcolor(O)]
      if empty_indices:
        O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, subtract(empty_indices[-1], ulcorner(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate Colors and Objects:** Iterates through each color (excluding background) and then through objects of that color.
2. **Find Empty Index:**  Finds the rightmost empty index in the object's row.
3. **Shift and Paint:** Shifts the object to the empty index and paints it onto the grid.

**Version 4 (Utilizes `occurrences` function for potential efficiency):**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = I
  for c in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
    obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, True, True), c)) # Assuming all objects of same color are identical
    occurrences_indices = occurrences(I, obj)
    target_indices = sorted([ulcorner(recolor(c, {(i, j)})) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(row) if v == mostcolor(I) and (i, j) not in occurrences(I, obj)])
    for k in range(min(len(occurrences_indices), len(target_indices))):
      O = paint(cover(O, shift(obj, subtract(first(occurrences_indices), ORIGIN))), shift(obj, subtract(target_indices[k], ORIGIN)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find Occurrences and Targets:**  Finds all occurrences of an object of a specific color and all potential target locations (empty spaces).
2. **Move Objects:** Iterates through occurrences and moves each to a target location.

**Version 5 (Similar to V4, but directly calculates target indices):**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = I
  for c in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
    obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, True, True), c))
    for i, row in enumerate(O):
      empty_indices = [(i, j) for j, v in enumerate(row) if v == mostcolor(O)]
      if empty_indices:
        target_index = empty_indices[-1]
        O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, subtract(target_index, ulcorner(obj)))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through Colors and Objects:** Iterates through each color (excluding background) and then the first object of that color (assuming all objects of the same color are identical).
2. **Find Rightmost Empty Index:**  For each row, it identifies the rightmost empty index.
3. **Shift and Paint:** If an empty index is found, it calculates the shift needed to move the object to that index and paints the shifted object onto the grid after covering the original object. 


## Code Extraction:

Each "Program_to_be_generated" version is enclosed within a `def program_v{version_number}(I):` block, making it easy to copy and paste into your code interpreter. For example, to extract Version 1:

```
def program_v1(I):
  # ... copy code from Version 1 here ...
  return O
```

These programs are diverse in their approach while attempting to solve the given transformation task. Further analysis of the true transformation program's logic might be needed to achieve a perfect score of 0.
