## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The object with color '3' is moved from its position in the input and placed to the right of the object with color '5' in the top row. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:** 
* The object with color '6' is split into two single-cell objects. 
* These two single-cell objects are moved to the right end of the top two rows respectively.
* The object with color '4' is moved to the right end of the third row.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** 
* The two-celled object with color '2' is moved to the right end of the second row. 
* The two single-celled objects with color '8' are moved to the right of the object with color '5' in the top two rows respectively.
* The object with color '1' is moved to the right of object with color '5' in the fourth row. 

## Code Generation:

The provided programs focus on moving objects to the rightmost position. We need to refine this logic to handle splitting objects and placing them at specific positions within the row.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 1):**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    c = color(obj)
    if c == 6 and size(I) == astuple(4, 4):  # Handle splitting object with color 6
      top_cell = extract(obj, lambda cell: uppermost(cell) == uppermost(obj))
      bottom_cell = other(obj, top_cell)
      O = paint(O, shift(top_cell, (0, width(I) - 1)))
      O = paint(O, shift(bottom_cell, (1, width(I) - 1)))
    elif size(obj) == 1:  # Move single-cell objects to the rightmost
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (uppermost(obj), width(I) - 1)))
    else: # Retain other objects in their original position
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create a canvas `O` of the same shape as the input `I`, filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** Loop through each object in the input grid.
3. **Special Handling for Color 6:** If the object's color is 6 and the input size is (4,4), split the object into two single-cell objects and place them at the right end of the first and second row respectively.
4. **Move Single-Cell Objects:** If the object consists of a single cell, move it to the right end of its corresponding row.
5. **Retain Other Objects:**  For any other objects, paint them onto the output grid in their original position.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 2):**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj in sorted(fgpartition(I), key=lambda obj: (-color(obj), uppermost(obj))):
    if size(obj) == 1:
      target_j = width(I) - 1
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (uppermost(obj), target_j - leftmost(obj))))
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Sorted Iteration:** Sort the objects based on color (descending) and then uppermost row index to ensure correct placement order. 
3. **Single-Cell Movement:** Move single-cell objects to the right end of their row.
4. **Retain Other Objects:**  Keep the remaining objects in their original locations.


**Program_to_be_generated (Version 3):**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = I
  for c in palette(I):
    if colorcount(I, c) == 1:
        obj = extract(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == c)
        O = move(O, obj, (uppermost(obj), width(I) - 1 - rightmost(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Modification:** Instead of creating a new canvas, directly modify the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through Colors:** Loop through each color present in the input.
3. **Single-Color Objects:** If a color appears only once, find the corresponding object and move it to the right end of its row. 

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 4):**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v != bg:
        if colorcount(I, v) == 1:  
          O = paint(O, {(v, (i, width(I) - 1))})
        else:
          O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Cell-by-Cell Iteration:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
2. **Single-Color Check:** If the cell's color appears only once in the grid, paint it on the right end of the output row.
3. **Default Placement:**  Otherwise, paint the cell onto the output grid at its original location.


**Program_to_be_generated (Version 5):**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  single_objs = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) == 1)
  other_objs = objs - single_objs
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), other_objs)
  for obj in single_objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (uppermost(obj), width(I) - 1 - leftmost(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Separate Objects:** Divide the objects into two sets: single-cell objects and others.
2. **Paint Non-Single Cells:** Paint the non-single-cell objects onto a new canvas at their original locations.
3. **Place Single Cells:**  Iterate through the single-cell objects and paint them onto the canvas at the right end of their respective rows.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
