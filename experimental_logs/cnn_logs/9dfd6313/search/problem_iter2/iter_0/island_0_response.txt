## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving colored objects within their respective rows.  Here's a breakdown:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
* The object of `3`s moves from the leftmost position to the rightmost position within its row.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
* The object of `6`s merges into a single object and moves to the rightmost position of its row.
* The object of `4`s moves to the rightmost position within its row. 

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
* The object of `8`s splits, with one part remaining in its original position and the other moving to the rightmost position of its row.
* The object of `2`s merges into a single object and moves to the second position from the right within its row. 
* The object of `1`s moves to the rightmost position within its row.

Essentially, the transformation shifts objects rightward within their rows. Some objects merge, some split, and others remain intact.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, each with a different approach to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:** (Inspired by Program_B's color iteration and Program_A's conditional shifting)

```python
def program_v1(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for c in difference(palette(I), {bg}):
    obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, c), I)
    if colorcount(obj, c) == 1:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, width(I) - width(obj) - leftmost(obj))))
    else:
      obj_parts = objects(subgrid(obj, I), univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
      for part in obj_parts:
        O = paint(O, shift(part, (0, width(I) - width(part) - leftmost(part))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty canvas `O` with the same dimensions as the input grid `I`, filled with the background color.
2. **Color Iteration:** Iterate through each color `c` present in the input grid, excluding the background color.
3. **Object Extraction:** Extract the object `obj` of the current color `c`.
4. **Single Cell Object:** If the object consists of a single cell, it's directly shifted to the rightmost position in its row.
5. **Multi-cell Object:**  If the object has multiple cells:
   -  The object is split into individual parts `obj_parts`, treating each cell as a separate object.
   -  Each part is then shifted to the rightmost position within its row.
6. **Painting:**  Each shifted object or object part is painted onto the output canvas `O`. 

**Program Version 2:** (Inspired by Program_A's object-based approach and Program_B's use of `ofcolor`)

```python
def program_v2(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for c in difference(palette(row), {bg}):
      obj = toobject(ofcolor(row, c), I)
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, width(I) - width(obj) - leftmost(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to version 1, create an empty canvas `O`.
2. **Row-wise Iteration:**  Iterate through each row `row` of the input grid `I`.
3. **Color Iteration within Row:** For each row, iterate through each unique color `c`, excluding the background color.
4. **Object Extraction and Shifting:** Extract the object `obj` of the current color within the row and shift it to the rightmost position in the row.
5. **Painting:**  Paint the shifted object onto the output canvas `O`.

**Program Version 3:** (Inspired by Program_A's conditional logic and Program_B's direct object manipulation)

```python
def program_v3(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, width(I) - width(obj) - leftmost(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty canvas `O`.
2. **Object Partitioning:** Partition the input grid `I` into objects `objs` based on color, excluding the background.
3. **Object Shifting and Painting:** For each object, shift it to the rightmost position in its row and paint it onto the output canvas. 

**Program Version 4:** (Focuses on grid manipulation using `crop` and `hconcat`)

```python
def program_v4(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for c in difference(palette(row), {bg}):
      obj_start = next(j for j, v in enumerate(row) if v == c)
      obj_end = width(I) - next(j for j, v in enumerate(row[::-1]) if v == c)
      obj = crop(I, (i, obj_start), (1, obj_end - obj_start))
      empty = canvas(bg, (1, width(I) - width(obj)))
      O = vconcat(O, hconcat(empty, obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty canvas `O`.
2. **Row-wise and Color Iteration:** Similar to version 2, iterate through each row and color. 
3. **Object Boundaries:**  Find the starting and ending column indices (`obj_start`, `obj_end`) of the object within the row.
4. **Object and Empty Grid Extraction:** Extract the object using `crop` and create an empty grid `empty` of the remaining space in the row.
5. **Concatenation and Painting:** Concatenate the `empty` grid and the `obj` horizontally and then concatenate the result to the output canvas `O` vertically.

**Program Version 5:** (Emphasizes object manipulation using `hmirror` and slicing)

```python
def program_v5(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for c in difference(palette(row), {bg}):
      obj_indices = [j for j, v in enumerate(row) if v == c]
      obj_width = max(obj_indices) - min(obj_indices) + 1
      obj = toobject(ofcolor(row, c), I)
      mirrored_obj = hmirror(obj)
      shifted_obj = shift(mirrored_obj, (0, width(I) - leftmost(mirrored_obj) - obj_width))
      O = paint(O, shifted_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty canvas `O`.
2. **Row-wise and Color Iteration:**  Iterate through each row and color.
3. **Object Indices and Width:**  Find the column indices where the object's color occurs and calculate the object's width.
4. **Mirroring and Shifting:**  Extract the object, mirror it horizontally, and then shift the mirrored object to the rightmost position in the row.
5. **Painting:** Paint the shifted and mirrored object onto the output canvas `O`.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to solving the given transformation problem using the provided DSL. Each version utilizes a unique combination of functions, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for spatial reasoning tasks.
