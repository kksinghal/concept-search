## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

The object with color '3' is moved one position to the right. All other objects remain in their original positions.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

* The two objects with color '6' are moved to the rightmost columns of the grid, maintaining their relative vertical positions.
* The object with color '4' is moved to the bottom right corner of the grid.

**Input 2 to Output 2:**

* One of the '8' colored objects is moved to the right of the other.
* Two new '2' colored objects appear to the right of the rightmost '8'.
* The object with color '1' is moved to the bottom row, one position to the left of the rightmost column. 

## Code Generation:

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 1):**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    c = color(obj)
    if c == 3:
      O = move(O, obj, (0, 1))
    elif c == 6:
      O = move(O, obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj)))
    elif c == 8:
      other_obj = extract(objects(O, T, T, T) - {obj}, lambda o: color(o) == 8)
      if other_obj:
        O = move(O, obj, (0, rightmost(other_obj) - leftmost(obj) + 1))
    elif c == 4:
      O = move(O, obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj), width(I) - rightmost(obj)))
    elif c == 1:
      O = move(O, obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj), width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1))
    elif c == 2 and colorcount(I, c) == 0:
      target = extract(objects(O, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == 8)
      O = paint(O, shift({(2, (uppermost(target) - 1, rightmost(target) + 1)), (2, (uppermost(target), rightmost(target) + 1))}, (0, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version iterates through each object in the input grid.
* For colors 3, 6, 4, and 1, it applies specific movement rules based on their target positions in the output.
* For color 8, it checks for the existence of another '8' object and moves it to its right.
* For color 2, which is newly introduced, it finds the '8' object and paints two '2's to its right. 

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 2):**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for c in sorted(palette(I)):
    for obj in sizefilter(objects(I, T, T, T), colorcount(I, c)):
      if c == 3:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 1)))
      elif c == 6:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj))))
      elif c == 8:
        if colorcount(O, c) == 1:
          O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 1)))
        else:
          O = paint(O, obj)
      elif c == 4:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj), width(I) - rightmost(obj))))
      elif c == 1:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj), width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1)))
      elif c == 2 and colorcount(I, c) == 0:
        target_8 = extract(objects(O, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == 8)
        O = paint(O, shift({(2, (uppermost(target_8) - 1, rightmost(target_8) + 1)), (2, (uppermost(target_8), rightmost(target_8) + 1))}, (0, 0)))
      else:
        O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version initializes the output grid as a blank canvas.
* It iterates through each color and its corresponding objects.
* It applies specific painting rules for each color based on their target positions, handling the new '2's and the movement of '8's.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 3):**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    c = color(obj)
    if c == 3:
      O = move(O, obj, (0, 1))
    elif c == 6:
      O = move(O, obj, (0, width(O) - rightmost(obj)))
    elif c == 8 and any(color(o) == 8 and rightmost(o) > rightmost(obj) for o in objects(O, T, T, T)):
      O = move(O, obj, (0, 1))
    elif c == 4:
      O = move(O, obj, (height(O) - lowermost(obj), width(O) - rightmost(obj)))
    elif c == 1:
      O = move(O, obj, (height(O) - lowermost(obj), width(O) - rightmost(obj) - 1))
    elif c == 2 and colorcount(I, c) == 0:
      target = extract(objects(O, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == 8)
      O = paint(O, {(2, (uppermost(target) - 1, rightmost(target) + 1)), (2, (uppermost(target), rightmost(target) + 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Similar to version 1, this version iterates through objects and applies movement rules.
* It uses a more concise condition to check if an '8' needs to be moved right, looking for another '8' to its right.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 4):**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = I
  if colorcount(I, 2) == 0:
    target_8 = extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == 8)
    O = paint(O, {(2, (uppermost(target_8) - 1, rightmost(target_8) + 1)), (2, (uppermost(target_8), rightmost(target_8) + 1))})
  for c in sorted(palette(I) - {2}):
    for obj in sizefilter(objects(I, T, T, T), colorcount(I, c)):
      if c == 3:
        O = move(O, obj, (0, 1))
      elif c == 6:
        O = move(O, obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj)))
      elif c == 8 and any(color(o) == 8 and rightmost(o) > rightmost(obj) for o in objects(O, T, T, T)):
        O = move(O, obj, (0, 1))
      elif c == 4:
        O = move(O, obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj), width(I) - rightmost(obj)))
      elif c == 1:
        O = move(O, obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj), width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version first handles the special case of adding '2's if they are not present in the input.
* Then, it iterates through the remaining colors and applies similar movement rules as in version 3.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 5):**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    c = color(obj)
    if c == 3:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 1)))
    elif c == 6:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, width(I) - rightmost(obj))))
    elif c == 8:
      if colorcount(O, 8) == 1:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 1)))
      else:
        O = paint(O, obj)
    elif c == 4:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj), width(I) - rightmost(obj))))
    elif c == 1:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (height(I) - lowermost(obj), width(I) - rightmost(obj) - 1)))
    elif c == 2 and colorcount(I, 2) == 0:
      target_8 = extract(objects(O, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == 8)
      O = paint(O, shift({(2, (0, 0)), (2, (0, 1))}, (uppermost(target_8) - 1, rightmost(target_8) + 1)))
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version combines elements from previous versions. It initializes a blank canvas but iterates through objects instead of colors.
* It applies painting rules for each object based on color and existing objects on the canvas.
* It uses a simplified approach to positioning the new '2' objects relative to the '8' object. 

Each version of the code above aims to achieve the desired transformations for the given input-output pairs using different logic or combinations of DSL functions. They showcase various approaches to solving the problem, offering a diverse set of solutions.
