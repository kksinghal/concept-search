## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve taking the rightmost column of each distinct color in the input grid and moving it to the leftmost available position while maintaining the original row order.

**Input_0:** 
- The rightmost '3' column moves to the leftmost available position in the same row.

**Input_1:**
- The rightmost '6' column moves to the leftmost available position in the same row.
- The rightmost '4' column moves to the leftmost available position in the same row.

**Input_2:**
- The rightmost '8' column moves to the leftmost available position in the same row.
- The rightmost '2' column moves to the leftmost available position in the same row.
- The rightmost '1' column moves to the leftmost available position in the same row.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for c in palette(I) - {bg}:
    obj = frozenset((c, (i, j)) for i, r in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(r) if v == c)
    target_j = 0
    while any(index(O, (i, target_j)) != bg for i in range(height(I))):
      target_j += 1
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, target_j - rightmost(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialization:**
    - `bg = mostcolor(I)`: Identify the background color.
    - `O = canvas(bg, shape(I))`: Create an empty output grid filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate through Colors:**
    - `for c in palette(I) - {bg}:`: Loop through each color in the input grid except the background.
3. **Process each Color:**
    - `obj = frozenset((c, (i, j)) for i, r in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(r) if v == c)`: Create an object representing all cells of the current color.
    - `target_j = 0`: Initialize the target column index to 0 (leftmost).
    - `while any(index(O, (i, target_j)) != bg for i in range(height(I))): target_j += 1`: Find the first available (empty) column from left to right.
    - `O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, target_j - rightmost(obj))))`: Shift the object horizontally to the target column and paint it on the output grid.
4. **Return Output:**
    - `return O`: Return the transformed output grid.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  processed = initset(bg)
  for j in range(width(I)-1, -1, -1):  # Iterate columns right to left
    for i in range(height(I)):
      c = index(I, (i, j))
      if c not in processed:
        obj = frozenset((c, (k, l)) for k, r in enumerate(I) for l, v in enumerate(r) if v == c)
        target_j = 0
        while any(index(O, (k, target_j)) != bg for k in range(height(I))):
          target_j += 1
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, target_j - rightmost(obj))))
        processed = insert(c, processed)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Iterate Columns Right to Left:** 
   - `for j in range(width(I)-1, -1, -1):`: Process columns from right to left to ensure correct placement.
3. **Process each Cell:**
   - `for i in range(height(I)):`: Loop through rows for the current column.
   - `c = index(I, (i, j))`: Get the color of the current cell.
   - `if c not in processed:`: Check if the color has already been processed.
     - If not processed, extract the object, find the target column, shift, and paint it on the output grid (similar to Version 1).
     - Mark the color as processed.
4. **Return Output:** Similar to Version 1.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  available_cols = list(range(width(I)))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    c = color(obj)
    target_j = available_cols.pop(0)  # Get and remove the first available column
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, target_j - rightmost(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Track Available Columns:**
   - `available_cols = list(range(width(I)))`: Create a list representing all columns, initially available.
3. **Iterate through Objects:**
   - `for obj in fgpartition(I):`: Loop through each object in the input grid.
4. **Place Each Object:**
   - `target_j = available_cols.pop(0)`: Assign the leftmost available column to `target_j` and remove it from the list.
   - `O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, target_j - rightmost(obj))))`: Shift and paint the object to the assigned column.
5. **Return Output:** Similar to Version 1.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  objs = sorted(fgpartition(I), key=lambda obj: (-rightmost(obj), color(obj)))
  for obj in objs:
    target_j = 0
    while any(index(O, (i, target_j)) != bg for i in range(height(I))):
      target_j += 1
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, target_j - rightmost(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Sort Objects:**
   - `objs = sorted(fgpartition(I), key=lambda obj: (-rightmost(obj), color(obj)))`: Sort objects based on their rightmost column (descending) and then color. This ensures correct placement order.
3. **Place Objects:**
   - Iterate through the sorted objects and place them in the leftmost available column (similar to Version 1).
4. **Return Output:** Similar to Version 1.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)-1, -1, -1):
    col = frozenset((index(I, (i, j)), (i, j)) for i in range(height(I)))
    for c, (i, _) in col:
      if c != bg and index(O, (i, 0)) == bg:  # Check if color needs moving and target is empty
        obj = frozenset((c, (k, l)) for k, r in enumerate(I) for l, v in enumerate(r) if v == c)
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, -rightmost(obj))))
        break  # Move only one column per original column
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Iterate Columns Right to Left:** Similar to Version 2.
3. **Process each Column as a Set:**
   - `col = frozenset((index(I, (i, j)), (i, j)) for i in range(height(I)))`: Represent each column as a set of (color, location) tuples.
4. **Move First Unplaced Color:**
   - Iterate through colors in the column set.
   - `if c != bg and index(O, (i, 0)) == bg:`: If the color is not background and its target position is empty:
     - Extract the object.
     - Shift it to the leftmost position.
     - `break`: Move only one column per original column to avoid overwriting.
5. **Return Output:** Similar to Version 1.


These five versions use different strategies and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the diversity of solutions possible.
