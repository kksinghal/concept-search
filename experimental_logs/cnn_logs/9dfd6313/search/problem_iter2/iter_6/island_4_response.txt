## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving objects within their respective columns to the top of the column while maintaining their original order. The background color (most common color) fills the space vacated by the objects.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The '3' in the second row, first column moves to the top of its column.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- In the third column, '6' moves above '5', and in the fourth column, '6' moves above '4'.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
-  Objects in the third and fourth columns are moved upwards, filling the spaces from the top.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for v in sorted(palette(crop(I, (0, j), (height(I), 1))) - {mostcolor(I)}):
      obj = extract(objects(O, True, True, True), lambda o: color(o) == v and leftmost(o) == j)
      O = cover(O, obj)
      O = paint(O, shift(normalize(obj), (uppermost(ofcolor(O, v) | {(height(I), j)}), j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns:** Loop through each column `j` of the input grid `I`.
2. **Identify unique colors:** For each column, identify unique object colors (`v`) excluding the background color.
3. **Extract and move objects:** 
    - `obj = extract(objects(O, True, True, True), lambda o: color(o) == v and leftmost(o) == j)` extracts the object of color `v` in the current column.
    - `O = cover(O, obj)` removes the object from the grid.
    - `O = paint(O, shift(normalize(obj), (uppermost(ofcolor(O, v) | {(height(I), j)}), j)))` paints the object back onto the grid at the topmost available position in the same column. The `ofcolor(O, v) | {(height(I), j)}` ensures that even if no cell of color `v` is present, the object is placed at the top of the column.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in sorted(objects(I, True, True, True), key=lambda o: (leftmost(o), uppermost(o))):
    target_j = leftmost(obj)
    O = paint(O, shift(normalize(obj), (uppermost(ofcolor(O, color(obj)) | {(height(I), target_j)}), target_j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create empty canvas:** Initialize an output grid `O` with the same dimensions as the input grid `I`, filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate through objects:** Loop through each object in the input, sorted by their column and then row position.
3. **Place objects:**
    - For each object, determine its target column `target_j`.
    - Paint the object onto the canvas `O` at the topmost available position within its target column. 

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for j in range(width(I)):
        column = crop(I, (0, j), (height(I), 1))
        non_bg_colors = sorted(palette(column) - {mostcolor(I)})
        next_i = 0
        for v in non_bg_colors:
            obj = extract(objects(column, True, True, True), lambda o: color(o) == v)
            O = cover(O, obj)
            O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj) + next_i, 0)))
            next_i += height(obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns:**  Loop through each column of the input grid.
2. **Process each color:** For each non-background color in the column:
    - Extract the corresponding object.
    - Cover the object in the output grid.
    - Paint the object at the top of the column, keeping track of the next available row (`next_i`).

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for j in range(width(I)):
        column_objects = sorted(
            (obj for obj in objects(I, True, True, True) if leftmost(obj) == j),
            key=lambda o: uppermost(o)
        )
        current_i = 0
        for obj in column_objects:
            O = paint(O, shift(normalize(obj), (current_i, j)))
            current_i += height(obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create empty canvas:** Similar to version 2, start with a canvas filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate through columns:** Loop through each column of the input grid.
3. **Sort and place objects:**
    - Extract all objects within the current column and sort them by their uppermost row.
    - Place each object onto the canvas at the top of the column, starting from row 0 and updating the current row (`current_i`) accordingly.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for j in range(width(I)):
        column_indices = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(height(I)))
        for v in sorted(palette(crop(I, (0, j), (height(I), 1))) - {mostcolor(I)}):
            obj = toobject(intersection(column_indices, toindices(extract(objects(I, True, True, True), lambda o: color(o) == v))), I)
            O = cover(O, obj)
            O = paint(O, shift(normalize(obj), (uppermost(ofcolor(O, v) | {(height(I), j)}), j)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns:** Loop through each column of the input grid.
2. **Identify object indices:**
   - `column_indices` represents all indices within the current column.
   - For each non-background color in the column, find the object in the input grid `I` and determine its intersection with the `column_indices` to get the precise indices of the object within that column.
3. **Extract, cover, and paint:** Similar to other versions, extract the object using `toobject`, cover it in the output grid, and paint it back at the topmost available position in the same column.

These five versions offer distinct approaches to solving the transformation problem while utilizing the provided DSL functions. Each version demonstrates a different combination of logic and function calls to achieve the desired outcome.
