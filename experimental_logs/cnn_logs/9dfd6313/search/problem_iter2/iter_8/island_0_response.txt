## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The isolated digit '3' moves to the right of the first '5' it encounters in its row.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** The isolated digits '6' move to join the other '6' in their row. The isolated '4' moves to the bottom-right corner of the grid.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The isolated '8's move to join the other '8's, forming a square. The two isolated '2's move to the right of the '8' square. The isolated '1' moves to the right of the '5' in its row. 


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions, along with explanations of their logic:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj in sorted(fgpartition(I), key=lambda obj: (-color(obj), uppermost(obj))):
    if size(obj) == 1:
      same_color_objs = sfilter(fgpartition(I), lambda o: color(o) == color(obj) and size(o) > 1)
      if same_color_objs:
        target_obj = argmin(same_color_objs, lambda o: manhattan(obj, o))
        target_j = leftmost(target_obj) + width(target_obj)
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (uppermost(obj), target_j - leftmost(obj))))
      else:
        target_j = width(I) - 1
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (uppermost(obj), target_j - leftmost(obj))))
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Creates an empty output grid (`O`) of the same size as the input grid (`I`), filled with the background color.
2. **Object Iteration:**  Iterates through foreground objects, sorted by color (descending) and then uppermost row.
3. **Isolated Digit Handling:** If an object is an isolated digit (`size(obj) == 1`):
    - **Find Target:**  It searches for other objects of the same color that are not isolated. If found, it picks the closest one (`argmin` with `manhattan` distance).
    - **Calculate Target Position:**  The target column (`target_j`) is set to be immediately to the right of the target object.
    - **Move:**  The isolated digit is moved to the target position.
4. **Non-Isolated Object Handling:** If an object is not an isolated digit, it is painted directly onto the output grid at its original position.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  for obj in objs:
    if size(obj) == 1:
      same_color_locs = ofcolor(I, color(obj)) - toindices(obj)
      if same_color_locs:
        target_loc = argmin(same_color_locs, lambda loc: manhattan(obj, initset(loc)))
        O = paint(O, {(color(obj), target_loc)})
      else:
        i, j = first(toindices(obj))
        O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, width(I) - 1))})
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1, initializes an empty output grid (`O`).
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through foreground objects.
3. **Isolated Digit Handling:**  If the object is an isolated digit:
    - **Find Target Location:** It searches for other cells in the grid with the same color as the isolated digit. If found, it chooses the closest location (`argmin` with `manhattan` distance).
    - **Move:** The isolated digit is moved to the target location.
4. **Non-Isolated Object Handling:**  Non-isolated objects are painted directly onto the output grid at their original positions.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for v in palette(I) - {bg}:
    obj = frozenset((v, loc) for loc in ofcolor(I, v))
    if size(obj) == 1:
      i, j = first(toindices(obj))
      O = paint(O, {(v, (i, width(I) - 1))})
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty output grid (`O`).
2. **Color Iteration:**  Iterates through each color present in the input grid, excluding the background color.
3. **Object Construction:** Constructs a single object containing all cells of the current color.
4. **Isolated Digit Handling:**  If the constructed object only has one cell (isolated digit):
    - **Move:**  The isolated digit is moved to the rightmost column on its original row.
5. **Non-Isolated Object Handling:** If the constructed object has multiple cells, it is painted directly onto the output grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    row_objs = objects(crop(I, (i, 0), (1, width(I))), univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
    for j, obj in enumerate(sorted(row_objs, key=lambda o: leftmost(o))):
      if size(obj) == 1:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, width(I) - j - 1)))
      else:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, j * width(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty output grid (`O`).
2. **Row-wise Processing:**  Iterates through each row of the input grid.
3. **Object Extraction:** Extracts objects from the current row, treating each cell as a separate object (`univalued=False`).
4. **Object Sorting:** Sorts objects in the row by their leftmost column position.
5. **Isolated Digit Handling:** If an object is an isolated digit:
    - **Move:** It's moved to the rightmost available position based on its sorted order in the row.
6. **Non-Isolated Object Handling:** If an object is not an isolated digit:
    - **Move:** It's placed at a position determined by its sorted order, ensuring objects are packed together from left to right.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  painted = canvas(False, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    j = 0
    for v in row:
      if v != bg:
        while painted[i][j]: 
          j += 1
        O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j))})
        painted[i][j] = True
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Creates an empty output grid (`O`) and a "painted" grid of the same size, initialized with `False` values. The "painted" grid keeps track of which cells in the output grid have already been filled.
2. **Row and Cell Iteration:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
3. **Non-Background Color Handling:** If a cell's value is not the background color:
   - **Find Empty Position:** It finds the next available empty position (`j`) in the same row of the output grid.
   - **Paint and Mark:** It paints the cell's value at the found position in the output grid and marks the position as "painted."


## Code Extraction:

Each "Program_to_be_generated" block represents the complete code for that version. You can directly copy and paste them into your environment for testing.
