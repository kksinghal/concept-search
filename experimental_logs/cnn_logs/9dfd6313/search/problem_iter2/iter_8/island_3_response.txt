## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The '3' object moves from its position to the right of the '5' object to its left, while maintaining its position within the row.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** 
* The '6' object moves from the bottom-left to the top-right, staying aligned with the '5' object.
* The '4' object moves one position to the right, staying aligned with the '5' object.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
* The '8' object moves from the bottom-left to the top-right, aligning with the top '5' object.
* A new '2' object is created, consisting of two cells, and is placed to the right of the top-right '8'.
* The '1' object moves one position to the right, aligning with the bottom '5' object.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    c = color(obj)
    if c == 3:
      O = move(O, obj, (0, -rightmost(obj)))
    elif c == 6:
      O = move(O, obj, (-lowermost(obj), width(I)-rightmost(obj)-1))
    elif c == 8:
      O = move(O, obj, (-lowermost(obj), width(I)-rightmost(obj)))
      O = paint(O, {(2, (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)), (2, (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 2))})
    elif c == 1:
      O = move(O, obj, (0, 1))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  The output grid `O` is initialized as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Object Iteration:**  The program iterates through each object in the input grid.
3. **Color-Specific Transformations:**
   - **Color 3:** The object is moved to the leftmost position on its row.
   - **Color 6:** The object is moved to the top-right corner, aligning with the top '5' object.
   - **Color 8:** The object is moved to the top-right, aligning with the top '5', and two '2' cells are painted to its right.
   - **Color 1:** The object is moved one position to the right.

**Program Version 2:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for c in sorted(palette(I)):
    for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
      if color(obj) == c:
        if c == 3:
          O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, -rightmost(obj))))
        elif c == 6:
          O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-lowermost(obj), width(I)-rightmost(obj)-1)))
        elif c == 8:
          O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-lowermost(obj), width(I)-rightmost(obj))))
          O = paint(O, {(2, (0, width(O)-2)), (2, (0, width(O)-1))})
        elif c == 1:
          O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 1)))
        else:
          O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** A blank canvas `O` is created with the same shape as the input, filled with the most common color.
2. **Color and Object Iteration:** The program iterates through each color and then each object of that color.
3. **Color-Specific Painting:**
   - **Color 3:** The object is painted at the leftmost position on its original row.
   - **Color 6:** The object is painted at the top-right corner, aligned with the top '5' object.
   - **Color 8:** The object is painted at the top-right, aligned with the top '5', and two '2' cells are painted at the two rightmost positions of the top row.
   - **Color 1:** The object is painted one position to the right of its original location.
   - **Other Colors:** The object is painted at its original location.

**Program Version 3:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  three = extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == 3)
  six = extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == 6)
  eight = extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == 8)
  one = extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == 1)
  if three is not None:
    O = move(O, three, (0, -rightmost(three)))
  if six is not None:
    O = move(O, six, (-lowermost(six), width(I)-rightmost(six)-1))
  if eight is not None:
    O = move(O, eight, (-lowermost(eight), width(I)-rightmost(eight)))
    O = paint(O, {(2, (0, width(O)-2)), (2, (0, width(O)-1))})
  if one is not None:
    O = move(O, one, (0, 1))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** The program first extracts the objects of colors 3, 6, 8, and 1 from the input grid, if they exist. 
2. **Conditional Movement and Painting:** 
   - If an object of a specific color is found, it is moved or painted according to the rules described in the previous versions.
   - If an object of a specific color is not found, no action is taken for that color.

**Program Version 4:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    if color(obj) == 3:
      O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (0, -rightmost(obj))))
    elif color(obj) == 6:
      O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (-lowermost(obj), width(I)-rightmost(obj)-1)))
    elif color(obj) == 8:
      O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (-lowermost(obj), width(I)-rightmost(obj))))
      O = paint(O, {(2, (0, width(O)-2)), (2, (0, width(O)-1))})
    elif color(obj) == 1:
      O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (0, 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Iteration:** The program iterates through each object in the input grid.
2. **Color-Specific Cover, Shift, and Paint:**
   - For each object, based on its color, it is first covered (removed) from its original position, then shifted to its new position, and finally painted onto the output grid. 
   - The '2' cells for color 8 are painted directly onto the output grid after the '8' object is moved.

**Program Version 5:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for c in palette(I):
    obj = extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == c)
    if obj is not None:
      if c == 3:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, -rightmost(obj))))
      elif c == 6:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-lowermost(obj), width(I)-rightmost(obj)-1)))
      elif c == 8:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-lowermost(obj), width(I)-rightmost(obj))))
        O = paint(O, {(2, (0, width(O)-2)), (2, (0, width(O)-1))})
      elif c == 1:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 1)))
      else:
        O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** A blank canvas `O` is created with the same shape as the input, filled with the most common color.
2. **Color and Object Iteration:** The program iterates through each color in the palette and attempts to extract an object of that color.
3. **Conditional Painting:**
   - If an object of the current color is found, it is shifted and painted onto the canvas based on its color, following the same rules as in previous versions.
   - If no object of the current color is found, nothing is painted for that color.

These versions showcase different approaches to achieving the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic structures. Each version offers a unique perspective on how to solve the task, demonstrating the flexibility and power of the provided DSL.
