## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving all non-background digits in the input grid to the right, filling the vacated spaces with the background color (0). The movement of each digit depends on its value:

* **Input_0:** The '3' moves one step right.
* **Input_1:** The '6's move two steps right, and the '4' moves one step right.
* **Input_2:** The '8's move two steps right, the '2's move two steps right, and the '1' moves one step right.

Therefore, the transformation can be generalized as: **Move each non-background digit 'n' steps to the right, where 'n' is the value of the digit itself.**


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    value = color(obj)
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, value)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`**: Initializes an empty output grid 'O' with the same dimensions as the input grid 'I', filled with the background color (0).
2. **`for obj in fgpartition(I)`**: Iterates through each object (group of connected cells with the same color) in the input grid, excluding the background.
3. **`value = color(obj)`**:  Gets the color (digit value) of the current object.
4. **`O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, value)))`**:  Shifts the object 'value' steps to the right and paints it onto the output grid 'O'.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value != ZERO:
        O = paint(cover(O, {(value, (i, j))}), {(value, (i, j + value))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`**: Initializes the output grid 'O' as a copy of the input grid 'I'.
2. **`for i, row in enumerate(I)`**: Iterates through each row 'i' of the input grid.
3. **`for j, value in enumerate(row)`**: Iterates through each cell 'j' and its value in the current row.
4. **`if value != ZERO`**: Checks if the current cell is not background.
5. **`O = paint(cover(O, {(value, (i, j))}), {(value, (i, j + value))})`**: 
    * Removes the current non-background digit from the output grid.
    * Paints the digit back onto the output grid, shifted 'value' steps to the right.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for value in palette(I) - {ZERO}:
    indices = ofcolor(I, value)
    O = paint(cover(O, toobject(indices, I)), toobject(shift(indices, (0, value)), I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`**: Initializes the output grid 'O' as a copy of the input grid 'I'.
2. **`for value in palette(I) - {ZERO}`**: Iterates through each unique non-background color (digit) in the input grid.
3. **`indices = ofcolor(I, value)`**: Retrieves the indices of all cells with the current color.
4. **`O = paint(cover(O, toobject(indices, I)), toobject(shift(indices, (0, value)), I))`**:
    * Removes all occurrences of the current color from the output grid.
    * Shifts the indices of those occurrences 'value' steps to the right.
    * Paints the color back onto the output grid at the shifted indices.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      value = index(I, (i, j))
      if value != ZERO:
        O = paint(O, {(value, (i, j + value))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`**: Initializes an empty output grid 'O' with the same dimensions as the input grid 'I'.
2. **`for i in range(height(I))`**: Iterates through each row 'i' of the input grid.
3. **`for j in range(width(I))`**: Iterates through each column 'j' of the current row.
4. **`value = index(I, (i, j))`**:  Retrieves the value (digit) at the current cell (i, j).
5. **`if value != ZERO`**: Checks if the current cell is not background.
6. **`O = paint(O, {(value, (i, j + value))})`**: Paints the current digit onto the output grid, shifted 'value' steps to the right.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(ZERO, (h, w))
  for i, r in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(r):
      if v:
        O = paint(O, {(v, (i, (j + v) % w))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h, w = shape(I)`**:  Gets the height and width of the input grid 'I'.
2. **`O = canvas(ZERO, (h, w))`**: Initializes an empty output grid 'O' with the same dimensions as the input grid 'I'.
3. **`for i, r in enumerate(I)`**: Iterates through each row 'i' of the input grid.
4. **`for j, v in enumerate(r)`**: Iterates through each cell 'j' and its value 'v' in the current row.
5. **`if v`**: Checks if the current cell is not background (0 is falsy).
6. **`O = paint(O, {(v, (i, (j + v) % w))})`**:  Paints the current digit onto the output grid at a shifted column calculated with `(j + v) % w`, ensuring the shift wraps around the grid boundaries.

These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation by utilizing different combinations of DSL functions and logic, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for spatial reasoning tasks.
