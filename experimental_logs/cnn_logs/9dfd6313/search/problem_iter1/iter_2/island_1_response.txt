## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to apply the following rules:

* **Object Isolation:**  Each unique digit in the input grid is treated as a distinct object.
* **Horizontal Shift:** Objects are shifted horizontally based on their values.
    * Odd-valued objects remain in their original columns.
    * Even-valued objects are shifted to the right. The amount of shift seems to correlate with the object's value.
* **Vertical Stacking:** After the shift, objects are vertically stacked within their new columns, maintaining their relative order from the input grid.

**Example Breakdown (Input_1 to Output_1):**

1. **Object Isolation:** The digits 5, 6, and 4 are identified as separate objects.
2. **Horizontal Shift:** 
    * The '5' objects remain in their original columns.
    * The '6' objects (even) are shifted rightward.
    * The '4' object (even) is also shifted rightward.
3. **Vertical Stacking:** In the output grid:
    * The '5' objects are stacked in their original columns.
    * The '6' objects are stacked in their new column, maintaining their input order.
    * The '4' object is positioned above the '5' in its new column.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for v in palette(I):
    obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, v), I)
    offset = (0, (v // 2) * 2) if even(v) else (0, 0)  # Even values shift right
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, offset))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Initialization:** `O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))` creates an empty grid of the same size as the input, filled with zeros.
2. **Iterate through Colors (Values):** The code iterates through each unique digit (color) present in the input grid.
3. **Object Extraction and Shift:**
   * `obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, v), I)` extracts the object formed by the current digit 'v'.
   *  `offset = (0, (v // 2) * 2)` calculates the horizontal shift for even values. It shifts the object rightward by twice the result of integer division of the value by 2. 
   * `O = paint(O, shift(obj, offset))` shifts the object and paints it onto the output grid.
4. **Return Output:** The function returns the transformed grid 'O'.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, F)
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    v = color(obj)
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, (v//2)*2) if even(v) else (0, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version first extracts all objects from the input using `objects(I, T, T, F)`. 
* It then iterates over each object, calculates the shift based on the object's color (value), and paints the shifted object onto the output canvas.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(ZERO, (h, w * 2))  # Create a wider canvas
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      v = I[i][j]
      O[i][j + (v // 2) * 2] = v  # Shift while painting
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version directly manipulates grid indices. It creates a wider output canvas (`w * 2`) to accommodate the rightward shifts.
* It iterates through each cell of the input and calculates the new column index based on the cell's value, directly placing the value in the output grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, v in enumerate(row):
            O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j + (v//2) * 2))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version is similar to Version 3 but uses the `paint` function to place individual cells on the output canvas after calculating their shifted positions.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = cover(I, asindices(I))  # Start with a blank canvas
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, F):
    v = color(obj)
    new_obj = {(v, (i, j + (v // 2) * 2)) for v, (i, j) in obj} # Shift object
    O = paint(O, new_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version first creates a blank canvas by covering the input grid with its background color.
* It then iterates over each object, calculates the new positions of its cells based on the object's color, and paints the shifted object onto the canvas. 

These are just five examples. Many other valid DSL programs could achieve the same transformation. The key is to combine the available functions in a way that implements the identified logic of object isolation, horizontal shifting based on value, and vertical stacking.
