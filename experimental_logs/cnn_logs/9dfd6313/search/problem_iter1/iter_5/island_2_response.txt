## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
The transformation shifts the leftmost column of non-background digits one position to the right.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
The transformation moves each column of non-background digits to the rightmost available position in its respective row. 

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
The transformation moves each non-background digit to the rightmost available position within its row.

## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
    # Identify non-background objects
    objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
    # Shift each object to the rightmost position in its row
    shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, width(I) - 1 - rightmost(toindices(obj)))), objs)
    # Paint the shifted objects onto a blank canvas
    O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(shifted_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We begin by identifying all non-background objects in the input grid `I` using the `objects` function with `without_bg=True`.
2. **Calculate Shift:** For each object, we calculate the required horizontal shift to move it to the rightmost position. This is achieved by subtracting the column index of the object's rightmost cell (`rightmost(toindices(obj))`) from `width(I) - 1` (the index of the rightmost column). 
3. **Shift Objects:** Using `mapply`, we apply the `shift` function with the calculated horizontal shift to each object, creating a new set of shifted objects.
4. **Paint to Canvas:**  Finally, we create a blank canvas using `canvas` with the background color (`mostcolor(I)`) and dimensions of the input grid (`shape(I)`). We then paint the merged set of shifted objects (`merge(shifted_objs)`) onto this canvas using the `paint` function.


**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for i in range(height(I)):
        row_objs = sfilter(objects(crop(I, (i, 0), (1, width(I))), univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), lambda obj: len(obj) > 0)
        for obj in row_objs:
            O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, width(I) - 1 - rightmost(toindices(obj)))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:**  A blank canvas `O` is created with the background color and dimensions of the input grid.
2. **Iterate Rows:** The code iterates through each row of the input grid `I`.
3. **Extract Row Objects:**  For each row, it crops the grid to that specific row and identifies non-background objects within that row using `objects` function. Objects with zero cells are filtered out.
4. **Shift and Paint:** Each object in the row is then shifted to the rightmost position (calculated similarly to Version 1) and painted onto the canvas `O`.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    for j in range(width(I)-1, -1, -1):
        for i in range(height(I)):
            if index(I, (i,j)) != mostcolor(I):
                O = move(O, {(index(I, (i,j)), (i,j))}, (0, width(O) - 1 - j))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Columns and Rows:** This version iterates through each column of the input grid from right to left and then through each row within that column.
2. **Move Non-Background Cells:** If a cell contains a non-background color, it is moved to the rightmost available position in its row. 

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
    shifted_cells = set()
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val != mostcolor(I):
                shifted_cells.add((val, (i, width(I) - 1 - j)))
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), frozenset(shifted_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Shift Cells:** This version directly iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`. If a cell is not a background color, its position is modified to the rightmost column of the corresponding row, and this new cell information is stored in the `shifted_cells` set.
2. **Paint to Canvas:** Finally, all shifted cells are painted onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = tuple()
    for row in I:
        newRow = tuple(v for v in row if v == mostcolor(I)) + tuple(v for v in row if v != mostcolor(I))
        O = O + (newRow,)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Reconstruct Rows:** This version directly manipulates the tuples representing the rows of the input grid. For each row, it creates a new tuple where background cells are placed first, followed by non-background cells, effectively moving all non-background cells to the rightmost positions.
2. **Combine Rows:** Finally, the modified rows are combined to form the output grid `O`.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to solving the transformation problem, using different DSL functions and logic. Each version achieves the same output as required by the task.
