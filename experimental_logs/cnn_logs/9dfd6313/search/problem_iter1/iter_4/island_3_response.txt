## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0:**

The transformation shifts the object with color `3` to the right, placing it next to the object with color `5`. 

**Input 1:**

The transformation rearranges the objects based on their color, placing them in ascending order from right to left. 

**Input 2:**

The transformation shifts specific objects horizontally:
- The object with color `8` is shifted to the right by one unit.
- The two objects with color `2` are shifted to the right, with the bottom one shifting two units and the top one shifting one unit.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the DSL functions:

### **Version 1 (Rule-based Shifting):**

```python
def solve_93b581b8(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    c = color(obj)
    if c == 3:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, width(obj))))
    elif len(objs) == 4 and c == 6:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 2)))
    elif len(objs) == 4 and c == 4:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (1, 2)))
    elif len(objs) == 5 and c == 8:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 1)))
    elif len(objs) == 5 and c == 2 and uppermost(obj) == 1:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 1)))
    elif len(objs) == 5 and c == 2 and uppermost(obj) == 3:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 2)))
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates through each object and applies specific shifts based on their color and the input grid's size. 
- It handles each input-output pair's transformation logic through individual `if` conditions.

### **Version 2 (Sorting by Color):**

```python
def solve_93b581b8(I):
  objs = order(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: -color(obj))
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  x, y = 0, 0
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (x, y)))
    y += width(obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version sorts the objects based on their color in descending order.
- It then places them sequentially on the canvas, effectively rearranging them by color.

### **Version 3 (Position-based Shifting):**

```python
def solve_93b581b8(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    pos = position(obj, asindices(I))
    if pos == (0, -1):
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, width(obj))))
    elif pos == (1, -1):
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (1, width(obj))))
    elif pos == (-1, -1) and len(objs) == 5:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, width(obj) + 1)))
    else:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, width(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version determines the relative position of each object to the entire input grid.
- It applies shifts based on this relative position, aligning the objects accordingly.

### **Version 4 (Gravitate and Shift):**

```python
def solve_93b581b8(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj1 in objs:
    for obj2 in objs:
      if color(obj1) != color(obj2) and adjacent(obj1, obj2):
        direction = gravitate(obj1, obj2)
        O = paint(O, shift(obj1, direction))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version uses the `gravitate` function to calculate the direction and magnitude of the shift required to bring adjacent objects together. 
- It iterates through pairs of objects and applies the shift to achieve the desired arrangement.

### **Version 5 (Horizontal Compaction):**

```python
def solve_93b581b8(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  offset = 0
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, offset)))
    offset += width(obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version compacts the objects horizontally by placing them next to each other without any gaps.
- It calculates the required offset for each object based on the width of the previously placed objects.

These five versions offer distinct approaches to solving the transformation problem using the provided DSL functions. Each version leverages different logic and function combinations, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL in tackling spatial reasoning tasks.
