## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying non-background objects within the grid and shifting them to the rightmost column. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**
* The '3' object is shifted to the rightmost column, maintaining its relative position within the column.

**Input_1:**
* Both the '6' and '4' objects are shifted to the rightmost column. 
* The relative order of objects within the column is maintained.

**Input_2:**
*  The '8', '2', and '1' objects are shifted to the rightmost column.
* Again, the order of these objects is preserved during the shift.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Identify non-background objects
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  # Calculate destination column index
  dest_col = width(I) - 1
  # Shift each object to the rightmost column
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, dest_col - rightmost(toindices(obj)))), objs)
  # Paint the shifted objects onto a blank canvas
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(shifted_objs))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies all distinct objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Destination Column:** `dest_col = width(I) - 1` calculates the index of the rightmost column.
3. **Shift Objects:** `mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, dest_col - rightmost(toindices(obj)))), objs)` iterates through each object and shifts it horizontally. The shift amount is determined by the difference between the destination column and the object's rightmost column.
4. **Paint Objects:**  `paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(shifted_objs))` creates a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input and then paints the shifted objects onto it. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    row_obj =  frozenset((I[i][j], (i, j)) for j in range(width(I)) if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I))
    O = paint(O, shift(row_obj, (0, width(I) - 1 - rightmost(toindices(row_obj))))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Blank Canvas:** `O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` initializes an output grid with the same background color and dimensions as the input.
2. **Iterate Rows:** It iterates through each row of the input grid.
3. **Extract Row Objects:** `frozenset((I[i][j], (i, j)) for j in range(width(I)) if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I))` extracts non-background elements from each row as an object.
4. **Shift and Paint:** `O = paint(O, shift(row_obj, (0, width(I) - 1 - rightmost(toindices(row_obj)))))` calculates the shift distance for the row object to reach the rightmost column and paints the shifted object onto the output grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = list(list(row) for row in I) # Create a mutable copy of I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if O[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        O[i][width(I)-1] = O[i][j]
        O[i][j] = mostcolor(I) 
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)  # Convert back to immutable tuples 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Mutable Copy:** It creates a mutable copy of the input grid to facilitate in-place modifications.
2. **Iterate and Shift:** It iterates through each cell, and if a non-background element is found, it's moved to the rightmost available cell in that row. The original cell is then filled with the background color.
3. **Immutable Output:** The modified grid is converted back into an immutable tuple-based representation before returning.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = []
  for row in I:
    new_row = [v for v in row if v == mostcolor(I)] + [v for v in row if v != mostcolor(I)]
    O.append(tuple(new_row))
  return tuple(O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Rows:** This version iterates through each row of the input grid.
2. **Reconstruct Rows:** For each row, it constructs a new row by first including all background elements and then appending the non-background elements, effectively shifting them to the right.
3. **Form Output Grid:** The newly constructed rows are then combined to form the output grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            v if j != width(I) - 1 else next((x for x in row[::-1] if x != mostcolor(I)), mostcolor(I))
            for j, v in enumerate(row)
        )
        for row in I
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Cells:**  This version utilizes nested loops to iterate over each cell in the input grid.
2. **Conditional Replacement:**  For each cell, it checks if it's in the last column. If it is, it replaces the cell's value with the rightmost non-background value from the current row.  
3. **In-Place Modification:** This version performs the modifications in-place within the nested loops, constructing the output grid directly. 

Each version above provides a distinct approach to solving the given transformation task using the provided DSL. They highlight the flexibility of the DSL in achieving the desired outcome through different logical pathways and function combinations.
