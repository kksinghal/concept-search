## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation shifts objects within the grid based on their color values. Let's break down the movement pattern for each color:

* **Color 5:** Remains stationary.
* **Other Colors:** Move horizontally to the right by a distance equal to their color value.

Let's illustrate this with an example from Input_2:

* The two '8's move two positions to the right.
* The two '2's move two positions to the right.
* The '1' moves one position to the right. 

This pattern holds true for all the input-output pairs provided.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing this transformation logic:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))  
  for v in palette(I):
    obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, v), I)
    offset = (0, v) if v != FIVE else (0, 0) 
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, offset))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas (`O`) of the same size as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Color Iteration:** Iterates through each unique color (`v`) present in the input grid.
3. **Object Extraction:** Extracts the object (`obj`) corresponding to the current color.
4. **Offset Calculation:**  Calculates the horizontal offset based on the color value. If the color is 5, the offset is (0, 0), meaning no movement. Otherwise, the offset is (0, v), indicating a rightward shift by 'v' positions.
5. **Object Shifting and Painting:** Shifts the extracted object by the calculated offset and paints it onto the canvas.
6. **Canvas Return:** Returns the final transformed canvas (`O`).


**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = cover(I, asindices(I)) 
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, color(obj) if color(obj) != FIVE else 0))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Creates an empty canvas (`O`) by covering the input grid with zeros.
2. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each object (`obj`) in the input grid.
3. **Shifting and Painting:** Shifts each object rightward by a distance equal to its color value (except for color 5, which remains stationary) and paints it onto the canvas.
4. **Canvas Return:** Returns the final transformed canvas (`O`).


**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I 
  for i in range(1, 10):
    if i != FIVE:
      O = paint(cover(O, ofcolor(O, i)), shift(toobject(ofcolor(I, i), I), (0, i))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Initializes the output grid (`O`) as a copy of the input grid (`I`).
2. **Color Iteration:** Iterates through potential color values from 1 to 9 (assuming a maximum color value of 9).
3. **Conditional Shifting:** For each color (except 5), it covers the occurrences of that color in the output grid and then paints the original object shifted to the right by a distance equal to the color value.
4. **Grid Return:** Returns the modified output grid (`O`).


**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for x, y in asindices(I):
        v = index(I, (x, y))
        if v != FIVE:
            O = paint(cover(O, {(v, (x, y))}), shift({(v, (x, y))}, (0, v)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Initializes the output grid (`O`) as a copy of the input grid (`I`).
2. **Cell Iteration:** Iterates through each cell location (x, y) in the input grid.
3. **Value Extraction and Conditional Shifting:**  Extracts the color value (`v`) at the current cell. If the color is not 5, it covers the cell in the output grid and then paints a new cell with the same color, shifted to the right by a distance equal to the color value.
4. **Grid Return:** Returns the modified output grid (`O`).


**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for x, row in enumerate(I):
    for y, v in enumerate(row):
      if v != FIVE:
        O = paint(O, {(v, (x, y + v))}) 
      else:
        O = paint(O, {(v, (x, y))}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Creates an empty canvas (`O`) of the same size as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Cell-by-Cell Iteration:** Iterates through each cell in the input grid, represented by row and column indices (`x`, `y`) and the corresponding value (`v`).
3. **Conditional Painting:** If the cell value is not 5, it paints a new cell with the same value on the canvas, shifted to the right by a distance equal to the cell value. If the value is 5, it's painted at its original location.
4. **Canvas Return:**  Returns the final transformed canvas (`O`).

These five versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic flow.
