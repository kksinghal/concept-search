## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving objects within the grid based on their color. Each color has a designated target direction. Analyzing the input-output pairs, we can identify the movement pattern:

* **Color 5:** Moves diagonally upwards to the right.
* **Color 3:** Moves one step to the right.
* **Color 6:** Moves one step to the right.
* **Color 8:** Moves one step upwards.
* **Color 2:** Moves one step upwards. 
* **Color 1:** Remains in its position.

The objects move until they reach another object or the edge of the grid.


## Program Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    c = color(obj)
    direction = {
        5: UP_RIGHT,
        3: RIGHT,
        6: RIGHT,
        8: UP,
        2: UP
    }.get(c, ORIGIN)  # Default to no movement if color not specified
    
    temp_obj = shift(obj, direction)
    while not len(intersection(toindices(temp_obj), toindices(asobject(O)))) and not bordering(temp_obj, O):
      obj = temp_obj
      temp_obj = shift(obj, direction)

    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** A canvas `O` is created with the same size and background color as the input grid `I`.
2. **Object Iteration:**  The program iterates through each object in the input grid `I`.
3. **Direction Assignment:**  A dictionary maps colors to their corresponding movement directions.
4. **Movement:**  The object is shifted in the determined direction until it collides with another object or hits the grid boundary.
5. **Painting:** The final position of the object is painted onto the canvas `O`.

## Program Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for c in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
    direction = {
        5: UP_RIGHT,
        3: RIGHT,
        6: RIGHT,
        8: UP,
        2: UP
    }.get(c, ORIGIN)
    obj = toobject(ofcolor(O, c), O)
    temp_obj = shift(obj, direction)
    while not len(intersection(toindices(temp_obj), toindices(asobject(O)))) and not bordering(temp_obj, O):
      obj = temp_obj
      temp_obj = shift(obj, direction)
    O = paint(cover(O, obj), temp_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  The output grid `O` is initialized as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Color Iteration:**  The program iterates through each color in the input grid, excluding the background color.
3. **Direction Assignment:**  A dictionary maps colors to their movement directions.
4. **Object Extraction:**  The object corresponding to the current color is extracted from the grid.
5. **Movement:** The object is moved in the specified direction until it hits another object or a grid boundary.
6. **Grid Update:**  The original object is erased, and the moved object is painted onto the grid `O`.

## Program Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for c in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
    direction = {
        5: (-1, 1),
        3: (0, 1),
        6: (0, 1),
        8: (-1, 0),
        2: (-1, 0)
    }.get(c, (0, 0))
    for _ in range(max(shape(I))):
        obj = toobject(ofcolor(O, c), O)
        if bordering(obj, O):
          break
        O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, direction))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Output grid `O` starts as a copy of input grid `I`.
2. **Color Iteration:**  Iterate through each color in `I` (except background).
3. **Direction Mapping:** Dictionary maps colors to movement directions.
4. **Movement Loop:**  For each color:
    - Loop for maximum grid dimension times (ensures complete movement).
    - Extract object of the current color.
    - If the object is already at a border, stop moving it.
    -  Erase the object and redraw it shifted by the designated direction. 
5. **Return:** The modified grid `O` is returned.

## Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I 
  for c in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
    direction = {
        5: (-1, 1),
        3: (0, 1),
        6: (0, 1),
        8: (-1, 0),
        2: (-1, 0)
    }.get(c, (0, 0))
    occupied = toindices(asobject(O))
    for (i, j) in sorted(ofcolor(I, c), key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0])): 
      while True:
        ni, nj = i + direction[0], j + direction[1]
        if (ni, nj) in occupied or not (0 <= ni < len(O) and 0 <= nj < len(O[0])):
          break
        O = paint(cover(O, {(c, (i, j))}), {(c, (ni, nj))})
        occupied = toindices(asobject(O))
        i, j = ni, nj
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  The output `O` is initialized with the input `I`.
2. **Color Iteration:** Iterates through each color in `I` except the background.
3. **Direction Assignment:**  Maps colors to movement vectors.
4. **Cell-by-Cell Movement:**
   - Gets indices of cells with the current color, sorted by column then row.
   - For each cell:
     - Continuously try to move in the assigned direction:
       - If the new position is occupied or outside the grid, stop moving.
       - Otherwise, erase the cell, redraw at the new position, and update the occupied cell set.

## Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for c in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
        obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, c), I)
        direction = {
            5: UP_RIGHT,
            3: RIGHT,
            6: RIGHT,
            8: UP,
            2: UP
        }.get(c, ORIGIN) 
        new_obj = set()
        for v, (i, j) in obj:
            ni, nj = i, j
            while True:
                ni += direction[0]
                nj += direction[1]
                if not (0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0])) or (v, (ni, nj)) in new_obj:
                    break
            new_obj.add((v, (ni, nj)))
        O = paint(O, frozenset(new_obj))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas `O` with the same size and background color as input `I`.
2. **Color Iteration:**  Iterates through each color in the input grid, except the background color.
3. **Direction Assignment:**  A dictionary maps colors to their movement directions.
4. **Cell-wise Movement and Placement:**  
    - For each cell in the object:
        - It simulates the movement of the cell in the specified direction until it encounters either a boundary or another cell that has already been placed in `new_obj`. 
        -  The final position of the cell is then added to `new_obj`.
5. **Object Painting:** Once all cells of the object have been processed, the entire `new_obj` is painted onto the canvas `O`.

These programs provide five distinct solutions using various strategies, demonstrating the flexibility of the DSL in achieving the desired transformation.
