## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation shifts each object in the input grid horizontally. The amount of shift is determined by the object's color subtracted by 5. 

**Example:**

- **Input_0:** The object with color '3' is shifted by (3-5) = -2 positions (2 positions to the left).
- **Input_1:** The object with color '6' is shifted by (6-5) = 1 position (1 position to the right).

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1:** (Inspired by Program_B - using canvas and iterating through objects)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas of the same size as input.
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):  # Iterate through each object in the input.
    offset = (0, color(obj) - FIVE)  # Calculate the horizontal shift based on color.
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, offset))  # Shift the object and paint it onto the canvas.
  return O  # Return the transformed grid.
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a blank canvas (`O`) of the same size as the input grid (`I`).
2. Iterates through each object (`obj`) in the input grid.
3. Calculates the horizontal shift (`offset`) based on the object's color (`color(obj)`).
4. Shifts the object by the calculated offset and paints it onto the canvas (`O`).
5. Returns the transformed grid (`O`).

**Version 2:** (Inspired by Program_A and B - using cover and paint with a single iteration through objects)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = cover(I, asindices(I))  # Create a copy of the input grid with all cells set to background color.
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):  # Iterate through each object in the input grid.
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, color(obj) - FIVE)))  # Shift and paint the object directly onto the modified grid.
  return O  # Return the transformed grid.
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a copy of the input grid (`O`) with all cells set to background color using `cover`.
2. Iterates through each object (`obj`) in the input grid.
3. Calculates the horizontal shift based on the object's color and shifts the object directly.
4. Paints the shifted object onto the modified grid (`O`).
5. Returns the transformed grid (`O`).

**Version 3:** (Using mapply for functional approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    cover(I, asindices(I)),  # Create a blank canvas.
    mpapply(
      lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, color(obj) - FIVE)),  # Shift each object based on its color.
      objects(I, T, T, T)  # Extract all objects from the input.
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a blank canvas by covering the input grid with the background color.
2. Uses `mpapply` to apply a lambda function to each object extracted from the input. 
3. The lambda function calculates the shift and shifts each object horizontally.
4. Finally, it paints all the shifted objects onto the blank canvas and returns the result.

**Version 4:** (Iterating through colors and shifting corresponding objects)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = asindices(I)  # Get all indices of the input grid.
  for v in palette(I):  # Iterate through each color in the input.
    obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, v), I)  # Extract the object with the current color.
    O = cover(O, obj)  # Remove the original object from the grid.
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, v - FIVE)))  # Shift and paint the object.
  return toobject(O, I)  # Return the transformed grid.
```

**Explanation:**

1. Gets all indices of the input grid.
2. Iterates through each unique color (`v`) present in the input grid.
3. Extracts the object corresponding to the current color.
4. Removes the original object from the grid.
5. Calculates the shift based on the color and shifts the extracted object.
6. Paints the shifted object back onto the grid.
7. Returns the transformed grid.

**Version 5:** (Using cellwise comparison and shifting)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)  # Get the height and width of the input grid.
  O = canvas(ZERO, (h, w))  # Create a blank output grid.
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      v = index(I, (i, j))  # Get the value at the current index.
      new_j = j + v - FIVE  # Calculate the new column index.
      if 0 <= new_j < w:  # Check if the new index is within bounds.
        O = paint(O, {(v, (i, new_j))})  # Paint the value at the new index.
  return O  # Return the transformed grid.
```

**Explanation:**

1. Gets the height and width of the input grid.
2. Creates a blank output grid of the same size.
3. Iterates through each cell in the input grid.
4. Calculates the new column index for each cell value based on its color.
5. Checks if the new index is within the grid boundaries.
6. If valid, paints the cell value at the calculated new index in the output grid.
7. Returns the transformed grid.


These five versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating diverse use of DSL functions and programming logic.
