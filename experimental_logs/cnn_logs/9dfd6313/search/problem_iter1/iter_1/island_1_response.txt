## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on rearranging same-colored objects within the grid, potentially based on their color values. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The object composed of '3's has shifted one position to the left, suggesting a color-dependent horizontal shift.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  The objects composed of '6's have shifted to the right, with the magnitude of the shift seemingly dependent on their vertical position. 

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The objects composed of '8's and '2's  exhibit a similar pattern of color-dependent horizontal shifts, further reinforcing this observation.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, each employing a different approach to achieve the desired transformation:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    for v in palette(I):
        obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, v), I)
        h = uppermost(obj)  
        offset = (0, h * (v - FIVE))
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, offset))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty canvas (`O`) of the same dimensions as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate through Colors:** For each unique color (`v`) in the input grid:
    * **Extract Object:** Identify and extract the object formed by cells of color `v`.
    * **Calculate Offset:** Determine the vertical position (`h`) of the uppermost cell in the object. Calculate the horizontal offset based on the difference between the color value and '5', scaled by the uppermost cell's row index. 
    * **Shift and Paint:** Shift the object horizontally by the calculated offset and paint it onto the output canvas.
3. **Return Output:** Return the transformed output grid.

This approach leverages the color value and the object's position to calculate the appropriate horizontal shift. 


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    c = color(obj)
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j + i * (c - FIVE)))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty output grid (`O`) with the same dimensions as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate through Objects:** For each object (`obj`) in the input grid:
    * **Get Color:** Extract the color (`c`) of the current object.
    * **Iterate through Cells:** For each cell (`v`, `(i, j)`) within the object:
        * **Calculate New Position:** Determine the new column index (`j + i * (c - FIVE)`), shifting the cell horizontally based on its row index (`i`) and the difference between its color (`c`) and '5'.
        * **Paint Cell:** Paint the cell at its new position on the output grid.
3. **Return Output:** Return the transformed output grid.

This version iterates through individual cells of each object, calculating their new positions based on their row index and color. 


### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
    O = I  
    for v in palette(I) - {FIVE}:
        obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, v), I)
        for i in range(height(obj)):
            O = move(O, toobject({(v, (i + uppermost(obj), j)) for j in range(width(obj))}, O), (0, i * (v - FIVE)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Initialize the output grid (`O`) as a copy of the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate through Colors (Except 5):** For each unique color (`v`) in the input grid, excluding '5':
    * **Extract Object:**  Extract the object composed of cells with color `v`.
    * **Iterate through Rows:**  For each row `i` within the object's bounding box:
        * **Extract Row:** Extract the row as an object.
        * **Calculate Offset:** Calculate the horizontal offset based on the row index and the color's difference from '5'.
        * **Move Row:** Shift the row horizontally on the output grid by the calculated offset.
3. **Return Output:** Return the transformed grid.

This version iterates through each row of an object and moves them independently, leading to the desired transformation.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
        h = uppermost(obj)
        w = width(obj)
        v = color(obj)
        for i in range(h, h + height(obj)):
            for j in range(leftmost(obj), leftmost(obj) + w):
                if (i, j) in toindices(obj):
                    O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j + (i - h) * (v - FIVE)))}) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty output grid (`O`) with the same dimensions as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate through Objects:** For each object (`obj`) in the input grid:
    * **Get Object Properties:** Extract the uppermost row (`h`), width (`w`), and color (`v`) of the object.
    * **Iterate through Bounding Box:** Iterate through the rows and columns within the object's bounding box.
    * **Check for Cell:** If a cell at (`i`, `j`) belongs to the object:
        * **Calculate New Position:**  Determine the new column index, shifting horizontally based on the row's offset from the uppermost row and the difference between the object's color and '5'.
        * **Paint Cell:** Paint the cell at its new location on the output grid. 
3. **Return Output:** Return the modified output grid.

This program meticulously moves individual cells of each object to their new positions, ensuring the desired output.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
    O = I
    for v in palette(I) - {FIVE}:
        obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, v), I)
        for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
            O = move(O, {(v, (i, j))}, (0, (i - uppermost(obj)) * (v - FIVE)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Initialize the output grid (`O`) as a copy of the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate through Colors (Except 5):**  For each unique color (`v`) in the input grid, excluding '5':
    * **Extract Object:** Extract the object formed by cells of color `v`.
    * **Iterate through Cells:** For each cell (`i`, `j`) within the object:
        * **Calculate Offset:** Calculate the horizontal offset based on the cell's row relative to the object's uppermost row and the color's difference from '5'.
        * **Move Cell:** Move the single-cell object on the output grid by the calculated offset.
3. **Return Output:** Return the transformed output grid.

This program focuses on moving each cell of the object independently based on its position and color.

These five program versions provide diverse implementations to solve the given transformation challenge in the provided DSL. Each utilizes different logic and function combinations, highlighting the flexibility of the DSL in solving spatial reasoning problems.
