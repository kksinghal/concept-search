## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be moving all the non-5 digits in each input grid to the rightmost column, while maintaining their relative vertical order. The 5s remain in their original positions.

**Input_0:**
- The 3 moves from (1,0) to (0,1).

**Input_1:**
- The 6s move from (2,0) and (3,0) to (0,2) and (0,3).
- The 4 moves from (3,2) to (1,3).

**Input_2:**
- The 8s move from (2,0) and (2,1) to (0,2) and (1,2).
- The 2s move from (3,1) and (4,1) to (1,3) and (1,4).
- The 1 moves from (4,3) to (3,4).


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find all non-5 objects.
  x1 = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda obj: color(obj) != FIVE)
  
  # Calculate the destination column index.
  x3 = width(I) - 1

  # Shift each object to the rightmost column, maintaining relative vertical position.
  x4 = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, x3 - leftmost(obj))), x2)

  # Paint the shifted objects onto the original grid.
  O = paint(I, merge(x4))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Non-5 Objects:** Identify all objects in the grid not containing the value 5 (`x2`).
2. **Calculate Destination Column:** Determine the rightmost column index (`x3`).
3. **Shift Objects:**  Calculate the shift amount for each object to reach the rightmost column while maintaining its vertical position (`x4`).
4. **Paint Objects:** Combine all shifted objects and paint them onto the original grid (`O`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Create a blank canvas of the same size as the input.
  O = canvas(FIVE, shape(I)) 

  # Iterate through each non-5 color in the input.
  for v in palette(I) - {FIVE}:
      # Get the indices of the current color.
      indices = ofcolor(I, v)
      # Calculate the shift amount for the current color.
      shift_amount = width(I) - 1 - leftmost(indices)
      # Shift and paint the color onto the canvas.
      O = paint(O, shift(recolor(v, indices), (0, shift_amount)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** Create a new grid (`O`) filled with 5s, having the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. **Iterate through Colors:** Loop through each unique color (`v`) in the input grid, excluding 5.
3. **Find Color Indices:** Get the indices of all cells with the current color (`indices`).
4. **Calculate Shift:** Determine the amount to shift the current color to the right (`shift_amount`).
5. **Shift and Paint:** Shift the color to the rightmost column and paint it onto the canvas (`O`).

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find all non-5 cells and their corresponding destination column indices.
  shifted_cells = ((I[i][j], (i, width(I) - 1)) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(width(I)) if I[i][j] != FIVE)
  
  # Create a blank canvas filled with 5s.
  O = canvas(FIVE, shape(I))

  # Paint the shifted cells onto the canvas.
  O = paint(O, frozenset(shifted_cells))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Shifted Cells:** Identify all non-5 cells in the grid and create a set of tuples, each tuple containing the cell value and its destination index in the rightmost column (`shifted_cells`).
2. **Create Canvas:** Create a new grid (`O`) filled with 5s, having the same dimensions as the input grid.
3. **Paint Shifted Cells:** Paint the shifted cells directly onto the canvas (`O`).

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Split the input grid into columns.
  columns = vsplit(I, width(I))

  # Filter out the columns containing only 5s.
  non_5_columns = tuple(col for col in columns if any(v != FIVE for row in col for v in row))

  # Concatenate the non-5 columns with a column of 5s.
  O = hconcat(canvas((FIVE,), (height(I), 1)), hconcat(*non_5_columns))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Split into Columns:** Divide the input grid vertically into individual columns (`columns`).
2. **Filter Non-5 Columns:** Identify columns that contain at least one non-5 value (`non_5_columns`).
3. **Concatenate Columns:** Create a new grid by horizontally concatenating a column of 5s with the filtered non-5 columns (`O`).

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Create a list to store the transformed rows.
    transformed_rows = []

    # Iterate over each row in the input grid.
    for row in I:
        # Extract the non-5 digits from the row.
        non_5_digits = [digit for digit in row if digit != FIVE]
        # Create a new row with 5s and the extracted digits.
        transformed_row = [FIVE] * (len(row) - len(non_5_digits)) + non_5_digits
        # Append the transformed row to the list.
        transformed_rows.append(transformed_row)

    # Convert the list of transformed rows back to a tuple of tuples (grid format).
    O = tuple(tuple(row) for row in transformed_rows)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Transformed Rows:** Create an empty list (`transformed_rows`) to store the modified rows of the grid.
2. **Iterate through Rows:** Loop through each row in the input grid.
3. **Extract Non-5 Digits:** For each row, identify and collect all digits that are not 5 (`non_5_digits`).
4. **Construct Transformed Row:** Create a new row starting with enough 5s to fill the original row length minus the number of non-5 digits, then append the `non_5_digits` to the end.
5. **Append to Transformed Rows:** Add the newly constructed `transformed_row` to the `transformed_rows` list.
6. **Convert to Grid Format:**  After processing all rows, convert the `transformed_rows` list back into a tuple of tuples, representing the final grid (`O`).


These are five distinct program versions that transform the input grids to the desired output grids as specified in the problem statement. Each version uses different functions and logic to achieve the same result.
