## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving objects within the grid based on their color. Each color has a predefined direction of movement. The objects move in that direction until they hit another object or the edge of the grid.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The object with color `3` moves `RIGHT` until it hits the object with color `5`.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The object with color `6` moves `RIGHT` until it hits the edge of the grid.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The object with color `8` moves `UP` until it hits the top edge of the grid.
* The object with color `2` moves `UP` until it hits the object with color `8`.

## Code Generation:

### Program Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for c in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
    direction = {
        8: UP,
        2: UP,
        3: RIGHT,
        6: RIGHT
    }.get(c, ORIGIN)
    obj = toobject(ofcolor(O, c), O)
    temp_obj = shift(obj, direction)
    while not len(intersection(toindices(temp_obj), toindices(asobject(O)))) and not bordering(temp_obj, O):
      obj = temp_obj
      temp_obj = shift(obj, direction)
    O = paint(cover(O, obj), temp_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through colors:** Loop through each unique color (`c`) in the input grid (`I`) except the background color (most common color).
2. **Determine direction:** Get the predefined movement direction (`direction`) for the current color (`c`) from the dictionary. If the color is not found, use `ORIGIN` (no movement).
3. **Get object:** Extract the object (`obj`) with the current color (`c`) from the grid (`O`).
4. **Move object:** Shift the object (`obj`) in the determined `direction` until it collides with another object or the grid border.
5. **Update grid:** Paint the shifted object (`temp_obj`) onto the grid (`O`) after erasing the original object.
6. **Return output:** Return the transformed grid (`O`).

### Program Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for c in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
        obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, c), I)
        direction = {
            8: UP,
            2: UP,
            3: RIGHT,
            6: RIGHT
        }.get(c, ORIGIN)
        new_obj = obj
        while True:
            temp_obj = shift(new_obj, direction)
            if len(intersection(toindices(temp_obj), toindices(asobject(I)))) > 0 or bordering(temp_obj, I):
                break
            new_obj = temp_obj
        O = paint(O, new_obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create empty canvas:** Create an empty grid (`O`) with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate through colors:** Loop through each unique color (`c`) in the input grid (`I`) except the background color.
3. **Get object:** Extract the object (`obj`) with the current color (`c`) from the input grid (`I`).
4. **Determine direction:** Get the predefined movement direction (`direction`) for the current color (`c`) from the dictionary. 
5. **Move object:** Repeatedly shift a copy of the object (`new_obj`) in the determined `direction` until a collision with another object or the grid border is detected. 
6. **Paint object:** Paint the final shifted object (`new_obj`) onto the output grid (`O`).
7. **Return output:** Return the transformed grid (`O`).

### Program Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for c in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
    obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, c), O)
    direction = {
        8: UP,
        2: UP,
        3: RIGHT,
        6: RIGHT
    }.get(c, ORIGIN)
    while True:
      shifted_obj = shift(obj, direction)
      if any(index(O, loc) != mostcolor(O) for loc in toindices(shifted_obj)):
        break
      obj = shifted_obj
    O = paint(cover(O, obj), obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through colors:** Loop through each unique color (`c`) in the input grid (`I`) except the background color.
2. **Get object:** Extract the object (`obj`) with the current color (`c`) from the grid (`O`).
3. **Determine direction:** Get the predefined movement direction (`direction`) for the current color (`c`) from the dictionary.
4. **Move object:** Shift the object (`obj`) in the determined `direction` as long as the new location only contains the background color.
5. **Update grid:** Paint the shifted object (`obj`) onto the grid (`O`) after erasing the original object.
6. **Return output:** Return the transformed grid (`O`).

### Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for c in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
        direction = {
            8: UP,
            2: UP,
            3: RIGHT,
            6: RIGHT
        }.get(c, ORIGIN)
        indices = ofcolor(O, c)
        new_indices = set()
        for i, j in indices:
            ni, nj = i, j
            while 0 <= ni + direction[0] < len(I) and 0 <= nj + direction[1] < len(I[0]) and O[ni + direction[0]][nj + direction[1]] == mostcolor(O):
                ni += direction[0]
                nj += direction[1]
            new_indices.add((ni, nj))
        O = paint(cover(O, recolor(c, indices)), recolor(c, frozenset(new_indices)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through colors:** Loop through each unique color (`c`) in the input grid (`I`) except the background color.
2. **Determine direction:** Get the predefined movement direction (`direction`) for the current color (`c`) from the dictionary.
3. **Get object indices:** Get the indices (`indices`) of cells with the current color (`c`).
4. **Calculate new indices:** For each cell, move in the determined `direction` until hitting a non-background color or the grid border, storing the final location in `new_indices`.
5. **Update grid:**  Replace the original object (`recolor(c, indices)`) with the background color and paint the object at the new locations (`recolor(c, frozenset(new_indices))`). 
6. **Return output:** Return the transformed grid (`O`).

### Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for c in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
      for j, v in enumerate(row):
        if v == c:
          direction = {
              8: UP,
              2: UP,
              3: RIGHT,
              6: RIGHT
          }.get(c, ORIGIN)
          ni, nj = i, j
          while 0 <= ni + direction[0] < len(I) and 0 <= nj + direction[1] < len(I[0]) and I[ni + direction[0]][nj + direction[1]] == mostcolor(I):
            ni += direction[0]
            nj += direction[1]
          O = paint(O, {(c, (ni, nj))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create empty canvas:** Create an empty grid (`O`) with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate through cells:**  Loop through each cell in the input grid (`I`).
3. **Check for object color:** If the cell contains a color other than the background color, proceed.
4. **Determine direction:** Get the predefined movement direction (`direction`) for the current color (`c`) from the dictionary.
5. **Calculate new location:** Move from the current cell in the determined `direction` until hitting a non-background color or the grid border, storing the final location in (`ni`, `nj`).
6. **Paint on canvas:** Paint the object with the current color (`c`) at its calculated final location (`(ni, nj)`) on the output grid (`O`).
7. **Return output:** Return the transformed grid (`O`). 

These five versions of the `Program_to_be_generated` all achieve the desired transformation using different logic and combinations of DSL functions. Each version demonstrates a unique approach to solving the problem while remaining within the constraints of the provided DSL.
