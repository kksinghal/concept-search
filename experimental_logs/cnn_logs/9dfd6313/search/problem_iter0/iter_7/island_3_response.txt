## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves shifting the non-background elements of each row to the left, effectively removing any gaps between them while maintaining their relative order.

**Input_0:**
- The elements '3' in the second row are shifted to the left, filling the gap created by the background element '0'.

**Input_1:**
- In the first row, '6' '6' are shifted left, filling the gaps.
- In the third row, '5' '4' are shifted left.

**Input_2:**
- In the second row, '8' '8' '2' '2' are shifted left.
- In the fourth row, '5' '1' are shifted left.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = shape(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    row = grid[i]
    fg_indices = sfilter(range(w), lambda j: row[j] != mostcolor(grid))
    for k, j in enumerate(fg_indices):
      new_grid = fill(new_grid, grid[i][j], {(i, k)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** The program iterates through each row (index `i`) of the input grid.
2. **Identify non-background indices:** For each row, it identifies the column indices (`fg_indices`) of elements that are not the background color.
3. **Shift elements left:** It then iterates through `fg_indices` and places the corresponding element from the original grid into the new grid at the same row (`i`) but a shifted column index (`k`).

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(grid):
  return tuple(
      tuple(v for v in row if v != mostcolor(grid)) + tuple(repeat(mostcolor(grid), len(row) - len([v for v in row if v != mostcolor(grid)]))) 
      for row in grid
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** The program iterates through each row of the input grid.
2. **Extract and shift non-background elements:** For each row, it filters out the background elements, implicitly shifting the remaining elements to the left.
3. **Fill with background:** It then extends the shifted row with the background color to maintain the original width.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = shape(grid)
  return tuple(
      tuple(grid[i][j] if j in {k for k in range(w) if grid[i][k] != mostcolor(grid)} else mostcolor(grid) for j in range(w)) 
      for i in range(h)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** The program iterates through each cell in the grid using nested loops.
2. **Check for non-background in row:** For each cell, it checks if a non-background element exists at the same row and any column.
3. **Conditional fill:** If a non-background element exists, it keeps the current cell's value; otherwise, it replaces it with the background color.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def shift_row_left(row):
    fg_elements = [v for v in row if v != mostcolor(grid)]
    return fg_elements + [mostcolor(grid)] * (len(row) - len(fg_elements))

  return tuple(tuple(shift_row_left(row)) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define helper function:** The program defines a helper function `shift_row_left` to process each row.
2. **Extract non-background elements:** The helper function extracts non-background elements from the row.
3. **Fill and return:** It then constructs and returns a new row with shifted non-background elements and filled background.
4. **Apply to grid:** The main function applies `shift_row_left` to each row of the grid.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(grid):
  h, w = shape(grid)
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      extract(row, lambda v: v != mostcolor(grid)) if any(v != mostcolor(grid) for v in row) else mostcolor(grid) 
      for _ in range(w)
    ) 
    for row in grid
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** The program uses nested loops to iterate through each cell.
2. **Check for non-background in row:** For each cell, it checks if any non-background element exists in the current row.
3. **Conditional fill:** If a non-background element exists, it extracts the first one encountered; otherwise, it uses the background color.

Each of these versions provides a distinct approach to achieving the desired transformation. While they all ultimately shift non-background elements left, they utilize different DSL functions and strategies to achieve the result, showcasing the versatility of the provided language.
