## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation logic for these input-output pairs involves re-arranging objects based on their unique color. Each object is moved to a specific location in the output grid depending on its color.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The object with color '3' is moved one position to the right.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The object with color '6' is split into two objects.
* One of the '6' objects is moved to the top right corner.
* The other '6' object is placed to the left of the top right corner.
* The object with color '4' is moved to the bottom right corner.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The objects with color '8' are moved to the top right, maintaining their relative positions.
* The objects with color '2' are moved to the right of the '8' objects.
* The object with color '1' is moved to the bottom right corner.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T) # Extract all objects
  new_grid = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Empty canvas
  for c in sorted(palette(I)): # Iterate through colors
    for obj in sizefilter(objs, colorcount(I, c)):
      if c == 3:
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(obj, (0, 1))) # Shift one position right
      elif c == 6:
        if len(sizefilter(objs, colorcount(I, c))) == 2: # Check if two objects of color 6 exist
          new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(obj, (0, width(I) - width(obj)))) # Shift to right edge
        else:
          new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(obj, (0, width(I) - 2*width(obj)))) # Shift left of right edge
      elif c == 4:
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(obj, (height(I) - 1, width(I) - width(obj)))) # Shift to bottom right
      elif c == 8:
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(obj, (0, width(I) - width(obj)))) # Shift to right edge
      elif c == 2:
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(obj, (1, width(I) - width(obj)))) # Shift to right edge, one row down
      elif c == 1:
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(obj, (height(I) - 1, width(I) - width(obj)))) # Shift to bottom right
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each color and its corresponding objects. It uses conditional statements to apply specific transformations based on the color and the number of objects with that color. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  H, W = shape(I)
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), (H, W))
  for c in sorted(palette(I)):
    for i, obj in enumerate(sizefilter(objects(I, T, T, T), colorcount(I, c))):
      if c == 3:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 1)))
      elif c == 6:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (i, W - width(obj))))
      elif c in (4, 8, 2, 1):
        target_row = H - 1 if c in (1, 4) else 0 if c == 8 else 1
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (target_row, W - width(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through colors and their objects. It utilizes the index 'i' while iterating through objects of the same color to handle the positioning of objects with color '6'. It also simplifies the positioning logic for colors 4, 8, 2, and 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for c in sorted(palette(I)):
    for i, obj in enumerate(sizefilter(objects(I, T, T, T), colorcount(I, c))):
      h, w = divmod(i, 2) if c == 6 else (0, 0)
      target = (h, len(I[0]) - width(obj) - w * width(obj)) if c in (2, 4, 6, 8) else (len(I) - 1, len(I[0]) - width(obj)) if c == 1 else (0, 1) if c == 3 else (0, 0)
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, target))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version condenses the logic into a single loop and uses a more complex conditional statement with the `divmod` function to determine the target position based on the color and object index.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for c in sorted(palette(I)):
    for i, obj in enumerate(sizefilter(objects(I, T, T, T), colorcount(I, c))):
      offset = (0, 1) if c == 3 else (
        (i, len(I[0]) - width(obj) - i * width(obj)) if c == 6 else 
        (c // 7, len(I[0]) - width(obj)) if c in (2, 8) else 
        (len(I) - 1, len(I[0]) - width(obj)) if c == 1 else 
        (0, len(I[0]) - width(obj))
      )
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, offset))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version further simplifies the conditional logic by utilizing the properties of the color values themselves to determine the target positions for certain colors.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for c in sorted(palette(I)):
    objs_c = sizefilter(objects(I, T, T, T), colorcount(I, c))
    for i, obj in enumerate(objs_c):
      target_pos = (
          (0, 1) if c == 3 else
          (i, len(I[0]) - width(obj) - i * width(obj)) if c == 6 else
          (c // 7, len(I[0]) - width(obj)) if c in (2, 8) else
          (len(I) - 1, len(I[0]) - width(obj)) if c == 1 else
          (0, len(I[0]) - width(obj))
      )
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(obj, target_pos))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version separates the object filtering for each color for readability. It also uses a more concise ternary operator within the loop to determine the target position.

These five program versions demonstrate distinct approaches to solving the transformation problem while achieving the desired output for each input grid.
