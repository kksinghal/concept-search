## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves taking all non-background digits in the input grid and rearranging them column-wise in the output grid while preserving their original column positions. The digits are placed from top to bottom in ascending order of their original row indices.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The '3' at (1,0) in the input is moved to (0,0) in the output as it's the topmost non-background digit in that column.

* **Input_1:** The digits '6' and '6' in the input's third column are rearranged in the output's third column based on their row positions in the input.

* **Input_2:** Similar to previous examples, the '8' and '8' in the third column, and '2' and '2' in the fourth column are rearranged based on their original row indices. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    non_bg_cells = [(i, v) for i, v in enumerate(I[i][j] for i in range(height(I))) if v != mostcommon(I)]
    sorted_cells = sorted(non_bg_cells, key=lambda x: x[0])
    for k, (i, v) in enumerate(sorted_cells):
      O = paint(O, {(v, (k, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas (`O`) with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Column-wise Iteration:** Iterates through each column (`j`) of the input grid.
3. **Non-Background Cell Extraction:** Identifies and stores the row index (`i`) and value (`v`) of each non-background cell in the current column.
4. **Sorting:** Sorts the extracted cells based on their row indices (`i`) in ascending order.
5. **Placement:** Places the sorted non-background digits into the corresponding column of the output grid (`O`), starting from the top row (`k=0`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, c in enumerate(row):
            if c != mostcommon(I):
                k = sum(1 for r in I[:i] if r[j] != mostcommon(I))
                O = paint(O, {(c, (k, j))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Cell Iteration:** Iterates through each cell (`c`) in the input grid (`I`).
3. **Non-Background Check:** If a cell is not the background color, proceed.
4. **Row Position Calculation:** Counts non-background cells in the same column above the current cell to determine its new row index (`k`).
5. **Placement:** Paints the current cell (`c`) onto the output grid (`O`) at the calculated position (`k`, `j`).

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
    non_bg_cells = [(i, j, I[i][j]) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(width(I)) if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I)]
    sorted_cells = sorted(non_bg_cells, key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))
    for k, (i, j, c) in enumerate(sorted_cells):
      O = paint(O, {(c, (k, j))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Non-Background Cell List:** Creates a list of tuples, each containing the row index (`i`), column index (`j`), and value (`c`) of every non-background cell.
3. **Sorting:** Sorts the list first by column index (`j`) and then by row index (`i`) to arrange the cells in the desired order.
4. **Placement:** Iterates through the sorted list and paints each cell (`c`) onto the output grid (`O`) at its corresponding column (`j`) and a new row index (`k`) based on the sorted order.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  k = {j: 0 for j in range(width(I))} 
  for obj in objs:
    j = next(iter(toindices(obj)))[1]
    for _, (i, _) in obj:
      O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (k[j], j))})
      k[j] += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Same as Version 1, and creates a dictionary 'k' to track the next available row index for each column in the output grid.
2. **Object Extraction:** Extracts objects from the input grid.
3. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each object.
4. **Column Identification:** Identifies the column ('j') to which the current object belongs.
5. **Cell Placement:** For each cell in the object, paints it to the output grid at the appropriate column ('j') and the row index obtained from the dictionary 'k', then increments the row index for that column.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
    for j in range(width(I)):
        column = [I[i][j] for i in range(height(I))]
        non_bg = [c for c in column if c != mostcommon(I)]
        for k, c in enumerate(non_bg):
            O = paint(O, {(c, (k, j))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Column-wise Processing:** Iterates through each column index (`j`) of the input grid.
3. **Column Extraction:** Extracts the current column from the input grid.
4. **Non-Background Filtering:** Filters the column to keep only the non-background colors.
5. **Placement:** Iterates through the filtered colors and places them in the output grid (`O`) at their corresponding column (`j`) and a new row index (`k`) based on their order in the filtered list.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to solving the transformation task, showcasing the versatility of the provided DSL.
