## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves rearranging the non-background digits within the grid while maintaining their spatial relationships. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:** The digit '3', initially below the top-left '5', is moved to the right of the top-left '5'. 

**Input_1 - Output_1:** The two '6' digits are moved to the top row, flanking the leftmost '5'. The '4' digit is moved to the bottom row, to the right of the bottom-right '5'.

**Input_2 - Output_2:** The two '8' digits are moved to the top row. The two '2' digits are moved to the right of the top-right '5'. The '1' digit is moved to the bottom row, to the right of the bottom-right '5'.

**Overall Pattern:**  The transformation seems to prioritize moving digits towards the top and right of the grid, potentially grouping them by value. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions utilizing the DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_custom(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    top_row = frozenset((i, 0) for i in range(width(I)))
    right_column = frozenset((height(I) - 1, j) for j in range(width(I)))
    O = I
    for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
      if size(obj) == 2:
        O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, gravitate(obj, recolor(ZERO, top_row))))
      else:
        O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, gravitate(obj, recolor(ZERO, right_column))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `fgpartition(I)` separates the input grid (`I`) into objects based on their values, excluding the background.
2. **Define Target Areas:** `top_row` and `right_column` represent the indices of the top row and rightmost column, respectively.
3. **Iterate and Move:** The program iterates through each object:
   - **Two-Cell Objects:**  Moved towards the top row using `gravitate`.
   - **Other Objects:** Moved towards the rightmost column using `gravitate`.
4. **Paint to Grid:** The moved objects are painted back onto the grid (`O`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_custom(I):
    objs = order(fgpartition(I), size)
    output = I
    for obj in objs:
        if height(obj) > 1:
            target = (0, width(I) - width(obj))
        else:
            target = (height(I) - 1, width(I) - width(obj))
        output = paint(cover(output, obj), shift(obj, target))
    return output
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction & Sorting:** `fgpartition(I)` extracts objects, and `order(..., size)` sorts them by size.
2. **Iterative Placement:** The code iterates through the sorted objects:
   - **Tall Objects:** Placed on the top row at the rightmost available position.
   - **Wide Objects:** Placed on the bottom row at the rightmost available position.
3. **Grid Update:**  `paint` and `cover` are used to update the output grid with the moved objects.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_custom(I):
  O = I
  for v in palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}:
    obj = extract(fgpartition(I), matcher(color, v))
    if height(obj) > width(obj):
      O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (0, width(I) - width(obj))))
    else:
      O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (height(I) - height(obj), width(I) - width(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Colors:** Iterates through each non-background color in the input grid.
2. **Object Isolation:**  `extract` finds the object corresponding to the current color.
3. **Height-Based Placement:**
   - **Taller than Wide:** The object is moved to the top-right corner of the grid.
   - **Wider than Tall:** The object is moved to the bottom-right corner of the grid.
4. **Grid Manipulation:** `paint` and `cover` are used to update the grid with the moved object.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_custom(I):
  O = I
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    if height(obj) == 1:
      target_row = 0 if size(obj) == 2 else height(I) - 1
      target = (target_row, rightmost(extract(objects(O, T, F, T), matcher(height, 1))) + 1)
    else:
      target = (0, rightmost(extract(objects(O, T, F, T), matcher(height, 2))) + 1)
    O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, target))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object-Centric Iteration:** Iterates through objects in the input grid (excluding background).
2. **Placement Logic:**
   - **Horizontal Objects:**  
      - Two-cell objects are placed on the top row. 
      - Others are placed on the bottom row. 
      - Placement is to the right of the previously placed horizontal object.
   - **Vertical Objects:** Placed on the top row, to the right of the previously placed two-cell object. 
3. **Grid Update:** `paint` and `cover` update the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_custom(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for obj in sorted(fgpartition(I), key=lambda x: (-(width(x) == 1 and height(x) == 2), -size(x))):
    if width(obj) == 1 and height(obj) == 2:
      target = (0, leftmost(extract(objects(O, T, F, T), matcher(size, 0))))
    elif width(obj) > height(obj):
      target = (height(I) - 1, leftmost(extract(objects(O, T, F, T), matcher(size, 0))))
    else:
      target = (0, leftmost(extract(objects(O, T, F, T), matcher(size, 0))))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, target))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas (`O`) of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Strategic Sorting:** Sorts objects: 
   - Prioritizes vertical two-cell objects.
   - Then, prioritizes objects by size (largest to smallest).
3. **Placement Strategy:**
   - **Vertical Two-Cell Objects:** Placed on the top row, starting from the leftmost available position.
   - **Wide Objects:**  Placed on the bottom row, starting from the leftmost available position.
   - **Other Objects:** Placed on the top row, starting from the leftmost available position.
4. **Grid Population:** Uses `paint` to place objects on the canvas.

These five program versions offer distinct approaches to solve the transformation problem, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL. Each version employs a unique combination of object identification, sorting, placement logic, and grid manipulation functions.
