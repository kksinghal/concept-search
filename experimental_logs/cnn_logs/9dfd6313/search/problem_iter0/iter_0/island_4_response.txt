## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 
* The top-left and bottom-left elements of the non-background object are swapped.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
* Each non-background element is moved to the rightmost available position in its row.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
* Each non-background element is moved to the topmost available position in its column.


## Program Version 1:

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Identify all objects
    x2 = order(x1, size)  # Order objects by size (smallest first)
    O = I
    for obj in x2:
      x3 = toindices(obj)
      x4 = order(x3, lambda x: x[1]) if portrait(obj) else order(x3, lambda x: x[0])  # Order cells within object
      for i, (r, c) in enumerate(x4):
        O = paint(cover(O, {(I[r][c], (r, c))}), {(I[r][c], (r, x4[-i-1][1]))} if portrait(obj) else {(I[r][c], (x4[-i-1][0], c))})  # Move each cell to the opposite end of its row/column
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and order objects:** `objects`, `order` find and order objects by size.
2. **Iterate and order cells:** Loop through each object, ordering its cells by column (portrait) or row (otherwise).
3. **Move cells:** For each cell, `cover` removes it from the grid, and `paint` places it at the opposite end of its row/column based on the object's orientation.


## Program Version 2:

```python
def solve(I):
    x1 = fgpartition(I)  # Identify foreground objects
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  # Create empty canvas
    for obj in x1:
      x2 = toindices(obj)
      x3 = order(x2, lambda x: x[1]) if portrait(obj) else order(x2, lambda x: x[0])  # Order cells
      x4 = [(r, c) for r, c in x3]
      for i, (r, c) in enumerate(x4):
        O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (r, x4[-i-1][1]))} if portrait(obj) else {(color(obj), (x4[-i-1][0], c))})  # Place cells at opposite ends
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects, create canvas:** `fgpartition` finds foreground objects, `canvas` creates an empty grid.
2. **Iterate and order cells:** Similar to version 1, order cells within each object.
3. **Place cells:** Directly `paint` each cell onto the canvas at the opposite end of its row/column.


## Program Version 3:

```python
def solve(I):
    O = I
    x1 = objects(I, T, T, T)
    for obj in x1:
      x2 = toindices(obj)
      for i, (r, c) in enumerate(x2):
        if portrait(obj):
          new_c = width(obj) - c + leftmost(x2) - 1
          O = paint(cover(O, {(I[r][c], (r, c))}), {(I[r][c], (r, new_c))})  # Move within row
        else:
          new_r = height(obj) - r + uppermost(x2) - 1
          O = paint(cover(O, {(I[r][c], (r, c))}), {(I[r][c], (new_r, c))})  # Move within column
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Calculate new position:** Directly calculate the new row/column index based on object dimensions and current cell position.
3. **Move cells:** `cover` and `paint` are used to move cells to their calculated positions.


## Program Version 4:

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for r, row in enumerate(I):
    for c, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != mostcommon(I):  # For each non-background cell
        new_c = width(I) - 1 - next((i for i in range(width(I) - 1, -1, -1) if O[r][i] == mostcommon(I)), -1)  # Find rightmost empty spot
        O = paint(O, {(val, (r, new_c))})  # Place cell
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate cells:** Directly iterate through each cell in the grid.
2. **Find empty spot:** For non-background cells, find the rightmost empty spot in the same row.
3. **Place cell:** `paint` the cell at the found empty spot.


## Program Version 5:

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for c in range(width(I)):
    for r in range(height(I)):
      if I[r][c] != mostcommon(I):
        new_r = next((i for i in range(height(I)) if O[i][c] == mostcommon(I)), height(I))
        O = paint(O, {(I[r][c], (new_r, c))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate columns:** Iterate through each column of the grid.
2. **Find empty spot:** For non-background cells, find the topmost empty spot in the same column.
3. **Place cell:** `paint` the cell at the found empty spot.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to solve the given transformation task. While they all achieve the same output, they demonstrate different programming styles and leverage different DSL functions, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL.
