## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to horizontally compact each row of the input grid by moving all non-background color digits to the left, while maintaining their relative order. The background color is the most frequent color in the grid.

**Input 0:**
- The digit '3' on the second row is moved to the left, filling the empty space.

**Input 1:**
- On the third row, both '6' digits are moved to the left, followed by the '4' digit. 

**Input 2:**
- On the third row, both '8' digits are moved to the left.
- On the fourth row, both '2' digits are moved left.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL:

**Version 1: Column-wise Shifting**

```python
def solve_horizontal_compact(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if O[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        k = min([x for x in range(j) if O[i][x] == mostcolor(I)], default=j)
        O = move(O, {(O[i][j], (i, j))}, (0, -j + k))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through columns:** The program iterates through each column (j) of the grid.
2. **Find empty spaces:** For each column, it checks each row (i) for non-background color digits.
3. **Find leftmost empty space:** If a non-background digit is found, it finds the index (k) of the leftmost background color digit in the same row. 
4. **Move the digit:** The non-background digit is then moved to the left to the position (i, k). 

**Version 2: Object-Based Shifting**

```python
def solve_horizontal_compact(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    j = min(j for i, j in toindices(obj))
    k = min([x for x in range(j) if O[uppermost(obj)][x] == mostcolor(I)], default=j)
    O = move(O, obj, (0, -j + k))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  The program identifies all objects (connected areas of the same color excluding background) in the grid.
2. **Find leftmost column:** For each object, it finds the index (j) of the leftmost column occupied by the object.
3. **Find target column:**  It then finds the index (k) of the leftmost empty space (background color) in the same row as the object's uppermost cell.
4. **Move the object:** The entire object is moved to the left to the position (k, uppermost(obj)).

**Version 3: Row-wise Compaction**

```python
def solve_horizontal_compact(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for i in range(height(I)):
      row = I[i]
      j = 0
      for v in row:
        if v != mostcolor(I):
          O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j))})
          j += 1
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create empty canvas:** The program creates an empty grid (O) filled with the background color and having the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. **Iterate through rows:** It iterates through each row (i) of the input grid.
3. **Compact the row:** For each row, it copies non-background digits to the output grid (O) starting from the leftmost column, effectively compacting the row.

**Version 4: Using `extract` and `remove`**

```python
def solve_horizontal_compact(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    row = I[i]
    non_bg_values = remove(mostcolor(I), row)
    j = 0
    for v in non_bg_values:
      loc = (i, next((x for x, y in enumerate(row) if y == v), -1))
      O = move(O, {(v, loc)}, (0, -loc[1] + j))
      j += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** Similar to other versions, the program iterates through each row of the input grid.
2. **Extract non-background values:** It extracts all non-background color digits from the row and stores them in `non_bg_values`.
3. **Move non-background values:**  It then iterates through `non_bg_values` and moves each value to the leftmost available space in the same row.

**Version 5: Using `sfilter` and `combine`**

```python
def solve_horizontal_compact(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    row = I[i]
    bg_indices = sfilter(enumerate(row), lambda x: x[1] == mostcolor(I))
    non_bg_indices = sfilter(enumerate(row), lambda x: x[1] != mostcolor(I))
    j = 0
    for x, v in non_bg_indices:
      O = move(O, {(v, (i, x))}, (0, -x + j))
      j += 1
    j = len(non_bg_indices)
    for x, v in bg_indices:
      O = move(O, {(v, (i, x))}, (0, -x + j))
      j += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** The program iterates through each row of the input grid.
2. **Separate background and non-background indices:** It identifies the indices of background and non-background color digits in each row.
3. **Move non-background values:** It moves all non-background color digits to the left, maintaining their original order.
4. **Move background values:** Finally, it moves the background color digits to the right, filling the remaining spaces.


These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the same horizontal compaction transformation using the provided DSL. Each version leverages different function combinations and logic flow, showcasing the flexibility and versatility of the DSL.
