## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying and moving objects within the grid to achieve a specific arrangement. Objects are defined by contiguous cells of the same color.  Let's analyze the movement pattern:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
* The object with color '3' moves from its initial position to the leftmost available position on the top row.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
* The object with color '6' is split into two single-cell objects. 
* Both '6' objects move to the rightmost positions of the top row.
* The '4' object moves to the rightmost position of the third row.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
* The object with color '8' is split into two single-cell objects.
* Both '8' objects move to the rightmost positions of the top two rows.
* The object with color '2' is split into two single-cell objects.
* Both '2' objects move to the rightmost positions of the second row.
* The '1' object moves to the rightmost position of the fourth row.

**Overall Pattern:**

The transformation aims to move objects to the rightmost available positions, starting from the top row and moving downwards. Objects may be split if necessary to fit into available spaces.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create empty canvas
  for v in sorted(palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}): # Iterate through colors
    obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, True, False), v))
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    for i in range(h):
      for j in range(w-1, -1, -1): # Iterate through grid from right to left
        if index(O, (i, j)) == mostcolor(I) and size(intersection(toindices(shift(obj, (i, j))), asindices(O))) == size(obj):
          O = paint(O, shift(obj, (i, j)))
          break
      else:
        continue
      break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`: An empty canvas is created with the same size and background color as the input.
2. `for v in sorted(palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}):`: Iterate through each unique color (except background) in the input, in ascending order.
3. `obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, True, False), v))`:  Get the object corresponding to the current color.
4. The nested loops iterate through the grid from right to left, top to bottom.
5. For each cell, it checks if:
   - The cell on the canvas is empty (background color).
   - The current object can be placed at that location without overlapping with existing objects.
6. If both conditions are true, the object is painted onto the canvas at the current location and the loop for that color breaks.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for v in sorted(palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}):
    obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, True, False), v))
    obj_placed = False
    for i in range(h):
      for j in range(w - width(obj), -1, -1):
        target_area = frozenset((i + k, j + l) for k in range(height(obj)) for l in range(width(obj)))
        if all(index(O, (row, col)) == mostcolor(I) for row, col in target_area):
          O = paint(O, shift(obj, (i, j)))
          obj_placed = True
          break
      if obj_placed:
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Create an empty canvas (`O`) with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid (`I`).
2. Iterate through each unique color (`v`) present in the input grid, excluding the background color.
3. For each color, extract the corresponding object (`obj`) from the input grid.
4. Attempt to place the object in the output grid, starting from the top-right corner and moving towards the left.
5. For each potential placement position, check if the target area is empty in the output grid.
6. If the target area is empty, paint the object onto the output grid and mark it as placed.
7. Continue this process for all colors, ensuring that each object is placed in the rightmost possible position. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for color in sorted(palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}):
    obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, True, False), color))
    placed = False
    for row in range(h):
      for col in range(w - width(obj), -1, -1):
        new_obj = shift(obj, (row, col))
        if all(0 <= i < h and 0 <= j < w and (i, j) not in toindices(asobject(O)) for _, (i, j) in new_obj):
          O = paint(O, new_obj)
          placed = True
          break
      if placed:
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty output grid (`O`) of the same size and background color as the input grid.
2. **Color Iteration:** Iterate through each distinct color present in the input, excluding the background color, in ascending order.
3. **Object Extraction:** For each color, extract the corresponding object (`obj`) from the input.
4. **Placement:** Try to place the object in the output grid, starting from the top-right corner and moving towards the left.
5. **Collision Check:** Before placing, check if all cells of the shifted object fall within the grid boundaries and do not overlap with any existing objects in the output grid.
6. **Paint and Mark:** If placement is successful, paint the object onto the output grid and mark it as placed.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))
  for color in sorted(palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}):
    obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, True, False), color))
    for row in range(h):
      for col in range(w - width(obj), -1, -1):
        if all(I[i][j] == mostcolor(I) for i in range(row, row + height(obj)) for j in range(col, col + width(obj)) if 0 <= i < h and 0 <= j < w):
          O = paint(O, shift(obj, (row, col)))
          break
      else:
        continue
      break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** An empty canvas (`O`) is created with the same size and background color as the input grid.
2. **Color Iteration:** It iterates through each unique color in the input grid, excluding the background color, in ascending order.
3. **Object Extraction:** For each color, it extracts the object from the input grid.
4. **Placement:** It attempts to place the extracted object in the output grid, starting from the top-right corner and moving leftwards.
5. **Collision Detection:** Before placing the object, it checks if the target area on the output grid is empty. If the target area is not empty, it moves to the next cell to the left.
6. **Painting:** If the target area is empty, it paints the object onto the output grid at the current position. 

**Program Version 5:** 

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  
  for v in sorted(palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}): 
    obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, True, False), v))
    for i in range(len(I)):
      for j in range(len(I[0]) - width(obj), -1, -1):
        new_obj = shift(obj, (i, j))
        if all((v, (row, col)) not in asobject(O) for v, (row, col) in new_obj):
          O = paint(O, new_obj)
          break 
      else:
        continue
      break
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 
 
1. **Initialize Output Grid:** Create an empty grid (`O`) with the same dimensions as the input grid (`I`), filled with the background color of the input.
2. **Iterate through Colors:** Loop through each unique color (`v`) found in the input grid, excluding the background color. The colors are processed in ascending order.
3. **Extract Object:** For the current color, extract the corresponding object (`obj`) from the input grid.
4. **Placement Loop:** Iterate through each cell in the output grid, starting from the top-right corner and moving towards the left, attempting to place the object.
5. **Check for Overlap:**  Before placing, ensure that no cell of the shifted object (`new_obj`) overlaps with any existing object in the output grid (`O`).
6. **Paint Object:** If there's no overlap, paint the shifted object (`new_obj`) onto the output grid (`O`).
7. **Continue to Next Color:** If the object is successfully placed, move on to the next unique color. 


Each of these programs provides a different way to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
