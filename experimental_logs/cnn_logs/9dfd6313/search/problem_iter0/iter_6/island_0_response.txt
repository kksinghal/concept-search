## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve **grouping digits based on their value and then arranging these groups in a specific order within the grid**. 

* **Input_0:** The '3' digit is moved to the right of the top '5' digit.
* **Input_1:**  The '6' digits are grouped to the right, while the '4' and '5' digits are paired at the bottom right.
* **Input_2:** The '8' digits are placed to the right of the top '5', the '2's are placed to the right of the middle '5', and the '1' is placed to the right of the bottom '5'.

This suggests a logic of **identifying unique digits, extracting objects formed by these digits, and then repositioning these objects within the grid based on their values.**


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions utilizing the DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
    new_objs = frozenset()
    for obj in objs:
        v = color(obj)
        if v == FIVE: 
            new_objs = new_objs | frozenset({shift(obj, (0,0))})
        else:
            new_objs = new_objs | frozenset({shift(obj, (0, v))})
    O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(new_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, False)` extracts objects from the input grid (`I`).
2. **Process Objects:**  Iterate through each object (`obj`).
3. **Shift Based on Value:** If the object's color (`v`) is 5, it remains in place (`(0,0)` shift). Otherwise, it's shifted horizontally based on its value (`(0, v)` shift).
4. **Paint to Canvas:** The shifted objects are painted onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid, resulting in the output grid (`O`).


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    values = sorted(palette(I))
    new_objs = frozenset()
    for i, v in enumerate(values):
        obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, v), I)
        new_objs = new_objs | frozenset({shift(obj, (0, i))})
    O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(new_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Unique Values:** `palette(I)` extracts unique digit values and `sorted()` sorts them in ascending order.
2. **Process Values:**  Iterate through each sorted value (`v`).
3. **Extract & Shift Objects:**  `ofcolor(I, v)` finds indices of the current value. `toobject` converts these indices to an object.  This object is shifted horizontally based on its position in the sorted values list (`(0, i)` shift).
4. **Paint to Canvas:** The shifted objects are painted onto a blank canvas, resulting in the output grid (`O`).


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    for v in palette(I):
        obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, v), I)
        offset = (0, v - FIVE) if v != FIVE else (0, 0)
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, offset))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Create a blank canvas (`O`) the same size as the input grid.
2. **Iterate Through Values:** Loop through each unique value (`v`) in the input grid.
3. **Extract, Shift & Paint:** Extract the object formed by the current value, shift it based on the value (no shift for '5', otherwise `(0, v-5)` shift), and paint it onto the canvas.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
    new_objs = frozenset()
    h = height(I)
    w = width(I)
    for obj in objs:
        v = color(obj)
        j = v if v != FIVE else 0
        for cell in obj:
            _, (i, _) = cell
            new_objs = insert((v, (i, j)), new_objs)
    O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), new_objs)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extract objects from the input grid (`I`).
2. **Process Objects:** Iterate through each object (`obj`).
3. **Calculate New Column:** Determine the target column (`j`) for the current object based on its color (no change for '5', otherwise use the value itself).
4. **Shift Cells:**  Shift each cell within the object to the new column while preserving its row position.
5. **Paint to Canvas:** Paint the shifted cells onto a blank canvas to generate the output grid.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, v in enumerate(row):
            if v == FIVE:
                O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j))})
            else:
                O = paint(O, {(v, (i, v))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Create a blank canvas (`O`) with the same dimensions as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate Through Cells:** Loop through each cell in the input grid using nested loops for rows (`i`) and columns (`j`).
3. **Conditional Painting:** If the cell value (`v`) is '5', paint it at the same location in the output grid. Otherwise, paint it in the column corresponding to its value (`v`).

These programs offer various approaches using different DSL functions and logic to achieve the same visual transformation. Each version highlights the flexibility of the DSL in solving spatial reasoning tasks.
