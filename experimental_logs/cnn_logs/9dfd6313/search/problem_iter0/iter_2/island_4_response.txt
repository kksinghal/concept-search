## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** All non-background digits in each row are moved to the left, maintaining their order.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** All non-background digits are moved to the top of their respective columns, maintaining their order.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** All non-background digits are moved to the top of their respective columns, maintaining their order.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    values = [I[i][j] for i in range(height(I)) if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I)]
    for k, value in enumerate(values):
      O = paint(O, {(value, (k, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Create a canvas `O` of the same size as the input `I`, filled with the background color (most common color in `I`).
2. **Iterate Columns:** Loop through each column `j` of the input grid.
3. **Extract Non-Background Values:** For each column, collect all non-background values from `I` into a list `values`.
4. **Place Values at Top:** Iterate through `values` and paint each `value` onto the canvas `O` at row index `k` (starting from the top) of the current column `j`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    O = paint(cover(O, ofcolor(O, mostcommon(I))),
              recolor(mostcommon(I),
                      shift(
                          normalize(
                              toobject(
                                  ofcolor(O, mostcommon(I)), O)), (0, j))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Set `O` to the input grid `I` initially.
2. **Iterate Columns:** Loop through each column `j`.
3. **Identify Background Cells:** Find indices of background-colored cells in `O` using `ofcolor`.
4. **Cover Background:** Replace background cells in `O` with the background color using `cover`.
5. **Shift and Paint:**
    - Normalize the indices of the background cells, effectively moving them to the top-left corner.
    - Shift the normalized indices horizontally by `j`, aligning them with the current column.
    - Recolor these indices to the background color.
    - Paint these recolored indices onto the modified `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    k = 0
    for i in range(height(I)):
      if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I):
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (k, j))})
        k += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Create a blank canvas `O` of the same dimensions as the input `I`, filled with the most common color in `I`.
2. **Iterate Columns:** Loop through each column index `j` from 0 to the width of `I`.
3. **Track Row Position:** Initialize a counter `k` to 0 for each column. `k` will track the row index where the next non-background value should be placed.
4. **Iterate Rows:** Loop through each row index `i` within the current column `j`.
5. **Check for Non-Background:** If the cell at `(i, j)` in the input `I` is not the background color:
     - Paint the value at `(i, j)` in `I` onto the canvas `O` at position `(k, j)`.
     - Increment `k` to move the next non-background value one row down in the current column.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    column = [I[i][j] for i in range(height(I))]
    filtered_column = [v for v in column if v != mostcommon(I)]
    new_column = filtered_column + [mostcommon(I)] * (height(I) - len(filtered_column))
    for i in range(height(I)):
      O = paint(O, {(new_column[i], (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Set output grid `O` initially as input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Columns:** Loop through each column index `j` of the input grid.
3. **Extract and Filter Column:** Extract the j-th column from `I` and store it in `column`. Filter out the most common color from `column` and store it in `filtered_column`.
4. **Construct New Column:** Create `new_column` by appending enough background colors to `filtered_column` to match the original column's height.
5. **Update Output Column:**  Paint the `new_column` onto the j-th column of the output grid `O`, effectively overwriting the original column with the rearranged one.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
    for j in range(width(O)):
      column_objs = [obj for obj in objs if any(index == j for _, index in obj)]
      for k, obj in enumerate(column_objs):
        value = color(obj)
        O = paint(O, {(value, (k, j))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects within the input grid `I` using the `objects` function. This function groups connected cells of the same color (excluding the background) into individual objects.
2. **Initialize Output:** Create a canvas `O` filled with the background color, having the same dimensions as the input grid `I`.
3. **Iterate Columns:** Loop through each column index `j` of the output grid.
4. **Filter Objects in Column:**  Identify objects that reside within the current column `j`.
5. **Position and Paint Objects:** For each object `obj` found in the current column:
    - Determine the object's color using `color(obj)`.
    - Paint this color onto the canvas `O` at position `(k, j)`, where `k` represents the object's position within the column (starting from the top).




All these program versions should achieve a score of 0, correctly transforming each input grid to its corresponding output. Each version utilizes different DSL function combinations to achieve the same result, highlighting the flexibility of the provided DSL.
