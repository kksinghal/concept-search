## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation shifts columns of pixels to the right based on the color value of the pixel.  The number of positions shifted is equal to the color value. Background pixels are not moved.

**Input 0:**
* The '3' pixel in the second row is shifted two positions to the right. 

**Input 1:**
* The '6' pixels in the third and fourth rows are shifted five positions to the right.

**Input 2:**
* The '8' pixels in the third row are shifted seven positions to the right.
* The '2' pixels in the fourth and fifth row are shifted one position to the right.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def shift_column_by_color(grid):
  h, w = shape(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if grid[i][j] != mostcolor(grid):
        shift_amount = grid[i][j] - 1
        new_j = min(j + shift_amount, w-1)  # Prevent shifting out of bounds
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, grid[i][j], {(i, new_j)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize:** Create a new blank grid (`new_grid`) of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate:** Loop through each cell in the input grid.
3. **Shift:** If the cell is not the background color:
    * Calculate the shift amount based on the cell value.
    * Calculate the new column index (`new_j`), ensuring it doesn't go out of bounds.
    * Fill the corresponding cell in the `new_grid` with the current cell's color.
4. **Return:** Return the transformed grid.


**Version 2:**

```python
def shift_column_by_color_v2(grid):
  h, w = shape(grid)
  shifted_objs = mapply(
      lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, color(obj) - 1)), 
      objects(grid, T, T, T)
  )
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), (h, w)), shifted_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify all objects (connected components) in the input grid.
2. **Shift Objects:** For each object:
    * Calculate the shift amount based on the object's color.
    * Shift the object horizontally by the calculated amount.
3. **Paint:** Create a blank grid (`new_grid`) and paint all shifted objects onto it.
4. **Return:** Return the transformed grid.


**Version 3:**

```python
def shift_column_by_color_v3(grid):
  h, w = shape(grid)
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), (h, w))
  for obj in objects(grid, T, T, T):
    new_obj = shift(obj, (0, color(obj) - 1))
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, new_obj)
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize:** Create a new blank grid (`new_grid`) of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Loop through each object in the input grid.
3. **Shift and Paint:** For each object:
    * Calculate the shift amount based on the object's color.
    * Shift the object horizontally by the calculated amount.
    * Paint the shifted object onto the `new_grid`.
4. **Return:** Return the transformed grid.


**Version 4:**

```python
def shift_column_by_color_v4(grid):
  h, w = shape(grid)
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      grid[i][j-grid[i][j]+1] if j-grid[i][j]+1 >= 0 and grid[i][j] != mostcolor(grid) else mostcolor(grid)
      for j in range(w)
    )
    for i in range(h)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Calculation:** This version directly calculates the new color for each cell based on the shift logic.
2. **Iterate:** Loop through each cell in the input grid.
3. **Conditional Shift:** If the cell is not the background color and shifting doesn't go out of bounds:
    * Calculate the new column index based on the shift amount (cell value - 1).
    * Use the color from the calculated new column index.
4. **Otherwise:** Use the background color.


**Version 5:**

```python
def shift_column_by_color_v5(grid):
  def shift_row(row):
    bg = mostcommon(row)
    return tuple(
      row[j-v+1] if j-v+1 >= 0 and v != bg else bg
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
  return tuple(shift_row(row) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Row-wise Shifting:** Define a helper function (`shift_row`) that applies the shift logic to a single row.
2. **Iterate Rows:** Apply the `shift_row` function to each row in the input grid.
3. **Shift Logic (within `shift_row`):** 
    * Determine the background color of the row.
    * Iterate through each cell in the row:
        * If the cell is not the background color and shifting doesn't go out of bounds, calculate the new column index and use its color.
        * Otherwise, use the background color.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. Each version leverages various DSL functions and logic to achieve the desired output.
