## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be moving all the non-background digits to the left, maintaining their relative vertical order. Here's a breakdown for each example:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
* The '3' digit, initially at position (1, 0), is moved left to position (0, 1).

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
* The '6' digits, initially at positions (2, 0) and (3, 0), are moved left to positions (0, 2) and (0, 3) respectively.
* The '4' digit, initially at position (3, 2), is moved left to position (1, 3).

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
* The '8' digits are moved to the leftmost positions in their respective rows.
* Similar movements happen for the '2' digits and the '1' digit.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL provided:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
    for j in range(width(I)):
        column = [(i, I[i][j]) for i in range(height(I)) if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I)]
        for k, (i, v) in enumerate(column):
            O = paint(O, {(v, (i, k))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialize Output:** Create an output grid `O` filled with the background color, having the same dimensions as the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Columns:** Loop through each column `j` of the input grid.
3. **Extract Non-Background Digits:** Collect all non-background digits and their row indices from the current column.
4. **Place in Output:** For each extracted digit, paint it onto the output grid at the same row `i` but shifted to column `k`, effectively moving them to the left.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        values = [v for v in row if v != mostcommon(I)]
        O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j)) for j, v in enumerate(values)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialize Output:** Create an output grid `O` filled with the background color, having the same dimensions as the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Rows:** Loop through each row `i` of the input grid.
3. **Filter Non-Background Digits:** Extract non-background digits from the current row.
4. **Paint to Output:**  For each extracted digit, paint it to the output grid at the same row `i` and sequentially increasing column index `j`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h, w = shape(I)
    non_bg = [(I[i][j], (i, j)) for i in range(h) for j in range(w) if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I)]
    sorted_cells = sorted(non_bg, key=lambda x: x[1][0])
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), (h, w))
    for j, (v, (i, _)) in enumerate(sorted_cells):
        O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Extract and Sort:**  Extract all non-background cells with their values and indices, then sort them based on their row index.
2. **Initialize Output:** Create an output grid `O` filled with the background color, having the same dimensions as the input grid `I`.
3. **Paint Sorted Cells:** Paint the sorted cells onto the output grid sequentially in increasing column order, maintaining their original row positions.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
    j = 0
    for obj in objs:
        for _, (i, _) in obj:
            O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, j))})
            j += 1
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Extract Objects:** Extract all objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Initialize Output:** Create an output grid `O` filled with the background, with the same size as the input.
3. **Place Objects Sequentially:**  Iterate through each object and paint its cells onto the output grid, moving to the next column for each subsequent object.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
    non_bg = [(i, j) for i in range(height(I)) for j in range(width(I)) if I[i][j] != mostcommon(I)]
    for k, (i, j) in enumerate(sorted(non_bg, key=lambda x: x[0])):
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j], (i, k))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find Non-Background:** Identify indices of all non-background cells in the input.
2. **Initialize Output:** Create an empty output grid with the same size as the input.
3. **Sorted Placement:** Sort the non-background indices by row, then iterate through them. For each index, paint the corresponding value from the input onto the output at the same row but in a sequentially increasing column.


These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation, each utilizing different combinations of DSL functions and logic.
