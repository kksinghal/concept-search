## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving all non-background colored cells to the leftmost available position on their respective rows while maintaining their relative order within the row. The background color remains unchanged.

**Input 0:**
- The '3' in the second row moves to the leftmost available position, replacing the '0'.

**Input 1:**
- In the first row, both '6's move to the leftmost available positions.
- In the third row, '5' and '4' shift leftwards to fill the empty spaces.

**Input 2:**
- '8's in the third row, '2's in the fourth row, and '1' in the fifth row all move to the leftmost available positions within their respective rows. 

## Program to be Generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    non_bg = [(j, v) for j, v in enumerate(row) if v != mostcommon(I)]
    new_j = 0
    for old_j, v in non_bg:
      O = paint(O, {(v, (i, new_j))})
      new_j += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Create a canvas `O` filled with the background color and having the same shape as the input `I`.
2. **Iterate Rows:** Loop through each row `i` of the input grid `I`.
3. **Collect Non-Background Cells:** For each row, collect the indices `j` and values `v` of non-background cells into a list `non_bg`.
4. **Place Cells in Output:** Iterate through the `non_bg` list and place each cell at the next available position `new_j` in the corresponding row `i` of the output grid `O`. Increment `new_j` after placing each cell. 

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    j = 0
    for k in range(w):
      if I[i][k] != mostcommon(I):
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][k], (i, j))})
        j += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Create a canvas `O` filled with the background color and having the same dimensions `h` and `w` as the input `I`.
2. **Iterate Rows and Cells:** Use nested loops to iterate through each cell `(i, k)` of the input grid `I`.
3. **Conditional Painting:** If the current cell is not the background color, paint it onto the output grid `O` at position `(i, j)`, where `j` tracks the next available position in the row. Increment `j` after painting.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    row = [v for v in I[i] if v != mostcommon(I)]
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Create a canvas `O` with background color and same shape as input `I`.
2. **Iterate Rows:** Loop through each row index `i` of `I`.
3. **Filter Non-Background:** Create `row` list containing only non-background values from the current row.
4. **Paint Filtered Cells:** Iterate through `row` and paint each value `v` at position `(i, j)` in `O`, where `j` is the index in the filtered list.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
    h, w = shape(I)
    bg = mostcommon(I)
    O = canvas(bg, (h, w))
    for i in range(h):
        j = 0
        for k in range(w):
            if I[i][k] != bg:
                O = paint(O, {(I[i][k], (i, j))})
                j += 1
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Get the height (`h`) and width (`w`) of input `I`, identify the background color (`bg`), and create an output canvas (`O`) with the same dimensions filled with the background color.
2. **Row Iteration:** Loop through each row (`i`) of the input grid.
3. **Cell Scanning & Shifting:** For each row, initialize a counter (`j`) to track the position for placing non-background cells. Iterate through the cells (`k`) in the row. If a cell doesn't contain the background color, paint it onto the output grid at position (`i`, `j`) and increment `j`. This ensures non-background cells are shifted to the left.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    row = [v for v in I[i] if v != mostcommon(I)]
    O = paint(cover(O, {(mostcommon(I), (i, j)) for j in range(width(I))}), {(v, (i, j)) for j, v in enumerate(row)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Modification:** Instead of creating a new canvas, this version directly modifies the input grid `I` and stores the result in `O`.
2. **Row-wise Processing:** It iterates through each row `i` of the grid.
3. **Filtering and Covering:**  For each row, it filters out the non-background values into a `row` list. Then, it covers the entire row in the output grid `O` with the background color.
4. **Repainting Non-background:** Finally, it paints the filtered non-background values from `row` back onto the output grid `O` at their new left-shifted positions, effectively achieving the desired transformation. 

These are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation. Each utilizes a different approach while adhering to the given DSL, showcasing diverse problem-solving techniques.
