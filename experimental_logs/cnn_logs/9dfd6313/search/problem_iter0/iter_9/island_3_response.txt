## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to shift the digits in each row of the input grid to the right, wrapping around the right edge and stopping when they encounter the most common digit in the row (likely the background). 

**Example:**

In `Input_0`, the transformation looks like this:

```
5 0 0   ->  5 3 0
3 5 0   ->  0 5 0 
0 0 5   ->  0 0 5 
```

- Row 1: '3' moves right, wrapping to the beginning, and stops before the '5'.
- Row 2: '3' moves right, wrapping to the beginning, and stops before the '5'.
- Row 3: No change, as there is only one distinct digit.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  def shift_row(row):
    bg = mostcommon(row) 
    shifted = []
    i = 0
    while i < len(row):
      j = (i + 1) % len(row)
      while row[j] == bg and j != i:
        j = (j + 1) % len(row)
      shifted.append(row[j])
      i += 1
    return tuple(shifted)
  return tuple(shift_row(row) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`solve(grid)`:** Takes the input grid.
2. **`shift_row(row)`:** Defines a function to process each row.
   - **`bg = mostcommon(row)`:** Identifies the most common digit in the row, assuming it's the background.
   - **`shifted = []`:** Initializes an empty list to store the shifted row.
   - **`while i < len(row)`:** Iterates through each element of the row.
   - **`j = (i + 1) % len(row)`:**  Finds the next index, wrapping around.
   - **`while row[j] == bg and j != i:`:** Skips background digits until a non-background or the starting index is reached.
   - **`shifted.append(row[j])`:** Appends the digit at the found index to the `shifted` list.
   - **`i += 1`:** Moves to the next digit in the row.
   - **`return tuple(shifted)`:** Returns the shifted row as a tuple.
3. **`return tuple(shift_row(row) for row in grid)`:** Applies `shift_row` to each row in the grid and returns the transformed grid.

**Version 2 (Using DSL functions):**

```python
def solve(grid):
  def shift_row(row):
    bg = mostcommon(row)
    indices = tuple(range(len(row)))
    shifted_indices = tuple((i + 1) % len(row) for i in indices)
    def condition(i): return row[i] != bg
    valid_indices = tuple(filter(condition, shifted_indices))
    return tuple(row[i] if i in valid_indices else bg for i in indices)
  return tuple(shift_row(row) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`solve(grid)`:** Takes the input grid.
2. **`shift_row(row)`:**  Defines a function to process each row.
   - **`bg = mostcommon(row)`:**  Identifies the background digit.
   - **`indices = tuple(range(len(row)))`:** Creates a tuple of row indices.
   - **`shifted_indices = tuple((i + 1) % len(row) for i in indices)`:**  Calculates shifted indices, wrapping around.
   - **`def condition(i): return row[i] != bg`:**  Defines a condition to check for non-background digits.
   - **`valid_indices = tuple(filter(condition, shifted_indices))`:** Filters shifted indices to keep only those pointing to non-background digits.
   - **`return tuple(row[i] if i in valid_indices else bg for i in indices)`:**  Constructs the shifted row by picking digits at valid indices or filling with background.
3. **`return tuple(shift_row(row) for row in grid)`:** Applies `shift_row` to each row and returns the transformed grid.


**Version 3 (Using `papply`):**

```python
def solve(grid):
    def shift_element(row, i):
      bg = mostcommon(row)
      j = (i + 1) % len(row)
      while row[j] == bg and j != i:
        j = (j + 1) % len(row)
      return row[j]
    return tuple(papply(shift_element, row, tuple(range(len(row)))) for row in grid)

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`solve(grid)`:** Takes the input grid.
2. **`shift_element(row, i)`:**  Defines a function to process each element in a row, taking the row and the element's index as input.
    - Calculates the shifted index (`j`) as in previous versions.
    - Returns the digit at the shifted index (`row[j]`).
3. **`return tuple(papply(shift_element, row, tuple(range(len(row)))) for row in grid)`:** 
    - For each row in the grid:
       - Uses `papply` to apply the `shift_element` function to each element of the row and its corresponding index.
       - Returns the transformed row as a tuple.

**Version 4 (Using modulo operation):**

```python
def solve(grid):
  def shift_row(row):
    bg = mostcommon(row)
    shifted = []
    for i in range(len(row)):
      j = (i + 1) % len(row)
      while row[j] == bg and j != i:
        j = (j + 1) % len(row)
      shifted.append(row[j])
    return tuple(shifted)
  return tuple(shift_row(row) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

- This version is almost identical to version 1, but instead of using conditional statements to handle wrapping, it directly uses the modulo operator (%) to calculate the shifted indices, making the code more concise.

**Version 5 (Functional approach with `apply`):**

```python
def solve(grid):
  def shift_row(row):
    bg = mostcommon(row)
    def shift_element(i):
      j = (i + 1) % len(row)
      while row[j] == bg and j != i:
        j = (j + 1) % len(row)
      return row[j]
    return tuple(apply(shift_element, tuple(range(len(row)))))
  return tuple(apply(shift_row, grid))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version takes a more functional approach by using the `apply` function to apply the `shift_row` function to each row of the grid and the `shift_element` function to each element's index within a row. 
- This eliminates the need for explicit looping and leverages higher-order functions for a more expressive and concise code structure.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to solving the problem using the provided DSL, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for image processing tasks.
