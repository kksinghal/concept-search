## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying cells surrounding objects formed by a specific digit (in this case, '8') and changing their value to another digit ('2'). Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- The '8' digits form a single object.
- All cells directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to the object's outer boundary are changed to '2'.
- Diagonal neighbors of the object remain unchanged.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- Similar to the previous case, cells directly adjacent to the '8' object become '2'.
- The transformation applies even when the object has holes (like the '0's enclosed within the '8's).

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

- The transformation consistently targets cells directly surrounding the '8' object, regardless of the object's shape or orientation.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  
  boundary = mapply(delta, objs) 
  O = fill(I, TWO, boundary)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`**:  Identifies objects in the grid 'I'. The arguments `(T, F, T)` specify that objects must be univalued (all cells same value), not consider diagonals for object formation, and exclude the background color.
2. **`boundary = mapply(delta, objs)`**:  For each detected object, the `delta` function finds the surrounding cells (the 'delta') and `mapply` applies this to all objects, merging the results.
3. **`O = fill(I, TWO, boundary)`**:  Fills the original grid 'I' with the value '2' at all indices present in the 'boundary' set.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  eights = ofcolor(I, EIGHT)
  neighbors = mapply(dneighbors, eights)
  boundary = difference(neighbors, eights)
  O = fill(I, TWO, boundary)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`eights = ofcolor(I, EIGHT)`**:  Finds the indices of all cells with the value '8'.
2. **`neighbors = mapply(dneighbors, eights)`**:  Finds the direct (non-diagonal) neighbors of all '8' cells.
3. **`boundary = difference(neighbors, eights)`**:  Removes the indices of '8' cells from the 'neighbors' set, leaving only the surrounding boundary cells.
4. **`O = fill(I, TWO, boundary)`**:  Fills the value '2' at the boundary indices in the grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(1, len(I)-1):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0])-1):
      if I[i][j] != EIGHT and (I[i-1][j] == EIGHT or I[i+1][j] == EIGHT or I[i][j-1] == EIGHT or I[i][j+1] == EIGHT):
        O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`**: Initializes the output grid 'O' as a copy of the input grid 'I'.
2. **Iterates through the grid (excluding borders):** The nested loops go through each cell of the grid, excluding the border cells.
3. **`if I[i][j] != EIGHT and ...`**: Checks if the current cell is not '8' and has at least one adjacent '8'.
4. **`O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j)})`**:  If the condition is met, the cell in the output grid 'O' is filled with '2'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    padded = vconcat((ONE, ONE), hconcat((ONE, ONE), vconcat(I, (ONE, ONE)))) 
    O = I
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] != EIGHT and index(padded, (i+2, j+2)) != ONE:
                O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`padded = ...`**: Creates a padded version of the input grid with '1's surrounding it. This simplifies boundary checks.
2. **`O = I`**: Initializes the output grid.
3. **Iteration and Check:** Iterates through the original grid, and for each cell not equal to '8', it checks if any neighbor in the padded grid is not '1' (meaning it's part of the '8' object).
4. **`O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j)})`**: Fills with '2' if the condition is met.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  shifted_up = vconcat((0, 0), I[:-1])
  shifted_down = vconcat(I[1:], (0, 0))
  shifted_left = hconcat((0, 0), I[:, :-1])
  shifted_right = hconcat(I[:, 1:], (0, 0))
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != EIGHT and (shifted_up[i][j] == EIGHT or shifted_down[i][j] == EIGHT or shifted_left[i][j] == EIGHT or shifted_right[i][j] == EIGHT):
        O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shifted Grids:** Creates four shifted versions of the input grid - up, down, left, and right - by one cell.
2. **Iteration and Comparison:**  Iterates through the original grid, and for each cell not '8', it checks if any of its corresponding positions in the shifted grids contains '8'.
3. **`O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j)})`**: Fills with '2' if the condition is met.

These five versions showcase different strategies and function combinations within the DSL to achieve the same visual transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and diverse problem-solving capabilities possible within a programming language.
