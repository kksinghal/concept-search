## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying objects (defined as connected areas of the same digit) with the value '2' and then creating a "border" of '1's around them. This border extends outwards until it hits either another object or the edge of the grid. 

**Example Breakdowns:**

* **Input_0:** The '2' at (0,0) gets a border extending right and down. The '2' at (1,3) gets a border extending in all directions except left.
* **Input_1:**  The '2' at (0,7) gets a border extending left and down. The '2' at (6,2) gets a border extending right and up.
* **Input_2:** The '2' at (1,1) gets a border extending in all directions.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  twos = colorfilter(objs, TWO)
  for two in twos:
    indices = toindices(two)
    for i, j in indices:
      for di, dj in [(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)]:
        new_i, new_j = i + di, j + dj
        if 0 <= new_i < len(I) and 0 <= new_j < len(I[0]) and I[new_i][new_j] == 0:
          I = fill(I, ONE, {(new_i, new_j)})
  return I 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  Finds all objects in the grid excluding the background (most common color).
2. **Filter for '2's:** Selects only the objects consisting of the digit '2'.
3. **Iterate and expand:** For each '2' object, it iterates through its cells and attempts to expand a border of '1's in all four directions.
4. **Boundary and object check:**  Ensures that the border expansion stays within the grid bounds and doesn't overwrite existing objects.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
  border = initset(ORIGIN)
  for obj in colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), TWO):
    border = border | backdrop(toindices(obj))
  return fill(I, ONE, delta(recolor(ZERO, border)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '2' objects:** Identifies objects with the value '2', excluding background.
2. **Create border area:**  Calculates the 'backdrop' (bounding box) of each '2' object and merges them into a single set of indices.
3. **Isolate border:**  Finds the difference between the border area and the actual '2' objects, resulting in only the border indices.
4. **Fill the border:** Fills the identified border indices with the value '1'. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
  for _ in range(max(height(I), width(I))):
    for i, j in ofcolor(I, TWO):
      for di, dj in [(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)]:
        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
        if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] == 0:
          I = fill(I, ONE, {(ni, nj)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterative expansion:** Iterates a sufficient number of times to ensure border expansion across the entire grid.
2. **Find '2' cells:** In each iteration, identifies all cells with the value '2'.
3. **Expand border:**  Attempts to place a '1' in each of the four adjacent cells of every '2', only if the cell is empty.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
  expanded = I
  for obj in colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), TWO):
    for direction in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]:
      shifted = shift(obj, direction)
      if len(intersection(toindices(shifted), asindices(I))) > 0 and len(intersection(shifted, asobject(I))) == 0:
        expanded = paint(expanded, recolor(ONE, toindices(shifted)))
  return expanded
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '2' objects:** Identifies objects with the value '2', excluding background.
2. **Directional expansion:** For each object and each cardinal direction, shifts the object by one unit.
3. **Validity check:**  Checks if the shifted object overlaps with the original grid but doesn't overlap with any existing objects.
4. **Paint border:** If valid, recolors the shifted object with '1's and paints it onto the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
  mask = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), TWO):
    mask = paint(mask, recolor(ONE, backdrop(toindices(obj))))
  return paint(fill(I, ONE, ofcolor(mask, ONE)), asobject(cellwise(I, mask, ZERO)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a mask:** Generates a blank grid (mask) of the same size as the input.
2. **Mark border areas:**  For each '2' object, marks its bounding box on the mask with '1's.
3. **Combine with original:**  Fills the input grid with '1's where the mask has '1's. Then, it overlays the original grid onto this result, preserving existing objects. 


These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation, leveraging different combinations of DSL functions and logic flow. Each version is designed to be significantly different, going beyond minor variations, to showcase the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
