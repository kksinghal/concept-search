## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** For each non-zero cell, fill all the cells to the right with 1s until reaching another non-zero cell or the grid boundary. Additionally, fill the cell above each non-zero cell with a 1, except for the top row.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:** Similar to the previous transformation, but only apply the right-fill to the bottom-most non-zero cell in each column. For the top-fill, only fill the cell directly above the left-most non-zero cell in each row, except for the top row. 

**Input_2 -> Output_2:** Identical transformation logic to Input_0 -> Output_0. 

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_fill(grid, i, j):
    for k in range(j + 1, width(grid)):
      if index(grid, (i, k)) == 0:
        grid = fill(grid, 1, {(i, k)})
      else:
        break
    return grid

  def top_fill(grid, i, j):
    if i > 0:
      grid = fill(grid, 1, {(i - 1, j)})
    return grid
  
  filled = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(filled, (i, j)) != 0:
        filled = right_fill(filled, i, j)
        filled = top_fill(filled, i, j)
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **right_fill(grid, i, j):** This function takes the grid and the coordinates (i, j) of a non-zero cell as input. It iterates through the cells to the right of (i, j) and fills them with 1s until encountering a non-zero cell or reaching the grid boundary.
2. **top_fill(grid, i, j):** This function takes the grid and the coordinates (i, j) of a non-zero cell. It fills the cell above (i, j) with a 1 if (i, j) is not in the top row.
3. The main function iterates through every cell in the grid. If a cell is non-zero, it calls `right_fill` and `top_fill` to apply the transformation.

**Program Version 2:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_fill_obj(obj, grid):
    for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
      grid = right_fill(grid, i, rightmost(obj))
    return grid

  def right_fill(grid, i, j):
    for k in range(j + 1, width(grid)):
      if index(grid, (i, k)) == 0:
        grid = fill(grid, 1, {(i, k)})
      else:
        break
    return grid

  def top_fill_obj(obj, grid):
    if uppermost(obj) > 0:
      grid = fill(grid, 1, {(uppermost(obj) - 1, leftmost(obj))})
    return grid
  
  filled = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    filled = right_fill_obj(obj, filled)
    filled = top_fill_obj(obj, filled)
  return filled 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **right_fill_obj(obj, grid):** This function applies the `right_fill` function to every row of a given object in the grid.
2. **top_fill_obj(obj, grid):** This function applies the top-fill logic specifically to the top-left corner of each object.
3. The main function first identifies all objects in the grid. For each object, it calls `right_fill_obj` and `top_fill_obj` to apply the desired transformations.


**Program Version 3:** (using `hsplit` and `vsplit`)

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_column(col):
    for i, val in enumerate(col):
      if val != 0:
        return (1,) * i + col[i:]
    return col
  
  def process_row(row):
    for i, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != 0:
        return row[:i+1] + (1,) * (len(row) - i - 1)
    return row

  rotated = rot90(I)
  processed = tuple(process_column(col) for col in rotated)
  rotated_back = rot270(processed)

  final = tuple(process_row(row) for row in rotated_back)
  return final
```

**Explanation:**

1. **process_column(col):** Processes each column from bottom to top, filling with 1s after the first non-zero value.
2. **process_row(row):** Processes each row from left to right, filling with 1s after the first non-zero value.
3. The main function rotates the grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise to process columns like rows.
4. It then applies `process_column` to each column and rotates the grid back 90 degrees clockwise.
5. Finally, it applies `process_row` to each row for the final transformation.

**Program Version 4:** (using `hconcat` and `vconcat`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_fill(grid):
    filled = tuple()
    for row in grid:
      for i, val in enumerate(row):
        if val != 0:
          filled += (row[:i+1] + (1,) * (len(row) - i - 1),)
          break
      else:
        filled += (row,)
    return filled

  def top_fill(grid):
    filled = tuple()
    for i, row in enumerate(grid):
      if i > 0 and any(val != 0 for val in row):
        filled += (((1,) * len(row)),) + grid[i:]
        break
      else:
        filled += (row,)
    return filled
  
  filled_right = right_fill(I)
  filled_top = top_fill(filled_right)
  return filled_top
```

**Explanation:**

1. **right_fill(grid):** Processes each row individually, replacing all values after the first non-zero value with 1s.
2. **top_fill(grid):** Iterates through rows, adding a row of 1s above the first row that contains a non-zero value.
3. The main function first applies `right_fill` to the input grid.
4. Then, it applies `top_fill` to the result of `right_fill` for the final transformation.

**Program Version 5:** (using `shift` and cell comparison)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  filled = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(filled, (i, j)) != 0:
        filled = right_fill(filled, i, j)
        if i > 0:
          filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i - 1, j)})
  return filled

def right_fill(grid, i, j):
  shifted = shift(grid, (0, 1))
  for k in range(j + 1, width(grid)):
    if index(grid, (i, k)) == 0 and index(shifted, (i, k)) == 0:
      grid = fill(grid, 1, {(i, k)})
    else:
      break
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **right_fill(grid, i, j):** This function shifts the grid to the right and compares each cell with the original grid. It fills cells with 1s if both the original and shifted cells are 0.
2. The main function iterates through each cell, applying `right_fill` and top-fill logic directly within the loop. It fills the cell above with a 1 if the current cell is non-zero and not in the top row.


Each program version utilizes different function combinations and logic to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and diversity of the provided DSL.
