## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:**

1.  **Identify target object:** The object containing the digit '2' is the target for transformation.
2.  **Expand horizontally:** The target object expands horizontally to the right, converting all '0's in its path to '1's. The expansion stops one cell before encountering a different digit ('6' in this case).

**Input 1 -> Output 1:**

1.  **Identify target object:** Again, the object containing the digit '2' is targeted.
2.  **Expand in two directions:**  This time, the target object expands both horizontally to the left and vertically upwards. Similar to before, the expansion converts '0's to '1's and halts before encountering different digits ('3' and '8').

**Input 2 -> Output 2:**

1.  **Identify target object:** The object with the digit '2' is targeted.
2.  **Surround with a border:** A border of '1's is created around the target object, effectively increasing its size by one cell in all directions.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    target_value = 2
    bg_value = 0
    new_value = 1
    
    target_object = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), target_value))
    expansion_area = backdrop(target_object)
    
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if (i, j) in expansion_area and value == bg_value:
                I = fill(I, new_value, {(i, j)})
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Initialization:** Sets up variables for target value, background value, and the value used for expansion.
2.  **Find Target Object:**  Identifies the object containing the `target_value` using `colorfilter` and `objects`.
3.  **Determine Expansion Area:**  Uses `backdrop` to define the area where expansion can occur.
4.  **Iterative Expansion:** Iterates through the grid and for each cell within the `expansion_area` that holds the `bg_value`, it replaces it with the `new_value`.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    target_value = 2
    bg_value = 0
    new_value = 1

    target_indices = ofcolor(I, target_value)
    expansion_indices = mfilter(apply(dneighbors, target_indices), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == bg_value)
    
    return fill(I, new_value, expansion_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Initialization:** Similar to Version 1, defines variables for relevant values.
2.  **Find Target Indices:** Uses `ofcolor` to find indices of cells containing the `target_value`.
3.  **Identify Expansion Indices:**  Applies `dneighbors` to each target index and then filters the resulting neighbors to only include those with the `bg_value` in the grid.
4.  **Direct Fill:** Fills the grid directly with the `new_value` at the identified `expansion_indices`.

## Program Version 3:

**(This version utilizes recursion. Note that recursion is not explicitly defined in the provided DSL, so you might need to adapt it based on the actual implementation of the language.)**

```python
def expand(grid, loc, target_value, bg_value, new_value):
    if index(grid, loc) == bg_value:
        grid = fill(grid, new_value, {loc})
        for neighbor in dneighbors(loc):
            grid = expand(grid, neighbor, target_value, bg_value, new_value)
    return grid

def solve(I):
    target_value = 2
    bg_value = 0
    new_value = 1

    start_loc = first(ofcolor(I, target_value))
    return expand(I, start_loc, target_value, bg_value, new_value)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`expand` Function:** Recursively expands from a given location. If the location has the `bg_value`, it fills it and recursively calls itself for each neighbor.
2.  **Main Logic:** Finds a starting location within the target object and calls the `expand` function.

## Program Version 4 & 5: 

Due to the limitations of the provided DSL and the abstract nature of the task, designing two more drastically different solutions while adhering strictly to the provided functions and ensuring they produce the exact output is challenging.  

Further versions could potentially explore:

*   Using different combinations of rotations and mirroring to achieve the expansion indirectly.
*   Implementing a more complex iterative approach that tracks expansion boundaries in different directions. 

However, these approaches would require assumptions about DSL functionalities not explicitly defined in the provided snippet. 

Feel free to provide additional DSL functions or clarify the limitations, and I can try to generate more diverse solutions.
