## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation involves identifying objects (clusters of non-zero digits) in the input grid and extending them to the right with the value '1' until they hit another object or the grid border. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  Similar to Input_0, objects are extended to the right with '1'. Additionally, the object with value '2' at the bottom left corner is extended upwards with '1' until it reaches another object or the grid border.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**  The object in the top left corner ('1's surrounding the '2') is extended downwards with the value '1' until it hits another object or the grid border.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T) 
    filled = I
    for obj in objs:
        rightmost_col = rightmost(obj)
        for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
            for j in range(rightmost_col + 1, len(I[0])):
                if index(I, (i, j)) == 0:
                    filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, j)})
                else:
                    break
    return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects (clusters of non-zero values).
2. **Iterate and Extend:** The program iterates through each object.
3. **Find Extension Point:** For each object, it finds the rightmost column.
4. **Fill Rightwards:** It extends the object rightwards with '1' until it encounters a non-zero value or the grid border.
5. **Update Grid:** The `filled` grid is updated with the extended object.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    filled = I
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val != 0:  
                for k in range(j+1, len(row)):
                    if index(I, (i, k)) == 0:
                        filled = fill(filled, 1, {(i, k)})
                    else:
                        break
    return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:** The program iterates through each cell of the grid.
2. **Check for Non-Zero:** If a cell has a non-zero value, it triggers the extension process.
3. **Extend Rightwards:** It fills all cells to the right with '1' until a non-zero value or the border is encountered.
4. **Update Grid:** The `filled` grid is updated in each iteration.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    def extend_right(obj, grid):
        right_edge = shoot(urcorner(obj), RIGHT)
        fill_area = difference(right_edge, toindices(obj))
        return fill(grid, 1, fill_area)

    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    filled = I
    for obj in objs:
        filled = extend_right(obj, filled)
    return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `extend_right`:** This function takes an object and the grid. It calculates the area to the right of the object and fills it with '1's.
2. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects.
3. **Iterate and Extend:**  Iterates through each object and applies `extend_right` to fill the area to its right.
4. **Update Grid:**  The `filled` grid is updated in each iteration. 


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    transposed = rot90(I)
    filled = rot90(I)
    for j, col in enumerate(transposed):
        for i, val in enumerate(col):
            if val != 0:
                for k in range(i+1, len(col)):
                    if index(transposed, (k, j)) == 0:
                        filled = fill(filled, 1, {(k, j)})
                    else:
                        break
    return rot270(filled) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transpose Grid:** The grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise (`rot90`) so the extension can be done downwards. 
2. **Iterate and Extend (Downwards):** Similar to Program Version 2, it iterates through the transposed grid and extends objects downwards.
3. **Rotate Back:** Rotates the `filled` grid back to the original orientation (`rot270`).

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    def right_fill_line(start, grid):
        line = shoot(start, RIGHT) 
        return fill(grid, 1, difference(line, toindices(objects(grid, T, F, T)))) 

    filled = I
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val != 0:
                filled = right_fill_line((i, j), filled)
    return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `right_fill_line`:**  Takes a starting point and the grid. It draws a line to the right and fills it with '1's, excluding existing objects. 
2. **Iterate and Fill:** Iterates through the grid and calls `right_fill_line` for each non-zero cell. 
3. **Update Grid:** The `filled` grid is updated with the filled line in each iteration.
