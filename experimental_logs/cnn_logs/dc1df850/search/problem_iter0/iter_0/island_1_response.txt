## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all the examples involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid and extending them diagonally by one cell in all four directions. The extended cells take on the value '1'.

**Input_0:**
* The '2' at (0,0) extends diagonally to (1,1)
* The '2' at (1,3) extends diagonally to (0,4), (2,4) and (2,2)
* The '6' at (3,1) extends diagonally to (2,0), (2,2), (4,0) and (4,2)

**Input_1:**
* The '2' at (0,7) extends diagonally to (1,6) and (1,8)
* The '3' at (2,3) extends diagonally to (1,2) and (3,2)
* The '8' at (4,6) extends diagonally to (3,5) and (5,5)
* The '2' at (6,2) extends diagonally to (5,1) and (7,1)

**Input_2:**
* The '2' at (1,1) extends diagonally to (0,0), (0,2), (2,0) and (2,2)


## Code Improvement:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify all objects in the grid
    extended_cells = set()
    for obj in objs:
      for v, (i, j) in obj:
        extended_cells |= {(i+di, j+dj) for di, dj in [(1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1)]}
    O = fill(I, 1, frozenset(extended_cells))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** We use the `objects` function to find all connected regions of the same digit in the input grid.
2. **Extend diagonally:** For each cell in each object, we generate the indices of its four diagonal neighbors using list comprehension.
3. **Fill with '1':**  We use the `fill` function to set the value of all the extended cells to '1'.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(1, height(I)-1):
    for j in range(1, width(I)-1):
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
        for di, dj in [(1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1)]:
          O = fill(O, 1, frozenset({(i+di, j+dj)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** This version iterates through each cell of the input grid except the border cells.
2. **Check for non-background:** It checks if the current cell is not part of the background (most common color).
3. **Fill diagonals:** If the cell is not background, it fills its four diagonal neighbors with '1'.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  shifted_grids = (shift(asobject(I), d) for d in [(1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1)])
  merged_grid = I
  for shifted_grid in shifted_grids:
    merged_grid = cellwise(merged_grid, paint(merged_grid, shifted_grid), 1)
  return merged_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create shifted grids:** This version creates four copies of the input grid, each shifted diagonally by one cell.
2. **Merge grids:** It then iterates through the shifted grids and merges them with the original grid. During merging, if a cell in the shifted grid has a value different from the background, it's replaced with '1'.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    diagonal_extensions = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((v, (i+di, j+dj)) for v, (i, j) in obj for di, dj in [(1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1)] if 0 <= i+di < height(I) and 0 <= j+dj < width(I)), objs)
    O = paint(I, merge(diagonal_extensions))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Similar to version 1, it identifies individual objects within the grid.
2. **Generate Diagonal Extensions:** For each object, it generates a new object containing diagonally extended cells, ensuring they fall within the grid boundaries.
3. **Paint Extensions:** It merges all the diagonal extensions and paints them onto the original grid, resulting in the transformed output.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
    one_padded_grid = vconcat((tuple(1 for _ in range(width(I))),), vconcat(I, (tuple(1 for _ in range(width(I))),)))
    one_padded_grid = hconcat((tuple(1 for _ in range(height(one_padded_grid))),), hconcat(one_padded_grid, (tuple(1 for _ in range(height(one_padded_grid))),)))
    
    def diagonal_fill(i, j):
        if one_padded_grid[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and one_padded_grid[i+1][j+1] == mostcolor(I): return 1
        if one_padded_grid[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and one_padded_grid[i+1][j-1] == mostcolor(I): return 1
        if one_padded_grid[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and one_padded_grid[i-1][j+1] == mostcolor(I): return 1
        if one_padded_grid[i][j] != mostcolor(I) and one_padded_grid[i-1][j-1] == mostcolor(I): return 1
        return one_padded_grid[i][j]

    transformed_grid = tuple(tuple(diagonal_fill(i, j) for j in range(1, width(one_padded_grid)-1)) for i in range(1, height(one_padded_grid)-1))
    
    return trim(transformed_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Pad with '1's:** It first pads the input grid with a border of '1's to simplify boundary checks.
2. **Diagonal Fill Function:** It defines a `diagonal_fill` function that checks for non-background cells and fills their empty diagonal neighbors with '1'.
3. **Apply Transformation:** It applies the `diagonal_fill` function to each cell (excluding the padded border) and constructs the transformed grid.
4. **Trim Padding:** Finally, it removes the padding to obtain the final output grid.

These five program versions showcase diverse approaches to achieve the diagonal extension transformation, employing different DSL function combinations and logic flows.
