## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation centers the object with color '3' horizontally and moves the object with color '4' to the bottom right corner of the grid.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

- **Object 3:** This object is always moved to the horizontal center of the grid, maintaining its original row position. 
- **Object 4:** This object is always moved to the bottom right corner of the grid.

## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Version 1: Using `extract` and individual object manipulation**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  threes = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
  fours = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 4)
  centered_threes = shift(threes, (0, w // 2 - centerofmass(threes)[1]))
  bottom_right_fours = shift(fours, (h - 1 - uppermost(fours), w - 1 - rightmost(fours)))
  return paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w)), centered_threes), bottom_right_fours)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get grid dimensions and objects:** `h, w = shape(I)` and `objs = fgpartition(I)` store the grid's height and width, and extract the non-background objects, respectively.
2. **Extract objects 3 and 4:**  `threes` and `fours` store the objects with colors '3' and '4', respectively, extracted from the `objs` set using `extract`.
3. **Center object 3 horizontally:** `centered_threes` shifts the '3' object horizontally to the center using its center of mass and the grid's width.
4. **Move object 4 to the bottom right:** `bottom_right_fours` shifts the '4' object to the bottom right corner by calculating the necessary offset from its current position.
5. **Paint on canvas:** A new canvas is created with the background color (`canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))`). The centered '3' object and the relocated '4' object are then painted onto this canvas.

**Version 2: Using loop and conditional shifting**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    if color(obj) == 3:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, w // 2 - centerofmass(obj)[1])))
    elif color(obj) == 4:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (h - 1 - uppermost(obj), w - 1 - rightmost(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get grid dimensions and create canvas:** Similar to Version 1, we get the grid dimensions and create a blank canvas with the background color.
2. **Iterate and conditionally shift:** We loop through each non-background object. 
    - If the object's color is '3', it's shifted horizontally to the center.
    - If the object's color is '4', it's shifted to the bottom right corner.
3. **Paint during iteration:** Each shifted object is immediately painted onto the canvas within the loop.

**Version 3: Using `branch` for conditional shifting**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, 
                       (branch(color(obj) == 4, h - 1 - uppermost(obj), 0),
                        branch(color(obj) == 3, w // 2 - centerofmass(obj)[1], w - 1 - rightmost(obj)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is very similar to Version 2, but it utilizes the `branch` function for a more compact conditional shifting logic within the `shift` function call. 

**Version 4: Using `apply` and a helper function**

```python
def _move_object(obj, h, w):
  if color(obj) == 3:
    return shift(obj, (0, w // 2 - centerofmass(obj)[1]))
  elif color(obj) == 4:
    return shift(obj, (h - 1 - uppermost(obj), w - 1 - rightmost(obj)))
  return obj

def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  moved_objs = apply(lambda obj: _move_object(obj, h, w), fgpartition(I))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w)), merge(moved_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Helper function for object movement:** A separate helper function `_move_object` handles the conditional shifting of objects based on their color.
2. **Apply helper function to objects:** The `apply` function applies the `_move_object` function to each non-background object, resulting in a set of shifted objects.
3. **Paint merged objects:** The shifted objects are merged and then painted onto a blank canvas.

**Version 5: Using list comprehension and conditional expression**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w)), merge(
      shift(obj, (0, w // 2 - centerofmass(obj)[1])) if color(obj) == 3
      else shift(obj, (h - 1 - uppermost(obj), w - 1 - rightmost(obj))) if color(obj) == 4
      else obj
      for obj in fgpartition(I)
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

This version compresses the logic into a single line using list comprehension and conditional expressions within the `merge` and `paint` function calls. It iterates through each object, conditionally shifting it based on its color and merging the results before painting onto the canvas.
