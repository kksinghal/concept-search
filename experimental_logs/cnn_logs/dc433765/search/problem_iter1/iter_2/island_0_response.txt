## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently moves the object with color '3' to the center column of the grid while maintaining its relative vertical position. The other objects remain in their original positions. 

**Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0, Output_0:** The '3' object shifts one column to the right to occupy the center column.
* **Input_1, Output_1:** The '3' object shifts one column to the left to occupy the center column.
* **Input_2, Output_2:** The '3' object is already in the center column; no change occurs.
* **Input_3, Output_3:** The '3' object shifts two columns to the left to occupy the center column.
* **Input_4, Output_4:** The '3' object shifts three columns to the right to occupy the center column.
* **Input_5, Output_5:** The '3' object shifts two columns to the right to occupy the center column.
* **Input_6, Output_6:** The '3' object shifts one column to the right to occupy the center column.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using different approaches and functions from the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(grid):
  objs = fgpartition(grid)  # Partition the grid into objects, excluding background
  three = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 3) # Extract the object with color '3'
  grid_center_col = width(grid) // 2  # Get the center column index of the grid
  three_center_col = centerofmass(three)[1] # Get the column index of the '3' object's center of mass
  offset = (0, grid_center_col - three_center_col) # Calculate the horizontal offset to center '3'
  return paint(cover(grid, three), shift(three, offset)) # Center the '3' object and paint it back

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition:** Divides the grid into individual objects, excluding the background.
2. **Extract:** Isolates the object containing the color '3'.
3. **Center Calculation:** Determines the horizontal center of the grid and the '3' object.
4. **Offset Calculation:** Calculates the horizontal distance to move the '3' object to the center.
5. **Shift and Paint:** Moves the '3' object by the calculated offset and paints it back onto the grid, effectively centering it horizontally.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(grid):
  three_indices = ofcolor(grid, 3) # Get indices of '3'
  grid_middle = (len(grid[0]) // 2)  # Calculate grid's middle column index
  obj_middle = (rightmost(three_indices) + leftmost(three_indices)) // 2 # Calculate object's middle column index
  shift_amount = grid_middle - obj_middle # Calculate the shift amount
  return paint(cover(grid, three_indices), shift(recolor(3, three_indices), (0, shift_amount))) # Shift and paint

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Indices and Midpoints:**  Finds the indices of '3' and calculates the middle column indices for both the grid and the '3' object.
2. **Shift Calculation:**  Determines the horizontal shift needed to center the object.
3. **Shift and Paint:**  Shifts the '3' object horizontally by the calculated amount and paints it onto a cleared version of the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(grid):
  obj = extract(objects(grid, T, F, T), lambda o: color(o) == 3) # Extract the '3' object
  grid_center_j = width(grid) // 2 # Calculate the grid's center column index
  object_center_j = centerofmass(obj)[1] # Calculate the '3' object's center column index
  j_offset = grid_center_j - object_center_j  # Calculate the horizontal offset
  return paint(cover(grid, obj), shift(obj, (0, j_offset))) # Center the '3' object and paint

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:**  Identifies and extracts the object composed of '3' from the grid.
2. **Center Calculation:**  Computes the center column indices for the grid and the '3' object.
3. **Offset and Centering:**  Calculates the required horizontal shift and moves the '3' object to the grid's center column.
4. **Painting:**  Draws the shifted '3' object onto a cleared version of the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(grid):
  for i in range(len(grid)):
    for j in range(len(grid[0])):
      if grid[i][j] == 3:
        target_j = len(grid[0]) // 2 # Calculate the target column index
        offset = (0, target_j - j) # Calculate the offset to move the '3' 
        return paint(cover(grid, {(3, (i, j))}), shift({(3, (i, j))}, offset)) # Move and paint '3'

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Locate:**  Scans the grid to locate the cell containing '3'.
2. **Target and Offset:**  Determines the target column index (center) and calculates the horizontal offset required.
3. **Shift and Paint:**  Shifts the '3' to the target column and paints it onto a cleaned grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(grid):
  three = extract(partition(grid), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3) # Extract object '3'
  mid = width(grid) // 2 # Calculate the middle column of the grid
  return paint(cover(grid, three), shift(three, (0,  mid - centerofmass(three)[1]))) # Center and paint '3'

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '3' Object:** Isolates the object containing the value '3' from the grid.
2. **Calculate Midpoint:**  Finds the horizontal middle of the grid.
3. **Center and Paint:** Shifts the '3' object to the grid's middle column while maintaining its row position and paints it onto a cleared grid.

Each program version accomplishes the specified transformation using different logic or DSL function combinations, making them distinct solutions.
