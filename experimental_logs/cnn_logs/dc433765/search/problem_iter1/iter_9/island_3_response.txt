## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation shifts all non-background objects to the center column while maintaining their relative vertical positions.

**Example:**

Input: 
```
0 0 3
0 0 0
4 0 0
```

Output:
```
0 0 0
0 3 0
4 0 0
```

Here, both '3' and '4' are moved to the center column (column index 1) while keeping their respective row positions.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  w = width(I) // 2 # Calculate the middle column index
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create an empty canvas
  for obj in fgpartition(I): # Iterate through non-background objects
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, w - centerofmass(obj)[1]))) # Center each object horizontally
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Calculate middle column:** `w = width(I) // 2` finds the index of the middle column.
2.  **Create empty canvas:** `O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates an output grid filled with the background color and having the same dimensions as the input.
3.  **Iterate and shift:** 
    *   The code iterates through each non-background object in the input grid.
    *   For each object, it calculates the horizontal shift required to move its center of mass to the middle column using `w - centerofmass(obj)[1]`.
    *   It then shifts the object using the `shift` function and paints it onto the output canvas using the `paint` function.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I) # Extract non-background objects
  mid = width(I) // 2 # Calculate the middle column index
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge({shift(obj, (0, mid - leftmost(obj) - width(obj) // 2)) for obj in objs}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** `objs = fgpartition(I)` isolates the non-background objects from the input grid.
2. **Calculate target column:** `mid = width(I) // 2` determines the index of the center column.
3. **Shift and merge:**
   *   For each object, it calculates the horizontal shift required to move its leftmost point to the middle column, adjusted by half its width.
   *   The objects are then shifted using `shift` and merged back onto a new canvas using `paint`. 

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for x in palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}:
        obj = extract(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == x)
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, width(I) // 2 - centerofmass(obj)[1])))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize canvas:** `O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` sets up an empty output grid.
2. **Iterate through colors:** It loops through each unique color in the input (except background).
3. **Find, shift, and paint:**
   *  `obj = extract(...)` finds the object of the current color.
   *  `O = paint(...)` shifts this object to the middle column and paints it onto the output canvas.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    out = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for obj in fgpartition(I):
        c = centerofmass(obj)
        out = paint(out, shift(obj, (0, width(I) // 2 - c[1])))
    return out 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create canvas:** `out = canvas(...)` prepares an empty canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Process objects:** The code iterates over non-background objects.
3. **Center and paint:** For each object:
   *  `c = centerofmass(obj)`:  Calculates the object's center of mass.
   *  `out = paint(...)`: Shifts the object horizontally to align its center of mass with the middle column of the output grid and paints it.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
                 merge(shift(obj, (0, width(I) // 2 - centerofmass(obj)[1]))
                       for obj in fgpartition(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Prepare canvas:** `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` sets up the output grid.
2. **Shift objects:** It shifts each non-background object horizontally. The shift amount is calculated to align the object's center of mass with the center column of the grid.
3. **Merge and return:**  All shifted objects are merged onto the prepared canvas using `paint`.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same outcome by utilizing various DSL functions and logic. Each version offers a distinct method for calculating and applying the horizontal shift required to center the objects.
