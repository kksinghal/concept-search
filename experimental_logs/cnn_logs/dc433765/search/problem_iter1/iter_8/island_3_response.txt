## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves swapping the positions of the objects represented by the digits 3 and 4 while maintaining their original shape and orientation. 

**Example:**

* **Input_0:**
   ```
   3 0 0
   0 0 0
   0 0 4 
   ```
* **Output_0:**
   ```
   0 0 0
   0 3 0
   0 0 4
   ```

In this example, the digit '3' at position (0,0) is moved to position (1,1), and the digit '4' at position (2,2) remains at the same position.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Extract objects with color 3 and 4
  obj3 = extract(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
  obj4 = extract(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == 4)
  # Paint the canvas with background color
  canvas_ = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), obj4)
  # Paint object 3 on the canvas
  return paint(canvas_, obj3)

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  The program first identifies and extracts the objects formed by the digits 3 and 4 from the input grid `I` using `fgpartition` and `extract`.
2. **Prepare Canvas:** It creates a new canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid and fills it with the background color using `canvas` and `paint`.
3. **Swap and Paint:** It paints object 4 first and then object 3 onto the canvas at their respective positions.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Create a function to swap colors
  swap = lambda v: {3:4, 4:3}.get(v, v)
  # Apply the swap function to each cell of the grid
  return tuple(tuple(swap(v) for v in row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Swap Function:** Defines a lambda function `swap` that takes a value `v` and returns '4' if `v` is '3', '3' if `v` is '4', and `v` otherwise.
2. **Apply Swap:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid `I` and applies the `swap` function to its value, effectively swapping the occurrences of '3' and '4'.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find indices of 3 and 4
  indices_3 = ofcolor(I, 3)
  indices_4 = ofcolor(I, 4)
  # Fill the original grid with background color
  new_grid = fill(I, mostcolor(I), asindices(I))
  # Fill the indices of 4 with 3, and vice-versa
  new_grid = fill(new_grid, 3, indices_4)
  new_grid = fill(new_grid, 4, indices_3)
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate Digits:** The program identifies the indices of all cells containing the digits 3 and 4 in the input grid using `ofcolor`.
2. **Clear and Fill:** It creates a new grid identical to the input but filled with the background color using `fill`. Then, it fills the cells at the indices of '4' with '3' and vice versa, effectively swapping their positions.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Replace 3 with a temporary value
  temp_grid = replace(I, 3, -1)
  # Replace 4 with 3
  temp_grid = replace(temp_grid, 4, 3)
  # Replace the temporary value with 4
  return replace(temp_grid, -1, 4)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Temporary Replacement:** Replaces all occurrences of '3' with a temporary value '-1' to avoid conflicts during the swapping process.
2. **Swap Digits:** Replaces '4' with '3' and then the temporary value '-1' with '4', effectively swapping the digits in the grid.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return switch(I, 3, 4)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Swap:** This version leverages the `switch` function to directly swap the values of '3' and '4' in the input grid `I` in a single step. 

These five versions utilize distinct approaches and DSL function combinations to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and versatility of the provided DSL.
