## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving the objects (represented by digits other than the background color 0) to new positions on the grid, while maintaining their original shape and orientation. The specific movement pattern is as follows:

* **3:** The object represented by the digit '3' is moved to the center column of the grid, maintaining its original row position. 
* **4:** The object represented by the digit '4' remains in its original position.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(grid):
  # Find the '3' object
  three_obj = extract(objects(grid, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
  # Calculate the target column for the '3' object
  target_column = width(grid) // 2
  # Calculate the shift needed for the '3' object
  shift_amount = (0, target_column - leftmost(three_obj))
  # Move the '3' object
  return paint(cover(grid, three_obj), shift(three_obj, shift_amount)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '3' Object:**  The code first identifies the object formed by the digit '3' using `objects` and `extract` functions.
2. **Calculate Target Position:**  It determines the target column for the '3' object, which is the middle column of the grid.
3. **Calculate Shift:**  The code calculates the horizontal shift required to move the '3' object to the target column.
4. **Move Object:** Finally, it uses `cover` to remove the '3' object from its original position, `shift` to move it by the calculated amount, and `paint` to draw it at its new location.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(grid):
  # Create a new grid with background color
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  # Iterate through each cell in the grid
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      # If the cell is not background
      if val != mostcolor(grid):
        # Calculate target position based on object value
        target_j = width(grid) // 2 if val == 3 else j
        # Paint the cell onto the new grid at its target position
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(val, (i, target_j))})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Empty Grid:** The code initializes a new empty grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Iterate & Relocate:** It iterates through each cell of the input grid. If the cell is not part of the background, it calculates the target position. If the cell value is '3', the target column is the middle column; otherwise, it retains its original column. It then paints the cell onto the new grid at its calculated target position. 

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(grid):
  # Extract '3' and '4' objects
  three_obj = extract(objects(grid, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
  four_obj = extract(objects(grid, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 4)
  # Calculate target column for the '3' object
  target_column = width(grid) // 2
  # Shift the '3' object
  shifted_three_obj = shift(three_obj, (0, target_column - leftmost(three_obj)))
  # Combine the objects onto a blank canvas
  return paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), shifted_three_obj), four_obj)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  The code first identifies the objects formed by the digits '3' and '4' using `objects` and `extract` functions.
2. **Calculate Target and Shift:** It determines the target column (middle) for the '3' object and calculates the horizontal shift required.
3. **Shift and Combine:** It shifts the '3' object to its target position. Then, it uses a blank canvas and paints both the shifted '3' object and the '4' object onto it, effectively creating the desired output grid. 

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(grid):
  # Find the column index of the leftmost '3' cell.
  col = leftmost(ofcolor(grid, 3))
  # Define a lambda function to reposition a cell value
  reposition = lambda j, v: (v, (j, width(grid) // 2)) if v == 3 else (v, (j, col)) if v == 4 else (0, (j, col))
  # Apply the reposition function to each cell and assemble the output grid
  return tuple(tuple(reposition(j, v)[0] for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(grid))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '3':** Find the column of the leftmost '3' cell.
2. **Reposition Logic:** A lambda function `reposition` defines the logic:
    - If cell value is '3', move it to the middle column of the same row.
    - If cell value is '4', move it to the same row, at the column where the leftmost '3' was.
    - Otherwise (background), fill with '0'.
3. **Apply & Reconstruct:** Apply `reposition` to each cell and reconstruct the grid.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(grid):
    # Get the middle column index
    mid = width(grid) // 2
    # Transpose the grid, making columns into rows
    transposed_grid = rot90(grid)
    # Create a new transposed grid
    new_transposed_grid = tuple()
    # Iterate over rows (originally columns)
    for i, row in enumerate(transposed_grid):
        # If the row (originally a column) contains a '3'
        if 3 in row:
            # Move it to the middle row (originally middle column)
            new_transposed_grid += ((transposed_grid[mid]),)
        else:
            # Otherwise, keep the row unchanged
            new_transposed_grid += (row,)
    # Transpose back to get the final grid
    return rot270(new_transposed_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transpose:**  The grid is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise, effectively swapping rows and columns. This simplifies the process of moving an entire column.
2. **Iterate and Move:** The code iterates through each row of the transposed grid (originally columns). If a row contains the value '3', it is replaced with the middle row of the transposed grid. 
3. **Transpose Back:** Finally, the transposed grid is rotated back 90 degrees clockwise to obtain the final output grid with the '3' object moved to the center column.

These five versions utilize different approaches and combinations of DSL functions, demonstrating distinct ways to achieve the same transformation.
