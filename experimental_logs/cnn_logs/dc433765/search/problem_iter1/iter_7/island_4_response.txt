## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently centers the non-background objects horizontally within their respective rows, while maintaining their vertical positions. 

Let's illustrate with an example:

**Input_2:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 3 0 0 4
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

**Output_2:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 3 0 4
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

Here, the objects represented by digits '3' and '4' are individually centered horizontally within their respective rows.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  return paint(
    canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
    merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, (width(I) - width(obj)) // 2 - leftmost(obj))), fgpartition(I)))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Extracts non-background objects from the input grid (`I`).
2. **`apply(lambda obj: ... , fgpartition(I))`:**  For each object:
    - **`(width(I) - width(obj)) // 2`:** Calculates the padding required to center the object.
    - **`- leftmost(obj)`:** Adjusts for the object's initial leftmost position.
    - **`shift(obj, (0, ...))`:**  Shifts the object horizontally to the center.
3. **`merge(...)`:** Combines the centered objects.
4. **`paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), ...)`:**  Paints the centered objects onto a blank canvas of the input's size and background color.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
      merge([shift(obj, (0, (width(I) - width(obj))//2 - leftmost(obj))) for obj in fgpartition(I)])
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version achieves the same outcome as Version 1 but uses list comprehension instead of `apply` for a more Pythonic approach.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  def center_object(obj):
    return shift(obj, (0, (width(I) - width(obj)) // 2 - leftmost(obj)))
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
      merge(map(center_object, fgpartition(I)))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version extracts the centering logic into a separate function (`center_object`) for improved readability and modularity. 


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  centered_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    offset = (0, (width(I) - width(obj)) // 2 - leftmost(obj))
    centered_objs.add(shift(obj, offset))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(centered_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

This version explicitly iterates through the extracted objects and calculates the centering offset for each before merging and painting. 


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  centered_objs = (
      shift(obj, (0, (width(I) - width(obj)) // 2 - leftmost(obj)))
      for obj in fgpartition(I)
  )
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(centered_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a generator expression to efficiently calculate the centered objects on the fly during the `merge` operation.

Each version accomplishes the required transformation by centering non-background objects horizontally within their respective rows while maintaining the grid structure and background. They differ in their implementation style, offering diverse approaches to the same problem.
