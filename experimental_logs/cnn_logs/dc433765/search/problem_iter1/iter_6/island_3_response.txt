## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves moving the non-background objects to the center column while preserving their relative vertical positions. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**
* The '3' and '4' are moved to the center column (column 1).
* The relative vertical positioning of '3' above '4' is maintained.

**Input_1:**
* Similar to Input_0, both digits are moved to the center column, preserving their vertical order.

**Input_2, Input_3, Input_4, Input_5:**
* These examples demonstrate the transformation consistently applies across varying grid sizes and object positions. Objects are always moved to the center column while maintaining their relative vertical order.

**Input_6:**
* This example highlights the preservation of vertical order even when the objects are initially in the same column.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions for achieving this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)  # Extract non-background objects
  center_col = width(I) // 2  # Find the center column index
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),  # Create a blank canvas
      merge({shift(obj, (0, center_col - centerofmass(obj)[1])) for obj in objs})  # Center each object horizontally
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  `fgpartition(I)` identifies and separates the non-background objects in the input grid.
2. **Find Center Column:** `width(I) // 2` calculates the index of the center column.
3. **Create Canvas:** `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` generates a blank grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
4. **Center Objects:** 
   -  `centerofmass(obj)[1]` finds the horizontal center of each object.
   -  `center_col - centerofmass(obj)[1]` determines the horizontal shift needed to center the object.
   -  `shift(obj, (0, ...))` moves each object to the center column.
5. **Paint Objects:** `paint(..., merge(...))` combines all the centered objects onto the blank canvas, creating the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(  # Construct the output grid row by row
      tuple(
          v if j == width(I) // 2 else mostcolor(I)  # Place the digit in the center column
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(I)  # Iterate through each row
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Rows:** The code iterates through each row and column of the input grid.
2. **Center Column Condition:** `j == width(I) // 2` checks if the current column is the center column.
3. **Conditional Placement:** If the current position is in the center column, the corresponding digit from the input row is placed; otherwise, the background color is used. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  new_objs = {frozenset({(v, (i, width(I) // 2)) for v, (i, _) in obj}) for obj in objs} 
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(new_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Similar to version 1, it extracts the non-background objects.
2. **Reposition Objects:** It creates new objects where each cell's column index is replaced with the center column index (`width(I) // 2`).
3. **Paint to Canvas:** It paints the repositioned objects onto a blank canvas to generate the output.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          I[i][j] if j == width(I) // 2 else mostcolor(I)  # Fill center column, otherwise background 
          for j in range(width(I))
      )
      for i in range(height(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Construct:** This version iterates through the grid and constructs the output directly.
2. **Center Column Check:** For each cell, it checks if it belongs to the center column (`j == width(I) // 2`).
3. **Conditional Filling:**  If in the center column, it takes the value from the corresponding cell in the input; otherwise, it fills with the background color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  return paint(
      canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
      merge(
          {shift(obj, (0, width(I) // 2 - (leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2))) for obj in objs}
      ),
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  It extracts non-background objects like previous versions.
2. **Calculate Shift:** It calculates the horizontal shift needed for each object to be centered based on the object's leftmost point and width.
3. **Shift and Paint:** It shifts each object horizontally and paints them onto a blank canvas to create the output.

These five program versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation, ranging from directly manipulating grid indices to working with object representations and transformations. Each version highlights the flexibility of the DSL and different coding styles for solving the problem.
