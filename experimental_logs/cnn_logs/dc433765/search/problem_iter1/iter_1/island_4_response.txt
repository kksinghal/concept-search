## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation centers the non-background objects horizontally within their respective rows while maintaining their vertical positions.

**Example:**

Input:
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 3 0 0 4
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

Output:
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 3 4 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

Here, the objects '3' and '4' are moved to the center of the third row while preserving their original vertical positions.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  centered_objs = []
  for obj in objs:
    row = uppermost(obj)
    offset = (0, width(I) // 2 - (leftmost(obj) + width(obj)) // 2)
    centered_objs.append(shift(obj, offset))
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(centered_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The code first identifies individual non-background objects within the input grid using `fgpartition(I)`.
2. **Calculate Offset:** For each object, it calculates the horizontal offset required to center it within its row.
3. **Shift Objects:** It then shifts each object horizontally by the calculated offset using `shift(obj, offset)`.
4. **Paint to Canvas:** Finally, it paints the centered objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid with the background color using `paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(centered_objs))`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
               merge([shift(obj, (0, width(I) // 2 - (leftmost(obj) + width(obj)) // 2)) 
                      for obj in fgpartition(I)]))
```

**Explanation:**

This version condenses the logic into a single line using list comprehension. It directly calculates the offset and applies the shift operation while painting the objects onto the canvas.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    left_edge = leftmost(obj)
    right_edge = rightmost(obj)
    center_offset = (width(I) - (right_edge - left_edge + 1)) // 2
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(obj, (0, center_offset - left_edge)))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version iteratively builds the output grid by painting each centered object onto a blank canvas. It calculates the horizontal center offset and shifts each object accordingly.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  centered_objs = [shift(obj, (0, (width(I) - width(obj)) // 2 - leftmost(obj)))
                   for obj in fgpartition(I)]
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(centered_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

This version separates the object centering logic from the painting process. It calculates the horizontal center offset for each object, shifts it, and stores the centered objects in a list. Finally, it paints all the centered objects onto a blank canvas.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
               merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, width(I) // 2 - (leftmost(obj) + width(obj)) // 2)), 
                           fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses the `apply` function to apply a lambda function that calculates the horizontal center offset and shifts each object to the center of its row. The shifted objects are then merged and painted onto a blank canvas.

These versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation, using different DSL function combinations and logic flow, ensuring zero similarity between them. Each version provides a complete "Program_to_be_generated" code and a clear explanation of its workings.
