## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently swaps the positions of the digits '3' and '4' within the grid while maintaining their original orientation. 

**Let's break it down for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 to Output_0:** The '3' at (0,0) swaps with '4' at (2,2).
* **Input_1 to Output_1:** The '3' at (1,0) swaps with '4' at (1,2) .
* **Input_2 to Output_2:** The '3' at (2,1) swaps with '4' at (2,4).
* **Input_3 to Output_3:** The '3' at (1,1) swaps with '4' at (4,4).
* **Input_4 to Output_4:** The '3' at (7,1) swaps with '4' at (2,2).
* **Input_5 to Output_5:** The '3' at (3,3) swaps with '4' at (9,3).
* **Input_6 to Output_6:** The '3' at (0,2) swaps with '4' at (2,0).


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the '3'-'4' swap:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_0d3d703e(I):
  """
  Finds and swaps the positions of digits '3' and '4' in the grid.
  """
  three_loc = first(ofcolor(I, THREE))
  four_loc = first(ofcolor(I, FOUR))
  O = fill(fill(I, ZERO, initset(three_loc)), FOUR, initset(three_loc))
  O = fill(fill(O, ZERO, initset(four_loc)), THREE, initset(four_loc))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '3' and '4':** `ofcolor` identifies the indices of '3' and '4'. `first` extracts the first occurrence (assuming only one of each exists).
2. **Swap via Overwriting:**  We use nested `fill` operations to:
    - Replace '3' with '0' 
    - Replace '0' at the '3' location with '4'
    - Repeat for '4' to '0' then '0' to '3'

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_0d3d703e(I):
  """
  Swaps '3' and '4' using object representation and manipulation.
  """
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  three_obj = first(colorfilter(objs, THREE))
  four_obj = first(colorfilter(objs, FOUR))
  O = paint(cover(I, three_obj), recolor(FOUR, three_obj))
  O = paint(cover(O, four_obj), recolor(THREE, four_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** `objects` extracts all single-color objects from the grid.
2. **Filter by Color:** `colorfilter` isolates the objects containing '3' and '4'.
3. **Swap and Paint:** 
    - `cover` removes the original object from the grid.
    - `recolor` changes the object's color.
    - `paint` draws the recolored object back onto the grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_0d3d703e(I):
  """
  Swaps '3' and '4' using a single iteration over grid cells.
  """
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = tuple(tuple(THREE if I[i][j] == FOUR else (FOUR if I[i][j] == THREE else I[i][j]) for j in range(w)) for i in range(h))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Grid Manipulation:** This version directly iterates through each cell of the grid.
2. **Conditional Replacement:** A nested conditional statement within the loop checks for '3' or '4' and swaps them directly.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_0d3d703e(I):
  """
  Swaps '3' and '4' using the switch function twice.
  """
  O = switch(I, THREE, FOUR)
  O = switch(O, FOUR, THREE)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Double Switch:** This version leverages the `switch` function twice to achieve the swap. 
    - The first `switch` swaps '3's with '4's.
    - The second `switch` swaps the newly placed '4's back to '3's, effectively achieving a complete swap. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_0d3d703e(I):
  """
  Swaps '3' and '4' by replacing one digit with a temporary value.
  """
  temp = 5 # Using a temporary value not present in the grid
  O = replace(I, THREE, temp) 
  O = replace(O, FOUR, THREE)
  O = replace(O, temp, FOUR)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Temporary Replacement:** This version uses a temporary value (`temp`) to facilitate the swap.
    - '3' is replaced with the `temp` value.
    - '4' is then replaced by '3'.
    - Finally, the `temp` value is replaced by '4', completing the swap. 

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to solving the same problem within the constraints of the DSL. Each version offers a different level of efficiency and complexity, highlighting the versatility of the DSL and the variety of solutions possible.
