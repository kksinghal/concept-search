## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves swapping the positions of the objects represented by the digits '3' and '4' in the input grid while maintaining their original shape and orientation. 

**Example:**

Input:
```
3 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 4
```

Output:
```
0 0 0
0 4 0
0 0 3
```

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_v1(I):
    # Find the objects represented by digits 3 and 4
    obj_3 = extract(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3) 
    obj_4 = extract(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == 4)
    
    # Cover the original positions of both objects
    I = cover(I, obj_3)
    I = cover(I, obj_4)
    
    # Paint the objects back onto the grid with swapped positions
    O = paint(I, obj_4)
    O = paint(O, obj_3)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The program first identifies the objects formed by digits '3' and '4' using `fgpartition` and `extract` functions.
2. **Clear Original Positions:** It then "erases" these objects from the grid by filling their positions with the background color using the `cover` function.
3. **Swap and Paint:** Finally, it paints the objects back onto the grid with their positions swapped using the `paint` function.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_v2(I):
    # Create a mapping of colors for swapping
    color_map = {3: 4, 4: 3}
    
    # Apply the color mapping to each cell in the grid
    O = tuple(tuple(color_map.get(v, v) for v in row) for row in I)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Color Mapping:** This version creates a dictionary `color_map` to map the digit '3' to '4' and vice versa.
2. **Direct Substitution:** It iterates through each cell in the grid and uses the `color_map` to replace the values, effectively swapping the '3' and '4' digits.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_v3(I):
  # Extract objects and their colors
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  colors = apply(color, objs)
  
  # Find the indices of '3' and '4' in the color list
  index_3 = colors.index(3)
  index_4 = colors.index(4)
  
  # Swap the objects at the identified indices
  objs_list = list(objs)
  objs_list[index_3], objs_list[index_4] = objs_list[index_4], objs_list[index_3]
  
  # Reconstruct the grid from the modified object list
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(objs_list))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object and Color Extraction:** This program extracts all objects and their corresponding colors from the grid.
2. **Index Swapping:**  It then finds the indices of objects with color '3' and '4' and swaps the objects at those indices within a list representation.
3. **Grid Reconstruction:** Finally, it reconstructs the output grid by painting the modified objects onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_v4(I):
    # Find the locations of digits '3' and '4'
    indices_3 = ofcolor(I, 3)
    indices_4 = ofcolor(I, 4)

    # Replace '3' with '4' and vice versa at the identified locations
    O = fill(I, 4, indices_3)
    O = fill(O, 3, indices_4)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate Digits:** This version utilizes the `ofcolor` function to find the indices of all occurrences of digits '3' and '4' within the grid.
2. **Direct Replacement:** It then directly replaces the values at these indices using the `fill` function, effectively swapping the '3' and '4' digits.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_v5(I):
    def swap_3_4(value):
        if value == 3:
            return 4
        elif value == 4:
            return 3
        else:
            return value
    
    # Apply the custom swapping function to each cell
    O = tuple(tuple(swap_3_4(v) for v in row) for row in I)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Custom Swapping Function:** This version defines a custom function `swap_3_4` that swaps '3' with '4' and vice versa while leaving other values unchanged.
2. **Cell-wise Application:** It then applies this custom function to each cell of the input grid using nested loops, effectively performing the desired swap.

These five programs demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version utilizes distinct logic and function combinations to arrive at the correct output grid.
