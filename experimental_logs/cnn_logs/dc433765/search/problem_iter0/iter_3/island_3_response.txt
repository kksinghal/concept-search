## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving the objects represented by the digits 3 and 4 to specific locations within the grid while maintaining their original color. 

* **Digit 3:**  Moves to the center of the top half of the grid.
* **Digit 4:**  Remains in its original column but moves to the center of the bottom half of the grid.

Let's break it down with examples:

**Input 0:**

```
3 0 0     0 0 0 
0 0 0  ->  0 3 0
0 0 4     0 0 4
```

* 3 moves from (0, 0) to (1, 1) - the center of the top half (1x2 grid).
* 4 stays in column 2 and moves from (2, 2) to (2, 2) - the center of the bottom half (1x3 grid).

**Input 2:**

```
0 0 0 0 0     0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0     0 0 0 0 0
0 3 0 0 4  ->  0 0 3 0 4
0 0 0 0 0     0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0     0 0 0 0 0 
```

* 3 moves from (2, 1) to (2, 2) - the center of the top half (2x5 grid).
* 4 stays in column 4 and moves from (2, 4) to (4, 4) - the center of the bottom half (3x5 grid).

This pattern holds true for all the provided input-output pairs.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve_56ff96f3(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  three = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
  four = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 4)
  new_three = shift(three, (height(I) // 2 - uppermost(three), width(I) // 2 - leftmost(three)))
  new_four = shift(four, (height(I) - uppermost(four), 0))
  O = paint(paint(cover(I, three), new_three), new_four) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  `fgpartition(I)` separates the input grid into objects based on color, excluding the background.
2. **Extract 3 and 4:** `extract` finds the object with color 3 and the object with color 4.
3. **Calculate new positions:** 
    * For digit 3:  Calculates the difference between the center of the top half of the grid and the current position of the object containing 3.  Shifts the object by this difference.
    * For digit 4: Calculates the difference between the bottom row of the grid and the current row of the object containing 4. Shifts the object vertically by this difference.
4. **Paint on the grid:** 
    * `cover(I, three)` removes the original digit 3 from the grid.
    * `paint(..., new_three)` paints the object containing 3 at its new position.
    * `paint(..., new_four)` paints the object containing 4 at its new position.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve_56ff96f3(I):
  three_loc = first(ofcolor(I, 3))
  four_loc = first(ofcolor(I, 4))
  new_three_loc = (len(I) // 2, len(I[0]) // 2)
  new_four_loc = (len(I) - 1, four_loc[1])
  O = paint(paint(fill(I, 0, {three_loc}), 3, {new_three_loc}), 4, {new_four_loc})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate 3 and 4:** `ofcolor` finds the indices of the digits 3 and 4 within the input grid. `first` takes the first occurrence (assuming only one of each digit exists).
2. **Define new locations:**
    * `new_three_loc` is set to the center of the grid.
    * `new_four_loc` keeps the same column index as the original 4 but moves to the bottom row.
3. **Manipulate grid:**
    * `fill(I, 0, {three_loc})` replaces the original 3 with a 0 (or background color).
    * `paint(..., 3, {new_three_loc})` paints a 3 at the calculated center position.
    * `paint(..., 4, {new_four_loc})` paints a 4 at the calculated bottom row position.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve_56ff96f3(I):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    three_i, three_j = first(ofcolor(I, 3))
    four_i, four_j = first(ofcolor(I, 4))
    O = canvas(0, (h, w))
    O = paint(O, {(3, (h // 2, w // 2))})
    O = paint(O, {(4, (h - 1, four_j))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get grid dimensions:** `h` and `w` store the height and width of the input grid.
2. **Find 3 and 4 locations:** Similar to version 2, this locates the indices of digits 3 and 4.
3. **Create empty canvas:** `canvas(0, (h, w))` generates a grid of the same size as the input, filled with zeros (or background color).
4. **Paint on canvas:**
    * Directly paints 3 at the center of the canvas.
    * Directly paints 4 at the bottom row, maintaining its original column position.


**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve_56ff96f3(I):
    obj3 = extract(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
    obj4 = extract(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == 4)
    new_obj3 = shift(obj3, subtract((len(I) // 2, len(I[0]) // 2), ulcorner(obj3)))
    new_obj4 = shift(obj4, (len(I) - 1 - uppermost(obj4), 0))
    O = paint(paint(cover(I, obj3), new_obj3), new_obj4)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and extract objects:** Similar to version 1, this separates objects and extracts those containing 3 and 4.
2. **Calculate offsets:**
   *  For object 3: Calculates the offset between the grid's center and the object's upper-left corner using `subtract`.
   *  For object 4: Calculates the vertical offset to move the object to the bottom row.
3. **Shift and paint:** 
    * Shifts object 3 by the calculated offset to center it.
    * Shifts object 4 vertically to the bottom row.
    * Covers the original object 3 with background color and then paints the shifted objects onto the grid.


**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve_56ff96f3(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for obj in objs:
    c = color(obj)
    if c == 3:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (h // 2 - uppermost(obj), w // 2 - leftmost(obj))))
    elif c == 4:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (h - 1 - uppermost(obj), 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects and get dimensions:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Create empty canvas:** Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.
3. **Iterate and paint:**
    * Loops through each extracted object.
    * If the object's color is 3, it's shifted to the center of the canvas and painted.
    * If the object's color is 4, it's shifted to the bottom row and painted.


These five programs offer diverse approaches to solving the transformation problem, utilizing different DSL functions and logic while achieving the same desired outcome. Each version demonstrates a unique way to manipulate and position objects within the grid.
