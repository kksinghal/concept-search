## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently swaps the positions of the objects with values '3' and '4' in the input grid, preserving their original shapes and colors, while leaving the rest of the grid unchanged.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  obj3 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
  obj4 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 4)
  O = paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), obj3), obj4)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`**:  Partitions the input grid `I` into objects, excluding the background color, and stores them in `objs`.
2. **`obj3 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)`**: Extracts the object with color '3' from `objs` and stores it in `obj3`.
3. **`obj4 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 4)`**: Extracts the object with color '4' from `objs` and stores it in `obj4`.
4. **`O = paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), obj3), obj4)`**: Creates a blank canvas with the background color and dimensions of the input, paints `obj3` onto it, then paints `obj4` onto the result, effectively swapping their positions.
5. **`return O`**: Returns the transformed grid `O`.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj3 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 3), I)
  obj4 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 4), I)
  O = paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), obj4), obj3)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj3 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 3), I)`**: Finds the indices of cells with color '3' and converts them into an object representation with their respective colors from the input grid `I`, storing the result in `obj3`.
2. **`obj4 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 4), I)`**:  Same as above but for cells with color '4', storing the result in `obj4`.
3. **`O = paint(paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), obj4), obj3)`**:  Creates a blank canvas, paints `obj4` first, then `obj3` on top, achieving the swap.
4. **`return O`**:  Returns the transformed grid.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val == 3:
                O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(i, j)})
                O = paint(O, {(4, (i, j))})
            elif val == 4:
                O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(i, j)})
                O = paint(O, {(3, (i, j))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`**: Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through each cell of the grid**:  The nested loops iterate over each cell of the input grid.
3. **`if val == 3`**: If the cell value is '3', it's replaced with background color and then repainted with '4'.
4. **`elif val == 4`**:  Similarly, if the cell value is '4', it's replaced with background and repainted with '3'.
5. **`return O`**: The modified grid `O` is returned.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices3 = ofcolor(I, 3)
  indices4 = ofcolor(I, 4)
  O = replace(replace(I, 3, mostcolor(I)), 4, 3)
  O = fill(O, 4, indices3)
  O = fill(O, 3, indices4)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`indices3 = ofcolor(I, 3)`**:  Gets the indices of all cells with color '3' in the input grid.
2. **`indices4 = ofcolor(I, 4)`**: Gets the indices of all cells with color '4' in the input grid.
3. **`O = replace(replace(I, 3, mostcolor(I)), 4, 3)`**: Replaces all '3's with the background color and then all '4's with '3' in the input grid, effectively deleting '3' and moving '4' to the '3's previous locations.
4. **`O = fill(O, 4, indices3)`**: Fills the cells at the original locations of '3' with color '4'.
5. **`O = fill(O, 3, indices4)`**:  Fills the cells at the original locations of '4' with color '3'.
6. **`return O`**: Returns the modified grid with swapped object positions.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  three_pos = extract(asindices(I), lambda x: index(I, x) == 3)
  four_pos = extract(asindices(I), lambda x: index(I, x) == 4)
  O = fill(fill(I, mostcolor(I), {three_pos}), 4, {three_pos})
  O = fill(fill(O, mostcolor(I), {four_pos}), 3, {four_pos})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`three_pos = extract(asindices(I), lambda x: index(I, x) == 3)`**: Finds the first occurrence of color '3' in the grid and stores its position in `three_pos`.
2. **`four_pos = extract(asindices(I), lambda x: index(I, x) == 4)`**: Finds the first occurrence of color '4' in the grid and stores its position in `four_pos`.
3. **`O = fill(fill(I, mostcolor(I), {three_pos}), 4, {three_pos})`**: Fills the cell at `three_pos` with the background color and then fills it with color '4', effectively replacing '3' with '4'.
4. **`O = fill(fill(O, mostcolor(I), {four_pos}), 3, {four_pos})`**:  Similarly, this line replaces '4' with '3' in the grid.
5. **`return O`**: Returns the transformed grid with the swapped object positions.
