## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation relocates the non-zero objects within the grid, positioning them on a vertical line in the center of the grid while maintaining their relative vertical order. The background color (0) remains unchanged.

**Example:**

Input:
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 3 0 0
0 0 0 0 4
0 0 0 0 0 
0 2 0 0 0
```

Output:
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 3 0 0
0 0 2 0 0
0 0 0 0 4 
0 0 0 0 0
```

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, T, F, T), key=lambda obj: uppermost(obj))
  h = height(I)
  center_j = width(I) // 2
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    O = paint(O, shift(normalize(obj), (h//2 + i - len(objs)//2, center_j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Sort Objects:** Extract non-background objects and sort them based on their uppermost row position.
2. **Calculate Center Column:** Determine the horizontal center of the grid.
3. **Create Empty Canvas:** Generate an empty grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (0).
4. **Paint Objects to Center:**  Iterate through sorted objects, normalize their positions, shift them to the center column and sequentially downwards, and paint them onto the canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  h, w = shape(I)
  center = (h // 2, w // 2)
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(objs, key=lambda obj: centerofmass(obj)[0])):
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, subtract(center, centerofmass(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition into Objects:** Divide the grid into objects based on color, excluding the background.
2. **Determine Grid Center:** Find the center coordinates of the grid.
3. **Initialize Empty Grid:** Create a blank grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color (0).
4. **Center and Paint Objects:** Iterate through the objects, sorted by their vertical center of mass. For each object, calculate the offset needed to center it and paint the shifted object onto the blank grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  h, w = height(I), width(I)
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(objs, key=lambda x: uppermost(x))):
    O = paint(O, shift(normalize(obj), (i + (h - len(objs)) // 2, w // 2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extract non-background objects from the input grid.
2. **Get Grid Dimensions:** Obtain the height and width of the input grid.
3. **Create Blank Canvas:** Generate an empty grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (0).
4. **Position and Paint:**  Iterate through the objects, sorted by their uppermost row. Calculate the vertical offset to center the objects and place them sequentially downwards in the center column. Paint each shifted object onto the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  h = height(I)
  mid = width(I) // 2
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, obj in enumerate(sorted(objs, key=lambda obj: uppermost(obj))):
    offset = (h // 2 + i - len(objs) // 2 - uppermost(obj), mid - leftmost(obj))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, offset))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Isolate Objects:** Separate the grid into distinct objects based on color, excluding the background.
2. **Find Middle Column:** Determine the middle column index of the grid.
3. **Prepare Empty Canvas:** Create an empty grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (0).
4. **Calculate Offsets and Paint:**  Iterate through objects, sorted by their top row. For each object, calculate the horizontal and vertical offsets needed to center it vertically and align it with the middle column. Paint the shifted object onto the canvas. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  non_zero_cells = [(I[i][j], (i, j)) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0])) if I[i][j] != 0]
  sorted_cells = sorted(non_zero_cells, key=lambda x: x[1][0])
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i, (v, (r, c)) in enumerate(sorted_cells):
    O = paint(O, {(v, (i + (h - len(sorted_cells)) // 2, w // 2))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Non-Zero Cells:** Identify and collect all cells with non-zero values, storing their value and coordinates.
2. **Sort by Row:** Sort the collected cells based on their row index.
3. **Get Grid Dimensions:** Obtain the height and width of the input grid.
4. **Create Blank Canvas:** Generate an empty grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (0).
5. **Center and Paint Cells:** Iterate through the sorted cells. For each cell, calculate its new position to be in the center column and sequentially downwards. Paint this cell onto the blank grid.
