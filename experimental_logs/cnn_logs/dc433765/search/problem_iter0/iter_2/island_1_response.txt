## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation centers the '3' object vertically while maintaining its original horizontal position. The '4' object remains in its initial location.

**Program Version 1:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  # Find the location of '3'.
  three_loc = extract(asindices(grid), lambda loc: index(grid, loc) == 3)
  # Calculate the vertical center of the grid.
  center_row = height(grid) // 2 
  # Maintain the horizontal position of '3'.
  center_col = three_loc[1] 
  center_loc = (center_row, center_col)
  # Move the '3' to the center vertically.
  grid = fill(grid, 0, initset(three_loc))
  grid = fill(grid, 3, initset(center_loc))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Find '3' Location:** `three_loc = extract(asindices(grid), lambda loc: index(grid, loc) == 3)` identifies the coordinates of the '3' digit.
2.  **Calculate Vertical Center:** `center_row = height(grid) // 2` determines the middle row index of the grid.
3.  **Maintain Horizontal Position:** `center_col = three_loc[1]` retains the original column index of the '3' digit.
4.  **New '3' Location:** `center_loc = (center_row, center_col)` combines the calculated center row and original column into a new target location for '3'.
5.  **Move '3':**  
    *   `grid = fill(grid, 0, initset(three_loc))` removes the '3' from its original position by replacing it with a '0'.
    *   `grid = fill(grid, 3, initset(center_loc))` places the '3' at the calculated center location.

**Program Version 2:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  # Extract the '3' object
  three_obj = extract(objects(grid, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
  # Calculate the required vertical offset 
  offset = (height(grid) // 2 - uppermost(three_obj), 0)
  # Move the object
  grid = paint(cover(grid, three_obj), shift(three_obj, offset))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Extract '3' Object:** `three_obj = extract(objects(...), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)` identifies the '3' object as a collection of cells.
2.  **Calculate Vertical Offset:**  `offset = (height(grid) // 2 - uppermost(three_obj), 0)` determines the vertical distance between the top of the '3' object and the center row. The horizontal offset is kept at 0. 
3.  **Move the Object:** 
    *   `grid = cover(grid, three_obj)` removes the '3' object from the grid.
    *   `grid = paint(grid, shift(three_obj, offset))` paints the '3' object back onto the grid, shifted by the calculated offset.

**Program Version 3:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  # Get indices of '3'.
  three_indices = ofcolor(grid, 3)
  # Calculate the vertical center.
  center_row = height(grid) // 2
  # Find the existing row of '3'.
  current_row = first(three_indices)[0] 
  # Calculate the vertical offset.
  offset = (center_row - current_row, 0) 
  # Move the '3' object.
  grid = paint(cover(grid, three_indices), shift(recolor(3, three_indices), offset)) 
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Find '3' Indices:** `three_indices = ofcolor(grid, 3)` finds the locations of all cells containing '3'.
2.  **Calculate Vertical Center:** `center_row = height(grid) // 2` finds the middle row index.
3.  **Find '3' Row:** `current_row = first(three_indices)[0]`  gets the row index of any '3' cell (assuming '3' forms a connected object).
4.  **Calculate Vertical Offset:** `offset = (center_row - current_row, 0)` calculates the vertical shift needed to move '3' to the center row, keeping the horizontal offset at 0.
5.  **Move '3':** 
    *   `grid = cover(grid, three_indices)` removes the '3' object.
    *   `grid = paint(grid, shift(recolor(3, three_indices), offset))` repaints the '3' object, shifted by the calculated offset.

**Program Version 4:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    # Find the '3' object.
    three_obj = extract(objects(grid, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
    # Create a new object with '3' at the vertical center.
    centered_obj = recolor(3, shift(normalize(three_obj), (height(grid) // 2, 0))) 
    # Modify the grid.
    grid = paint(cover(grid, three_obj), centered_obj)
    return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Find '3' Object:** `three_obj = extract(...)`  locates the '3' object within the grid.
2.  **Normalize '3':** `normalize(three_obj)`  shifts the '3' object so its top-left corner is at (0, 0) for easier manipulation.
3.  **Center '3':** `centered_obj = recolor(3, shift(..., (height(grid) // 2, 0)))` creates a new object identical to the normalized '3', but shifted vertically to the grid's center row.
4.  **Modify Grid:** 
    *   `grid = cover(grid, three_obj)` removes the original '3' object.
    *   `grid = paint(grid, centered_obj)` paints the newly created and centered '3' object onto the grid. 

**Program Version 5:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  # Identify the '3' object
  three_obj = extract(objects(grid, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
  # Determine the vertical center of the grid
  center_row = height(grid) // 2
  # Calculate the difference between the '3' object's center and the grid's center
  diff = center_row - (uppermost(three_obj) + height(three_obj) // 2)
  # Apply the difference to shift the object vertically
  shifted_obj = shift(three_obj, (diff, 0))
  # Paint the shifted object back onto the grid
  return paint(cover(grid, three_obj), shifted_obj)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify '3' Object:**  `three_obj = extract(objects(grid, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)` locates the '3' object. 
2.  **Determine Vertical Center:** `center_row = height(grid) // 2`  calculates the grid's middle row.
3.  **Calculate Vertical Difference:** `diff = center_row - (uppermost(three_obj) + height(three_obj) // 2)` finds the vertical distance between the object's center and the grid's center.
4.  **Shift the Object:** `shifted_obj = shift(three_obj, (diff, 0))` moves the object vertically by the calculated difference.
5.  **Paint Shifted Object:** 
    *   `grid = cover(grid, three_obj)`  clears the original '3' object.
    *   `return paint(grid, shifted_obj)` draws the shifted '3' onto the grid.
