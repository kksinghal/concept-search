## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place in these input-output pairs can be described as follows:

1. **Transpose:** The input grid is transposed, meaning rows become columns and vice versa.
2. **Conditional Swap:** The values 3 and 4 are swapped within the transposed grid. All other values remain unchanged.

## Program Version 1: Using `dmirror` and `switch`

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return switch(dmirror(I), 3, 4)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`dmirror(I)`:** This function performs a diagonal mirroring of the input grid `I`, effectively transposing it.
2. **`switch(..., 3, 4)`:** This function then switches the values 3 and 4 within the transposed grid.

## Program Version 2:  Using Loops and Conditional Assignment

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(0, (w, h))  
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == 3:
        O[j][i] = 4
      elif I[i][j] == 4:
        O[j][i] = 3
      else:
        O[j][i] = I[i][j]
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Grid:** An empty grid `O` is created with dimensions swapped from the input `I`.
2. **Iterate and Assign:** The code iterates through each cell of the input `I`. If the cell value is 3, it assigns 4 to the corresponding transposed position in `O`. Similarly, if the cell value is 4, it assigns 3. Other values are copied directly to their transposed positions. 

## Program Version 3: Using List Comprehension and `zip`

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(4 if v == 3 else 3 if v == 4 else v for v in row)
      for row in zip(*I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`zip(*I)`:** This transposes the input grid `I`.
2. **List Comprehension:**  The nested list comprehension iterates through each value `v` in the transposed grid.  If `v` is 3, it outputs 4. If `v` is 4, it outputs 3. Otherwise, it outputs the original value `v`. This effectively performs the conditional swap during the transposition. 

## Program Version 4: Using `rot90` and Mirroring

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return switch(hmirror(rot90(I)), 3, 4)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`rot90(I)`:** Rotates the input grid `I` 90 degrees clockwise.
2. **`hmirror(...)`:** Mirrors the rotated grid horizontally. This combined with the rotation results in a transposition.
3. **`switch(..., 3, 4)`:**  Performs the conditional swap of values 3 and 4.

## Program Version 5: Using `apply` and Custom Function

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def swap_3_4(row):
    return tuple(4 if v == 3 else 3 if v == 4 else v for v in row)
  return tuple(apply(swap_3_4, zip(*I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`swap_3_4` function:** Defines a function that takes a row, iterates through it, and swaps values 3 and 4 while leaving other values unchanged.
2. **`zip(*I)`:** Transposes the input grid `I`.
3. **`apply(swap_3_4, ...)`:**  Applies the `swap_3_4` function to each row (now a column) of the transposed grid. This effectively performs the conditional swap after transposition.
