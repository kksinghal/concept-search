## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation centers the '3' object horizontally in each grid while preserving the relative positions of other objects.

**Example:**

Input_0:
```
3 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 4
```

Output_0:
```
0 0 0
0 3 0
0 0 4
```

Here, the '3' is moved from the leftmost column to the center column. The '4' object remains in the same relative position.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" in the provided DSL:


### Program Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  # Get the '3' object.
  three_obj = next(obj for obj in objects(grid, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False) if color(obj) == 3)
  # Calculate the horizontal center.
  center_j = width(grid) // 2
  # Calculate the shift needed to center the '3'.
  shift_amount = center_j - (leftmost(three_obj) + width(three_obj) // 2)
  # Shift the '3' object.
  shifted_three = shift(three_obj, (0, shift_amount))
  # Paint the shifted object back onto a blank canvas.
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), shifted_three)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the '3' object:**  We iterate through all objects in the grid and find the one with color '3'.
2. **Calculate the target position:** We determine the horizontal center of the grid.
3. **Calculate the shift amount:**  We calculate the difference between the current '3' center and the target center.
4. **Shift the object:**  We shift the '3' object horizontally by the calculated amount.
5. **Paint onto a blank canvas:** We create a blank canvas and paint the shifted '3' object onto it.


### Program Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  # Transpose the grid, center vertically, then transpose back.
  return rot270(bbbejdcfgfebedbajffbegdaahdeejdg(rot90(grid)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages the provided `bbbejdcfgfebedbajffbegdaahdeejdg` function, which centers an object vertically.

1. **Rotate:** We rotate the grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise so that horizontal centering becomes vertical centering.
2. **Center vertically:** We apply the provided function to center the '3' object vertically.
3. **Rotate back:** We rotate the grid back to its original orientation.


### Program Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  # Find the column index of the '3' object's leftmost cell.
  col = leftmost(ofcolor(grid, 3))
  # Calculate the target column index for centering.
  target_col = width(grid) // 2
  # Calculate the offset needed to move the column.
  offset = target_col - col
  # Create a new grid by shifting columns.
  return tuple(tuple(r[(j - offset) % width(grid)] for j in range(width(grid))) for i, r in enumerate(grid))
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on shifting columns to achieve horizontal centering.

1. **Find the '3' column:**  We find the column index containing the leftmost '3' cell.
2. **Calculate target column:**  We determine the target column index for the centered '3'.
3. **Calculate the offset:**  We calculate the difference between the current and target column indices.
4. **Shift columns:** We create a new grid by shifting columns based on the calculated offset. 


### Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  # Extract all objects from the grid.
  objs = objects(grid, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  # Find the '3' object.
  three_obj = next(obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == 3)
  # Calculate the target center for the '3' object.
  target_center = (centerofmass(three_obj)[0], width(grid) // 2) 
  # Calculate the shift vector.
  shift_vector = subtract(target_center, centerofmass(three_obj))
  # Shift all objects by the calculated vector.
  shifted_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, shift_vector) for obj in objs)
  # Paint the shifted objects onto a blank canvas.
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(grid)), merge(shifted_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

This version shifts all objects by the same amount to center the '3' object.

1. **Extract objects:** We extract all objects from the grid.
2. **Find the '3' object:**  We find the object with color '3'.
3. **Calculate the target center:**  We determine the desired center for the '3' object. 
4. **Calculate the shift vector:** We calculate the vector needed to move the '3' object to the target center.
5. **Shift all objects:** We shift all extracted objects by the calculated vector.
6. **Paint onto a blank canvas:** We create a blank canvas and paint the shifted objects onto it. 


### Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  # Get the '3' indices.
  three_indices = ofcolor(grid, 3)
  # Calculate the horizontal center of the '3' indices.
  center_j = (leftmost(three_indices) + rightmost(three_indices)) // 2
  # Calculate the target center column.
  target_col = width(grid) // 2
  # Calculate the offset.
  offset = target_col - center_j
  # Shift the grid columns.
  return tuple(tuple(grid[i][(j + offset) % width(grid)] for j in range(width(grid))) for i in range(height(grid)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly manipulates the grid based on the '3' indices. 

1. **Get '3' indices:** We obtain the indices of all cells containing '3'.
2. **Calculate '3' center:** We determine the horizontal center of the '3' cells.
3. **Calculate target column:** We find the target column index for centering.
4. **Calculate the offset:** We compute the difference between the current '3' center and the target column.
5. **Shift grid columns:** We create a new grid by shifting the columns based on the calculated offset.
