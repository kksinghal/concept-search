## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves moving the '3' object and the '4' object in the input grid to specific positions in the output grid, regardless of their original locations. Here's a breakdown:

* **'3' Object:** The '3' object is always moved to the center of the grid in the vertical direction and one step to the left of the center in the horizontal direction. 
* **'4' Object:**  The '4' object is always moved one position below the '3' object in the output grid.

This holds true for all the input-output pairs provided.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  three_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
  four_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 4)
  center_i = height(I) // 2
  center_j = width(I) // 2 - 1 
  O = paint(O, shift(three_obj, (center_i - uppermost(three_obj), center_j - leftmost(three_obj))))
  O = paint(O, shift(four_obj, (center_i + 1 - uppermost(four_obj), center_j - leftmost(four_obj))))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The program first identifies the '3' and '4' objects within the input grid (`I`).
2. **Create Canvas:** It then creates an empty output grid (`O`) with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3. **Calculate Target Positions:** It calculates the target positions for both objects. The '3' object's target is the center of the grid, and the '4' object's target is one position below the '3'.
4. **Move and Paint:** The program then moves both objects to their target locations on the output grid and paints them.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  three_indices = ofcolor(I, 3)
  four_indices = ofcolor(I, 4)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  target_i = height(I) // 2
  target_j = width(I) // 2 - 1
  O = fill(O, 3, shift(three_indices, (target_i - uppermost(three_indices), target_j - leftmost(three_indices))))
  O = fill(O, 4, shift(four_indices, (target_i + 1 - uppermost(four_indices), target_j - leftmost(four_indices))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate Objects:** This version directly locates all cells containing '3' and '4' in the input grid, getting their indices.
2. **Prepare Output:** An empty canvas for the output is created, mirroring the input grid's size.
3. **Determine Destination:** Target positions for the center of both '3' and '4' are calculated.
4. **Shift and Fill:** The '3' and '4' indices are shifted to align with the calculated targets, and then these positions on the output canvas are filled with the respective values.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  three = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
  four = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 4)
  target = (height(I) // 2, width(I) // 2 - 1)
  O = paint(O, shift(three, subtract(target, ulcorner(three))))
  O = paint(O, shift(four, subtract((target[0]+1, target[1]), ulcorner(four))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  The code identifies and extracts the '3' and '4' objects from the input grid.
2. **Create Blank Grid:** An empty output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid is generated.
3. **Define Target:** The central target position for the '3' object is determined.
4. **Calculate Offsets:**  The required shifts for both '3' and '4' are calculated based on their upper-left corner positions relative to the target.
5. **Shift and Paint:** Both objects are shifted to their new positions on the output grid and painted.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  three_obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 3)
  four_obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 4)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  h, w = shape(I)
  center = (h // 2, w // 2 - 1)
  O = paint(O, shift(three_obj, subtract(center, centerofmass(three_obj))))
  O = paint(O, shift(four_obj, subtract((center[0] + 1, center[1]), centerofmass(four_obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Isolate Objects:** This version pinpoints the '3' and '4' objects within the input grid.
2. **Prepare Canvas:** An empty output grid with the input's dimensions is created.
3. **Find Center:** The program determines the center of the output grid, which will be the target position for the '3' object.
4. **Calculate Offsets:** For both objects, the offset needed to move their center of mass to the target position is calculated.
5. **Apply Transformation:** The objects are shifted according to the calculated offsets and drawn onto the output grid. 

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  three_loc = first(ofcolor(I, 3))
  four_loc = first(ofcolor(I, 4))
  target = (height(I) // 2, width(I) // 2 - 1)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  O = fill(O, 3, shift({three_loc}, subtract(target, three_loc)))
  O = fill(O, 4, shift({four_loc}, subtract((target[0] + 1, target[1]), four_loc)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find First Occurrences:** This code identifies the location of the first occurrence of '3' and '4' in the input grid. 
2. **Target Position:**  The target position for '3' is determined as the center of the grid.
3. **Empty Canvas:** An empty output grid of the same size as the input is created.
4. **Calculate Offsets:**  The offsets required to move the first occurrences of '3' and '4' to their target positions are calculated.
5. **Shift and Fill:** The code then shifts the locations of '3' and '4' based on the calculated offsets and fills these new positions on the output grid with the corresponding values. 

Each program version utilizes a different combination of functions from the DSL to achieve the same transformation, ensuring diversity in the generated solutions.
