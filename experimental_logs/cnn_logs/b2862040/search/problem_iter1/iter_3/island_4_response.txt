## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently swaps the colors '1' and '8' within the grid, while leaving other colors untouched.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  ones = colorfilter(objs, 1)
  eights = colorfilter(objs, 8)
  O = paint(I, recolor(8, merge(apply(toindices, ones))))
  return paint(O, recolor(1, merge(apply(toindices, eights))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We use `objects()` to identify all distinct objects in the grid, regardless of their color or shape.
2. **Filter by Color:**  `colorfilter()` isolates the objects consisting solely of '1's and '8's, storing them in `ones` and `eights` respectively.
3. **Swap Colors:** We iterate through `ones` and `eights` and use `recolor()` to switch their colors to '8' and '1' respectively.  The `merge(apply(toindices, ones))` and `merge(apply(toindices, eights))` expressions ensure that we're working with a single set of indices for each color.
4. **Paint onto Grid:** `paint()` applies the recolored objects back onto a copy of the input grid (`O`), effectively swapping the '1's and '8's.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return replace(replace(I, 1, 8), 8, 1)
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a simpler approach:

1. **Double Replacement:**  We perform two consecutive `replace()` operations. 
   - The first replaces all occurrences of '1' with '8'.
   - The second replaces all '8's (including those that were originally '1's) with '1'.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return switch(I, 1, 8)
```

**Explanation:**

This version is the most concise, directly utilizing the `switch()` function:

1. **Direct Switching:** `switch(I, 1, 8)` efficiently swaps all occurrences of '1' and '8' within the input grid `I`.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
    eight_indices = ofcolor(I, 8)
    O = fill(I, 8, one_indices)
    return fill(O, 1, eight_indices) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Indices:** We use `ofcolor()` to directly find the indices of cells containing '1' and '8', storing them in `one_indices` and `eight_indices`.
2. **Fill by Indices:** `fill()` is then used twice:
    - First, to replace all cells at indices in `one_indices` with '8'.
    - Second, to replace cells at indices in `eight_indices` with '1'.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        O = fill(O, 8, {(i,j)})
      elif I[i][j] == 8:
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version employs a more iterative approach:

1. **Iterate and Replace:**  We iterate through each cell in the grid. 
   - If the cell value is '1', we use `fill()` to replace it with '8'.
   - If the cell value is '8', we use `fill()` to replace it with '1'.


Each of these program versions successfully achieves the desired transformation of swapping colors '1' and '8' in the input grid. They demonstrate a range of approaches, highlighting the flexibility of the provided DSL.
