## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on recoloring specific occurrences of the digit '1' to the digit '8' within the input grids. The recoloring pattern appears to target '1's that are part of horizontally oriented structures while preserving vertically oriented structures.

**Let's analyze each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 -> Output_0:** All horizontally connected '1's are recolored to '8', except for the single '1' in the seventh row.
* **Input_1 -> Output_1:**  Similar to Output_0, all horizontally connected '1's are recolored to '8' while vertical structures of '1' remain unchanged. 
* **Input_2 -> Output_2:**  The pattern holds; horizontal '1' structures are recolored to '8' while vertical ones remain as '1'.
* **Input_3 -> Output_3:** Again, the same pattern is observed. Horizontal '1' structures become '8' and vertical '1' structures are preserved.


## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1 and not vline(obj))
  indices_to_recolor = mapply(toindices, filtered_objs)
  O = fill(I, 8, indices_to_recolor)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies all distinct connected objects within the grid, excluding the background (digit '9').
2. **Filter Objects:** `sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1 and not vline(obj))` selects objects that are composed of the digit '1' and are not vertical lines.
3. **Extract Indices:** `mapply(toindices, filtered_objs)` extracts the indices of the cells belonging to the selected objects.
4. **Recolor:** `fill(I, 8, indices_to_recolor)` recolors the cells at the extracted indices to the digit '8'.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 1 and ((j > 0 and I[i][j - 1] != 1) or j == 0) and ((j < len(row) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 1) and (j < len(row) - 1)):
        O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Recolor:** This version iterates through each cell of the grid.
2. **Horizontal Check:** It checks if a cell contains '1' and is at the beginning of a horizontal sequence of '1's.
3. **Recolor:** If the condition holds, it recolors that cell to '8'.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(8, obj) if color(obj) == 1 and width(obj) > 1 else obj, objs)
  O = paint(canvas(9, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Recolor:** Similar to version 1, it identifies objects. If an object is made of '1' and has a width greater than 1 (horizontal), it's recolored to '8'.
2. **Paint:** A new canvas filled with the background color is created. Then, the recolored objects are painted back onto this canvas.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  h = height(I)
  w = width(I)
  O = canvas(9, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
      current_color = None
      start_j = None
      for j in range(w):
          if I[i][j] == 1 and current_color != 1:
              current_color = 1
              start_j = j
          elif I[i][j] != 1 and current_color == 1:
              if j - start_j > 1: # Horizontal line longer than 1
                  O = fill(O, 8, {(i, k) for k in range(start_j, j)})
              else:
                  O = fill(O, 1, {(i, k) for k in range(start_j, j)})
              current_color = None
      if current_color == 1 and w - start_j > 1:
          O = fill(O, 8, {(i, k) for k in range(start_j, w)})
      elif current_color == 1:
          O = fill(O, 1, {(i, k) for k in range(start_j, w)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Track:** This program iterates through rows, tracking horizontal sequences of '1's.
2. **Recolor based on Length:** If a sequence is longer than one cell, it's recolored to '8', otherwise, it remains as '1'.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  def recolor_condition(obj):
    return color(obj) == 1 and any((i, j + 1) in toindices(obj) for i, j in toindices(obj))
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(8, obj) if recolor_condition(obj) else obj, objs)
  O = paint(canvas(9, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Check for Horizontal Neighbors:**  Objects are identified. For each object composed of '1', the code checks if any cell within the object has a right neighbor that is also part of the same object. 
2. **Recolor based on Neighbors:** If a right neighbor is found within the same object, indicating a horizontal structure, the object is recolored to '8'.


## Conclusion:

These five program versions utilize a variety of DSL functions and logic to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version offers a unique approach to identifying and recoloring horizontal structures of '1's while preserving vertical ones, effectively achieving the target transformation observed in the input-output examples.
