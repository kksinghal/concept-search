## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently recolors specific objects within the input grid to the value '8'. Let's break down the logic for each input-output pair:

* **Pair 0:**  The object formed by connected '1's is recolored to '8', except for the '1' directly connected to the object of '1's on the right edge of the grid.
* **Pair 1:**  Similar to Pair 0, the object of connected '1's is recolored to '8', but this time, the recoloring excludes the '1's connected to any object extending to the edge of the grid.
* **Pair 2:**  Again, the main object of '1's is recolored to '8', excluding the parts connected to any object touching the grid border.
* **Pair 3:** This pair reinforces the pattern - recolor the primary '1' object to '8', excluding portions connected to objects touching the grid edge.

## Code Generation:

The core challenge is to accurately identify and exclude the '1's connected to border-touching objects. We can achieve this by leveraging DSL functions like `objects`, `bordering`, `connected`, and potentially some spatial reasoning. 

Below are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Extract connected objects, excluding background.
  main_obj = mostcommon(objs, size) # Identify the largest object (likely the main '1' object).
  border_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: bordering(toindices(obj), I)) # Find objects touching the border.
  connected_to_border = mfilter(border_objs, lambda obj: len(intersection(toindices(obj), neighbors(toindices(main_obj)))) > 0) # Objects directly connected to the main object.
  recolor_area = difference(toindices(main_obj), connected_to_border)  # Exclude connected parts from recoloring.
  O = fill(I, 8, recolor_area) # Recolor the remaining area of the main object.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Extract connected objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Find Main Object:** Determine the largest object, assuming it's the primary object we want to recolor.
3. **Locate Border Objects:** Identify objects directly touching the grid's border.
4. **Find Connected Parts:**  Find objects connected to both the main object and the border objects.
5. **Exclude Connected Area:**  Remove the indices of the connected parts from the main object's indices.
6. **Recolor and Return:** Recolor the remaining area of the main object to '8' and return the modified grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  main_obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)  # Directly extract the object with color '1'.
  border_indices = outbox(asindices(I)) # Get indices forming the outer border of the grid.
  connected_indices = mfilter(border_indices, lambda loc: len(intersection(neighbors(loc), toindices(main_obj))) > 0) # Indices around the border connected to the main object.
  recolor_area = difference(toindices(main_obj), connected_indices) # Exclude connected indices from recoloring.
  O = fill(I, 8, recolor_area) # Fill the remaining area with '8'.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Main Object:**  Directly extract the object composed of '1's.
2. **Define Border:**  Determine the indices forming the outer boundary of the grid.
3. **Find Connected Border Indices:**  Identify border indices directly connected to the main object.
4. **Exclude Connected Area:**  Remove the connected border indices from the main object's indices.
5. **Recolor and Return:** Fill the remaining area of the main object with '8' and return the modified grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  main_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  border_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: any(index(I, loc) != 9 for loc in outbox(toindices(obj)))) # Objects with non-9 values around their outer box.
  connected_to_border = mfilter(border_objs, lambda obj: len(intersection(toindices(obj), neighbors(toindices(main_obj)))) > 0) # Objects directly connected to the main object.
  recolor_area = difference(toindices(main_obj), connected_to_border) 
  O = fill(I, 8, recolor_area)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Extract connected objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Find Main Object:** Extract the object made of '1's.
3. **Locate Border-Connected Objects:** Identify objects that have at least one non-'9' value in their outer box, indicating a connection to a border-touching object.
4. **Find Connected Parts:** Identify border-connected objects directly adjacent to the main object. 
5. **Exclude Connected Area:**  Remove the indices of the connected parts from the main object's indices.
6. **Recolor and Return:** Recolor the remaining area of the main object to '8' and return the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  main_obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  expanded_main_obj = toindices(main_obj)
  for _ in range(2): # Expand the object twice to ensure capturing all connected components
      expanded_main_obj = mapply(neighbors, expanded_main_obj)
      expanded_main_obj = intersection(expanded_main_obj, asindices(I)) # Keep only valid indices within the grid.
  recolor_area = difference(expanded_main_obj, toindices(main_obj)) # The difference will be the connected components
  O = fill(I, 8, recolor_area)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Main Object:**  Directly extract the object composed of '1's.
2. **Expand Main Object:**  Expand the main object's area by considering its neighbors twice. This helps capture potentially distant connections to border-touching objects.
3. **Limit to Grid:** Ensure the expanded area remains within the grid's boundaries.
4. **Find Difference (Connected Parts):**  The difference between the expanded area and the original main object represents the connected parts.
5. **Recolor and Return:**  Recolor the identified connected parts to '8' and return the modified grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  main_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  border_cells = sfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: bordering({loc}, I)) # Directly get border cell indices
  connected_to_border = mfilter(border_cells, lambda loc: manhattan(loc, toindices(main_obj)) <= 2) # Border cells within 2 manhattan distance from the main object.
  recolor_area = difference(toindices(main_obj), connected_to_border)
  O = fill(I, 8, recolor_area)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extract connected objects, excluding the background.
2. **Find Main Object:**  Extract the object composed of '1's.
3. **Get Border Cells:**  Directly obtain indices of cells located on the grid's border.
4. **Find Connected Border Cells:** Identify border cells within a Manhattan distance of 2 or less from any cell in the main object.
5. **Exclude Connected Area:** Remove the connected border cells from the main object's indices. 
6. **Recolor and Return:** Recolor the remaining area of the main object to '8' and return the grid. 

These five program versions provide distinct approaches to solving the transformation task. Each leverages different DSL functions and logic to achieve the desired outcome.
