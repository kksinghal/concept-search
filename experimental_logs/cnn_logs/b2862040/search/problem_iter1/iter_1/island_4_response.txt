## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently swaps the colors '1' and '8' in the input grids. 

**Let's analyze each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0, Output_0:** All occurrences of '1' become '8', and vice-versa.
* **Input_1, Output_1:** Same color swap applied.
* **Input_2, Output_2:**  The same pattern holds.
* **Input_3, Output_3:** Consistent color swapping between '1' and '8'. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions for "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL provided in `dsl.py` to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1 (Simple Replacement):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Swaps colors '1' and '8' in the input grid.
  """
  O = replace(I, 1, 8)  # Replace all '1' with '8'
  O = replace(O, 8, 1)  # Replace all '8' with '1' 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`replace(I, 1, 8)`:**  This replaces all occurrences of the value '1' in the input grid `I` with the value '8'. 
2. **`replace(O, 8, 1)`:** This line takes the intermediate grid `O` (where '1's are now '8's) and replaces all '8's with '1's, effectively completing the swap.

**Program Version 2 (Using Switch):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Swaps colors '1' and '8' in the input grid using switch.
  """
  O = switch(I, 1, 8)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`switch(I, 1, 8)`:** This function directly swaps the values '1' and '8' in the input grid `I` in a single step.

**Program Version 3 (Set-based Color Swap):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Swaps colors '1' and '8' using set operations and recoloring.
  """
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)  # Get indices of '1'
  eights = ofcolor(I, 8)  # Get indices of '8'
  O = paint(I, recolor(8, ones))  # Paint '1' indices with '8'
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, eights))  # Paint '8' indices with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)` and `ofcolor(I, 8)`:** These extract the indices of cells containing '1' and '8' respectively.
2. **`recolor(8, ones)`:** This creates a new object with the color '8' at the indices where '1' was present.
3. **`paint(I, ...)`:** This paints the new object onto the grid. 
4. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated for the color '8', effectively swapping the colors. 

**Program Version 4 (Iterative Cell Modification):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Swaps colors '1' and '8' by iterating through the grid. 
  """
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(9, (h, w))  # Create a blank canvas filled with '9'
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j)})
      elif I[i][j] == 8:
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
      else:
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(9, (h, w))`:** Creates a new grid `O` with the same dimensions as the input `I` filled with the value '9'.
2. **Iterative Swap:** The code iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`. 
   - If a cell contains '1', it fills the corresponding cell in `O` with '8'.
   - If a cell contains '8', it fills the corresponding cell in `O` with '1'.
   - Otherwise, it copies the original value from `I` to `O`.

**Program Version 5 (Functional Approach):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Swaps colors '1' and '8' using a functional approach and apply.
  """
  def swap_color(v):
    return {1: 8, 8: 1}.get(v, v)
  
  O = tuple(apply(lambda row: tuple(apply(swap_color, row)), I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`swap_color(v)`:** This inner function takes a value `v` and returns '8' if `v` is '1', '1' if `v` is '8', and `v` itself otherwise. 
2. **`apply(swap_color, row)`:** This applies the `swap_color` function to each element (value) within a row.
3. **`apply(lambda row: ..., I)`:** This applies the entire swapping logic to each row of the input grid `I`, effectively swapping '1' and '8' throughout the grid.
