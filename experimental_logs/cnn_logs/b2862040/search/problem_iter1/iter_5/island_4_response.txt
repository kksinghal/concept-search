## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation logic seems to revolve around identifying objects (clusters of connected pixels with the same value) and then selectively recoloring them based on their position within the grid.  Here's a breakdown of the input-output pairs:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation identifies all '1' objects and recolors them to '8', except for the '1' object located in the bottom right corner of the grid.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the previous transformation, all '1' objects are re-colored to '8', with the exception of the '1' object closest to the bottom right corner of the grid. 

**Input_2 to Output_2:** Again, '1' objects are identified and re-colored to '8', excluding the '1' object closest to the bottom right corner.

**Input_3 to Output_3:** The pattern continues.  All '1' objects are identified and recolored to '8', except for the '1' object closest to the bottom right corner.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Based on the transformation analysis, here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  target_obj = argmax(objs, lambda obj: lrcorner(obj)[0] * 100 + lrcorner(obj)[1])
  O = paint(I, recolor(8, difference(objs, {target_obj})))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We use `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` to find all objects within the grid, considering diagonally connected pixels as separate objects and excluding the background color.
2. **Find Target Object:**  `argmax(objs, lambda obj: lrcorner(obj)[0] * 100 + lrcorner(obj)[1])` finds the object whose bottom-right corner has the maximum sum of its row and column index, effectively targeting the object closest to the bottom-right corner. 
3. **Recolor and Paint:** We then recolor all objects except the target object to '8' using `recolor(8, difference(objs, {target_obj}))`, and finally, paint these objects back onto the original grid to get the desired output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  target_loc =  lrcorner(asindices(I))
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  target_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: target_loc in toindices(obj))
  O = paint(I, recolor(8, difference(objs, {target_obj})))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Target Location:** First, we find the bottom-right corner coordinates of the entire grid using `lrcorner(asindices(I))`.
2. **Identify Target Object:** We find the object containing the target location found in step 1 using `extract(objs, lambda obj: target_loc in toindices(obj))`.
3. **Recolor and Paint:**  Similar to version 1, we recolor all objects except the identified target object and paint them back onto the grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  target_obj = argmax(objs, lambda obj: sum(i + j for i, j in toindices(obj)))
  O = paint(I, recolor(8, difference(objs, {target_obj})))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions, we identify all objects in the grid.
2. **Find Target Object:** This version uses a different approach to locate the target object. It calculates the sum of row and column indices for every cell in each object using `sum(i + j for i, j in toindices(obj))`. The object with the maximum sum will be the one closest to the bottom-right corner.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** Identical to previous versions, we recolor and paint the objects to generate the output.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  target_loc = lrcorner(one_indices)
  target_obj = extract(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), lambda obj: target_loc in toindices(obj))
  O = paint(I, combine(recolor(8, difference(one_indices, toindices(target_obj))), toobject(target_obj, I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Target Location:** This version directly finds the bottom-right corner coordinates of the '1' objects using `lrcorner(ofcolor(I, 1))`.
2. **Identify Target Object:** Similar to version 2, we identify the object containing the target location.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** Here, instead of recoloring entire objects, we just recolor the indices belonging to the '1' objects except for the target object's indices. Then, we combine the recolored indices with the original target object and paint them onto the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  target_loc = lrcorner(asindices(I))
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if target_loc not in toindices(obj):
      O = paint(O, recolor(8, obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Target Location:**  Find the bottom-right corner of the grid.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:**  Iterate through each object. If an object doesn't contain the target location, recolor it to '8' and paint it onto a copy of the original grid.  This avoids the need for set operations and directly modifies the grid. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation. Each leverages different DSL functions and logic to accomplish the desired outcome, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
