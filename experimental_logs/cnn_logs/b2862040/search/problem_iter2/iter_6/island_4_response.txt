## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the rightmost object composed of '1's and replacing it with a vertical line of '1's extending downwards from the uppermost '1' in that object, while filling the rest of the original object's space with the background color.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The rightmost '8' object is replaced with a vertical '1' line starting from the third row (index 2).
* **Input_1:** The rightmost '8' object is replaced, with the '1' line starting from the second row.
* **Input_2 & Input_3:** Similar transformations occur, highlighting that the position of the '1' line depends on the uppermost '1' in the rightmost object.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" utilizing functions from the provided DSL (`dsl.py`) to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  # Find the rightmost object with color 1
  target_obj = argmax(
      sfilter(objects(grid, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1),
      key=rightmost
  )
  
  # If no object with color 1 exists, return the original grid
  if not target_obj:
    return grid

  # Get the background color
  bg_color = mostcolor(grid)

  # Determine the starting row for the new '1' column
  start_row = uppermost(target_obj)

  # Get the column index of the rightmost cell in the target object
  rightmost_col = rightmost(target_obj)

  # Create the new grid by replacing the object with background color
  new_grid = paint(grid, recolor(bg_color, toindices(target_obj)))

  # Add a new column of '1's starting from start_row
  final_grid = tuple(
      tuple(1 if j == rightmost_col and i >= start_row else v for j, v in enumerate(row))
      for i, row in enumerate(new_grid)
  )
  
  return final_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Object:** Uses `argmax` with `rightmost` key to find the rightmost object of '1's.
2. **Handle Missing Object:** If no '1' object is found, returns the original grid.
3. **Determine Start Row:** Uses `uppermost` to find the starting row for the '1' line.
4. **Replace Object:** Uses `paint` and `recolor` to replace the target object with the background color.
5. **Add '1' Line:** Iterates through the grid and inserts '1's in the correct column and from the determined `start_row`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  # Get all objects in the grid
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, False)

  # Find the rightmost object containing a '1'
  target_obj = argmax(sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1), key=rightmost)

  # If no such object exists, return the original grid
  if not target_obj:
    return grid

  # Get the column index of the rightmost cell in the target object
  rightmost_col = rightmost(target_obj)

  # Create a vertical line object
  line_obj = recolor(
      1, 
      frozenset((i, rightmost_col) for i in range(uppermost(target_obj), height(grid)))
  )

  # Replace the original object and paint the line
  return paint(paint(grid, recolor(mostcolor(grid), toindices(target_obj))), line_obj)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extracts all objects using `objects`.
2. **Find Target:** Similar to Version 1, finds the rightmost object of '1's.
3. **Construct Line:** Creates a vertical line object (`line_obj`) with '1's starting from the uppermost point of the target object.
4. **Replace and Paint:** Uses `paint` twice â€“ first to replace the target object with background color, then to paint the `line_obj`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  # Find the rightmost column containing 1
  rightmost_col = max((j for i in range(height(grid)) for j in range(width(grid)) if grid[i][j] == 1), default=None)

  # If no 1 is found, return the original grid
  if rightmost_col is None:
    return grid

  # Find the first row containing 1 in the rightmost column
  first_row = next((i for i in range(height(grid)) if grid[i][rightmost_col] == 1))

  # Create a mask for the rightmost column
  mask = frozenset((i, rightmost_col) for i in range(height(grid)))

  # Fill the rightmost column with background color
  new_grid = fill(grid, mostcolor(grid), mask)

  # Paint the vertical line starting from the first_row
  return paint(new_grid, recolor(1, frozenset((i, rightmost_col) for i in range(first_row, height(grid)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate Rightmost Column:** Finds the rightmost column index (`rightmost_col`) containing a '1'.
2. **Find Starting Row:** Determines the first row index (`first_row`) containing a '1' in the `rightmost_col`.
3. **Create Mask:** Generates a mask representing the entire `rightmost_col`.
4. **Clear Column:** Uses `fill` with the mask to replace the `rightmost_col` with the background color.
5. **Paint Line:** Paints the vertical line of '1's from `first_row` downwards.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for j in range(width(grid)-1, -1, -1):
    if any(grid[i][j] == 1 for i in range(height(grid))):
      rightmost_col = j
      break
  else:
    return grid

  for i in range(height(grid)):
    if grid[i][rightmost_col] == 1:
      start_row = i
      break
  
  return paint(
      fill(grid, mostcolor(grid), ofcolor(grid, 1)),
      frozenset(((1, (i, rightmost_col)) for i in range(start_row, height(grid))))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Rightmost Column:** Iterates columns right-to-left (`range(width(grid)-1, -1, -1)`) to find the `rightmost_col` with a '1'.
2. **Find Starting Row:** Iterates rows to find the `start_row` where the first '1' appears in `rightmost_col`.
3. **Replace and Paint:** Employs a one-liner combining `paint`, `fill`, and `ofcolor` to replace all '1's with background and paint the vertical line.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  # Transpose the grid for column-wise operations
  transposed = rot90(grid)

  # Find the last column containing a '1'
  target_col_idx = max(
      (j for j in range(width(transposed)) if any(transposed[i][j] == 1 for i in range(height(transposed)))), 
      default=None
  )

  # Return the original grid if no '1' is found
  if target_col_idx is None:
    return grid

  # Find the first '1' in the target column
  target_row_idx = next((i for i in range(height(transposed)) if transposed[i][target_col_idx] == 1))

  # Replace the entire target column with background color
  modified_transposed = tuple(
      tuple(mostcolor(grid) if j == target_col_idx else v for j, v in enumerate(row))
      for row in transposed
  )

  # Add a new column of '1's from the target row onwards
  final_transposed = tuple(
      tuple(1 if j == target_col_idx and i >= target_row_idx else v for j, v in enumerate(row))
      for i, row in enumerate(modified_transposed)
  )

  # Transpose back to original orientation
  return rot270(final_transposed)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transpose:** Uses `rot90` to work with columns as rows.
2. **Find Target Column:** Similar to other versions, identifies the last (originally rightmost) column with a '1'.
3. **Locate First '1':** Finds the row index of the first '1' in the target column.
4. **Replace Column:** Replaces the entire target column with the background color.
5. **Add '1' Column:** Inserts a new column of '1's starting from the located row.
6. **Transpose Back:** Uses `rot270` to return to the original grid orientation.

These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation. They utilize a variety of DSL functions, showcasing the flexibility and problem-solving potential of this custom programming language.
