## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the rightmost object composed of '1's in the grid and replacing it with a vertical line of '1's extending downwards from the rightmost '1' cell of the original object. The rest of the original object is filled with the background color (most common color in the grid).

**Example Breakdown:**

Let's take Input_1 as an example:

```
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
9 8 8 8 8 8 9 9 8 9 9
9 8 9 9 9 8 9 9 8 9 8
9 8 8 8 8 8 9 9 8 8 8
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
9 9 9 8 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
9 9 8 8 8 8 8 9 9 9 9
9 9 9 8 9 8 9 9 9 9 9
9 9 9 8 8 8 9 9 8 8 8
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 8 9 8
8 8 9 9 9 9 9 9 8 8 8 
```

The rightmost object of '1's is located at the bottom right. The transformation replaces this object with a vertical line starting at the rightmost '1' (bottom right corner) and extending downwards. The rest of the original object is filled with '9's (the background color). 

This results in the following output:

```
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
9 8 8 8 8 8 9 9 1 9 9
9 8 9 9 9 8 9 9 1 9 1
9 8 8 8 8 8 9 9 1 1 1
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
9 9 9 8 9 9 9 9 9 9 9
9 9 8 8 8 8 8 9 9 9 9
9 9 9 8 9 8 9 9 9 9 9
9 9 9 8 8 8 9 9 8 8 8
9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 8 9 8
1 1 9 9 9 9 9 9 8 8 8
```

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(grid):
  # Find the rightmost object of 1s
  objs = objects(grid, True, False, False)
  target_obj = argmax(objs, lambda obj: rightmost(obj) if color(obj) == 1 else -1)

  # If no object of 1s exists, return the original grid
  if not target_obj or color(target_obj) != 1:
    return grid

  # Get the rightmost cell's location
  rightmost_cell = (uppermost(target_obj), rightmost(target_obj))

  # Create a vertical line patch from the rightmost cell
  line_patch = frozenset((i, rightmost_cell[1]) for i in range(rightmost_cell[0], len(grid)))

  # Fill the object with background and draw the line
  return paint(fill(grid, mostcolor(grid), toindices(target_obj)), recolor(1, line_patch))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Target Object:** Find all objects using `objects` and then iterate through them to find the rightmost object consisting of '1's.
2. **Locate Rightmost Cell:**  Determine the coordinates of the rightmost cell within the target object.
3. **Generate Line Patch:** Construct a vertical line patch extending downwards from the rightmost cell.
4. **Fill and Draw:** Fill the original object with the background color and then paint the line patch onto the grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(grid):
  # Find the rightmost column containing a '1'
  rightmost_col = max((j for j in range(len(grid[0])) if any(grid[i][j] == 1 for i in range(len(grid)))), default=None)

  # If no '1' is found, return the original grid
  if rightmost_col is None:
    return grid

  # Get background color
  bg_color = mostcolor(grid)

  # Create a new grid, filling the rightmost '1' column with the background color
  new_grid = tuple(
    tuple(bg_color if j == rightmost_col and grid[i][j] == 1 else v for j, v in enumerate(row))
    for i, row in enumerate(grid)
  )

  # Draw a vertical line of '1's at the rightmost column
  final_grid = tuple(
      tuple(1 if j == rightmost_col and i >= 0 else v for j, v in enumerate(row))
      for i, row in enumerate(new_grid)
  )
  return final_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate Rightmost Column:** Iterate through columns to find the rightmost one containing a '1'.
2. **Handle Empty Case:** If no '1' is found, return the original grid.
3. **Create Modified Grid:** Generate a new grid where the identified column is filled with the background color if it originally contained a '1'.
4. **Draw Line:** On the modified grid, draw a vertical line of '1's at the previously identified column. 

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(grid):
  # Find rightmost 1's index
  rightmost_one = max(((i, j) for i in range(len(grid)) for j in range(len(grid[0])) if grid[i][j] == 1), key=lambda x: x[1], default=None)

  # If no 1 exists, return the original grid
  if rightmost_one is None:
    return grid

  # Create a vertical line patch from the rightmost 1
  line_patch = frozenset(((i, rightmost_one[1]) for i in range(rightmost_one[0], len(grid))))

  # Replace rightmost 1 with background and paint the line
  return paint(fill(grid, mostcolor(grid), {rightmost_one}), recolor(1, line_patch))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Rightmost '1':**  Iterate through the grid and locate the rightmost cell containing a '1'.
2. **Handle No '1' Case:** Return the original grid if no '1' is present.
3. **Construct Line Patch:** Create a vertical line patch starting from the rightmost '1' and extending downwards.
4. **Fill and Paint:** Fill the cell containing the rightmost '1' with the background color and paint the line patch onto the grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(grid):
  # Find the rightmost object with color 1
  target_obj = argmax(
      objects(grid, True, False, False),
      lambda obj: rightmost(obj) if color(obj) == 1 else -1
  )

  # If no such object exists, return the original grid
  if target_obj is None or color(target_obj) != 1:
    return grid

  # Get background color and line's column index
  bg_color = mostcolor(grid)
  line_col = rightmost(target_obj)

  # Replace the object with background color
  grid = paint(grid, recolor(bg_color, toindices(target_obj)))

  # Create a vertical line object at the designated column
  for i in range(len(grid)):
    if grid[i][line_col] == bg_color:
      grid = paint(grid, {(1, (i, line_col))})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Rightmost Object:** Locate the rightmost object composed of '1's.
2. **Handle Missing Object:** Return the original grid if the object is not found or doesn't consist of '1's.
3. **Prepare for Transformation:** Extract the background color and the column index of the line.
4. **Replace Object:** Fill the target object with the background color.
5. **Draw Line:** Iterate through the designated column and paint a '1' on every cell that has the background color.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(grid):
  for j in range(len(grid[0]) - 1, -1, -1):  # Iterate columns right to left
    for i in range(len(grid)):
      if grid[i][j] == 1:  # Found a '1'
        # Replace the entire column from this '1' downwards with '1's
        grid = tuple(
          tuple(1 if k == j and l >= i else grid[l][k] for k in range(len(grid[0]))) 
          for l in range(len(grid))
        )
        # Replace any other '1's in the original object with background color
        grid = paint(grid, recolor(mostcolor(grid), toindices(objects(grid, True, False, False)[0])))
        return grid
  return grid 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate from Right:**  Loop through the grid columns from right to left.
2. **Locate First '1':** Find the first occurrence of '1' in each column.
3. **Draw Downward Line:** Upon finding a '1', replace the entire column from that cell downwards with '1's.
4. **Replace Remaining Object:** Identify the object to which the initial '1' belonged and fill its remaining cells with the background color.
5. **Return Modified Grid:** Return the transformed grid. 

Each of these program versions utilizes different DSL function combinations and logic flow to achieve the same visual transformation, demonstrating diverse solutions within the provided DSL.
