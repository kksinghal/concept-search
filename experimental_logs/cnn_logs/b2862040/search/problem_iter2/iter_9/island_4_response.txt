## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the rightmost object formed by the digit '1' and then extending it downwards to the bottom of the grid.  The original shape of the rightmost '1' object is then replaced with the background color.

**Let's break down each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 -> Output_0:** The rightmost '8' object in the 5th row is identified. This object is extended downwards by filling the 6th and 7th rows of the last column with '1'. Finally, the original three '8's forming the object are replaced by the background color '9'.

* **Input_1 -> Output_1:** The rightmost '8' object is found spanning from the 10th to 12th row. This object is extended downwards by filling the 12th row with '1'. Then, the original object, comprising the three '8's, is replaced by the background color '9'.

* **Input_2 -> Output_2:**  The rightmost object, consisting of a single '1' in the 12th row, is extended downwards to the bottom. The original '1' is then replaced with the background color '9'.

* **Input_3 -> Output_3:**  The rightmost object, formed by the four '8's in the 2nd row, is extended downwards. The original object is then replaced with the background color '9'.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  # Find the rightmost object of color 1
  obj = max(colorfilter(objects(grid, True, False, False), 1), key=lambda obj: rightmost(obj))
  # Get the column index of the rightmost object
  col = rightmost(obj)
  # Fill the column from the bottom of the object to the bottom of the grid with 1
  grid = fill(grid, 1, frozenset((i, col) for i in range(lowermost(obj), len(grid))))
  # Replace the original object with the background color
  return paint(grid, recolor(mostcolor(grid), toindices(obj)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the rightmost object:**  `objects(grid, True, False, False)` identifies all connected objects. `colorfilter(..., 1)` keeps only objects made of '1's. `max(..., key=lambda obj: rightmost(obj))` selects the rightmost object. 
2. **Extend downwards:** `lowermost(obj)` finds the lowest row of the object. `fill(grid, 1, ...)` fills the column from that row to the bottom of the grid with '1's.
3. **Replace original object:**  `paint(grid, recolor(mostcolor(grid), toindices(obj)))` replaces the original object with the background color.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  # Iterate through columns from right to left
  for j in range(len(grid[0]) - 1, -1, -1):
    # Check if the column contains a '1'
    if any(grid[i][j] == 1 for i in range(len(grid))):
      # Find the first row index containing a '1' in this column
      first_one_row = next(i for i in range(len(grid)) if grid[i][j] == 1)
      # Fill the column with '1's from the found row onwards
      grid = fill(grid, 1, frozenset((i, j) for i in range(first_one_row, len(grid))))
      # Replace the original '1's with the background color
      return replace(grid, 1, mostcolor(grid))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate columns right to left:** This ensures we find the *rightmost* column with a '1'.
2. **Find first '1' and fill:**  If a column has a '1', we find its row and fill downwards with '1's using `fill`.
3. **Replace originals:** Finally, we replace all original '1's with the background color.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  # Find the rightmost column containing a '1'
  rightmost_col = max((j for j in range(len(grid[0])) if any(grid[i][j] == 1 for i in range(len(grid)))), default=-1)

  # If no '1' is found, return the original grid
  if rightmost_col == -1:
    return grid

  # Create a mask indicating cells below the last '1' in the rightmost column
  mask = frozenset((i, rightmost_col) for i in range(len(grid)) if any(grid[k][rightmost_col] == 1 for k in range(i, len(grid))))

  # Fill the masked cells with '1'
  filled_grid = fill(grid, 1, mask)

  # Replace the original '1's with the background color
  return replace(filled_grid, 1, mostcolor(grid))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find rightmost '1' column:**  Similar to previous versions, we find the target column.
2. **Create a mask:** A set of indices is created, representing cells from each row downwards in the target column, only if a '1' exists in that column from that row onwards.
3. **Fill using the mask:** `fill` uses the mask to precisely place the new '1's.
4. **Replace originals:** Similar to before, original '1's are replaced.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  # Transpose the grid to operate on columns as rows
  transposed_grid = rot90(grid)

  # Apply Program_B logic on the transposed grid
  modified_transposed = febccchabbaaeedejcgfgfbdiffdbedf(transposed_grid)

  # Transpose back to the original orientation
  return rot270(modified_transposed)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transpose:**  We rotate the grid 90 degrees, effectively making columns into rows.
2. **Utilize Program_B:**  Program_B already finds and extends the rightmost object. By applying it to the transposed grid, we effectively extend the object downwards in the original grid.
3. **Transpose back:**  Rotate the grid back to its original orientation.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  # Find the indices of all '1's in the grid
  one_indices = ofcolor(grid, 1)

  # If no '1' is found, return the original grid
  if not one_indices:
    return grid

  # Find the rightmost '1' index
  _, rightmost_j = max(one_indices, key=lambda x: x[1])

  # Create a new grid by modifying columns
  modified_grid = tuple(
      tuple(
          1 if j == rightmost_j and any(grid[k][j] == 1 for k in range(i, len(grid))) else v
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(grid)
  )

  # Replace the original '1's with the background color
  return replace(modified_grid, 1, mostcolor(grid))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find rightmost '1' column:** Similar to other versions.
2. **Conditional cell modification:**  We create a new grid where cells in the target column are changed to '1' only if a '1' exists in that column from that row onwards. 
3. **Replace originals:** Original '1's are replaced with the background color.


##  Note:

These are just five examples, and there could be other equally valid ways to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL. The key is to understand the logic of the transformation and utilize the available functions effectively.
