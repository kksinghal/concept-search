## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) and shifting specific objects to the right. The objects to be moved are determined by their color and their position relative to other objects of the same color. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** The rightmost object of color '8' is shifted one unit to the right, and its color is changed to '1'.

**Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the rightmost '8' object is shifted right and recolored to '1'. However, due to the object's shape, the shift results in the object extending beyond its original column.

**Input_2:** The rightmost '1' object is shifted right and recolored to '8'. Note that only the connected component forming the rightmost part of the object is moved.

**Input_3:**  The rightmost '8' object is shifted right and recolored to '1'. Again, only the connected component at the rightmost position is affected.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions for the "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    if color(obj) == 8 and rightmost(obj) == max([rightmost(o) for o in objects(I, True, False, False) if color(o) == color(obj)]):
      if rightmost(obj) < len(I[0]) - 1:
        O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (0,1)))
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, toindices(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** The program iterates through each object in the input grid (`I`).
2. **Identify Rightmost Object of Specific Color:** It checks if the current object's color is '8' and if it's the rightmost object of that color. 
3. **Shift and Recolor:** If the conditions are met, it shifts the object one unit to the right (if it's not already at the edge) and recolors it to '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  target_color = 8
  for obj in sorted(objects(I, True, False, False), key=lambda obj: -rightmost(obj)):
    if color(obj) == target_color:
      O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, (0,1)))
      O = paint(O, recolor(1, toindices(obj)))
      break 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Sort Objects:** The program first sorts the objects based on their rightmost column index in descending order.
2. **Find First Matching Object:** It iterates through the sorted objects and finds the first object with the target color ('8').
3. **Shift, Recolor, and Exit:** It shifts the found object to the right, recolors it to '1', and then immediately exits the loop, ensuring only the rightmost object of the target color is modified.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    rightmost_8 = max(objects(I, True, False, False), key=lambda obj: (color(obj) == 8, rightmost(obj)))
    if rightmost(rightmost_8) < len(I[0]) - 1:
      O = paint(cover(O, rightmost_8), shift(rightmost_8, (0,1)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, toindices(rightmost_8)))
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Rightmost Object Directly:** This version directly finds the rightmost object of color '8' using the `max` function with a custom key that prioritizes objects with color '8' and then their rightmost position.
2. **Shift and Recolor:**  It then shifts this object (if possible) and recolors it to '1'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  max_rightmost = -1
  target_obj = None
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    if color(obj) == 8 and rightmost(obj) > max_rightmost:
      max_rightmost = rightmost(obj)
      target_obj = obj
  if target_obj is not None:
    if rightmost(target_obj) < len(I[0]) - 1:
      O = paint(cover(O, target_obj), shift(target_obj, (0,1)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, toindices(target_obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterative Search:**  This program iterates through all objects, keeping track of the rightmost '8' object found so far.
2. **Store and Modify:**  It stores the rightmost object and its position. After finding the target object, it shifts and recolors it.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  rightmost_8_indices = max(ofcolor(I, 8), key=lambda loc: loc[1]) 
  rightmost_8 = extract(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: contained(rightmost_8_indices, toindices(obj)))
  shifted_obj = shift(rightmost_8, (0,1)) if rightmost(rightmost_8) < len(I[0]) - 1 else rightmost_8
  return paint(paint(I, recolor(mostcolor(I), toindices(rightmost_8))), recolor(1, toindices(shifted_obj)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Rightmost Index:** This version first finds the rightmost index (location) of the color '8' in the grid.
2. **Extract Object:** It then extracts the object containing this specific index.
3. **Conditional Shift and Recolor:**  The object is conditionally shifted right (if possible). Finally, the original object is erased (recolored to background color) and the shifted object is painted with color '1'.

Each program version provides a different approach to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
