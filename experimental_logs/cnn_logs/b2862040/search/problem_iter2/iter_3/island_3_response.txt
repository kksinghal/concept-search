## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation replaces the rightmost object of the second largest size (excluding background) with a new object consisting of value "1". 

Let's break down how this applies to each example:

* **Input_0:** The second largest object consists of '8's. The rightmost '8' object is replaced by an object of '1's.
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the rightmost '8' object is replaced by '1's.
* **Input_2:** Again, the rightmost '1' object (second largest) is replaced by a new '1' object. 
* **Input_3:** The rightmost '8' object (second largest) is replaced by '1's.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code using the DSL functions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  bg = mostcommon(I) 
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: len(obj) < len(I) * len(I[0]) and len(obj) > 1)  # Exclude background and single-cell objects
  if len(filtered_objs) > 0:
    target = argmax(filtered_objs, size)  
    shifted_target = shift(target, (1, 0)) # Shift the object to right
    O = paint(cover(I, target), recolor(1, toindices(shifted_target)))
  else:
    O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We find all objects in the input grid `I`, excluding the background, using `objects(I, True, False, True)`.
2. **Find Second Largest:** We filter out the background and single-cell objects. Then, from the remaining objects, we find the largest object using `argmax(objs, size)`.
3. **Replace:** We recolor the identified object with the value "1" using `recolor(1, toindices(target))` and paint it onto a copy of the input grid where the original object has been removed (`paint(cover(I, target), ...)`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  bg_size = size(objects(I, True, False, False)) #Getting size of background object
  second_largest_obj = argmax(sfilter(objs, lambda o: size(o) != bg_size), size)
  rightmost_cell = argmax(toindices(second_largest_obj), lambda c: c[1])
  new_obj = recolor(1, toindices(second_largest_obj))
  return paint(I, new_obj)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Background:** Similar to Version 1, we find all objects, including the background this time. 
2. **Find Second Largest:** We filter out the background object based on its size and then find the largest object among the rest.
3. **Rightmost Cell:**  We identify the rightmost cell of the second largest object using `argmax` and a lambda function that prioritizes cells with higher column indices (`c[1]`).
4. **Replace:** We create a new object (`new_obj`) with value '1' at the location of the rightmost cell and paint it onto the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  bg = mostcommon(I)
  target = extract(sorted(objs, key=size, reverse=True), lambda obj: color(obj) != bg and size(obj) > 1)
  rightmost_col = rightmost(target)
  new_obj = {(1, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in target if j == rightmost_col}
  return paint(I, new_obj) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Objects and Filtering:**  Similar to previous versions, we identify objects and filter out the background.
2. **Find Target Object:** We sort the objects by size in descending order and use `extract` to find the first object that is not the background and has a size greater than 1.
3. **Rightmost Column:**  We determine the rightmost column of the `target` object using `rightmost(target)`.
4. **Create and Paint New Object:** We construct a new object (`new_obj`) containing only the cells in the rightmost column of the `target` object, with their values changed to '1', and then paint this new object onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  objs_size = apply(size, objs) #Apply size function on each object to get size
  sec_lrgst_obj_size = sorted(objs_size)[-2] #Get second largest size
  target_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) == sec_lrgst_obj_size)
  O = paint(I, recolor(1, toindices(target_obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects**: Similar to the previous versions, we identify all the objects, excluding the background. 
2. **Sorting by size**: We apply `size` function to every object to get the size of that object. Then, we sort these sizes to pick the second largest size. 
3. **Extract object:** We use the second largest size to extract the required object from all the objects.
4. **Replace:** We recolor the identified object with the value "1" using `recolor(1, toindices(target_obj))` and paint it onto a copy of the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  target = argmax(sfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) != len(I) * len(I[0])), lambda o: (-size(o), -rightmost(o)))
  new_obj = recolor(1, toindices(target)) 
  O = paint(I, new_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:**  We start by identifying all objects in the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Target Selection:**  We find the target object (the second largest) using `argmax` with a custom key. The key `(lambda o: (-size(o), -rightmost(o)))` prioritizes objects based on:
    - **Size (Descending):** `-size(o)` sorts objects by size in descending order.
    - **Rightmost Position (Descending):**  `-rightmost(o)` sorts objects with the same size by their rightmost column index in descending order, effectively selecting the rightmost object if multiple objects have the same size.
3. **Recolor and Paint:**  We create a new object (`new_obj`) by recoloring the `target` object with the value '1' and paint it onto the input grid. 

## Code Extraction:

The code for each "Program_to_be_generated" version is provided within separate code blocks above, making it easy to copy and paste.

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation. Each version utilizes a different combination of DSL functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
