## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying the rightmost object composed of '1's and changing its color. The specific color change depends on the input grid:

* **Input_0, Input_1, Input_2:** The rightmost '1' object becomes entirely '1'.
* **Input_3:** The rightmost '1' object transforms into an '8' object.

Additionally, a new object consisting of '8's is added directly to the left of the modified rightmost object in all examples. The size and shape of this new object mirror the original rightmost '1' object.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  # Find the rightmost object made of '1's.
  rightmost_one_obj = argmax(colorfilter(objects(grid, T, F, T), 1), rightmost)
  
  # Create a new '8' object shifted one position to the left.
  new_eight_obj = recolor(8, shift(toindices(rightmost_one_obj), (-1, 0)))
  
  # Paint the new object onto the grid.
  grid = paint(grid, new_eight_obj)
  
  # Replace the original rightmost '1' object based on the input.
  return branch(
      colorcount(grid, 1) > 1,  # Check if there are other '1's besides the rightmost object
      fill(grid, 1, toindices(rightmost_one_obj)),  # If yes, fill with '1'
      paint(grid, recolor(8, rightmost_one_obj))  # If no, change the object to '8'
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the target:** Locate the rightmost object composed solely of '1's using `colorfilter` and `argmax` with `rightmost` as the key.
2. **Create the new object:** Generate a new object with the same shape and size as the target but with '8's instead, shifted one position left using `recolor` and `shift`.
3. **Paint the new object:** Add the new '8' object to the grid using `paint`.
4. **Modify the target object:** Determine if the target object is the only occurrence of '1's in the grid. If yes, change its color to '8'. If not, keep it as '1'. This is achieved using `branch`, `colorcount`, and `fill`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  # Find all objects and filter for those consisting of '1's.
  one_objs = colorfilter(objects(grid, T, F, T), 1)
  
  # Find the rightmost '1' object.
  rightmost_one_obj = argmax(one_objs, rightmost)
  
  # Generate a list of transformations based on object count.
  transformations = [
      lambda g: fill(g, 1, toindices(rightmost_one_obj)),  # Fill with '1' if multiple '1' objects.
      lambda g: paint(g, recolor(8, rightmost_one_obj))   # Change to '8' if it's the only '1' object.
  ]
  
  # Apply the appropriate transformation based on the number of '1' objects.
  grid = transformations[min(len(one_objs) - 1, 1)](grid)
  
  # Add the new '8' object to the left of the modified object.
  return paint(grid, recolor(8, shift(toindices(rightmost_one_obj), (-1, 0))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Filter for '1' objects:** Isolate all objects made of '1's using `colorfilter`.
2. **Locate the target:** Find the rightmost '1' object using `argmax` and `rightmost`.
3. **Define transformations:** Create a list of functions representing the two possible modifications to the target object: fill with '1' or change to '8'.
4. **Apply transformation:** Select the appropriate transformation function based on the number of '1' objects present in the grid using array indexing and apply it.
5. **Add the '8' object:** Paint the new '8' object to the left of the modified target object using `paint`, `recolor`, and `shift`.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  # Directly modify the grid based on the color of the rightmost object.
  return branch(
      color(argmax(objects(grid, T, F, T), rightmost)) == 1,
      paint(fill(grid, 8, shift(toindices(argmax(colorfilter(objects(grid, T, F, T), 1), rightmost)), (-1, 0))), recolor(1, argmax(colorfilter(objects(grid, T, F, T), 1), rightmost))),
      paint(fill(grid, 8, shift(toindices(argmax(objects(grid, T, F, T), rightmost)), (-1, 0))), recolor(8, argmax(objects(grid, T, F, T), rightmost)))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version condenses the logic into a single `branch` statement. It directly checks the color of the rightmost object. If it's '1', it paints the new '8' object and fills the original with '1'. Otherwise, it paints the new '8' object and changes the original to '8'. This version prioritizes conciseness but might be less readable.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  # Find the rightmost object.
  rightmost_obj = argmax(objects(grid, T, F, T), rightmost)
  
  # Create a function to handle object modification.
  def modify_object(obj):
    return branch(
        color(obj) == 1 and colorcount(grid, 1) > 1,
        fill(grid, 1, toindices(obj)),
        paint(grid, recolor(8, obj))
    )
  
  # Modify the rightmost object and add the new '8' object.
  return paint(modify_object(rightmost_obj), recolor(8, shift(toindices(rightmost_obj), (-1, 0))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate the rightmost object:** Find the rightmost object regardless of its color.
2. **Define object modification function:** Create a function `modify_object` that encapsulates the logic for filling with '1' or changing to '8' based on the object's color and the count of '1's in the grid.
3. **Apply modification and add object:** Apply `modify_object` to the rightmost object and paint the new '8' object to the left using `paint`, `recolor`, and `shift`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  # Identify the rightmost object and its color.
  rightmost_obj = argmax(objects(grid, T, F, T), rightmost)
  target_color = color(rightmost_obj)
  
  # Define a dictionary mapping target color and '1' count to output color.
  color_map = {
      (1, True): 1,  # Target is '1', and there are other '1's.
      (1, False): 8, # Target is '1', and it's the only one.
      (8, _): 8      # Target is not '1', keep it as '8'.
  }
  
  # Determine the output color for the rightmost object.
  output_color = color_map[(target_color, colorcount(grid, 1) > 1)]
  
  # Modify the rightmost object and add the new '8' object.
  return paint(fill(grid, output_color, toindices(rightmost_obj)), recolor(8, shift(toindices(rightmost_obj), (-1, 0))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find target and its color:**  Locate the rightmost object and store its color.
2. **Create a color mapping:** Define a dictionary `color_map` that maps combinations of target color and the presence of other '1's to the desired output color.
3. **Determine output color:** Use the `color_map` to determine the correct output color for the rightmost object.
4. **Modify and add object:**  Fill the rightmost object with the determined `output_color` and paint the new '8' object to the left.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic structures. Each version achieves the same output for the given input-output pairs.
