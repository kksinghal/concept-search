## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the rightmost object made of '1's in each input grid and replacing it with '8's, except for the bottom-most '1' which is replaced with a vertical line of '1's extending downwards to the bottom edge of the grid. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** The rightmost '1' object is already a single '1' at the bottom edge, so the transformation simply changes it to an '8'.

**Input_1:** The rightmost '1' object is a single '1' in the second-to-last row. The transformation changes this '1' to an '8' and fills the cell below it with a '1', effectively extending a vertical line of '1's down to the bottom.

**Input_2:**  The rightmost '1' object is a vertical line of three '1's. The transformation changes the top two '1's to '8's and keeps the bottom '1' unchanged as it already reaches the bottom edge.

**Input_3:** The rightmost '1' object is a group of three '1's forming an 'L' shape. The transformation changes the top two '1's to '8's and extends a vertical line of '1's downwards from the remaining bottom '1'.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" that achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  obj1s = objects(I, True, False, True)
  rightmost_obj = argmax(colorfilter(obj1s, 1), lambda obj: rightmost(obj))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, remove(last(order(rightmost_obj, lambda cell: cell[1][0])), rightmost_obj)))
  bottom_cell = last(order(rightmost_obj, lambda cell: cell[1][0]))[1]
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, frozenset((i, bottom_cell[1]) for i in range(bottom_cell[0], len(I)))))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify rightmost '1' object:**  We use `objects` to get all objects, filter for those with color '1' using `colorfilter`, and find the rightmost one using `argmax` with `rightmost` as the key function.
2. **Replace with '8's except bottom:** We order the cells of the object by row index using `order` and `last` to get the bottom-most cell. Then, we remove this cell from the object using `remove`, recolor the remaining cells to '8' with `recolor`, and paint them onto the grid using `paint`.
3. **Extend vertical line:**  We extract the row and column indices of the bottom-most cell. Using `frozenset` and a list comprehension, we create a vertical line of indices extending downwards from the bottom-most cell. Finally, we recolor these indices to '1' and paint them onto the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for j in range(len(I[0])-1,-1,-1):
    found_one = False
    for i in range(len(I)):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        found_one = True
        I = fill(I, 8, {(i, j)})
        if i < len(I)-1:
          I = fill(I, 1, {(i+1, j)})
        break
    if found_one:
      break
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate from the right:** This version iterates through the columns from right to left (`range(len(I[0])-1,-1,-1)`).
2. **Find and replace '1':** For each column, it iterates through rows to find the first '1'. If found, it replaces it with '8', and if it's not at the bottom row, it fills the cell below with '1'.
3. **Stop after first replacement:**  The `found_one` flag ensures that only the rightmost '1' object is modified.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  rightmost_one = max(ofcolor(I, 1), key=lambda x: x[1])
  O = fill(O, 8, {(rightmost_one[0], rightmost_one[1])})
  if rightmost_one[0] < len(I)-1:
    O = fill(O, 1, {(i, rightmost_one[1]) for i in range(rightmost_one[0]+1, len(I))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find rightmost '1' cell:** This version finds the rightmost '1' cell directly using `ofcolor` and `max` with column index as the key.
2. **Replace and extend:** It replaces the found cell with '8' and, if not at the bottom, fills a vertical line of '1's downwards.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(9, shape(I))
  for j in range(len(I[0])):
    col = tuple(I[i][j] for i in range(len(I)))
    if 1 in col:
      last_one_index = len(col) - 1 - col[::-1].index(1)
      O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j) for i in range(last_one_index, len(I))})
      if last_one_index > 0:
        O = fill(O, 8, {(last_one_index - 1, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create empty canvas:** This version starts with an empty canvas filled with '9's.
2. **Iterate through columns:** It iterates through columns, extracts each column as a tuple, and checks for the presence of '1'.
3. **Fill from last '1':**  If a '1' is found, it determines the row index of the last '1' in the column and fills a vertical line of '1's downwards from that point. If it's not the top cell, the cell above is filled with '8'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    try:
      j = len(row) - 1 - row[::-1].index(1)
      O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j)})
      if i < len(I)-1:
        O = fill(O, 1, {(k, j) for k in range(i+1, len(I))})
      break
    except ValueError:
      continue
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** This version iterates through rows, looking for a '1' in each row.
2. **Handle missing '1':** It uses a try-except block to handle cases where a row doesn't contain a '1' (ValueError).
3. **Replace and extend:** Similar to other versions, it replaces the found '1' with '8' and extends a vertical line of '1's downwards if needed.
