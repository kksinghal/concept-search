## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying objects within the input grid and changing the color of specific objects to '1'. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:** The single '8'-colored object remains unchanged. The rightmost '8' cell of the grid, not belonging to any object, is recolored to '1'. 

**Input_1 - Output_1:** The single '8'-colored object remains unchanged. The rightmost '8' cell of each row, not belonging to any object, is recolored to '1'.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**  The '1'-colored objects remain unchanged. The rightmost cell of each row containing an '8', not belonging to any object, is recolored to '1'.

**Input_3 - Output_3:**  The '8'-colored objects remain unchanged. The rightmost '8' cell of each row, not belonging to any object, is recolored to '1'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, T, F, T)
  rightmost_cells = frozenset((i, len(grid[0]) - 1) for i in range(len(grid)))
  target_cells = rightmost_cells - toindices(merge(objs))
  return fill(grid, 1, target_cells) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objs = objects(grid, T, F, T)` finds all connected objects in the grid.
2. **Rightmost cells:** `rightmost_cells = frozenset((i, len(grid[0]) - 1) for i in range(len(grid)))` creates a set of indices representing the rightmost column of the grid.
3. **Target cells:** `target_cells = rightmost_cells - toindices(merge(objs))` removes the indices belonging to any object from the rightmost cells, leaving only the isolated rightmost cells. 
4. **Fill:** `return fill(grid, 1, target_cells)` fills the identified target cells with the value '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  modified_grid = tuple(tuple(1 if j == len(row) - 1 and row[j] != mostcommon(row) else row[j] for j in range(len(row))) for row in grid)
  return modified_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows and cells:** The code uses nested loops to examine each cell in the grid.
2. **Rightmost cell condition:**  `j == len(row) - 1` checks if the current cell is the rightmost cell of the row. 
3. **Non-object cell condition:** `row[j] != mostcommon(row)` checks if the current cell's value is different from the most common value in its row (representing the object color in that row).
4. **Conditional recoloring:** If both conditions are met, the cell is recolored to '1'; otherwise, the original value is retained.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  return tuple(tuple(branch(both(j == len(row) - 1, contained(row[j], palette(grid) - {mostcommon(row)})), 1, row[j]) for j in range(len(row))) for row in grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and apply function:** The code iterates through rows and cells, applying a function to each cell using nested generator expressions.
2. **Branching logic:** `branch(condition, if_value, else_value)` is used to conditionally recolor cells.
3. **Rightmost cell check:** `j == len(row) - 1` checks for the rightmost cell.
4. **Non-object cell check:** `contained(row[j], palette(grid) - {mostcommon(row)}))` verifies if the cell's value is part of the grid's color palette but not the most common color (object color) in its row.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  return tuple(tuple(1 if (i, j) in difference(asindices(grid), toindices(merge(objects(grid, T, F, T)))) and j == len(grid[0]) - 1 else grid[i][j] for j in range(len(grid[0]))) for i in range(len(grid)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify non-object cells:** `difference(asindices(grid), toindices(merge(objects(grid, T, F, T))))` finds the indices of cells not belonging to any object.
2. **Rightmost cell condition:** `j == len(grid[0]) - 1` checks for the rightmost column.
3. **Conditional recoloring:** If a cell is both a rightmost cell and doesn't belong to an object, it's recolored to '1'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(grid):
  return tuple(tuple(branch(both(j == len(grid[0]) - 1, not contained((i, j), toindices(merge(objects(grid, T, F, T))))), 1, grid[i][j]) for j in range(len(grid[0]))) for i in range(len(grid)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and apply function:** Similar to version 3, the code iterates and applies a function to each cell.
2. **Branching logic:**  Uses `branch` for conditional recoloring.
3. **Rightmost cell check:** `j == len(grid[0]) - 1` targets the rightmost column.
4. **Non-object cell check:**  `not contained((i, j), toindices(merge(objects(grid, T, F, T))))` verifies if the cell's index is not part of any object's indices.
