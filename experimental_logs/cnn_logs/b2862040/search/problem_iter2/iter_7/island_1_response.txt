## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied in each input-output pair appears to be:

**Goal:** Replace the rightmost object on each row with a value of '1'.

**Details:**

- **Object Definition:**  Objects seem defined by connected cells of the same value (excluding the background color '9'). Connectivity seems to be based on directly adjacent cells (not diagonal).
- **Rightmost Determination:** The "rightmost object" is determined based on the column index of the rightmost cell within the object. 
- **Single-Cell Objects:** Single-cell objects are also considered objects and are replaced entirely with '1'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Below are five distinct program versions implementing the transformation logic:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(grid):
  def get_rightmost_cell(obj):
    return (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj))

  def is_background(obj):
    return color(obj) == mostcolor(grid)

  rightmost_objs = [argmax(sfilter(objects(grid, T, F, T), lambda o: not is_background(o)), get_rightmost_cell)]
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, merge(apply(toindices, rightmost_objs))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`get_rightmost_cell`:** Defines a helper function to get the cell index (row, column) of the rightmost cell within an object.
2. **`is_background`:** Defines a helper function to check if an object is the background color.
3. **`rightmost_objs`:**  Finds the rightmost non-background object on each row using `objects`, filters out background objects using `sfilter`, and selects the rightmost object based on `get_rightmost_cell`. 
4. **`paint`:** Paints the grid by recoloring the identified rightmost objects to '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(grid):
  def process_row(row_index):
    objs_in_row = sfilter(objects(grid, T, F, T), lambda obj: any(i == row_index for i, j in toindices(obj)))
    if objs_in_row:
      rightmost_obj = argmax(objs_in_row, rightmost)
      return recolor(1, toindices(rightmost_obj))
    else:
      return frozenset()

  return paint(grid, merge(apply(process_row, range(len(grid))))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`process_row`:** Defines a function to process each row individually. It finds all objects intersecting the current row, selects the rightmost one, and recolors it to '1'.
2. **Main Logic:**  Iterates through each row index using `range(len(grid))`, applies `process_row`, and merges the resulting recolorings using `merge` before painting the grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(grid):
  def rightmost_on_row(obj):
    row = uppermost(obj)
    objs_on_row = sfilter(objects(grid, T, F, T), lambda o: uppermost(o) == row)
    return obj == argmax(objs_on_row, rightmost)

  return paint(grid, recolor(1, merge(apply(lambda obj: branch(rightmost_on_row(obj), toindices(obj), frozenset()), objects(grid, T, F, T)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`rightmost_on_row`:** Determines if the given object is the rightmost object on its row.
2. **Main Logic:** Iterates through all objects using `objects`, applies `rightmost_on_row` to each, recolors only the identified rightmost objects, and paints the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(grid):
  modified_grid = grid
  for i in range(len(grid)):
    objs_in_row = sfilter(objects(grid, T, F, T), lambda obj: any(i == row_index for row_index, col_index in toindices(obj)))
    if objs_in_row:
      rightmost_obj = argmax(objs_in_row, rightmost)
      modified_grid = paint(modified_grid, recolor(1, toindices(rightmost_obj)))
  return modified_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterative Approach:** This version iterates over each row of the grid.
2. **`objs_in_row`:** Identifies objects present on the current row.
3. **`rightmost_obj`:** Finds the rightmost object from `objs_in_row`.
4. **`modified_grid`:**  The grid is progressively modified by recoloring the identified rightmost objects to '1'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(grid):
  def replace_rightmost(obj):
    if any(i == lrcorner(obj)[0] for i, j in toindices(obj)):
      return recolor(1, obj)
    else:
      return obj
  return paint(grid, merge(apply(replace_rightmost, objects(grid, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`replace_rightmost`:** This helper function checks if an object contains its lower-right corner cell. If it does, it's considered the rightmost on its row and is recolored to '1'.
2. **Main Logic:**  Iterates through all objects using `objects`, applies `replace_rightmost` to each, and directly paints the grid with the modified objects.
