## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify the rightmost object consisting entirely of the digit "1".  Once found, this object is replaced with the background color, and a new vertical line of "1"s is drawn starting from the top of the original object's bounding box and extending downwards in the same column as the rightmost "1" of the original object.

**Example Breakdown:**

Let's analyze Input_0 and Output_0:

- **Input_0:** The rightmost object of "1"s is a single cell at the bottom right corner. 
- **Output_0:** The single "1" is replaced by "9" (the background color), and a new column of "1"s is drawn from the 3rd row onwards (where the original "1" was) in the 10th column.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(grid):
  # Find rightmost object of color 1
  target_obj = argmax(objects(grid, True, False, False), key=lambda obj: rightmost(obj) if color(obj)==1 else -1)
  
  # If no object with color 1 exists, return the original grid
  if not target_obj or color(target_obj) != 1:
    return grid

  # Get background color
  bg_color = mostcolor(grid)

  # Get column index of the rightmost cell
  rightmost_col = rightmost(target_obj)

  # Create new grid with object replaced by background color
  new_grid = paint(grid, recolor(bg_color, toindices(target_obj)))

  # Add new column of '1's
  final_grid = tuple(
      tuple(1 if j == rightmost_col and i >= uppermost(target_obj) else v for j, v in enumerate(row))
      for i, row in enumerate(new_grid)
  )
  return final_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Target Object:** Uses `argmax` with a custom `key` to find the rightmost object of color "1". If no such object is found, the original grid is returned.
2. **Replace Object:** The identified object is replaced with the background color using `paint` and `recolor`.
3. **Draw Vertical Line:**  A new column of "1"s is drawn from the top row of the original object downwards using nested loops and conditional replacement.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(grid):
  # Find rightmost '1' cell's location
  rightmost_one = argmax(ofcolor(grid, 1), key=lambda loc: loc[1])

  # If no '1' is found, return the original grid
  if not rightmost_one:
    return grid

  # Extract row and column index
  target_row, target_col = rightmost_one

  # Create vertical line patch
  line_patch = frozenset((i, target_col) for i in range(target_row, len(grid)))

  # Replace rightmost '1' with background and draw line
  return paint(fill(grid, mostcolor(grid), {rightmost_one}), recolor(1, line_patch)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Rightmost "1" Cell:** Utilizes `ofcolor` and `argmax` to directly find the coordinates of the rightmost "1" cell.
2. **Create Line Patch:** Generates a patch representing the vertical line starting from the identified cell.
3. **Replace and Draw:** Replaces the rightmost "1" with the background color using `fill` and draws the vertical line using `paint` and `recolor`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(grid):
    # Get all objects
    objs = objects(grid, True, False, False)

    # Find the target object
    target_obj = argmax(objs, key=lambda obj: (rightmost(obj) if color(obj) == 1 else -1, -len(obj)))
    
    if not target_obj or color(target_obj) != 1:
        return grid

    # Get the line's column index
    line_col = rightmost(target_obj)

    # Generate the vertical line object
    line_obj = recolor(1, frozenset((row, line_col) for row in range(uppermost(target_obj), len(grid))))

    # Combine original grid with the line, overwriting any existing cells
    return paint(grid, line_obj)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Target Object:**  Finds the rightmost object containing '1' by considering both the rightmost position and the object's size.
2. **Generate Line Object:**  Creates a new object representing the vertical line, positioned correctly.
3. **Combine with Original Grid:**  Overwrites the original grid with the new line object, effectively drawing it on top.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(grid):
  for j in range(len(grid[0])-1, -1, -1):
    for i in range(len(grid)):
      if grid[i][j] == 1:
        # Replace the rightmost '1' with background color
        grid = fill(grid, mostcolor(grid), {(i, j)})
        
        # Draw a vertical line of '1's from the current row to the bottom
        grid = paint(grid, recolor(1, frozenset((k, j) for k in range(i, len(grid)))))
        return grid  
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Replace:** Iterates through the grid from right to left, top to bottom. Upon finding a '1', it replaces it with the background color.
2. **Draw Vertical Line:** A vertical line of '1's is drawn from the found '1's position downwards. 
3. **Early Return:** The function returns the modified grid immediately after drawing the line, preventing further modifications.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(grid):
  # Find rightmost object of 1s
  obj = argmax(objects(grid, True, False, False), key=lambda obj: (rightmost(obj) if color(obj) == 1 else -1, -len(obj)))
  
  # If no object of 1s exists, return the original grid
  if not obj or color(obj) != 1:
    return grid

  # Get the bottom-right corner of the object
  bottom_right_corner = lrcorner(obj)

  # Create a vertical line from the bottom-right corner to the bottom of the grid
  line = frozenset((i, bottom_right_corner[1]) for i in range(bottom_right_corner[0], len(grid)))

  # Paint the object with the background color and the line with 1s
  return paint(paint(grid, recolor(mostcolor(grid), obj)), recolor(1, line))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Locate Rightmost Object:**  Identifies the rightmost object formed by '1's.
2. **Determine Line Start:**  Finds the bottom-right corner of the located object to determine the starting point of the vertical line.
3. **Construct Line:**  Creates a set of coordinates representing a vertical line from the identified starting point to the bottom of the grid.
4. **Paint and Return:**  Paints the original object with the background color and then draws the constructed line using '1's.


These are just a few examples of how to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL. Each version utilizes a different combination of functions and logic, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
