## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to all input-output pairs follows this logic:

1. **Identify Inner Objects:**  Find all connected components of the digit '1', excluding the background (digit '9'). Then, identify the objects that do not touch the border of the grid. 
2. **Recolor Inner Objects:** Change the color of all the cells within these inner objects to '8'. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Identify connected components excluding background
  inner_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: not bordering(toindices(obj), I)) # Filter for objects not touching the border
  O = I  # Initialize output as input
  for obj in inner_objs:
    O = fill(O, 8, toindices(obj)) # Replace '1's within inner objects with '8'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** We use `objects(I, True, False, True)` to find connected components of '1's, excluding the background '9'.
2. **Filter for inner objects:** `sfilter` keeps only the objects that satisfy the condition specified by the lambda function, which checks if an object is not bordering the grid using `bordering` and `toindices`.
3. **Iterate and fill:** The code iterates through each `inner_obj`, and for each object, it uses `fill` to change the color of the object's cells (obtained using `toindices`) to '8' in the output grid `O`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  inner_indices = mfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: not bordering(toindices(obj), I)) # Filter and merge indices of inner objects
  return fill(I, 8, inner_indices)  # Replace '1's at inner indices with '8'
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and filter:** This version combines object identification and filtering in one step using `mfilter`. It identifies connected components excluding the background and then filters for those not bordering the grid. 
2. **Fill:**  It directly uses the merged indices from `mfilter` to fill the corresponding cells with '8' in the input grid `I` using `fill`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(1, len(I)-1):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0])-1):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and all(I[i+di][j+dj] != 9 for di in [-1, 0, 1] for dj in [-1, 0, 1]):
        O = fill(O, 8, {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and check:** This version iterates through each cell of the grid, excluding the border cells.
2. **Inner cell condition:**  For each cell, it checks if the cell value is '1' and if all its neighboring cells (including diagonals) are not '9'. This ensures the cell belongs to an inner object.
3. **Fill:** If the condition is met, it fills the current cell with '8' in the output grid `O`.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  inner_objs = [obj for obj in objs if all(0 not in index for index in toindices(obj))]
  return paint(fill(I, 9, asindices(I)), merge(inner_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Similar to previous versions, it identifies connected components of '1's excluding the background using `objects(I, True, False, True)`.
2. **Filter for inner objects:** It filters objects that do not have any cell with index 0, indicating they are not on the border.
3. **Paint:** It first creates a blank canvas filled with '9' using `fill(I, 9, asindices(I))`. Then, it paints all inner objects onto this canvas using `paint` and `merge`.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(9, (h, w))
  for i in range(1, h-1):
    for j in range(1, w-1):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and all(I[k][l] != 9 for k in range(max(0, i-1), min(h, i+2)) for l in range(max(0, j-1), min(w, j+2))):
        O = fill(O, 8, {(i,j)})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create canvas:** It creates a canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background color '9'.
2. **Iterate and Check:** It iterates through each cell, excluding the border cells. For each cell, it checks if it is '1' and if all its neighbors (including diagonals) are not '9'.
3. **Fill:** If the condition is met, it fills the corresponding cell in the canvas with '8'.
