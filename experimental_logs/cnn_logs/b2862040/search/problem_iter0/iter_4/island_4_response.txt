## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces all occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid with the digit '8' in the output grid, while leaving all other digits unchanged. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:** (Inspired by `recolor` and `asobject`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return asobject(frozenset((8, loc) if v == 1 else (v, loc) for v, loc in asobject(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asobject(I)`:** Converts the input grid `I` into an object representation, where each cell is represented as a (value, (row, col)) tuple.
2. **`frozenset(...)`:** Iterates through the object representation and applies the recoloring logic within the set comprehension.
3. **`(8, loc) if v == 1 else (v, loc)`:** For each cell, if the value `v` is 1, it replaces it with 8, otherwise keeps the original value. The location `loc` remains unchanged.
4. **`asobject(...)`:** Converts the recolored object representation back into a grid format.

**Version 2:** (Inspired by `cellwise` and `canvas`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, canvas(8, shape(I)), fallback=I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(8, shape(I))`:** Creates a grid of the same size as the input grid `I`, filled entirely with the digit '8'.
2. **`cellwise(I, ..., fallback=I)`:** Compares each cell of the input grid with the '8' filled grid. 
    - If the values match (both are '8'), the output grid retains the '8'.
    - If the values don't match (input is not '8'), the output grid takes the value from the `fallback` which is the input grid itself, effectively keeping the original digit.

**Version 3:** (Inspired by `replace` and `fgpartition`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, frozenset(recolor(8, obj) for obj in fgpartition(I) if color(obj) == 1))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Partitions the input grid `I` into objects, excluding the background.
2. **`... if color(obj) == 1`:** Filters the objects, keeping only those where the color (value) is '1'.
3. **`frozenset(recolor(8, obj) ...)`:**  Applies the `recolor` function to each filtered object, changing their color to '8'.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the recolored objects back onto the original input grid `I`.

**Version 4:** (Inspired by `objects` and `paint`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, frozenset(recolor(8, obj) for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) == 1))
```

**Explanation:**

- Similar to version 3, but uses `objects` instead of `fgpartition` to extract objects from the input grid. This version explicitly sets `univalued` to `True`, `diagonal` to `False`, and `without_bg` to `True` to match the desired behavior of recoloring only '1's.

**Version 5:** (Inspired by `apply` and nested loops)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  return tuple(tuple(8 if I[i][j] == 1 else I[i][j] for j in range(w)) for i in range(h))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h, w = shape(I)`:** Obtains the height and width of the input grid `I`.
2. **`tuple(tuple(...) for i in range(h))`:**  Uses nested loops to iterate over each cell in the grid.
3. **`8 if I[i][j] == 1 else I[i][j]`:** For each cell, if its value is '1', it replaces it with '8'. Otherwise, it keeps the original value.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation using the provided DSL, highlighting the flexibility and power of this programming approach.
