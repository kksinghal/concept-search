## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves changing the color of inner objects (objects not touching the grid border) from '1' to '8', while keeping the color of border objects as '1'. 

**For all input-output pairs:**

* **Identify border objects:** Objects that have at least one cell touching the edge of the grid remain unchanged.
* **Identify inner objects:** Objects that are fully enclosed within the grid, with no cells touching the edge, are targeted for color change.
* **Recolor inner objects:** The targeted inner objects have their color changed from '1' to '8'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Extract all objects from the input grid, excluding the background
  border_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: bordering(toindices(obj), I)) # Identify objects touching the border
  inner_objs = difference(objs, border_objs) # Get the set difference to find inner objects
  inner_indices = mapply(toindices, inner_objs) # Extract indices of cells belonging to inner objects
  O = fill(I, 8, inner_indices) # Fill the cells of inner objects with color '8'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies connected components (objects) in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Identify border objects:** `sfilter(objs, lambda obj: bordering(toindices(obj), I))` filters the objects, keeping only those touching the grid border.
3. **Identify inner objects:** `difference(objs, border_objs)` finds the objects present in `objs` but not in `border_objs`, thus giving us the inner objects.
4. **Extract inner indices:** `mapply(toindices, inner_objs)` applies the `toindices` function to each inner object, extracting the indices of their constituent cells.
5. **Recolor inner cells:** `fill(I, 8, inner_indices)` fills the cells at the extracted indices with color '8', effectively recoloring the inner objects.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = replace(I, 1, 8) # Replace all occurrences of '1' with '8'
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Extract all objects from the input grid, excluding the background
  border_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: bordering(toindices(obj), I)) # Identify objects touching the border
  for obj in border_objs:
    O = paint(O, recolor(1, toindices(obj))) # Recolor the border objects back to '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initial recolor:** `replace(I, 1, 8)` replaces all instances of '1' in the grid with '8'.
2. **Extract objects and identify border objects:** Similar to Version 1, this step identifies objects and filters for those touching the border.
3. **Recolor border objects:**  The code iterates through `border_objs` and uses `paint` to recolor them back to '1', effectively restoring their original color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0]) # Get grid dimensions
  for i in range(1, h-1): # Iterate over inner rows, excluding the first and last
    for j in range(1, w-1): # Iterate over inner columns, excluding the first and last
      if I[i][j] == 1: # Check if the current cell is '1'
        O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j)}) # If it's '1', fill it with '8'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over inner grid:** This version directly iterates over the inner cells of the grid, excluding the border rows and columns.
2. **Recolor inner '1's:**  For each cell, if it contains '1', it's replaced with '8'. This effectively targets inner objects without explicitly extracting them.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Find all objects excluding background
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        if any((i == 0 or i == len(I) - 1 or j == 0 or j == len(I[0]) - 1) for i, j in toindices(obj)):
            # Check if the object touches the border, if so, skip recoloring
            continue
        else:
            O = paint(O, recolor(8, toindices(obj)))  # Recolor the inner object to '8'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** Similar to previous versions, extract all objects from the input grid.
2. **Iterate and check for border contact:**  Iterate through each object. If any cell of the object has i or j index equal to 0 or the maximum row/column index, it means the object touches the border and is skipped. 
3. **Recolor inner objects:**  If an object doesn't touch the border, it's recolored to '8'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(9, shape(I)) # Create a canvas filled with '9's, matching the input shape
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Extract all objects, excluding the background
    border_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: bordering(toindices(obj), I)) # Identify border objects
    for obj in border_objs:
        O = paint(O, obj) # Paint the border objects from the input onto the canvas
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create blank canvas:**  `canvas(9, shape(I))` creates a new grid filled with '9's, having the same dimensions as the input.
2. **Extract objects and identify border objects:** This step identifies objects and filters for border objects.
3. **Paint border objects:** The code iterates through the `border_objs` and paints them onto the canvas. This leaves the inner objects unpainted, effectively achieving the desired transformation.

These five versions offer different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and versatility of the provided DSL.
