## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying all objects formed by the digit '1' and recoloring them to the digit '8'. All other digits in the grid remain unchanged.

## Code Generation:

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 1):**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Extract connected objects of '1's, excluding background
  target_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1) # Filter for objects with color '1'
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(8, obj), target_objs)))  # Recolor to '8' and paint back onto the grid 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`**:  Extracts all connected components (objects) of the digit '1', treating diagonal connections as separate objects and excluding the background. 
2. **`sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)`**: Filters the extracted objects, keeping only those where the color of the object is '1'.
3. **`apply(lambda obj: recolor(8, obj), target_objs)`**: Applies the `recolor` function to each object in `target_objs`, changing their color from '1' to '8'.
4. **`merge(...)`**: Merges the re-colored objects back into a single set of cells.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`**:  Paints the re-colored objects onto the original input grid `I`.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 2):**

```python
def program(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)  # Get indices of all cells with value '1'
  return fill(I, 8, ones) # Fill those indices with '8'
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`**:  Finds the indices of all cells in the grid `I` that have the value '1'.
2. **`fill(I, 8, ones)`**:  Fills the cells at the indices stored in `ones` with the value '8', effectively replacing all '1's with '8's.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 3):**

```python
def program(I):
  return tuple(tuple(8 if v == 1 else v for v in row) for row in I)  # Iterate and replace
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses list comprehension for a more Pythonic approach. It iterates through each row and cell of the input grid `I`. If the cell value is '1', it's replaced with '8', otherwise, the original value is kept. 

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 4):**

```python
def program(I):
  return paint(cover(I, ofcolor(I, 1)), recolor(8, ofcolor(I, 1)))  # Cover '1's, then paint '8's
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`**:  Identifies the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **`cover(I, ...)`**: Replaces all cells containing '1' with the background color. 
3. **`recolor(8, ofcolor(I, 1))`**: Creates an object representing the '1' cells but with the color '8'.
4. **`paint(..., ...)`**:  Paints the '8'-colored object onto the grid where the '1's were previously located.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 5):**

```python
def program(I):
  f = lambda v, loc: (8, loc) if v == 1 else (v, loc)
  return tuple(tuple(v for v, _ in apply(f, zip(row, repeat(tojvec(j), len(row))))) for j, row in enumerate(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`f = lambda v, loc: (8, loc) if v == 1 else (v, loc)`**: Defines a lambda function `f` that takes a value `v` and location `loc`. If `v` is 1, it returns a tuple with 8 and the location; otherwise, it returns the original value and location.
2. **`repeat(tojvec(j), len(row))`**: For each row, creates a list of locations corresponding to each column in the row.
3. **`zip(row, ...)`**: Combines the values of the row with their corresponding locations.
4. **`apply(f, ...)`**:  Applies the lambda function `f` to each value-location pair, replacing '1's with '8's while preserving locations.
5. **`tuple(tuple(v for v, _ in ...))`**: Reconstructs the grid from the transformed value-location pairs.
