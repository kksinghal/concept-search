## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying and recoloring all but the rightmost occurrence of a specific color (in this case, '1') to another color (here, '8').  

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** All '1's are replaced with '8's, except for the rightmost '1' in the grid, which remains unchanged.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the previous transformation, all '1's become '8's, but the rightmost '1' remains as '1'.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**  Again, all but the rightmost '1' are recolored to '8'. The rightmost '1' retains its original color.

**Input_3 to Output_3:**  Consistently, all '1's are changed to '8's, excluding the rightmost '1', which remains unchanged.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" to achieve the desired transformation, along with explanations for each:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Identify all objects excluding the background
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  # Find the object with the '1' having the maximum column index (rightmost)
  rightmost_obj = argmax(objs, lambda obj: rightmost(toindices(recolor(1, obj)))) 
  # Recolor objects - '1's in other objects to '8', keep rightmost object as is
  recolored_objs = frozenset(
      recolor(8, obj) if obj != rightmost_obj else obj for obj in objs
  )
  # Paint the recolored objects onto the input grid
  O = paint(I, recolored_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `fgpartition(I)` identifies all objects in the grid excluding the background.
2. **Find Rightmost '1' Object:** `argmax` finds the object containing the rightmost '1'. We use `recolor(1, obj)` within `rightmost` to ensure it only considers the rightmost '1' within each object. 
3. **Recolor Objects:**  Iterate through each object. If it's not the `rightmost_obj`, recolor its '1's to '8'. Otherwise, keep the object unchanged.
4. **Paint Objects:** Paint the `recolored_objs` onto the original grid, overwriting the original colors.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find indices of all '1's
  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  # If no '1's, return the original grid
  if not ones_indices:
    return I
  # Find the index of the rightmost '1'
  rightmost_index = argmax(ones_indices, lambda loc: loc[1])
  # Recolor all '1's to '8's
  O = replace(I, 1, 8)
  # Recolor the rightmost '1' back to '1'
  O = fill(O, 1, {rightmost_index})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' Indices:** `ofcolor(I, 1)` gets the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **Handle Empty Case:** If no '1's are found, return the original grid.
3. **Find Rightmost '1' Index:**  `argmax` finds the index of the rightmost '1' based on the maximum column value.
4. **Recolor to '8':** `replace(I, 1, 8)` changes all '1's in the grid to '8's.
5. **Restore Rightmost '1':** `fill(O, 1, {rightmost_index})` changes the color of the cell at `rightmost_index` back to '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Directly modify the grid, iterating row by row from right to left
  O = list(list(row) for row in I)  # Create a mutable copy of the grid
  rightmost_found = False
  for i in range(len(O)):
    for j in range(len(O[0]) - 1, -1, -1):
      if O[i][j] == 1:
        if not rightmost_found:
          rightmost_found = True  # Mark the first (rightmost) '1' as found
        else:
          O[i][j] = 8
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)  # Convert back to immutable tuple
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Mutable Grid:** Make a mutable copy of the input grid.
2. **Iterate Reverse:** Loop through rows and then columns from right to left.
3. **Track Rightmost:** Use a flag (`rightmost_found`) to track if the rightmost '1' has been encountered.
4. **Recolor:** If a '1' is found and it's not the rightmost, recolor it to '8'.
5. **Return Immutable Grid:** Convert the modified grid back to an immutable tuple.

**Program Version 4:** 
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Transpose the grid to process columns as rows
  transposed_grid = rot90(I) 
  # Find the rightmost column containing '1'
  rightmost_col_index = max((j for j in range(len(transposed_grid[0])) 
                         if any(transposed_grid[i][j] == 1 for i in range(len(transposed_grid)))))
  # Replace all '1's with '8's except in the rightmost column containing '1'
  modified_transposed_grid = tuple(
      tuple(8 if cell == 1 and j != rightmost_col_index else cell for j, cell in enumerate(row))
      for row in transposed_grid
  )
  # Rotate back to the original orientation
  O = rot270(modified_transposed_grid) 
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Transpose:** Rotate the grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise to treat columns as rows.
2. **Find Rightmost '1' Column:** Iterate through the transposed grid's columns, identifying the rightmost column containing a '1'.
3. **Recolor:** Replace '1's with '8's in all columns except the identified rightmost '1' column.
4. **Rotate Back:** Rotate the modified grid 90 degrees clockwise to restore its original orientation.

**Program Version 5:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the rightmost index of '1' in the flattened grid
  flattened_grid = [cell for row in I for cell in row]
  try:
    rightmost_index_flat = len(flattened_grid) - flattened_grid[::-1].index(1) - 1
  except ValueError: # Handle cases where '1' is not present in the grid
    return I
  # Calculate row and column index from the flattened index
  rightmost_row = rightmost_index_flat // len(I[0])
  rightmost_col = rightmost_index_flat % len(I[0])
  # Replace '1's with '8's except for the one at the calculated rightmost index
  O = tuple(
    tuple(8 if cell == 1 and (i, j) != (rightmost_row, rightmost_col) else cell for j, cell in enumerate(row))
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Flatten the Grid:** Create a 1D list representation of the 2D grid.
2. **Find Rightmost '1' Index (Flattened):** Utilize Python's list slicing and `index` method to find the index of the rightmost '1' in the flattened grid. If no '1' is found, return the original grid.
3. **Calculate 2D Index:**  Convert the flattened index back to row and column indices.
4. **Recolor:** Replace all '1's with '8's, except for the cell at the calculated rightmost index.
