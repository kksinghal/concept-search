## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions) of a specific color within the input grid and recoloring them to the value '8'.  Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** The object formed by the digit '1' is recolored to '8'.
**Input_1 -> Output_1:**  The object formed by the digit '1' is recolored to '8'.
**Input_2 -> Output_2:**  The object formed by the digit '1' is recolored to '8'.
**Input_3 -> Output_3:**  The object formed by the digit '1' is recolored to '8'.

Essentially, the transformation consistently targets and recolors objects formed by the digit '1' to '8', while leaving other elements untouched.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") to achieve this transformation using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, True, True) # Identify all objects in the grid
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1) # Filter for objects with color '1'
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(8, obj), target_objs) # Recolor the filtered objects to '8'
  O = paint(I, merge(recolored_objs)) # Paint the recolored objects onto the original grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, True, True)`:** Identifies all connected regions (objects) within the grid.
2. **`colorfilter(objs, 1)`:** Filters the identified objects, keeping only those with the color value '1'.
3. **`apply(lambda obj: recolor(8, obj), target_objs)`:** Applies the `recolor` function to each object in `target_objs`, changing their color to '8'.
4. **`paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))`:**  Merges the recolored objects and paints them onto the original grid `I`, resulting in the final output.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices = ofcolor(I, 1) # Get indices of all cells with value '1'
  O = fill(I, 8, indices) # Fill those indices with value '8'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`:**  Directly identifies the indices of all grid cells containing the value '1'.
2. **`fill(I, 8, indices)`:**  Fills the grid cells at the identified indices with the value '8', effectively recoloring the target object.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = replace(I, 1, 8) # Replace all occurrences of '1' with '8'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`replace(I, 1, 8)`:** This approach directly utilizes the `replace` function to substitute all instances of the value '1' with '8' within the input grid `I`. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = extract(objects(I, True, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1) # Extract the object with color '1'
  O = paint(I, recolor(8, obj)) # Recolor the extracted object to '8' and paint it back onto the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, True, True)`:**  Identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **`extract(..., lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)`:**  Extracts the specific object from the identified objects that has the color '1'.
3. **`recolor(8, obj)`:**  Recolors the extracted object to have the color '8'.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the recolored object onto the original input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  condition = lambda x: x == 1 # Define a condition to check if a cell value is '1'
  O = apply(lambda row: tuple(8 if condition(v) else v for v in row), I) # Apply the recoloring logic row-wise
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`condition = lambda x: x == 1`:** Defines a lambda function to check if a given value is equal to '1'.
2. **`apply(lambda row: ..., I)`:** Iterates through each row of the input grid `I`.
3. **`tuple(8 if condition(v) else v for v in row)`:**  For each cell value `v` in a row, if the `condition` is met (value is '1'), it's replaced with '8'; otherwise, the original value is kept. The result is converted into a tuple to maintain the grid structure.
