## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring all the cells of an object to '8' except the cell with the largest Euclidean distance from the origin (0,0) among all the cells of that object.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

- **Input 0:** The object formed by '1's is re-colored to '8's except for the bottom-right '1' which is farthest from the origin.
- **Input 1:**  Similar to Input 0, the object of '1's changes, but the logic remains the same â€“ only the bottom-right '1' remains unchanged.
- **Input 2:** Again, the transformation affects only the object of '1's, recoloring all but the bottom-rightmost cell to '8'.
- **Input 3:** The pattern persists. The most distant '1' from the origin (bottom-right) within its object is preserved while others are changed to '8'.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  for obj in objs:
    furthest_cell = argmax(toindices(obj), lambda cell: cell[0]**2 + cell[1]**2)  
    O = paint(fill(I, 8, obj), {(color(obj), furthest_cell)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` extracts objects from the input grid, treating only '1's as a single object.
2. **Iterate & Find Furthest:** For each object, `argmax(toindices(obj), lambda cell: cell[0]**2 + cell[1]**2)` finds the cell with the maximum squared Euclidean distance from the origin (using `cell[0]**2 + cell[1]**2` as a proxy for distance). 
3. **Recolor & Paint:**  The object is filled with '8' using `fill(I, 8, obj)` and then the furthest cell is painted back to its original color using `paint(..., {(color(obj), furthest_cell)})`.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True).pop() # Assuming only one object of interest
  furthest_index = argmax(obj, lambda c: ijaaadffbafeehecbcbecchcjajjicec({c})) 
  O = paint(fill(I, 8, obj), {furthest_index})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Object:**  Similar to Version 1, it extracts objects. However, it assumes only one object of interest and directly accesses it using `.pop()`.
2. **Find Furthest Cell:**  Utilizes the `ijaaadffbafeehecbcbecchcjajjicec` function to compute Euclidean distances for each cell within the object and selects the cell with the maximum distance using `argmax`.
3. **Recolor and Paint:**  Mirrors Version 1 in recoloring the entire object and then painting back the furthest cell. 


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  if size(indices) == 1: # Handle the single cell case
    return I
  furthest_cell = argmax(toindices(indices), lambda cell: cell[0]**2 + cell[1]**2)
  O = paint(fill(I, 8, indices), {(1, furthest_cell)})  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Indices of '1':** Directly finds the indices of all '1's using `ofcolor(I, 1)`.
2. **Handle Single Cell:** Checks if there's only one cell of '1'. If so, returns the original grid.
3. **Find Furthest:**  Similar to Version 1, finds the cell with the maximum squared Euclidean distance from the origin within the identified indices.
4. **Recolor & Paint:**  Identical logic to Version 1, recoloring all '1's to '8's and then painting back the furthest cell.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True).pop()
  corner_indices = (ulcorner(obj), urcorner(obj), llcorner(obj), lrcorner(obj)) 
  furthest_corner = argmax(corner_indices, lambda c: c[0]**2 + c[1]**2) 
  shifted_obj = shift(obj, subtract(furthest_corner, lrcorner(obj))) # Align furthest corner with bottom-right
  O = paint(I, recolor(8, difference(obj, {shifted_obj})))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Object:** Extracts the object of '1's, assuming only one exists.
2. **Find Furthest Corner:** Calculates the Euclidean distances of all corners of the object and selects the furthest one.
3. **Shift Object:** Shifts the object so that its furthest corner aligns with its bottom-right corner.
4. **Recolor & Paint:** Recolors all cells of the original object except the shifted furthest cell (which is now at the bottom-right) to '8'.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = asobject(I)  # Treat the whole grid as an object
  target_cell = argmax(obj, lambda c: ijaaadffbafeehecbcbecchcjajjicec({c})) 
  O = paint(fill(I, 8, obj), {target_cell}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Treat Grid as Object:** Considers the entire input grid as a single object using `asobject(I)`.
2. **Find Furthest Cell:**  Finds the cell with the maximum Euclidean distance from the origin within the entire grid.
3. **Recolor & Paint:** Fills the grid with '8' and then paints back the furthest cell to its original color.
