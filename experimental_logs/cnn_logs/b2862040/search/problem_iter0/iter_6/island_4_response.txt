## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation logic applied to the input grids to achieve the desired output is consistent across all examples:

**Objective:** Recolor all objects in the grid to '8' except for the rightmost object consisting of '1's, which retains its original color. 

Let's break down this logic through the lens of the input-output pairs:

* **Input 0:** All '1' objects are recolored to '8' except for the single '1' object positioned furthest to the right.
* **Input 1:** Similar to Input 0, only the rightmost '1' object remains untouched while all other '1' objects are recolored.
* **Input 2 & 3:** These inputs reinforce the pattern observed in the previous examples, demonstrating the transformation's consistency across different grid configurations.


## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL, each achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find all objects in the grid, excluding the background.
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  # Find the rightmost object.
  rightmost_obj = argmax(objs, lambda obj: rightmost(toindices(obj)))
  # Recolor objects based on whether they are the rightmost object.
  recolored_objs = frozenset({recolor(8, obj) if obj != rightmost_obj else obj for obj in objs})
  # Paint the recolored objects onto the input grid.
  O = paint(I, recolored_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `fgpartition(I)` identifies all distinct objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Find the rightmost object:**  `argmax(objs, lambda obj: rightmost(toindices(obj)))` iterates through each object, determining its rightmost column index (`rightmost(toindices(obj))`) and selecting the object with the highest index (furthest to the right).
3. **Recolor objects:** A set comprehension recolors all objects to '8' except for the rightmost object, which retains its original color.
4. **Paint objects:** `paint(I, recolored_objs)` paints the recolored objects onto a copy of the input grid, generating the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the rightmost '1' index
  target_index = argmax(ofcolor(I, 1), lambda loc: loc[1]) 
  # Recolor all '1's to '8's except the one at the target index
  O = asobject(frozenset(
      (8 if (v == 1 and (i, j) != target_index) else v, (i, j)) 
      for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(row)
  ))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the rightmost '1':** `argmax(ofcolor(I, 1), lambda loc: loc[1])` finds the index of the rightmost '1' by considering the maximum column index (`loc[1]`) among all '1' indices.
2. **Conditional Recoloring:** Iterates through each cell in the grid and recolors it to '8' if it's a '1' and not located at the `target_index`. Otherwise, the cell retains its original value. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Split the grid vertically into individual columns
  parts = vsplit(I, width(I))
  # Find the index of the column containing the rightmost '1'
  target_part_index = argmax(parts, lambda part: rightmost(ofcolor(part, 1)))
  # Recolor all '1's to '8's in columns except the target column
  recolored_parts = tuple(
      replace(part, 1, 8) if i != target_part_index else part 
      for i, part in enumerate(parts)
  )
  # Concatenate the columns back together horizontally 
  O = hconcat(*recolored_parts)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Split into columns:** Divides the grid into individual columns using `vsplit(I, width(I))`.
2. **Locate the target column:**  Identifies the index of the column containing the rightmost '1' using `argmax` and `rightmost`.
3. **Recolor columns:** Recolors '1's to '8's in all columns except the target column identified in the previous step.
4. **Recombine columns:**  Merges the modified columns back into a single grid using `hconcat`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find all objects in the grid.
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  # Sort objects based on the rightmost column index.
  sorted_objs = order(objs, lambda obj: rightmost(toindices(obj)))
  # Recolor all objects except the last one (rightmost) to '8'.
  recolored_objs = tuple(recolor(8, obj) for obj in sorted_objs[:-1]) + (sorted_objs[-1],)
  # Paint the recolored objects onto the input grid.
  O = paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `fgpartition(I)` extracts all objects in the grid.
2. **Sort by rightmost index:**  Orders the objects based on their rightmost column index (`rightmost(toindices(obj))`) using the `order` function.
3. **Selective recoloring:**  Recolors all objects in the sorted list to '8' except for the last object (the rightmost one), which preserves its original color.
4. **Combine objects:** Merges the modified objects back onto the grid to generate the output.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Find the indices of all '1's in the grid.
    ones_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
    # If there are no '1's, return the original grid.
    if not ones_indices:
        return I
    # Find the index of the rightmost '1'.
    rightmost_index = argmax(ones_indices, lambda loc: loc[1])
    # Create a new grid by iterating through each cell.
    O = asobject(frozenset(
        # If the cell is a '1' and not the rightmost '1', recolor it to '8'.
        (8 if (v == 1 and (i, j) != rightmost_index) else v, (i, j))
        for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(row)
    ))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1's:** Identifies the indices of all cells containing '1' using `ofcolor(I, 1)`.
2. **Handle empty case:** If no '1's are found, the original grid is returned.
3. **Find the rightmost '1':** Determines the index of the rightmost '1' based on the maximum column index.
4. **Cell-wise recoloring:** Iterates through the grid, recoloring cells to '8' only if they contain '1' and are not the rightmost '1'.


These five versions demonstrate diverse ways to achieve the desired transformation using various DSL functions and logic. Each version offers a unique approach to solving the problem, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL.
