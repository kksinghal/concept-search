## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied in this task can be summarized as follows: 

**Recolor all '1's in the input grid to '8's, except for the rightmost '1' in the grid, which should remain unchanged.**

Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:

* **Input_0:** The rightmost '1' is located at (5,9). All other '1's are recolored to '8'.
* **Input_1:** The rightmost '1' is located at (11,9). All other '1's are recolored to '8'.
* **Input_2:**  The rightmost '1' is located at (11,8). All other '1's are recolored to '8'.
* **Input_3:** The rightmost '1' is located at (13,12). All other '1's are recolored to '8'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find all indices of '1's
  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  # If there are no '1's, return the original grid.
  if not ones_indices:
    return I
  # Find the rightmost '1' index
  rightmost_index = argmax(ones_indices, lambda loc: loc[1]) 
  # Recolor all '1's to '8's except the one at the target index
  O = replace(I, 1, 8)
  O = fill(O, 1, {rightmost_index}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)`:** Identifies the indices of all cells containing the value '1'.
2. **`if not ones_indices: return I`:** Handles the edge case where no '1's are present, returning the input grid directly.
3. **`rightmost_index = argmax(ones_indices, lambda loc: loc[1])`:**  Finds the index of the rightmost '1' by maximizing the column index (`loc[1]`) among the indices of '1's.
4. **`O = replace(I, 1, 8)`:** Recolors all occurrences of '1' to '8'.
5. **`O = fill(O, 1, {rightmost_index})`:**  Recolors the cell at the `rightmost_index` back to '1'.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the column index of the rightmost '1'
  rightmost_col =  maximum(apply(lambda loc: loc[1], ofcolor(I, 1)))
  # Construct a new grid based on the input
  O = tuple(
      tuple(
          8 if (v == 1 and j != rightmost_col) else v
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      ) for row in I
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`rightmost_col = maximum(apply(lambda loc: loc[1], ofcolor(I, 1)))`:** 
    - `ofcolor(I, 1)`: Gets the indices of all '1's.
    - `apply(lambda loc: loc[1], ...)`: Extracts the column index (`loc[1]`) from each index.
    - `maximum(...)`:  Finds the maximum column index, representing the rightmost column containing a '1'.
2. **Nested tuple comprehensions:** 
   - Iterates through each row and each value within the row of the input grid.
   - `8 if (v == 1 and j != rightmost_col) else v`: If the current value is '1' and it's not in the `rightmost_col`, recolor to '8'; otherwise, keep the original value.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Identify all objects excluding the background
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  # Find the object containing the rightmost cell
  rightmost_obj = argmax(objs, lambda obj: rightmost(toindices(obj)))
  # Recolor objects based on being the rightmost object or not
  recolored_objs = frozenset(
      recolor(8, obj) if obj != rightmost_obj else obj for obj in objs
  )
  # Paint the recolored objects onto the input grid
  O = paint(I, recolored_objs)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:**  Partitions the input grid into objects, excluding the background.
2. **`rightmost_obj = argmax(objs, lambda obj: rightmost(toindices(obj)))`:**
    - `toindices(obj)`: Gets the indices of cells belonging to each object.
    - `rightmost(...)`: Finds the rightmost column index for each object.
    - `argmax(...)`:  Determines the object with the maximum rightmost column index, meaning it contains the rightmost cell.
3. **`recolored_objs = ...`:** Creates a new set of objects where:
    - If an object is not the `rightmost_obj`, it gets recolored to '8' using `recolor(8, obj)`.
    - The `rightmost_obj` remains unchanged.
4. **`O = paint(I, recolored_objs)`:** Paints the recolored objects back onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Find all '1's in the grid
    ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
    # If there's no '1', return the original grid
    if not ones:
        return I
    # Find the rightmost '1's index
    rightmost_one = argmax(ones, lambda loc: loc[1])
    # Create a lambda function to recolor cells
    recolor_cell = lambda loc: 8 if (loc != rightmost_one and I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 1) else I[loc[0]][loc[1]]
    # Apply the recolor_cell function to each cell in the grid
    O = tuple(
        tuple(recolor_cell((i, j)) for j in range(width(I)))
        for i in range(height(I))
    )
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = ofcolor(I, 1)`:**  Finds the indices of all cells with the value '1'.
2. **`if not ones: return I`:**  Handles the case where no '1's are present, returning the input grid.
3. **`rightmost_one = argmax(ones, lambda loc: loc[1])`:** Finds the index of the rightmost '1'.
4. **`recolor_cell = lambda loc: ...`:** Defines a lambda function to recolor cells based on these conditions:
    - If the cell is not the `rightmost_one` and its value is '1', recolor it to '8'.
    - Otherwise, keep the original cell value.
5. **Nested tuple comprehensions:** Iterates over each cell of the grid and applies the `recolor_cell` function to determine its new value.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Create a function to check if a cell should be recolored
    should_recolor = lambda i, j: I[i][j] == 1 and j < maximum(apply(lambda loc: loc[1], ofcolor(I, 1)))
    # Generate the output grid
    O = tuple(
        tuple(
            8 if should_recolor(i, j) else I[i][j] 
            for j in range(width(I))
        ) 
        for i in range(height(I))
    )
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`should_recolor = lambda i, j: ...`:** Defines a function to check if a cell at index (i, j) should be recolored based on these criteria:
    - The cell's value is '1'.
    - The cell's column index (j) is less than the column index of the rightmost '1' in the grid.
2. **Nested tuple comprehensions:** Iterates through the input grid and applies the `should_recolor` function. If it returns `True`, the cell is recolored to '8'; otherwise, its value remains unchanged.
