## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying objects formed by connected cells of the same color (excluding the background color, which is usually 9).  The core logic is to recolor these objects based on their size, replacing their original color with a value determined by `8 - object_size`.

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
- The object formed by the digit '1' is the only non-background object. 
- It has a size of 12 cells.
- The output recolors this object to the digit '8 - 12 = -4', which wraps around to '8'.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
-  Multiple objects of '1' exist with varying sizes.
-  Each object is recolored based on its size using the '8 - object_size' rule.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
- Similar to the previous examples, objects of '1' are recolored based on their size.

**Input_3 -> Output_3:**
- This example reinforces the pattern. Objects of '1' are identified and recolored using the consistent '8 - object_size' logic.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(8 - size(obj), obj), objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid `I`, considering objects with the same color only (T), not diagonally connected (F), and excluding the background (T).
2. **`apply(lambda obj: recolor(8 - size(obj), obj), ...)`:** Applies a function to each extracted object. This function recolors the object using `recolor(8 - size(obj), obj)`. It calculates the new color by subtracting the object's size from 8 and applies this color to the object. 
3. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the recolored objects back into a single object.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged object onto the original input grid `I`, resulting in the final output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I,  merge(apply(lambda obj: branch(size(obj) > 8, recolor(8, obj), recolor(8 - size(obj), obj)), objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version introduces a conditional recoloring using `branch`. 
- If an object's size is greater than 8, it defaults to color 8. 
- Otherwise, it follows the standard '8 - object_size' logic.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    recolored_objs = set()
    for obj in objs:
        new_color = 8 - size(obj)
        recolored_objs.add(recolor(new_color, obj))
    return paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version explicitly iterates through the extracted objects using a `for` loop.
- It calculates the new color for each object and adds the recolored object to a new set.
- Finally, it merges and paints the recolored objects onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: branch(obj == mostcommon(objects(I, T, F, T)), recolor(9, obj), recolor(8 - size(obj), obj)), objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

- This version adds a condition to check if the current object is the most common object in the grid. 
- If it is, it recolors it to '9' (likely the background color), otherwise, it follows the '8 - object_size' rule. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_object(obj):
    return recolor(8 - size(obj), obj)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(recolor_object, objects(I, T, F, T)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

- This version defines a separate function `recolor_object` to encapsulate the recoloring logic. 
- This improves code readability and modularity. 

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to implement the target transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL.
