## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation replaces the color of specific objects within the grid. Here's a breakdown:

- **Target Objects:** Objects that are not touching the border of the grid.
- **Color Change:**  All '1's within the target objects are replaced with '8's.
- **Other Colors:** All other colors and their positions remain unchanged.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) 
  inner_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: not bordering(toindices(obj), I))
  inner_obj_cells = mfilter(inner_objs, lambda obj: sfilter(obj, lambda cell: cell[0] == 1)) 
  O = paint(I, inner_obj_cells)  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` finds all connected components in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Filter Inner Objects:** `sfilter(objs, lambda obj: not bordering(toindices(obj), I))` keeps only objects that don't touch the grid border.
3. **Filter Cells with '1':** `mfilter(inner_objs, lambda obj: sfilter(obj, lambda cell: cell[0] == 1))` iterates over the inner objects and keeps only the cells with color '1'.
4. **Paint the Grid:** `paint(I, inner_obj_cells)` paints the filtered cells onto the original grid, effectively replacing the '1's with the original color of those cells.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  inner_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(intersection(toindices(obj), outbox(toindices(obj)))) == 0)
  inner_obj_indices = mapply(toindices, inner_objs)
  O = fill(I, 8, intersection(inner_obj_indices, ofcolor(I, 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Filter Inner Objects:** `sfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(intersection(toindices(obj), outbox(toindices(obj)))) == 0)` identifies inner objects by checking if their indices intersect with their outbox. If the intersection is empty, the object is not touching the border.
3. **Get Inner Object Indices:** `mapply(toindices, inner_objs)` extracts indices from inner objects.
4. **Fill with '8':** `fill(I, 8, intersection(inner_obj_indices, ofcolor(I, 1)))` fills '8' at the indices that belong to both inner objects and have the color '1' in the original grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
  not_border = lambda loc: all(0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0]) for i, j in neighbors(loc))
  inner_one_indices = sfilter(ofcolor(I, 1), not_border) 
  O = fill(I, 8, inner_one_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `not_border` Function:**  Checks if all neighbors of a location are within the grid bounds.
2. **Filter Inner '1' Indices:** `sfilter(ofcolor(I, 1), not_border)` filters the indices of color '1' to keep only those whose all neighbors are within the grid (meaning they are not on the border).
3. **Fill with '8':** `fill(I, 8, inner_one_indices)` fills '8' at the filtered inner '1' indices.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
  border_cells = box(asindices(I))
  inner_cells = difference(asindices(I), border_cells)
  inner_one_cells = intersection(inner_cells, ofcolor(I, 1))
  O = fill(I, 8, inner_one_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Border Cells:** `box(asindices(I))` identifies the indices of cells forming the border of the grid.
2. **Get Inner Cells:**  `difference(asindices(I), border_cells)` finds the indices of all cells except the border cells.
3. **Find Inner '1' Cells:** `intersection(inner_cells, ofcolor(I, 1))` gets the indices of cells that are both inner cells and have color '1'.
4. **Fill with '8':** `fill(I, 8, inner_one_cells)` fills '8' at the filtered indices. 

**Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
    O = I  
    for i in range(1, len(I) - 1):
        for j in range(1, len(I[0]) - 1):
            if I[i][j] == 1:
                O = paint(O, {(8, (i, j))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** `O = I` initializes the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. **Iterate Through Inner Cells:** The nested loop iterates through all inner cells of the grid, excluding the border.
3. **Replace '1' with '8':** If a cell's value is '1', it's replaced with '8' in the output grid using `paint(O, {(8, (i, j))})`.
