## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces the digit '1' with the digit '8' in all input grids. 

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** Every occurrence of '1' is replaced by '8' in the output.

**Input_1:** Same as Input_0, all '1' digits become '8'.

**Input_2:** Consistent with the previous patterns, '1' transforms to '8'.

**Input_3:**  Again, the transformation simply changes all instances of '1' to '8'.

## Code Generation:

Considering the straightforward nature of the transformation, the code will be relatively simple. We can achieve this using the `replace` function from the DSL. 

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = replace(I, 1, 8)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly applies the `replace` function to the input grid `I`, replacing all occurrences of the value `1` with the value `8`, and storing the result in the output grid `O`.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = leastcolor(I)  # This will always be 1
  O = replace(I, x1, 8)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version first identifies the smallest color value in the input grid `I` using the `leastcolor` function and stores it in `x1`. Since the input grids consistently contain '1' as the smallest digit, `x1` will always be 1. Then, it utilizes the `replace` function to substitute all instances of `x1` (which is 1) with '8' in the input grid, producing the output grid `O`.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = palette(I) 
  x2 = extract(x1, lambda x: x == 1) 
  O = replace(I, x2, 8)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version first extracts all unique color values present in the input grid `I` using the `palette` function and stores them in `x1`.  It then employs the `extract` function to find the value '1' within the set of colors `x1` and assigns it to `x2`. Finally, it uses the `replace` function to replace all occurrences of  `x2` (which is 1) in the input grid with '8', generating the output grid `O`. 

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  f = lambda x: 8 if x == 1 else x
  O = tuple(tuple(f(v) for v in row) for row in I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a lambda function `f` that takes a single argument `x`. If `x` equals 1, it returns 8; otherwise, it returns the original value of `x`. It then iterates through each row and cell of the input grid `I`, applying the lambda function `f` to transform the cell values. The result is stored in the output grid `O`.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I 
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

This version iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`. If the cell value equals 1, it utilizes the `fill` function to replace that specific cell with the value 8 in the output grid `O`. If the cell value is not 1, it remains unchanged. This process continues until all cells in the input grid have been examined and modified accordingly.
