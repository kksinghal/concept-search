## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently applies the following logic:

- **Identify target objects:** Locate all objects formed by the digit '1' within the grid. An object is defined as a connected group of cells with the same value, considering either 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) or 8-connectivity (including diagonals) based on the input-output pairs.
- **Recolor specific objects:**  Recolor the target object that is furthest away from the origin (0,0) to the value '8'. Distance is calculated diagonally, meaning objects in the bottom-right corner are considered furthest.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program implementing the identified transformation:

**Version 1:** (Using `argmax` for furthest object selection)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  target_obj = argmax(objs, lambda obj: lrcorner(obj)[0]+lrcorner(obj)[1]) # Select furthest object based on bottom-right corner sum
  O = paint(I, recolor(8, target_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`:** Identifies all '1' objects using 4-connectivity and excluding background.
2. **`target_obj = argmax(objs, lambda obj: lrcorner(obj)[0]+lrcorner(obj)[1])`:** Selects the object with the largest sum of its lower-right corner indices, effectively finding the furthest object diagonally.
3. **`O = paint(I, recolor(8, target_obj))`:** Recolors the target object to '8' on a copy of the input grid.

**Version 2:** (Iterative object selection and distance comparison)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  max_dist = -1
  target_obj = None
  for obj in objs:
    dist = lrcorner(obj)[0] + lrcorner(obj)[1]
    if dist > max_dist:
      max_dist = dist
      target_obj = obj
  O = paint(I, recolor(8, target_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Iterative selection:** Iterates through each object, calculates its diagonal distance from the origin, and updates `target_obj` if a further object is found.
3. **`O = paint(I, recolor(8, target_obj))`:**  Same as Version 1.

**Version 3:** (Sorting objects by distance)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  sorted_objs = sorted(objs, key=lambda obj: lrcorner(obj)[0]+lrcorner(obj)[1]) # Sort by bottom-right corner sum
  O = paint(I, recolor(8, sorted_objs[-1])) # Select the last (furthest) object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`:** Same as Version 1.
2. **`sorted_objs = sorted(objs, key=lambda obj: lrcorner(obj)[0]+lrcorner(obj)[1])`:** Sorts the objects based on their diagonal distance from the origin.
3. **`O = paint(I, recolor(8, sorted_objs[-1]))`:** Selects the last object in the sorted list (the furthest) and recolors it.

**Version 4:** (Filtering objects based on maximum distance)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  max_dist = max(lrcorner(obj)[0]+lrcorner(obj)[1] for obj in objs) # Find maximum distance
  target_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: lrcorner(obj)[0]+lrcorner(obj)[1] == max_dist) # Extract object with max distance
  O = paint(I, recolor(8, target_obj)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`:** Same as Version 1.
2. **`max_dist = max(lrcorner(obj)[0]+lrcorner(obj)[1] for obj in objs)`:** Calculates the maximum diagonal distance of any object.
3. **`target_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: lrcorner(obj)[0]+lrcorner(obj)[1] == max_dist)`:** Finds the object with the calculated maximum distance.
4. **`O = paint(I, recolor(8, target_obj))`:** Same as Version 1.


**Version 5:** (Using a custom distance function)

```python
def diagonal_distance(obj):
  i, j = lrcorner(obj)
  return (i**2 + j**2)**0.5 # Calculate Euclidean distance for more accurate diagonal measurement

def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  target_obj = argmax(objs, diagonal_distance) # Select furthest object using custom distance function
  O = paint(I, recolor(8, target_obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`diagonal_distance(obj)`:** Defines a custom function to calculate the Euclidean distance of an object's bottom-right corner from the origin, providing a more accurate measure of diagonal distance.
2. **`objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`:** Same as Version 1.
3. **`target_obj = argmax(objs, diagonal_distance)`:** Selects the furthest object using the custom `diagonal_distance` function.
4. **`O = paint(I, recolor(8, target_obj))`:** Same as Version 1.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to selecting the furthest '1' object and recoloring it to '8', showcasing the flexibility and diversity of solutions possible within the DSL.
