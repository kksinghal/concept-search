## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves replacing all occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid with the digit '8', except for the digit '1's that are directly connected to the edge of the grid. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** All inner '1's are replaced by '8'. The single '1' connected to the right edge remains unchanged.

**Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0, inner '1's become '8'. The '1's connected to the bottom edge are preserved.

**Input_2:**  Again, only inner '1's are changed to '8', while those on the edges remain.

**Input_3:**  This example reinforces the pattern, with all edge-connected '1's remaining unchanged.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code in the provided DSL, along with explanations:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Find connected components, excluding background
    inner_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: not bordering(toindices(obj), I)) # Filter for objects not touching the border
    inner_indices = mapply(toindices, inner_objs) # Get indices of all inner objects
    O = fill(I, 8, inner_indices) # Replace '1's within inner objects with '8'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We use `objects` to find all connected components (objects) within the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Filter Inner Objects:** `sfilter` is used with `bordering` to keep only objects that don't touch the grid border.
3. **Extract Inner Indices:**  `mapply` with `toindices` extracts the indices of all cells belonging to the inner objects.
4. **Replace with '8':** Finally, `fill` replaces the '1's at the extracted inner indices with '8'.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    border =  frozenset((i, j) for i in range(h) for j in range(w) if i == 0 or i == h - 1 or j == 0 or j == w - 1) # Define the border indices
    inner_indices = asindices(I) - border # Find indices not on the border
    O = fill(replace(I, 1, 8), 1, inner_indices) # Replace all '1's with '8', then restore '1's on the inner indices 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Border:** We explicitly calculate and store the indices of the grid's border.
2. **Find Inner Indices:**  `asindices` gives all grid indices, and we subtract the `border` to get the inner indices.
3. **Replace and Restore:**  We first replace all '1's with '8' using `replace`. Then, using the precomputed `inner_indices`, we restore the original '1's using another `fill`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = replace(I, 1, 8) # Replace all '1's with '8'
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if (i == 0 or i == h - 1 or j == 0 or j == w - 1) and I[i][j] == 1: # Check for '1's on the border in the original input
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)}) # Restore '1's on the border 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Replace All:** We first replace all occurrences of '1' with '8' using `replace`.
2. **Iterate and Restore:** We then iterate through each cell of the grid. If a cell is on the border and originally contained a '1', we use `fill` to restore it back from '8' to '1'.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, False) # Find all connected components, including background
    border_obj = argmax(objs, size) # Find the largest object, which represents the background and border
    inner_objs = difference(objs, {border_obj}) # Exclude the border object
    inner_indices = mapply(toindices, inner_objs) # Get indices of all inner objects
    O = fill(I, 8, inner_indices) # Replace '1's within inner objects with '8'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find All Objects:** `objects` finds all connected components, this time including the background.
2. **Identify Border Object:**  We assume the largest object is the background, which includes the border. We find it using `argmax` with `size`.
3. **Isolate Inner Objects:**  `difference` is used to remove the `border_obj`, leaving only inner objects.
4. **Replace in Inner Objects:** Similar to version 1, we extract inner indices and replace '1's with '8' using `fill`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  for i in range(1, h - 1): # Iterate through inner rows
    for j in range(1, w - 1): # Iterate through inner columns
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j)}) # Replace '1' with '8' if it's in the inner region
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Inner Region:** This version directly iterates through the inner region of the grid, excluding the border rows and columns.
2. **Replace Inner '1's:**  For each cell in the inner region, if it contains a '1', we replace it with '8' using `fill`.

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to solve the given transformation task using the provided DSL. Each version uses a different combination of functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
