## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces a specific color in the input grid with color 8, while leaving all other colors untouched. 

* **Input 0, 1, 2, 3:** The color 1 in the input grids is replaced by color 8 in the output grids.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return replace(I, 1, 8)
```

**Explanation:** This version leverages the `replace` function for a direct substitution of color 1 with color 8 in the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = partition(I)
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1)
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(8, obj), target_objs)
  return paint(I, merge(recolored_objs))
```

**Explanation:** This version first identifies all objects in the grid using `partition`. Then, it filters for objects with color 1 using `colorfilter`. These objects are then recolored to 8 using `recolor` and finally painted onto the original grid using `paint`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  return fill(I, 8, indices)
```

**Explanation:** This version directly finds the indices of color 1 using `ofcolor` and then fills those indices with color 8 using `fill`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(8 if v == 1 else v for v in row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:** This version uses a nested list comprehension to iterate through each cell in the grid and replace cells with value 1 with value 8.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_cell(v, loc):
    return (8, loc) if v == 1 else (v, loc)
  return asobject(tuple(tuple(v for v, _ in row) for row in apply(lambda row: papply(recolor_cell, row, interval(0, len(row), 1)), I)))
```

**Explanation:**  This version defines a helper function `recolor_cell` that handles the color replacement at the cell level. It then utilizes `papply` to apply this function to each cell in each row and reconstructs the grid using `asobject`. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
