## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently applies the following logic across all input-output pairs:

1. **Identify Connected Components:** It identifies groups of connected '1's within the input grid, excluding the background (which is represented by '9'). Two '1's are considered connected if they are directly adjacent (not diagonally). 

2. **Target Inner Components:** It specifically targets those connected components of '1's that do not touch the border of the grid.

3. **Color Transformation:**  The targeted connected components (inner '1's) are replaced with the digit '8', while all other digits retain their original values. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def transform(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Identify connected components excluding background
  inner_cells = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: not bordering(toindices(obj), I)) # Filter for objects not touching the border
  O = fill(I, 8, mapply(toindices, inner_cells))  # Replace '1's within inner objects with '8'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Identifies connected components of '1's, excluding the background. 
2. **`mfilter(objs, lambda obj: not bordering(toindices(obj), I))`:** Filters for objects that don't touch the border. 
3. **`mapply(toindices, inner_cells)`:** Extracts the indices of all cells belonging to the filtered inner objects.
4. **`fill(I, 8, ...)`:**  Fills the grid 'I' with the value '8' at the indices identified in the previous step.

**Version 2:**

```python
def transform(I):
  inner_objs = sfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: not bordering(toindices(obj), I))
  O = I
  for obj in inner_objs:
    O = fill(O, 8, toindices(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`sfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: not bordering(toindices(obj), I))`:**  Combines object identification and border filtering into a single step.
2. **`O = I`:**  Initializes the output grid 'O' as a copy of the input grid 'I'.
3. **`for obj in inner_objs:`:** Iterates through each inner object.
4. **`O = fill(O, 8, toindices(obj))`:**  Fills the output grid 'O' with '8' at the indices of each inner object.

**Version 3:**

```python
def transform(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(1, len(I)-1):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0])-1):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and all(I[i+di][j+dj] != 9 for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]):
        O = fill(O, 8, {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initializes output 'O' as a copy of input 'I'.
2. **`for i in range(1, len(I)-1):` and `for j in range(1, len(I[0])-1):`**: Iterates through inner cells of the grid, excluding the border.
3. **`if I[i][j] == 1 ...`**: Checks if the cell value is '1'.
4. **`and all(I[i+di][j+dj] != 9 ...)`**: Checks if all directly adjacent cells are not background ('9').
5. **`O = fill(O, 8, {(i,j)})`**: If both conditions are met, fill the cell at (i, j) in 'O' with '8'.

**Version 4:**

```python
def transform(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objs:
        if not bordering(toindices(obj), I):
            O = paint(O, recolor(8, obj))
        else:
            O = paint(O, obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Identifies connected components excluding background.
2. **`O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates a canvas of the same shape as input 'I', filled with the background color.
3. **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterates through each object.
4. **`if not bordering(toindices(obj), I):`**:  Checks if the object touches the border.
5. **`O = paint(O, recolor(8, obj))`:** Paints the object onto the canvas with color '8' if it's an inner object.
6. **`else: O = paint(O, obj)`:** Paints the object onto the canvas with its original color if it touches the border. 

**Version 5:**

```python
def transform(I):
  inner_indices = mfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: not bordering(toindices(obj), I) and size(obj) > 1) # Combine filtering for bordering and size within mfilter
  return fill(I, 8, mapply(toindices, inner_indices)) # Apply toindices after filtering and before filling
```

**Explanation:**

This version optimizes Version 1 by combining the filtering for bordering and size within the `mfilter` function for improved code conciseness.

These five versions demonstrate diverse ways to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL functions. Each version offers a different approach in terms of code structure, function usage, and logic flow, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
