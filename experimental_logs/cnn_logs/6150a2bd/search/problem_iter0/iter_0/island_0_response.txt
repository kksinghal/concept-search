## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking the input grids to the output grids can be described as follows:

1. **Rotation:** The grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
2. **Horizontal Mirroring:** The rotated grid is then mirrored along the vertical axis. 

Let's illustrate this with an example using Input_0:

```
Input_0:          Rotate 90 degrees:       Horizontal Mirroring:
3 3 8              5 3 3                     0 0 5
3 7 0           ->  0 7 3                ->   0 7 3
5 0 0              0 3 8                     8 3 3
```

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated"  using the DSL functions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = hmirror(rot90(I))
  return O
```
**Explanation:** 
1. `rot90(I)`:  This rotates the input grid (`I`) by 90 degrees clockwise.
2. `hmirror(...)`: This function takes the rotated grid and mirrors it horizontally.
3. `return O`: The final transformed grid (`O`) is returned. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = rot270(hmirror(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. `hmirror(I)`: This first mirrors the input grid (`I`) horizontally.
2. `rot270(...)`: Then rotates the mirrored grid by 270 degrees clockwise (equivalent to 90 degrees anticlockwise), achieving the same final rotation as in Version 1. 
3. `return O`: The final transformed grid (`O`) is returned. 

**Program Version 3:** 

```python
def solve(I):
  O = vmirror(dmirror(I))
  return O
```
**Explanation:** 
This version utilizes a combination of diagonal and vertical mirroring to achieve the rotation and mirroring:
1.  `dmirror(I)`: First, the input grid (`I`) is mirrored along the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right).
2.  `vmirror(...)`: The diagonally mirrored grid is then mirrored vertically, resulting in the desired transformation.
3. `return O`: The final transformed grid (`O`) is returned.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = cmirror(dmirror(I))
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
Similar to Version 3, this version also uses a combination of diagonal mirroring, but this time with counter-diagonal mirroring:
1. `dmirror(I)`: The input grid (`I`) is first mirrored along the main diagonal.
2. `cmirror(...)`:  This mirrored grid is then mirrored along the counter-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left), achieving the target transformation.
3. `return O`: The final transformed grid (`O`) is returned.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = rot90(I)
  O = tuple(zip(*r[::-1]) for r in O[::-1])  # Manual horizontal mirroring
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `rot90(I)`: This rotates the input grid (`I`) by 90 degrees clockwise.
2.  `O = tuple(zip(*r[::-1]) for r in O[::-1])`: This line performs the horizontal mirroring manually using Python's built-in functions within the DSL:
    - `r[::-1]` reverses each row (`r`) of the rotated grid.
    - `zip(*...)` transposes the grid (swaps rows and columns).
    -  The outer `tuple(...)` converts the result back to the required tuple format. 
3. `return O`: The final transformed grid (`O`) is returned. 

All five program versions achieve the same transformation but utilize different combinations of DSL functions, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
