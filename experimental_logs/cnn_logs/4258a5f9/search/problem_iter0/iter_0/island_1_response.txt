## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (clusters of the same digit different from the background) and enclosing them in a bounding box of the digit '1', with a few key modifications:

* **Color Preservation:** The original digit within the bounding box is preserved.
* **Single Cell Expansion:** The bounding box expands to include single cells directly adjacent to the object, even if they are background color. 

**Example Breakdown (Input_0 to Output_0):**

1. The input has objects formed by the digit '5' on a background of '0'.
2. Each '5' object is enclosed in a box of '1's.
3. Single '0' cells directly touching a '5' are also incorporated into the '1' box (See cells above, below, and to the right of the '5's).

**Example Breakdown (Input_1 to Output_1):**

1.  Similar to Input_0, '5' objects are identified on a '0' background.
2.  Bounding boxes of '1's are drawn, again incorporating single adjacent '0' cells.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_0962bcdd(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify all objects
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: obj | mfilter(lambda loc: size(intersection(dneighbors(loc), toindices(obj))) > 0, delta(obj)), objs) # Expand each object to include single adjacent cells
  boxes = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(1, backdrop(obj)), expanded_objs) # Draw bounding boxes around expanded objects
  O = paint(I, merge(boxes))  # Paint boxes onto the original grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, T)` finds all connected objects in the grid.
2. **Expand Objects:** For each object, we find single-cell gaps in its 'delta' (surrounding area) that are adjacent to the object and merge them into the object.
3. **Draw Boxes:** `backdrop` gets the bounding box indices, and `recolor` sets those to '1'.
4. **Paint Boxes:** The boxes are combined and painted onto the original grid, preserving existing digits.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_0962bcdd(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: combine(obj, shift(obj, DOWN), shift(obj, RIGHT), shift(obj, UP), shift(obj, LEFT)), objs)  # Expand by shifting in all directions
  boxes = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(1, backdrop(intersection(asindices(I), obj))), shifted_objs)  # Intersect with grid indices to handle out-of-bounds shifts
  O = paint(I, merge(boxes))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Shift and Expand:** Instead of analyzing adjacency, we shift each object in all four directions, expanding it. 
3. **Handle Out-of-Bounds:** The shifted objects might have indices outside the grid. We intersect with `asindices(I)` to keep only valid ones.
4. **Draw Boxes and Paint:** Similar to Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_0962bcdd(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expanded_indices = mfilter(lambda ind: any(d in toindices(obj) for obj in objs for d in dneighbors(ind)), asindices(I))  # Find indices adjacent to any object
  boxes = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(1, backdrop(obj)), objs)
  O = fill(paint(I, merge(boxes)), 1, expanded_indices)  # Fill adjacent indices with '1'
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Find Adjacent Indices:** We directly identify grid indices that are neighbors of any object cell.
3. **Draw Boxes:** Similar to previous versions.
4. **Fill Adjacent Cells:** Instead of merging with objects, we directly fill the adjacent indices with '1' after painting the boxes.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_0962bcdd(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  filled_grid = fill(I, 1, mfilter(lambda ind: any(index(I, d) != bg for d in dneighbors(ind)), asindices(I)))  # Fill cells with '1' if they have a non-background neighbor
  objs = objects(filled_grid, T, F, T) 
  boxes = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(1, backdrop(obj)), objs)
  O = cellwise(paint(I, merge(boxes)), filled_grid, bg)  # Combine boxes with initially filled grid, preserving original digits
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background:** Find the most frequent color, which is the background.
2. **Pre-Fill Adjacent Cells:** Fill any cell with '1' if it has a non-background neighbor.
3. **Identify Objects (on modified grid):** Find objects on the pre-filled grid.
4. **Draw Boxes:**  Similar to previous versions.
5. **Combine and Preserve:** Combine the box grid with the pre-filled grid using `cellwise`, ensuring original object digits are kept.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_0962bcdd(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj:  toobject(backdrop(obj), I), objs) # Create objects from the bounding box of original objects
  filtered_objs = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(lambda cell: cell[0] != mostcolor(I) or any(n in toindices(obj) for n in dneighbors(cell[1])), obj), expanded_objs)  # Filter out background cells not adjacent to non-background cells
  O = paint(I, merge(filtered_objs))  # Paint the filtered objects back onto the original grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Expand to Bounding Boxes:**  Create new objects that represent the bounding boxes of the original objects.
3. **Filter Background Cells:** Remove background-colored cells from the expanded objects unless they are adjacent to a non-background cell within the bounding box.
4. **Paint Filtered Objects:** Paint the filtered, expanded objects onto the original grid.

These are five distinct approaches to solve the transformation, utilizing different combinations and logic within the given DSL. Each version achieves the same result but through varying methods.
