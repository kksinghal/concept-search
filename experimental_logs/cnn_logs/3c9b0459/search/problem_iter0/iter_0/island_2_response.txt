## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to involve identifying objects within the input grid and then rotating those objects 180 degrees.  Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

```
2 2 1
2 1 2
2 8 1
```

**Output_0:**

```
1 8 2
2 1 2
1 2 2
```

* The object composed of '2's is rotated 180 degrees.

**Input_1:**

```
9 2 4
2 4 4
2 9 2
```

**Output_1:**

```
2 9 2
4 4 2
4 2 9
```

* The objects composed of '9's, '4's, and the single '2' in the center are rotated 180 degrees.

**Input_2:**

```
8 8 8
5 5 8
8 5 5
```

**Output_2:**

```
5 5 8
8 5 5
8 8 8 
```

* The object composed of '5's is rotated 180 degrees.

**Input_3:**

```
3 2 9
9 9 9
2 3 3
```

**Output_3:**

```
3 3 2
9 9 9
9 2 3
```

* The objects composed of '3's and the single '2' are rotated 180 degrees.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program utilizing different DSL functions and logic:

**Program Version 1:** (Using `objects`, `rot180`, `paint`, `cover`)

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(cover(O, obj), toobject(rot180(toindices(obj)), I)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, True, False, False)`:** Identifies all connected objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid.
3. **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterates through each detected object.
4. **`O = paint(cover(O, obj), toobject(rot180(toindices(obj)), I))`:** 
    * `cover(O, obj)`:  Removes the current object from the output grid `O`.
    * `rot180(toindices(obj))`: Rotates the indices of the object by 180 degrees.
    * `toobject(..., I)`:  Reconstructs the object with rotated indices using color values from the input grid `I`.
    * `paint(..., ...)`: Paints the rotated object back onto the output grid `O`.
5. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed output grid.

**Program Version 2:** (Using `partition`, `rot180`, `asobject`, `paint`)

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = partition(I)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, asobject(rot180(subgrid(obj, I)))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = partition(I)`:** Partitions the grid into objects based on color value.
2. **`O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates an empty canvas `O` of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
3. **`for obj in objs:`:**  Iterates through each object.
4. **`O = paint(O, asobject(rot180(subgrid(obj, I))))`:**
    * `subgrid(obj, I)`: Extracts the smallest subgrid containing the object.
    * `rot180(...)`: Rotates the extracted subgrid by 180 degrees.
    * `asobject(...)`: Converts the rotated subgrid back into an object.
    * `paint(O, ...)`:  Paints the rotated object onto the output canvas `O`.
5. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed output grid.

**Program Version 3:** (Using list comprehension and index manipulation)

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  return tuple(
      tuple(I[h - 1 - i][w - 1 - j] for j in range(w)) 
      for i in range(h)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly accesses and rearranges the elements of the input grid using index manipulation to achieve the 180-degree rotation.

**Program Version 4:** (Using `hmirror` and `vmirror`)

```python
def solve(I):
  return hmirror(vmirror(I)) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the fact that rotating a grid 180 degrees is equivalent to mirroring it horizontally and then vertically.

**Program Version 5:** (Using `rot180` directly on the grid)

```python
def solve(I):
  return rot180(I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly applies the `rot180` function to the input grid to achieve the desired transformation.

These five versions showcase distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and power of the DSL. Each version leverages different functions and logic, offering diverse solutions for the given problem.
