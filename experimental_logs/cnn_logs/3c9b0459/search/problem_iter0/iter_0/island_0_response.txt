## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place in all examples is a **diagonal mirroring** of the input grid. It's like flipping the grid along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.

**Example:**

Input_0:
```
2 2 1
2 1 2
2 8 1
```

Output_0:
```
1 8 2
2 1 2
1 2 2 
```

Here, the top-right corner '1' in the input becomes the top-left corner in the output, and so on for all other elements.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = dmirror(I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version directly utilizes the `dmirror` function from the DSL, which performs the diagonal mirroring operation on the input grid (`I`) and returns the mirrored grid (`O`).

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = rot90(hmirror(rot270(I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version achieves diagonal mirroring through a series of rotations and a horizontal mirroring:
1. `rot270(I)`: Rotates the input grid counter-clockwise by 270 degrees.
2. `hmirror(...)`: Mirrors the rotated grid horizontally.
3. `rot90(...)`: Rotates the mirrored grid clockwise by 90 degrees. 
The combined effect of these operations is equivalent to a diagonal mirroring.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h = len(I)
  w = len(I[0])
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      O = fill(O, I[j][i], ((i, j),))
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version manually constructs the mirrored grid:
1. `canvas(0, (h, w))`: Creates a new grid (`O`) with the same dimensions as the input, filled with zeros.
2. The nested loop iterates over each cell of the input grid.
3. `fill(O, I[j][i], ((i, j),))`:  Fills the cell at (i, j) in the output grid with the value from cell (j, i) in the input grid, effectively swapping row and column indices to achieve diagonal mirroring.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = cmirror(hmirror(I))
    return O
```

**Explanation:** This version utilizes a combination of horizontal mirroring (`hmirror`) and counter-diagonal mirroring (`cmirror`) to achieve the desired diagonal mirroring. 

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = rot180(dmirror(rot180(I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**  This version uses a combination of 180-degree rotations (`rot180`) and diagonal mirroring (`dmirror`):
1. `rot180(I)`: Rotates the input grid by 180 degrees.
2. `dmirror(...)`: Mirrors the rotated grid diagonally.
3. `rot180(...)`: Rotates the mirrored grid again by 180 degrees.
This combination results in the final diagonally mirrored output.

These are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using different combinations of DSL functions from the provided 'dsl.py' file to achieve the diagonal mirroring transformation. Each version offers a unique approach to solving the problem.
