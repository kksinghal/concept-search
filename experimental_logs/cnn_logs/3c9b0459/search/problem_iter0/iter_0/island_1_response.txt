## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be rotating the input grid by 90 degrees counterclockwise. 

Let's break down each input-output pair:

* **Input_0 -> Output_0:**
    * The top row (2 2 1) becomes the rightmost column (1 2 2) reversed.
    * The middle row (2 1 2) becomes the middle column (8 1 2) reversed.
    * The bottom row (2 8 1) becomes the leftmost column (1 8 2) reversed.
* **Input_1 -> Output_1:**
    *  Follows the same pattern of rotating 90 degrees counterclockwise and reversing each row to form the corresponding column in the output. 
* **Input_2 -> Output_2:**
    * Follows the same pattern.
* **Input_3 -> Output_3:**
    * Follows the same pattern.


## Program to be Generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  """
  Rotates the input grid 90 degrees counterclockwise.
  """
  O = rot270(I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version directly uses the `rot270` function from the DSL to rotate the input grid (`I`) counterclockwise by 270 degrees, effectively achieving a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation. The rotated grid is then returned as output (`O`).


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  """
  Rotates the input grid 90 degrees counterclockwise.
  """
  O = rot90(hmirror(vmirror(I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version utilizes a combination of mirroring and rotation:
    *  `vmirror(I)`: First, the input grid is mirrored vertically.
    *  `hmirror(...)`: Then, the vertically mirrored grid is mirrored horizontally.
    * `rot90(...)`: Finally, the resulting grid (which is effectively rotated 180 degrees) is rotated clockwise by 90 degrees, achieving the desired 90-degree counterclockwise rotation. 


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  """
  Rotates the input grid 90 degrees counterclockwise.
  """
  O = dmirror(rot180(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version combines diagonal mirroring and rotation:
    * `rot180(I)`: First rotates the input grid by 180 degrees.
    * `dmirror(...)`: Then, the rotated grid is mirrored along the main diagonal, achieving the desired 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  """
  Rotates the input grid 90 degrees counterclockwise.
  """
  O = cmirror(rot180(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version uses counter-diagonal mirroring and rotation:
    * `rot180(I)`: First, it rotates the input grid by 180 degrees.
    * `cmirror(...)`: Then, it mirrors the grid along the counter-diagonal to achieve the 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  """
  Rotates the input grid 90 degrees counterclockwise using transposition.
  """
  transposed = tuple(zip(*I))
  O = tuple(tuple(row[::-1]) for row in transposed)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version manually implements the rotation by transposing the grid and then reversing each row:
   * `transposed = tuple(zip(*I))`: This transposes the input grid - rows become columns and vice-versa.
   * `O = tuple(tuple(row[::-1]) for row in transposed)`: This iterates through each row of the transposed grid and reverses it, achieving the final rotated output.
