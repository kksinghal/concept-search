## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves hollowing out the objects in the grid, leaving only a one-cell-thick border.

**Input_0:**  The objects formed by digits 8, 3, 6, and 7 are hollowed out.

**Input_1:** The object formed by digit 2 is hollowed out.

**Input_2:** The objects formed by digits 5 and 4 are hollowed out.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  hollowed_objs = frozenset({frozenset({(v, loc) for v, loc in obj if loc in box(obj)}) for obj in objs})
  O = paint(fill(I, ZERO, asindices(I)), merge(hollowed_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all distinct objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Create Hollow Objects:** For each object, a new object is created that only contains the cells that form the border (`box(obj)`) of the original object.
3. **Clear the Grid:** `fill(I, ZERO, asindices(I))` creates a grid filled with zeros, effectively clearing the original content.
4. **Paint Hollow Objects:** The hollowed objects are then painted onto the cleared grid using `paint`.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = underfill(O, ZERO, toindices(obj) - box(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Objects:**  Iterate through each object in the grid.
2. **Fill Interior with Zeros:** For each object, identify the indices that are *inside* the object but not part of the border (`toindices(obj) - box(obj)`) and fill them with zeros using `underfill`.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for x in range(len(I)):
    for y in range(len(I[0])):
      if index(I, (x,y)) != ZERO and len(dneighbors((x, y)) & ofcolor(I, index(I, (x, y)))) == 4:
        O = fill(O, ZERO, {(x, y)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Cells:** Iterate through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check for Interior Cells:** If a cell is not zero and all its direct neighbors have the same color, it is considered an interior cell.
3. **Fill Interior Cells:** Fill identified interior cells with zeros.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  hollowed_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    border = box(obj)
    hollowed_obj = frozenset()
    for cell in obj:
      if cell[1] in border:
        hollowed_obj = insert(cell, hollowed_obj)
    hollowed_objs = insert(hollowed_obj, hollowed_objs)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(hollowed_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify all objects in the input grid.
2. **Construct Hollow Objects:** For each object:
    - Identify the border cells.
    - Create a new object containing only the border cells.
3. **Create Empty Canvas:** Generate an empty canvas of the same size as the input grid, filled with zeros.
4. **Paint Onto Canvas:** Paint the hollowed objects onto the empty canvas.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  hollowed = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    for x, y in box(obj):
      if 0 <= x < len(I) and 0 <= y < len(I[0]):
        hollowed = fill(hollowed, index(I, (x, y)), {(x, y)})
  return hollowed
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** Create a canvas filled with zeros, representing the final output grid.
2. **Iterate Through Objects and Borders:**  Iterate through each object in the input grid and find its border coordinates.
3. **Copy Border Colors:**  Copy the color of each border cell from the input grid to the corresponding location in the output canvas.
