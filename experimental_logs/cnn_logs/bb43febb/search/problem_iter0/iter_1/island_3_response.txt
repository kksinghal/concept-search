## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the grid and modifying their internal structure based on their size and shape. The specific rules are:

* **Small Objects:** Objects with less than 5 cells remain unchanged.
* **Large Objects:**  For objects with 5 or more cells:
    * **Non-square:** The internal cells are replaced with the value '2', preserving a one-cell border of the original color.
    * **Square:** Only the top row and rightmost column of the internal cells are replaced with '2', again preserving a one-cell border. 

Let's break down how this applies to the provided examples:

**Input_0:** The single object is large and non-square. The output shows its internal cells replaced with '2', leaving a one-cell border of '5'.

**Input_1:** This input has two objects:
    * **Top Object:** Large and non-square.  The output reflects the same internal replacement with '2' as seen in Input_0.
    * **Bottom Object:** Large and square. The output shows only the top row and rightmost column of internal cells replaced with '2'.


## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Version 1: Using `inbox` and conditional replacement**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  modified_grid = I
  for obj in objs:
    if size(obj) > 4:
      if not square(obj):
        modified_grid = fill(modified_grid, 2, inbox(obj)) 
      else: 
        modified_grid = fill(modified_grid, 2, intersection(inbox(obj), combine(hfrontier(ulcorner(obj)), vfrontier(urcorner(obj)))))
  return modified_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Uses `objects(I, T, F, T)` to identify objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Modify:** Loops through each object:
    * **Size Check:**  `if size(obj) > 4` proceeds only if the object is large enough.
    * **Shape Check:** `if not square(obj)` determines if the object is non-square.
        * **Non-Square:**  `fill(modified_grid, 2, inbox(obj))` replaces the internal cells (`inbox`) with '2'.
    * **Square:** Otherwise, the object is square.
        * **Selective Fill:** Uses `intersection` and `combine` with `hfrontier` and `vfrontier` to target only the top row and rightmost column of the `inbox` for replacement with '2'.
3. **Return:** Returns the modified grid.


**Version 2:  Leveraging `shift` and `centerofmass`**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if size(obj) > 4:
      c = centerofmass(obj)
      if not square(obj):
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(obj, subtract((1,1), c)))) 
      else:
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, shift(intersection(inbox(obj), combine(hfrontier(ulcorner(obj)), vfrontier(urcorner(obj)))), subtract((1,1), c))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Similar Start:**  Identifies objects and initializes the output grid like Version 1.
2. **Center-Based Modification:**
    * **Calculate Center:** Uses `centerofmass(obj)` to determine the object's center.
    * **Shift and Recolor:**  
       * **Non-Square:** Shifts the entire object by `(1, 1)` towards the origin (`subtract((1,1), c)`) before recoloring with '2' and painting onto the output.
       * **Square:** Applies the same shift and recolor logic but only to the selectively targeted cells from the square case in Version 1.
3. **Return:** Returns the modified grid.

**Version 3:  Emphasizing `hmatching` and `vmatching`**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  G = I
  for obj in objs:
    if size(obj) > 4:
      for i, j in toindices(obj):
        if (hmatching(frozenset({(i, j)}), inbox(obj))) and (vmatching(frozenset({(i, j)}), inbox(obj))):
          G = fill(G, 2, frozenset({(i, j)}))
  return G
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Iterate:** Similar to previous versions, identifies objects and iterates through them.
2. **Matching for Internal Cells:**
    * **Double Matching:** For each cell within an object, it checks if the cell is `hmatching` (shares a row) and `vmatching` (shares a column) with the object's `inbox`. This effectively identifies internal cells.
    * **Fill if Internal:** If a cell meets both matching criteria, it's filled with '2'.
3. **Return:** Returns the modified grid.


**Version 4:  Combining `crop` and `paint`**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if size(obj) > 4:
      if not square(obj):
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, inbox(obj)))
      else:
        c = ulcorner(obj)
        s = shape(obj)
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, combine(asindices(crop(canvas(0, s), (0, s[1] - 1), (1, 1))), asindices(crop(canvas(0, s), (s[0] - 1, 0), (1, s[1] - 1))))))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Standard Start:**  Identifies objects and initializes the output grid.
2. **Conditional Modification:**
    * **Non-Square:** Handles non-square objects by recoloring their `inbox` with '2' and painting onto the output.
    * **Square:** 
        * **Canvas Creation:** Creates a temporary canvas using `canvas(0, s)` with the same dimensions as the square object. 
        * **Cropping for Target:** Uses `crop` twice to extract the top row and rightmost column (excluding the corner) from the canvas.
        * **Combining and Recoloring:** Combines these extracted indices, recolors them with '2', and paints them onto the output grid at the correct position. 
3. **Return:** Returns the modified grid. 

**Version 5:  Utilizing `hsplit` and `vsplit`**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  G = I
  for obj in objs:
    if size(obj) > 4:
      if not square(obj):
        G = paint(G, recolor(2, inbox(obj)))
      else:
        parts = hsplit(vsplit(subgrid(obj, G), 2)[0], 2)
        G = paint(cover(G, obj), combine(recolor(2, asindices(parts[1])), recolor(color(obj), asindices(parts[0]))))
  return G 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initial Steps:** Same as previous versions - identifies objects and initializes the output.
2. **Splitting for Modification:**
    * **Non-Square:**  Handles these cases as before.
    * **Square:**
       * **Extract Subgrid:** Uses `subgrid` to isolate the square object from the grid.
       * **Splitting:** Employs `vsplit` and `hsplit` to divide the subgrid into four equal parts. 
       * **Selective Recoloring:** Takes the top right part (`parts[1]`) and recolors it with '2'. The top left part (`parts[0]`) retains its original color using `color(obj)`.
       * **Combine and Paint:** Combines the recolored parts and paints them back onto the output grid after covering the original object. 
3. **Return:** Returns the modified grid. 

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and power of the provided DSL.
