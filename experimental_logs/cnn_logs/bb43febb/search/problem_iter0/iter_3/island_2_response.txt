## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) within the input grid and recoloring the inner cells of objects larger than a certain size (in this case, 4). The recoloring only happens if the object is not touching the border of the grid.

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 

* The large '5' object in the center is identified.
* The inner cells of this object, not touching any '0' or the grid border, are recolored to '2'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* Two large '5' objects are identified.
* The inner cells of both objects, not touching any '0' or the grid border, are recolored to '2'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def jhefdgeceajiedchjjcgaajecbjeddbh(I):
  return paint(I, mfilter(lambda obj: size(obj) > FOUR, 
                     apply(lambda obj: recolor(TWO, inset(toindices(obj), ONE)),
                           objects(I, T, F, F))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Identifies all objects in the grid `I`.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: recolor(TWO, inset(toindices(obj), ONE)), ...)`:** For each object, it creates a new object with color '2' at indices one step inwards from the original object's border. 
3. **`mfilter(lambda obj: size(obj) > FOUR, ...)`:** Filters the objects, keeping only those with a size greater than 4.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the recolored objects onto the original grid `I`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def jhefdgeceajiedchjjcgaajecbjeddbh(I):
  return paint(I, 
               frozenset({(TWO, (i, j)) 
                         for obj in objects(I, T, F, F) if size(obj) > FOUR 
                         for (i, j) in toindices(obj) 
                         if all(0 < x < y - 1 for x, y in zip((i, j), shape(obj)))}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **`for obj in ... if size(obj) > FOUR ...`:** Iterates through objects larger than size 4.
3. **`for (i, j) in toindices(obj) ...`:** Iterates through indices of each object.
4. **`if all(0 < x < y - 1 for x, y in zip((i, j), shape(obj)))`:** Checks if the index is an inner cell by comparing its position to the object's dimensions.
5. **`frozenset({(TWO, (i, j)) ...})`:** Creates a new object with color '2' at the inner cell indices.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the recolored objects onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def jhefdgeceajiedchjjcgaajecbjeddbh(I):
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if size(obj) > FOUR and not bordering(obj, I):
      I = fill(I, TWO, delta(box(obj)) & toindices(obj))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **`if size(obj) > FOUR and not bordering(obj, I):`:** Filters for objects larger than 4 and not touching the grid border.
3. **`delta(box(obj)) & toindices(obj)`:** Calculates the inner cells of the object by finding the intersection between the object's indices and the indices within its bounding box excluding the box itself.
4. **`fill(I, TWO, ...)`:** Fills the inner cell indices with color '2'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def jhefdgeceajiedchjjcgaajecbjeddbh(I):
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
        if size(obj) > 4:
            (i0, j0), (i1, j1) = ulcorner(obj), lrcorner(obj)
            I = paint(I, {(TWO, (i, j)) for i in range(i0 + 1, i1) for j in range(j0 + 1, j1)})
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **`if size(obj) > 4:`:** Filters for objects larger than size 4.
3. **`(i0, j0), (i1, j1) = ulcorner(obj), lrcorner(obj)`:** Gets the coordinates of the upper-left and lower-right corners of the object.
4. **`{(TWO, (i, j)) for i in range(i0 + 1, i1) for j in range(j0 + 1, j1)}`:** Generates a set of tuples representing the inner cells with color '2' within the object's boundaries.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the recoloured cells onto the original grid. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def jhefdgeceajiedchjjcgaajecbjeddbh(I):
  return paint(I, mfilter(lambda obj: size(obj) > 4 and not bordering(obj, I), 
                        apply(lambda obj: recolor(TWO, inbox(obj)), 
                              objects(I, T, F, F))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: recolor(TWO, inbox(obj)), ...)`:** For each object, it creates a new object with color '2' at the indices within its inner bounding box (excluding the border).
3. **`mfilter(lambda obj: size(obj) > 4 and not bordering(obj, I), ...)`:** Filters the objects, keeping only those with a size greater than 4 and not bordering the grid.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the recoloured objects onto the original grid.


These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation. Each program utilizes different DSL functions and logic while accomplishing the same goal: recoloring the inner cells of large objects not touching the grid border.
