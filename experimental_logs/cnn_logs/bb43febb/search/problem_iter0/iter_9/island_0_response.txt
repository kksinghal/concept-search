## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify objects within the input grid and fill their interior with the value '2', leaving a one-cell border around the filled area. The background color (most frequent color) remains unchanged.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** A single object formed by the digit '5'. The interior of this object is filled with '2', leaving a '5' border.
* **Input_1:** Two objects, one formed by '5' and the other by a smaller cluster of '5'. Both objects have their interiors filled with '2' while maintaining a one-cell '5' border.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # x1: Identify all objects (excluding background)
  x1 = objects(I, F, F, T)
  # x2: Get indices of each object
  x2 = apply(toindices, x1)
  # x3: Get the inbox indices for each object 
  x3 = apply(inbox, x2)
  # x4: Merge all inbox indices
  x4 = merge(x3)
  # O: Fill the merged inbox indices with 2
  O = fill(I, 2, x4)
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 
1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, F, F, T)` finds all objects in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Extract Indices:** `apply(toindices, x1)` extracts the indices of each object.
3. **Calculate Inbox:** `apply(inbox, x2)` determines the interior indices (inbox) of each object.
4. **Merge Indices:** `merge(x3)` combines all inbox indices into a single set.
5. **Fill Interior:** `fill(I, 2, x4)` fills the identified interior cells with the value '2'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # x1: Identify all non-background cells
  x1 = toindices(objects(I, F, F, T))
  # x2: Generate a canvas filled with 2s, same size as input
  x2 = canvas(2, shape(I))
  # x3: Combine cell-by-cell, using input as fallback for non-matching cells
  O = cellwise(x2, paint(x2, recolor(1, x1)), I) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Non-Background:** `toindices(objects(I, F, F, T))` gets indices of all non-background cells.
2. **Create Filled Canvas:** `canvas(2, shape(I))` generates a grid of the same size as the input, filled with '2'.
3. **Overlay Objects:** `paint(x2, recolor(1, x1))` creates a grid with '1' at non-background cell positions.
4. **Combine and Restore Background:** `cellwise(x2, ..., I)` combines the filled canvas with the overlaid grid. It uses the original input as a fallback, effectively restoring the background.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # x1: Get indices of all non-background cells
  x1 = toindices(objects(I, F, F, T))
  # x2: Get indices of the outer border of non-background cells
  x2 = difference(backdrop(x1), x1)
  # x3: Fill the grid with 2 at non-border indices
  x3 = fill(I, 2, difference(asindices(I), x2))
  # O: Replace any remaining 2s outside the object with the original values from the input
  O = cellwise(x3, I, I) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Non-Background Indices:** Similar to version 2, get indices of non-background cells.
2. **Identify Border:**  `difference(backdrop(x1), x1)` finds indices forming the outer border of the objects.
3. **Fill Non-Border:** `fill(I, 2, difference(asindices(I), x2))` fills all indices except the border with '2'.
4. **Restore Background:** `cellwise(x3, I, I)` ensures that any '2' outside the object area reverts to the original input value.

**Program Version 4:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # x1: Identify objects in the grid excluding background
  x1 = objects(I, F, F, T)
  # x2: For each object, create a grid filled with 2, then paint the object onto it
  x2 = apply(lambda o: paint(canvas(2, shape(I)), o), x1)
  # x3: Merge all the resulting grids
  x3 = merge(x2)
  # O: Cellwise match between the merged grid and the input to preserve the background
  O = cellwise(x3, I, I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Find all objects excluding background.
2. **Process Each Object:**  For each object:
    - Create a canvas filled with '2' the same size as the input.
    - Paint the object onto this canvas, resulting in a grid with the object on a '2'-filled background.
3. **Merge Grids:**  Combine all object-specific grids.
4. **Restore Background:** Use `cellwise` to match with the original input, effectively restoring the original background.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # x1: Get all object indices, excluding background
  x1 = apply(toindices, objects(I, F, F, T))
  # x2: Find the backdrop for each object
  x2 = apply(backdrop, x1)
  # x3: Get the difference between backdrop and object indices for each object
  x3 = apply(lambda x: difference(x[0], x[1]), pair(x2, x1))
  # x4: Merge the differences to get all indices to fill
  x4 = merge(x3)
  # O: Fill the input grid with 2 at the identified indices 
  O = fill(I, 2, x4)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Object Indices:** Obtain indices of all objects except the background.
2. **Find Backdrops:** Determine the bounding box (backdrop) for each object's indices.
3. **Calculate Differences:** Find the difference between each object's backdrop and its actual indices, effectively getting the interior border.
4. **Merge Differences:** Combine all these differences into a single set of indices.
5. **Fill Interior:** Fill the input grid with '2' at the identified interior border indices.

Each of these program versions uses a different combination of DSL functions to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
