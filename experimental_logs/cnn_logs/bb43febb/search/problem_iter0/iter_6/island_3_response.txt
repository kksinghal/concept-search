## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid and changing the color of specific cells within those objects to the digit '2'. The selection criteria for recoloring are as follows:

* **Object Size:** Only objects with a size greater than 4 cells are considered.
* **Cell Position:** A cell within the object is recolored if it lies on both the horizontal and vertical lines that define the inner boundary of the object's bounding box. In other words, the cell should be adjacent to both a horizontal and a vertical edge of the object's inner bounding box.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  G = I
  for obj in objs:
    if size(obj) > 4:
      for i, j in toindices(obj):
        if (i,j) in inbox(obj):
          G = fill(G, 2, frozenset({(i, j)}))
  return G
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects in the input grid `I`, considering only directly adjacent cells (`F`) and excluding the background (`T`).
2. **Iterate and Filter:** The code iterates through each object `obj`. If the `size(obj)` is greater than 4, it proceeds.
3. **Recolor Cells:** For each cell `(i, j)` within the object, it checks if the cell is part of the `inbox(obj)`. If true, it recolors the cell to '2' using `fill(G, 2, frozenset({(i, j)}))`.
4. **Return Modified Grid:** The modified grid `G` is returned.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  G = I
  for obj in objs:
    if size(obj) > 4:
      G = fill(G, 2, intersection(toindices(obj), inbox(obj)))
  return G
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Iterate and Filter:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Recolor Cells:** Instead of iterating through each cell, this version directly finds the intersection of the object's indices `toindices(obj)` and its inbox `inbox(obj)` using `intersection`. It then recolors all cells in this intersection to '2' at once.
4. **Return Modified Grid:** Same as Version 1.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  return paint(I, merge(frozenset({(2, (i, j)) for i, j in toindices(obj) if (i, j) in inbox(obj)} for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if size(obj) > 4)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version compresses the logic into a single line using nested comprehensions and function composition:

1. **Identify Objects and Filter:**  It identifies objects, filters them by size, and generates a set of cells to be recolored within each valid object using a nested comprehension.
2. **Recolor and Merge:** It merges all sets of cells to be recolored using `merge` and paints them with the value '2' on the input grid `I` using `paint`.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(2, intersection(toindices(obj), inbox(obj))), sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) > 4))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes higher-order functions for a more functional programming style:

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Filter Objects:**  `sfilter` filters the objects based on size.
3. **Apply Transformation:**  `apply` applies a lambda function to each filtered object. This lambda function recolors the intersection of the object and its inbox to '2' using `recolor` and `intersection`.
4. **Merge and Paint:**  `merge` combines the recolored cells from all objects, and `paint` applies them to the input grid `I`.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  G = I
  for i in range(1, height(I) - 1):
    for j in range(1, width(I) - 1):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcommon(I) and index(I, (i - 1, j)) == index(I, (i + 1, j)) == mostcommon(I) and index(I, (i, j - 1)) == index(I, (i, j + 1)) == mostcommon(I):
        G = fill(G, 2, frozenset({(i, j)}))
  return G
```

**Explanation:**

This version takes a different approach by iterating through every cell and checking its neighborhood:

1. **Iterate through Cells:** It iterates through each cell `(i, j)` of the grid, excluding the border cells.
2. **Check Neighborhood:** For each cell, it checks if it's not the background color (`mostcommon(I)`) and if its top and bottom neighbors, as well as left and right neighbors, are all the background color. 
3. **Recolor if Condition Met:** If the condition in step 2 is met, it means the cell is an inner corner of an object, so it recolors the cell to '2'.
4. **Return Modified Grid:** Same as Version 1.

Each of these versions successfully implements the desired transformation using different combinations of DSL functions, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
