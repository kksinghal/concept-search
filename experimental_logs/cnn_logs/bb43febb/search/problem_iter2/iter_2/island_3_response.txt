## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

The transformation shifts the object composed of '2' digits one cell to the right. Then, it extends the rightmost column of the '5' object downwards by one cell. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

This transformation is more complex and involves multiple steps:

1. **Horizontal Expansion:** The '5' object is expanded horizontally by one cell on both the left and right sides.
2. **Vertical Compression:** The '2' object is compressed vertically, reducing its height by one cell. 
3. **Vertical Shift & Expansion:** The compressed '2' object is then shifted down by one cell and its bottom row is extended to match the width of the '5' object.


## Program Versions & Explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  two_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  five_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 5)
  O = fill(I, 5, shift(two_obj, (0, 1)))
  O = fill(O, 2, shift(two_obj, (0, 2)))
  O = fill(O, 5, (lrcorner(five_obj)[0], lrcorner(five_obj)[1] + 1)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The code identifies the objects formed by digits '2' and '5' using the `objects` function.
2. **Shift and Fill:** It shifts the '2' object one cell to the right and fills the original location with '5'. Then it shifts the '2' object once more to the right and fills the location with '2', effectively moving the object.
3. **Extend '5' Object:** The code then identifies the lower right corner of the '5' object and fills the cell below it with '5', extending it downwards.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  twos = ofcolor(I, 2)
  fives = ofcolor(I, 5)
  O = fill(I, 5, shift(twos, (0, 1)))
  O = fill(O, 2, shift(twos, (0, 2)))
  bottom_five = (lowermost(fives), rightmost(fives))
  O = fill(O, 5, (bottom_five[0] + 1, bottom_five[1]))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate Colors:** This version directly finds the indices of cells containing '2' and '5' using `ofcolor`.
2. **Shift and Fill:** Similar to version 1, it shifts the '2' object.
3. **Extend '5' Object:** It finds the lowermost and rightmost points of the '5' object and uses them to identify and fill the cell directly below.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  two_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  five_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 5)
  O = paint(I, shift(recolor(5, two_obj), (0, 1))) 
  O = paint(O, shift(two_obj, (0, 2)))
  O = fill(O, 5, shift(lrcorner(five_obj), (1, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Shift, Recolor, Paint:** It shifts a recolored copy of the '2' object (now '5') one cell right and paints it onto the grid. Then, it shifts the original '2' object two cells right and paints it, effectively achieving the desired movement.
3. **Extend '5' Object:**  The lower right corner of the '5' object is shifted down and used to fill the cell with '5'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  two_indices = ofcolor(I, 2)
  five_indices = ofcolor(I, 5)
  shifted_twos = shift(two_indices, (0, 1))
  O = fill(I, 5, shifted_twos)
  O = fill(O, 2, shift(shifted_twos, (0, 1)))
  O = fill(O, 5, shift(lrcorner(five_indices), (1, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate Colors and Shift:** This version identifies the indices of '2' and '5' and shifts the '2' indices one cell right.
2. **Fill with Shifted Indices:** It fills the grid with '5' at the shifted '2' indices and then with '2' at further shifted indices, effectively moving the '2' object.
3. **Extend '5' Object:** Similar to version 3.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  two_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  five_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 5)
  O = paint(I, shift(recolor(5, two_obj), (0, 1)))
  O = underpaint(O, shift(two_obj, (0, 2)))
  extension = {(5, (lrcorner(five_obj)[0] + 1, lrcorner(five_obj)[1]))}
  O = paint(O, extension)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Shift, Recolor, Paint:**  Similar to version 3.
3. **Extend '5' Object:** It creates a new object containing only the cell below the lower right corner of the '5' object and paints it onto the grid, extending the object.


These five program versions showcase distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformations using various combinations of DSL functions. Each version demonstrates a different way to identify, manipulate, and position objects within the grid.
