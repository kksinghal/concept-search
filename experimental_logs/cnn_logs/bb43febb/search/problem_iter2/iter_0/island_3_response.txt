## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in both examples involves identifying objects of a specific color (in this case, '2') and then extending them horizontally to merge with another object of a different color (in this case, '5'). 

* **Input_0:** The object '2' is extended rightward to merge with the object '5' directly to its right. This creates a single, larger object composed of both colors.
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the object '2' is extended rightward to merge with the object '5'. However, in this case, the '2' object is enveloped by the '5' object, creating a '5' object with a '2' core.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions ("Program_to_be_generated") inspired by the provided Program_A and Program_B, but adapted to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      target_color = 5
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
        for j in range(leftmost(obj), len(I[0])):
          if index(I, (i, j)) == target_color:
            O = fill(O, 2, connect((i, leftmost(obj)), (i, j)))
            break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** The program iterates through each object in the input grid `I`.
2. **Identify '2' objects:** It checks if the current object's color is '2'.
3. **Horizontal Scan:** For each row of the '2' object, the program scans horizontally towards the right.
4. **Merge with '5':** Upon encountering a cell with the target color '5', it recolors the connecting cells to '2', effectively merging the two objects.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      target_obj = extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda x: color(x) == 5 and hmatching(obj, x))
      if target_obj:
        start_j = min(leftmost(target_obj), leftmost(obj))
        end_j = max(rightmost(target_obj), rightmost(obj))
        for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
          O = fill(O, 2, connect((i, start_j), (i, end_j)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Iteration:** Iterates through each object in the input grid.
2. **Find Target '5' Object:** For each '2' object, it finds the corresponding '5' object that shares at least one row.
3. **Determine Horizontal Span:** It calculates the starting and ending column indices for the merged object.
4. **Horizontal Merge:**  It recolors the cells within the determined span to '2', merging the objects.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      target_j = rightmost(obj) + 1
      while target_j < len(I[0]) and any(index(I, (i, target_j)) == 5 for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)):
        I = fill(I, 2, {(i, target_j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)})
        target_j += 1
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Identify:** Iterates through objects, focusing on those with color '2'.
2. **Rightward Expansion:**  Starts from the right edge of the '2' object.
3. **Conditional Filling:**  For each column to the right, it checks if any cell in that column, within the object's row span, has the color '5'. If so, it fills the entire column segment with '2'.
4. **Iteration Until '5' End:**  Continues expanding rightward until it no longer encounters the target color '5'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
        j = leftmost(obj)
        while j < len(I[0]):
          if index(I, (i, j)) == 5:
            O = fill(O, 2, connect((i, leftmost(obj)), (i, j)))
            break
          j += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object and Row Iteration:**  Iterates through objects, and for each '2' object, iterates through its rows.
2. **Linear Search:**  Moves rightward along each row, starting from the object's leftmost column.
3. **Color Detection and Filling:**  If it encounters a cell with color '5', it connects the current cell to the leftmost cell of the object on that row, effectively merging them. The loop for that row then breaks.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      target_indices = set()
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
        for j in range(leftmost(obj), len(I[0])):
          if index(I, (i, j)) == 5:
            target_indices.update(connect((i, leftmost(obj)), (i, j)))
      O = fill(O, 2, frozenset(target_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Iteration and Index Collection:** Iterates through objects, identifying '2' objects. For each, it collects indices of cells that need to be recolored.
2. **Horizontal Scan and Connection:** For each '2' object, it scans rows to the right. When it finds a '5', it marks the cells between the '2' object's leftmost point on that row and the current '5' cell for recoloring. 
3. **Batch Recoloring:** After processing all rows, it recolors the marked cells to '2' in one go.


These five programs offer diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing flexibility in utilizing the provided DSL. Each program leverages different functions and logic to accomplish the merging of objects based on color and spatial relationships.
