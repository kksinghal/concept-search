## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves shifting the '2' colored objects one position to the right and replacing the leftmost column of the shifted object with '5's. Additionally, the rightmost column of any '5' colored object is shifted one position down and replaced with '2's.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. The '2' colored object is shifted one position to the right.
2. The leftmost column of the shifted '2' object is replaced with '5's.
3. The rightmost column of the bottom '5' colored object is shifted one position down.
4. The shifted column of the '5' object is replaced with '2's.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. The '2' colored object is shifted one position to the right.
2. The leftmost column of the shifted '2' object is replaced with '5's.
3. The rightmost column of the top and bottom '5' colored objects is shifted one position down.
4. The shifted columns of both '5' objects are replaced with '2's.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  twos = ofcolor(I, 2)
  fives = ofcolor(I, 5)
  O = fill(I, 5, shift(twos, (0, 1)))
  O = fill(O, 2, shift(twos, (0, 2)))
  for obj in objects(O, T, T, T):
    if color(obj) == 5:
      right_edge = {(i, rightmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)}
      O = fill(O, 2, shift(right_edge, (1, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identify the indices of '2's and '5's in the input grid.
2. Shift the '2' indices one position to the right and fill with '5's.
3. Shift the '2' indices two positions to the right and fill with '2's.
4. Iterate over all '5' colored objects.
5. For each object, identify its rightmost column indices.
6. Shift the rightmost column indices one position down and fill with '2's.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      O = paint(O, shift(recolor(5, obj), (0, 1)))
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 2)))
    elif color(obj) == 5:
      right_edge = toobject({(i, rightmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)}, I)
      O = paint(O, shift(recolor(2, right_edge), (1, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterate over each object in the input grid.
2. If the object is color '2':
    - Recolor it to '5' and shift one position to the right, painting it onto the output grid.
    - Shift the original object two positions to the right and paint it onto the output grid.
3. If the object is color '5':
    - Identify its rightmost column and convert it to an object.
    - Recolor the rightmost column object to '2' and shift one position down, painting it onto the output grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == 2 and I[i][j + 1] in (0, 5):
        O = fill(O, 5, {(i, j + 1)})
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 2)})
  for obj in objects(O, T, T, T):
    if color(obj) == 5:
      O = fill(O, 2, {(lowermost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterate over the input grid cell by cell.
2. If a '2' is found with a '0' or '5' to its right:
    - Fill the cell to the right with '5'.
    - Fill the cell two positions to the right with '2'.
3. Iterate over all '5' colored objects in the updated grid.
4. For each object, fill the cell one position below its bottom-right corner with '2'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      O = fill(O, 5, shift(toindices(obj), (0, 1)))
      O = fill(O, 2, shift(toindices(obj), (0, 2)))
    if color(obj) == 5:
      for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
        if (i, rightmost(obj)) in toindices(obj):
          O = fill(O, 2, {(i + 1, rightmost(obj))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterate over each object in the input grid.
2. If the object is color '2':
    - Get its indices and shift them one position to the right, filling with '5's.
    - Get its indices and shift them two positions to the right, filling with '2's.
3. If the object is color '5':
    - Iterate through each row of the object.
    - If the rightmost cell of the row belongs to the object, fill the cell one position below with '2'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  two_obj = extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  five_objs = sizefilter(objects(I, T, T, T), size(extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 5)))
  O = fill(I, 5, shift(toindices(two_obj), (0, 1)))
  O = fill(O, 2, shift(toindices(two_obj), (0, 2)))
  for obj in five_objs:
    O = fill(O, 2, {(lowermost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Extract the '2' colored object and all '5' colored objects of the same size as the first '5' object encountered.
2. Shift the indices of the '2' object one position to the right and fill with '5's.
3. Shift the indices of the '2' object two positions to the right and fill with '2's.
4. For each '5' colored object, fill the cell one position below its bottom-right corner with '2'.


These five program versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation using different combinations of DSL functions. Each version provides a valid solution, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
