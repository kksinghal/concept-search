## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. Identify objects with color '2'.
2. Shift each '2' object one cell to the right.
3. Fill the leftmost column of each shifted '2' object with color '5'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. Identify objects with color '2'.
2. Shift each '2' object one cell down.
3. For each shifted '2' object, replace the uppermost row with color '5'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for obj in objects(grid, T, T, T):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      grid = paint(grid, recolor(5, shift(toindices(obj), (-1, 0))))
      grid = move(grid, obj, (1, 0))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterate over all objects in the grid.
2. If the object's color is '2':
   - Shift the object's indices one cell up.
   - Recolor the shifted indices to '5' and paint them onto the grid.
   - Move the original object one cell to the right.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  for obj in objects(grid, T, T, T):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, recolor(5, shift(obj, (-1, 0))))
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(obj, (1, 0)))
    else:
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, obj)
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. Create a new grid filled with the background color.
2. Iterate over all objects in the original grid.
3. If the object's color is '2':
   - Shift the object one cell up and recolor it to '5'. Paint this onto the new grid.
   - Shift the original object one cell to the right and paint it onto the new grid.
4. If the object's color is not '2', paint it directly onto the new grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  shifted_objs = frozenset({shift(obj, (1, 0)) if color(obj) == 2 else obj for obj in objects(grid, T, T, T)})
  grid = paint(canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid)), merge(shifted_objs))
  for obj in shifted_objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      grid = paint(grid, recolor(5, shift(toindices(obj), (-1, 0))))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. Create a new set of objects with all '2' objects shifted one cell to the right.
2. Create a new grid filled with the background color and paint all objects from the shifted set onto it.
3. Iterate over the shifted objects and for every '2' object, recolor its up-shifted indices to '5' and paint them onto the grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  for obj in objects(grid, T, T, T):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      grid = fill(grid, 5, shift(toindices(obj) & backdrop(shift(obj, (1, 0))), (-1, 0)))
      grid = move(grid, obj, (1, 0))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterate over all objects in the grid.
2. If the object's color is '2':
   - Find the intersection between the object's indices shifted one cell up and the backdrop of the object shifted one cell to the right.
   - Fill the resulting indices with color '5'.
   - Move the original object one cell to the right.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(grid), shape(grid))
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 2:
        if i > 0:
          new_grid = fill(new_grid, 5, {(i - 1, j + 1)})
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
      else:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, val, {(i, j)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. Create a new grid filled with the background color.
2. Iterate over each cell in the original grid.
3. If the cell value is '2':
   - If the cell is not in the first row, fill the cell diagonally up-right with '5'.
   - Fill the cell to the right with '2'.
4. If the cell value is not '2', copy the value to the new grid.

These five versions use different strategies and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same transformation. They demonstrate the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for solving spatial reasoning problems.
