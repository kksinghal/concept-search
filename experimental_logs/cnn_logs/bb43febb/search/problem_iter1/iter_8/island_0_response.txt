## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring the inner cells of objects in the grid. An inner cell is defined as a cell that's completely surrounded by cells of the same color (including diagonals). 

**Example:**

In Input_0, the inner cells of the "5" object form a rectangle from (2,1) to (5,4). These cells are recolored to "2" in the output. The cells on the perimeter of the object are not recolored because they have at least one neighboring cell with a different color. 

The same logic applies to Input_1, with the inner cells of both "5" objects being recolored. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions using the DSL to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Recolors inner cells by checking all 8 neighbors.
  """
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  def is_inner(i, j):
    if i <= 0 or i >= h - 1 or j <= 0 or j >= w - 1:
      return False
    value = I[i][j]
    return all(I[i+di][j+dj] == value for di in (-1, 0, 1) for dj in (-1, 0, 1) if di != 0 or dj != 0)
  return tuple(tuple(2 if is_inner(i, j) else I[i][j] for j in range(w)) for i in range(h))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_inner(i, j)` Function:** 
   - Checks if a cell at `(i, j)` is an inner cell.
   - Excludes border cells.
   - Compares the cell's value with all 8 neighbors.
   - Returns `True` if all neighbors have the same value, `False` otherwise.
2. **Grid Iteration:**
   - Iterates through all cells in the grid.
   - Calls `is_inner(i, j)` for each cell.
   - Recolors the cell to '2' if it's an inner cell, otherwise keeps the original value.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Recolors inner cells by comparing with shifted grids.
  """
  shifted_grids = (shift(asobject(I), d) for d in ((1,1),(-1,-1),(1,-1),(-1,1),(1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)))
  common_cells = intersection(*[toindices(obj) for obj in shifted_grids])
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(2, common_cells)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_grids`:** Creates a tuple of shifted versions of the input grid (`I`) in all 8 directions.
2. **`common_cells`:** Finds the intersection of indices from all shifted grids. These indices represent cells that remained unchanged after all shifts, meaning they are inner cells.
3. **`paint` and `recolor`:**  Creates a blank canvas, then paints the inner cells (`common_cells`) with the value '2'. 

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Identifies inner cells using object properties.
  """
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  G = I
  for obj in objs:
    if size(obj) > 4:
      G = underfill(G, 2, inbox(obj))
  return G
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects`:** Extracts objects from the grid.
2. **Iteration and `underfill`:** 
   - Iterates through each object.
   - If the object has more than 4 cells (to exclude single cells or lines), it fills the `inbox` of the object with '2' in the grid `G`, effectively recoloring the inner cells.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Recolors inner cells by expanding from the center.
  """
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  def expand(i, j, value):
    if i < 0 or i >= h or j < 0 or j >= w or I[i][j] != value:
      return 
    I[i][j] = 2
    for di in (-1, 0, 1):
      for dj in (-1, 0, 1):
        if di != 0 or dj != 0:
          expand(i+di, j+dj, value)

  for i in range(1, h - 1):
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
      if I[i][j] != I[i-1][j] or I[i][j] != I[i][j-1] or I[i][j] != I[i+1][j] or I[i][j] != I[i][j+1]:
        continue
      expand(i, j, I[i][j])
  return I

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`expand(i, j, value)`:** Recursively expands from a given cell `(i, j)` and recolors cells with the same `value` to '2'. 
2. **Grid Traversal and Expansion:**
   - Iterates through each cell (excluding borders).
   - If a cell's value is the same as its four direct neighbors, it's a potential inner cell.
   - Calls `expand` to recolor the inner cell and its connected neighbors with the same value.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Recolors inner cells by finding cells not on the perimeter of objects.
  """
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  perimeter_cells = merge(apply(box, objs))
  return fill(I, 2, difference(asindices(I), perimeter_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`perimeter_cells`:** Extracts all objects and merges their perimeters (`box` function) to get a set of cells on the outer edges of objects.
2. **`difference`:**  Finds the difference between all indices in the grid and the `perimeter_cells`. This leaves only the inner cells.
3. **`fill`:** Fills the inner cells with the value '2'.
