## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves moving the object composed of '5' digits. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** The '5' object is moved two rows down, effectively centering it vertically within the grid.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**  The '5' object is moved one column to the right, aligning its leftmost cells with the '2' object's rightmost cells.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:** The '5' object is moved one column to the right, aligning its leftmost cells with the center of the '2' object.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct code versions using functions from the DSL to achieve the desired transformations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find object with color 5
  five_obj = extract(objects(I, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 5)
  # Move the '5' object one row down for each row in the top half 
  O = move(I, five_obj, (height(tophalf(I)), 0)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the '5' object:**  The code first locates the object formed by the '5' digits.
2. **Calculate the offset:** The height of the top half of the input grid is used to calculate the required vertical offset for the '5' object.
3. **Move the object:** The '5' object is moved down by the calculated offset.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find object with color 5
  five_obj = extract(objects(I, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 5)
  # Calculate the vertical center of the grid
  center_i = height(I) // 2 
  # Calculate the offset to center the '5' object vertically
  offset = (center_i - centerofmass(five_obj)[0], 0)
  # Move the '5' object 
  O = move(I, five_obj, offset) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate the '5' object:** Similar to version 1, the code first finds the '5' object.
2. **Determine the grid's vertical center:** It calculates the row index representing the grid's vertical center.
3. **Compute the offset:** The code determines the difference between the grid's vertical center and the '5' object's center of mass, providing the vertical offset.
4. **Execute the move:** The '5' object is shifted down by the calculated offset.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find object with color 5
  five_obj = extract(objects(I, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 5)
  # Find object with color 2
  two_obj = extract(objects(I, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  # Calculate the horizontal offset to align left edge of '5' with right edge of '2'
  offset = (0, rightmost(two_obj) - leftmost(five_obj) + 1) 
  # Move the '5' object 
  O = move(I, five_obj, offset)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the '5' and '2' objects:** The code identifies both the '5' and '2' objects within the grid.
2. **Determine the horizontal offset:** It calculates the difference between the rightmost column of the '2' object and the leftmost column of the '5' object, adding 1 to position the '5' object immediately to the right.
3. **Move the '5' object:**  The '5' object is shifted horizontally by the calculated offset.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find object with color 5
  five_obj = extract(objects(I, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 5)
  # Find object with color 2
  two_obj = extract(objects(I, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  # Calculate the horizontal offset to align centers of '5' and '2' objects
  offset = (0, centerofmass(two_obj)[1] - centerofmass(five_obj)[1])
  # Move the '5' object 
  O = move(I, five_obj, offset)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate the '5' and '2' objects:**  The code identifies the objects formed by the '5' and '2' digits.
2. **Calculate the horizontal offset:** It determines the difference in horizontal position between the centers of mass of the '2' and '5' objects.
3. **Move the '5' object:** The '5' object is moved horizontally by the calculated offset.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find object with color 5
  five_obj = extract(objects(I, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 5)
  # Calculate the horizontal center of the grid
  center_j = width(I) // 2
  # Calculate the offset to horizontally center the '5' object 
  offset = (0, center_j - centerofmass(five_obj)[1]) 
  # Move the '5' object 
  O = move(I, five_obj, offset)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the '5' object:**  The code finds the object composed of '5' digits.
2. **Find the grid's horizontal center:**  It calculates the column index representing the grid's horizontal center.
3. **Calculate the offset:** The code determines the difference between the grid's horizontal center and the '5' object's center of mass, giving the horizontal offset.
4. **Perform the move:** The '5' object is moved rightward by the calculated offset.
