## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the object made of '2's and the objects made of '5's, then moving the '5' objects to the center of the '2' object. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** The '5' objects are moved downwards to align with the center of the '2' object.

**Input_1:** The '5' objects are moved upwards and to the right to align with the center of the '2' object.

**Input_2:** The '5' objects are moved towards the center of the '2' object. 

## Program to be Generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  two_obj = merge(objects(I, True, False, True)) # Find the '2' object.
  five_objs = colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), 5) # Find all '5' objects.
  two_center = center(two_obj) # Find the center of the '2' object.
  
  def move_five(five_obj):
    return shift(five_obj, subtract(two_center, center(five_obj))) # Calculate offset to move '5' to center of '2'.

  moved_fives = apply(move_five, five_objs) # Move each '5' object.
  return paint(cover(I, merge(five_objs)), merge(moved_fives)) # Paint the moved objects on a blank canvas.
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Find Objects:** Identify the '2' object and all '5' objects using `objects` and `colorfilter`.
2.  **Find Center:** Calculate the center coordinates of the '2' object using `center`.
3.  **Calculate Offset:** For each '5' object, determine the offset needed to move it to the center of the '2' object.
4.  **Move Objects:** Shift each '5' object by its calculated offset.
5.  **Paint Objects:** Erase the original '5' objects and paint the moved '5' objects onto the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  two_center = center(toindices(merge(objects(I, True, False, True)))) # Find center of '2' object.
  five_indices = toindices(merge(colorfilter(asobject(I), 5))) # Find indices of all '5's.
  return paint(cover(I, five_indices), shift(five_indices, subtract(two_center, center(five_indices)))) # Move and paint '5's.
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Find Center and Indices:** Directly calculate the center of the '2' object and the indices of all '5's.
2.  **Move and Paint:** Calculate the offset, shift the '5' indices, and paint the moved '5's onto a cleared grid in a single step.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  def move_to_center(obj, target_center):
    return shift(obj, subtract(target_center, center(obj))) # Function to move any object to a target center.

  two_center = center(merge(objects(I, True, False, True))) # Find the center of the '2' object.
  five_obj = merge(colorfilter(asobject(I), 5)) # Find the combined '5' object.
  return paint(cover(I, five_obj), move_to_center(five_obj, two_center)) # Move and paint the '5' object.
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Helper Function:** Defines a reusable `move_to_center` function for moving objects.
2.  **Find Center and Object:** Identify the '2' object's center and the combined '5' object.
3.  **Move and Paint:** Use the helper function to move the '5' object to the '2' object's center and paint it.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  two_center_i, two_center_j = center(toindices(merge(objects(I, True, False, True)))) # Get i, j coordinates of '2' center.
  five_obj = frozenset((5, (two_center_i - 7 + i, two_center_j - 7 + j)) for i, j in toindices(merge(colorfilter(asobject(I), 5)))) # Create new '5' object at the center of '2'.
  return paint(cover(I, colorfilter(asobject(I), 5)), five_obj) # Paint the new '5' object onto a cleared grid. 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Find Center and Indices:** Extract the '2' object's center coordinates and the indices of all '5's.
2.  **Create New Object:** Construct a new '5' object directly at the calculated center of the '2' object.
3.  **Paint Object:** Erase the original '5' objects and paint the new '5' object.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  two_center = center(toindices(merge(objects(I, True, False, True)))) # Find the '2' object's center.
  def move_five(v, loc): 
    i, j = loc
    return (v, (i + two_center[0] - 7, j + two_center[1] - 7)) # Function to move individual cells to '2' center.

  return paint(cover(I, colorfilter(asobject(I), 5)), frozenset(move_five(v, loc) for v, loc in asobject(I) if v == 5)) # Move and paint individual '5' cells.
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Find Center:** Determine the '2' object's center coordinates.
2.  **Cell-wise Movement:** Define a function to move individual cells to the calculated center.
3.  **Move and Paint:** Apply the movement function to each '5' cell and paint the moved cells onto a cleared grid.

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieving the same transformation. They demonstrate the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for solving spatial reasoning tasks.
