## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving all objects of value "5" to be centered both vertically and horizontally around the center of mass of all objects of value "2".

**Input 0:** 
* The '5' objects are above, below and to the left of the '2' object.
* All '5' objects are moved to the center of the '2' object.

**Input 1:**
* The '5' objects are to the right of the '2' objects.
* All '5' objects are moved horizontally to align with the center of the '2' objects, and then vertically centered.

**Input 2:**
* The '5' objects surround the '2' objects.
* All '5' objects are moved to be centered around the '2' objects.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  twos = merge(objects(I, True, False, True))
  fives = colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), 5)
  target_x, target_y = center(twos)
  
  def align_five(five):
    offset = subtract((target_x, target_y), center(five))
    return shift(five, offset)

  return paint(cover(I, merge(fives)), merge(apply(align_five, fives)))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all '2' objects and '5' objects separately.
2. **Find Target Center:** Calculate the center of mass of all '2' objects combined.
3. **Calculate Offset:** Determine the offset required to move each '5' object's center to the target center.
4. **Shift and Paint:** Shift each '5' object by its calculated offset and paint it back onto the grid after removing the original '5' objects.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  twos = toindices(merge(objects(I, True, False, True)))
  target_x, target_y = (sum(i for i, j in twos) // len(twos), sum(j for i, j in twos) // len(twos))
  
  def move_five(v, loc):
    i, j = loc
    return (v, (i + target_x - uppermost(twos) - height(twos) // 2, j + target_y - leftmost(twos) - width(twos) // 2))

  return paint(cover(I, colorfilter(asobject(I), 5)), frozenset(move_five(v, loc) for v, loc in colorfilter(asobject(I), 5)))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find Target Center:** Calculate the average row and column indices of all '2' cells to determine the target center.
2. **Define Move Function:** Create a function that takes a cell's value and location, calculates the offset based on the target center and the '2' object's bounding box, and returns the new cell location.
3. **Apply Transformation:** Apply this function to all '5' cells, effectively shifting them to be centered around the '2' objects.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  two_center = center(merge(objects(I, True, False, True)))
  return paint(cover(I, colorfilter(asobject(I), 5)), 
               merge(apply(lambda five: shift(five, subtract(two_center, center(five))), colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), 5))))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects and Center:** Find the center of mass of the '2' objects and identify all objects with value '5'.
2. **Calculate Offset:**  For each '5' object, calculate the offset between its center and the target center.
3. **Shift and Combine:** Shift each '5' object by its calculated offset and combine them back onto the grid where the original '5' objects were removed.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  two_indices = toindices(merge(objects(I, True, False, True)))
  tx, ty = center(two_indices)
  return paint(cover(I, colorfilter(asobject(I), 5)), 
               frozenset((5, (i + tx - (uppermost(two_indices) + height(two_indices) // 2), j + ty - (leftmost(two_indices) + width(two_indices) // 2))) for i, j in toindices(colorfilter(asobject(I), 5))))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find Target Center:**  Calculate the center of mass of all '2' cells.
2. **Directly Calculate New Indices:**  For each '5' cell, calculate its new row and column indices directly based on the difference between its current position and the target center, considering the bounding box of the '2' objects.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  twos = merge(objects(I, True, False, True))
  fives = colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), 5)
  target = center(twos)
  
  def reposition(five):
    offset_x, offset_y = subtract(target, center(five))
    return shift(five, (offset_x, offset_y))

  return paint(cover(I, merge(fives)), merge(apply(reposition, fives)))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Locate Objects and Target:**  Identify all '2' objects and '5' objects, and find the center of mass of the combined '2' objects.
2. **Define Repositioning:**  Create a function that calculates the required shift for each '5' object based on the target location.
3. **Apply and Repaint:**  Apply this repositioning function to each '5' object and paint the shifted objects back onto a cleared grid.


Each of these program versions uses slightly different approaches and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same goal, demonstrating diverse coding solutions for the given transformation.
