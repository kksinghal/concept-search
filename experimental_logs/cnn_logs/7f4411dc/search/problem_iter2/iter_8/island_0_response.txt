## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves removing the bottom row of each non-background colored object. 

**Input_0:** The bottom row of the two 7-colored objects is removed.

**Input_1:** The bottom row of the two 6-colored objects is removed.

**Input_2:** The bottom row of the 5-colored object is removed.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
               merge(frozenset(obj - {(v, (lowermost(obj), j)) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)} 
                               for obj in partition(I) if color(obj) != mostcolor(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`partition(I)`:** Partitions the input grid `I` into distinct objects based on color.
2. **`... for obj in ... if color(obj) != mostcolor(I)`:** Iterates through each object, excluding the background color.
3. **`{(v, (lowermost(obj), j)) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)}`:** Creates a set containing the cells forming the bottom row of the object.
4. **`obj - ...`:**  Removes the bottom row from the object.
5. **`merge(frozenset(...))`:** Merges the modified objects into a single object.
6. **`paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), ...)`:** Paints the merged object onto a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input.

**Program Version 2:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)),
               merge(frozenset({(v, (i, j)) for (v, (i, j)) in obj if i != lowermost(obj)} 
                      for obj in partition(I) if color(obj) != mostcolor(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`partition(I)`:** Partitions the input grid `I` into distinct objects based on color.
2. **`... for obj in ... if color(obj) != mostcolor(I)`:**  Iterates through each object, excluding the background color.
3. **`{(v, (i, j)) for (v, (i, j)) in obj if i != lowermost(obj)}`:** Creates a set containing all cells of the object except those in the bottom row.
4. **`merge(frozenset(...))`:**  Merges the modified objects into a single object.
5. **`paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), ...)`:** Paints the merged object onto a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input.

**Program Version 3:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, mostcolor(I), 
               merge(frozenset({(lowermost(obj), j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)} 
                      for obj in objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Finds all non-background objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`... for obj in ...`:** Iterates through each object.
3. **`{(lowermost(obj), j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)}`:**  Creates a set containing indices of the bottom row of the object.
4. **`merge(frozenset(...))`:** Merges the bottom row indices of all objects into a single set.
5. **`paint(I, mostcolor(I), ...)`:**  Paints the background color over the specified indices in the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, 
                 fill(canvas(0, shape(I)), 1,
                      merge(frozenset({(i, j) for i, j in product({lowermost(obj)}, range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1))} 
                             for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)))),
                 mostcolor(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:**  Finds all non-background objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`... for obj in ...`:** Iterates through each object.
3. **`product({lowermost(obj)}, range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1))`:**  Generates all cell indices for the bottom row of the object.
4. **`merge(frozenset(...))`:**  Merges the bottom row indices of all objects into a single set.
5. **`fill(canvas(0, shape(I)), 1, ...)`:** Creates a mask grid with 1s at the bottom row indices.
6. **`cellwise(I, ..., mostcolor(I))`:**  Combines the input grid with the mask, using the background color where the mask has 1s.


**Program Version 5:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(cover(I, 
                    merge(frozenset({(lowermost(obj), j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)} 
                          for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)))), 
               mostcolor(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Finds all non-background objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`... for obj in ...`:**  Iterates through each object.
3. **`{(lowermost(obj), j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)}`:**  Creates a set containing indices of the bottom row of the object.
4. **`merge(frozenset(...))`:** Merges the bottom row indices of all objects into a single set.
5. **`cover(I, ...)`:** Replaces cells at the specified indices with the background color.
6. **`paint(..., mostcolor(I))`:**  Paints the resulting grid with the background color, effectively removing the bottom rows.


These programs offer diverse approaches to solve the given transformation while utilizing only the functions provided in the DSL. Each version demonstrates a unique combination of functions and logic, showcasing different ways to manipulate and modify the input grid to achieve the desired output.
