## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all given input-output pairs aims to **remove the bottom row of every connected component** in the input grid. Single-cell components remain unchanged.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**  The bottom rows of the two '7'-colored objects are removed.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  The bottom rows of all '6'-colored objects are removed.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The bottom row of the '5'-colored object is removed.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Extract connected components
  def trim_bottom_row(obj):
    if size(obj) > 1: # Check if object has more than one cell
      return toobject(sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda idx: idx[0] != lowermost(obj)), I)
    else:
      return obj # Keep single-cell objects unchanged
  trimmed_objs = mfilter(objs, trim_bottom_row)  # Apply trimming to objects
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(trimmed_objs))  # Paint trimmed objects
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract components:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` extracts all connected components from the input grid `I`.
2. **Trim bottom row:** `trim_bottom_row(obj)` function checks if an object has more than one cell. If so, it filters the object's indices to remove those belonging to the bottom row and reconstructs the object. Single-cell objects are returned as is.
3. **Apply trimming:** `mfilter(objs, trim_bottom_row)` applies `trim_bottom_row` to each object and merges the results.
4. **Paint to canvas:** `paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(trimmed_objs))` creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input, paints the trimmed objects onto it, and returns the result.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  def trim_bottom(obj):
    bottom_row_y = lowermost(obj)  # Find y-coordinate of bottom row
    return toobject(sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda idx: idx[0] < bottom_row_y), I)
  trimmed_objs = mfilter(objs, trim_bottom)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(trimmed_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract components:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Trim bottom row:** This version calculates the y-coordinate of the bottom row and then filters indices based on being strictly less than this y-coordinate.
3. **Apply trimming and paint:** Same as Version 1.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  def not_bottom_row(idx):
    return idx[0] != lowermost(objs) # Check if index is NOT on the bottom row
  trimmed_objs = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: toobject(sfilter(toindices(obj), not_bottom_row), I))
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(trimmed_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract components:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Trim bottom row:** This version defines a helper function `not_bottom_row` to check if an index is NOT on the bottom row and uses it within the `sfilter` call.
3. **Apply trimming and paint:** Same as Version 1.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def trim_obj(obj):
    height = shape(obj)[0] # Calculate the height of the object
    return toobject(sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda idx: idx[0] < height - 1), I)
  trimmed_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), trim_obj)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(trimmed_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Trim object:** `trim_obj(obj)` calculates the height of the object and filters its indices to exclude those on the last row (height - 1).
2. **Extract, apply, and paint:**  The code directly applies `trim_obj` during object extraction and then paints the result as before. 

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  def trim_from_bottom(obj):
    return toobject(toindices(obj) -  {
        (lowermost(obj), j) for j in range(width(obj))
    }, I)
  trimmed_objs = mfilter(objs, trim_from_bottom)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(trimmed_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract components:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Trim from bottom:** This version directly calculates the indices of the bottom row using `lowermost` and `width` and then removes them from the object's indices before reconstructing it.
3. **Apply trimming and paint:** Same as Version 1.
