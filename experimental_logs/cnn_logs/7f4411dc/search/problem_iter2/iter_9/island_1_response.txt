## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids aims to **remove the bottom row of each connected object** while preserving the rest of the grid. 

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** The bottom row of each group of connected 7s is removed. 

**Input_1 -> Output_1:** The bottom row of each group of connected 6s is removed.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:** The bottom row of the single connected object of 5s is removed. 


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def trim_bottom(obj):
    h = height(obj)
    return frozenset({(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if i < h - 1})
  return paint(I, merge(apply(trim_bottom, objects(I, True, True, False))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, True, False)`:** This function identifies all connected objects in the input grid `I`. 
2. **`apply(trim_bottom, ...)`:**  The `trim_bottom` function is applied to each object.
3. **`trim_bottom(obj)`:** This function calculates the height `h` of the object. It then iterates through all cells `(v, (i, j))` of the object and keeps only the cells where the row index `i` is smaller than `h-1` (effectively removing the bottom row). The result is converted back to a frozenset to be used with other DSL functions.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the transformed objects back into a single object.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged object onto the original input grid `I`, resulting in the final output grid.


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def bottom_indices(obj):
    return frozenset((i,j) for i,j in toindices(obj) if i == lowermost(obj))
  return cover(I, merge(apply(bottom_indices, objects(I, True, True, False))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, True, False)`:**  Identifies all connected objects in the grid.
2. **`apply(bottom_indices, ...)`:** Applies the `bottom_indices` function to each object.
3. **`bottom_indices(obj)`:** This function identifies the indices of the bottom row of each object by comparing the row index `i` with the `lowermost` row index of the object. It returns a frozenset of these indices.
4. **`merge(...)`:**  Merges the bottom row indices of all objects.
5. **`cover(I, ...)`:**  The `cover` function sets the color of the cells at the merged indices to the background color, effectively removing the bottom rows of all objects. 


### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def shift_up_one_row(obj):
    return shift(obj, (-1, 0))
  def remove_overlapping(obj):
    return toobject(toindices(obj) - toindices(shift_up_one_row(obj)), I)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(remove_overlapping, objects(I, True, True, False))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, True, False)`:** Identifies all connected objects.
2. **`apply(remove_overlapping, ...)`:**  Applies `remove_overlapping` to each object.
3. **`remove_overlapping(obj)`:** 
   -  `shift_up_one_row(obj)`:  Shifts the object one row upwards.
   -  `toindices(...) - toindices(...)`: Calculates the difference between the original object's indices and the shifted object's indices. This effectively identifies the bottom row of the original object.
   -  `toobject(..., I)`: Converts the resulting indices back into an object using the original grid's colors.
4. **`merge(...)`:**  Merges the transformed objects.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged object onto the original grid.


### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def bottom_row_filter(obj):
    return size(obj) > width(obj)
  return paint(I, merge(sfilter(objects(I, True, True, False), bottom_row_filter)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, True, False)`:**  Identifies all connected objects in the grid.
2. **`sfilter(..., bottom_row_filter)`:**  Filters the objects using the `bottom_row_filter` function.
3. **`bottom_row_filter(obj)`:**  This function checks if the object's size is greater than its width. This is true for any object that has more than one row, meaning it has a distinct bottom row to remove.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the filtered objects, which now exclude objects consisting of only a single row.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged object onto the original grid.


### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def remove_bottom_if_exists(obj):
    return toobject(crop(subgrid(obj, I), (0, 0), (max(height(obj) - 1, 1), width(obj))), I)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(remove_bottom_if_exists, objects(I, True, True, False))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, True, False)`:** Identifies all connected objects.
2. **`apply(remove_bottom_if_exists, ...)`:** Applies `remove_bottom_if_exists` to each object.
3. **`remove_bottom_if_exists(obj)`:**
   - `subgrid(obj, I)`: Extracts the smallest subgrid containing the object.
   - `crop(..., (0, 0), (max(height(obj) - 1, 1), width(obj)))`: Crops the subgrid to remove the bottom row. The `max(height(obj) - 1, 1)` ensures that at least one row remains even if the object is only one row high.
   - `toobject(..., I)`: Converts the cropped subgrid back into an object with the original grid's colors.
4. **`merge(...)`:**  Merges the transformed objects.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the merged object onto the original grid. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same goal. Each utilizes different DSL functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility and versatility of the provided DSL for solving spatial reasoning problems.
