## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation keeps the grid the same. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:** The transformation removes the bottom row of the input grid if it contains only 0s.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The transformation removes the last row of the input grid if it contains only 0s.


## Program Version 1

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return I[:-1] if all(v == 0 for v in I[-1]) else I
```

**Explanation:**

* This program first checks if all elements in the last row of the input grid `I` are 0 using `all(v == 0 for v in I[-1])`.
* If true, it returns a new grid excluding the last row using `I[:-1]`.
* Otherwise, it returns the original input grid `I`.
* This logic successfully performs the transformation for all three input-output pairs.

## Program Version 2

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return I[:len(I)-1] if set(I[-1]) == {0} else I
```

**Explanation:**

* This version uses `set(I[-1]) == {0}` to check if the last row contains only 0s.
* It then uses slicing similar to version 1 to return the appropriate grid.

## Program Version 3

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    last_row = I[-1]
    if len(set(last_row)) == 1 and last_row[0] == 0:
        return I[:-1]
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

* This version explicitly extracts the last row into `last_row`.
* It then checks if the set of unique elements in `last_row` has a length of 1 and if the first element is 0. 
* Depending on the condition, it returns the original grid or a grid without the last row.

## Program Version 4

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return (I[:-1], I)[sum(I[-1]) > 0]
```

**Explanation:**

* This version calculates the sum of the last row using `sum(I[-1])`. 
* It uses this sum as an index into a tuple containing the grid without the last row and the original grid. 
* If the sum is 0 (meaning all elements are 0), it picks the grid without the last row; otherwise, it picks the original grid.

## Program Version 5

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return branch(
    any(v != 0 for v in I[-1]),  
    I,
    I[:-1] 
  )
```

**Explanation:**

* This version uses the `branch` function for a more expressive approach. 
* It checks if any element in the last row is not 0 using `any(v != 0 for v in I[-1])`.
* Based on this condition, it uses `branch` to select and return either the original grid or the grid without the last row.

All five versions achieve the desired transformation for each input-output pair, showcasing diverse logic and function combinations within the DSL.
