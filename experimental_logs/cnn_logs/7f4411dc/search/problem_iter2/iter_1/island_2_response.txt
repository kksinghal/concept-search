## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 - Output 0:** The transformation removes any object that touches the edge of the grid, effectively keeping only the objects fully contained within the grid borders.

**Input 1 - Output 1:** Similar to the previous transformation, this one also removes objects touching the grid edges. However, it additionally eliminates any isolated cells (single cells not connected to any other cell of the same color). 

**Input 2 - Output 2:** This transformation appears to remove the bottom row of any object touching the bottom edge of the grid.

## Program to be Generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
               merge(sfilter(
                   sfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), 
                           lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I)),
                   lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`**: Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid (`I`), filled with the most frequent color in the input.
2. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`**: Extracts all objects from the input grid. The parameters specify univalued objects, no diagonal connections, and exclusion of the background.
3. **`sfilter(..., lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I))`**: Filters the objects, keeping only those that don't touch the grid borders.
4. **`sfilter(..., lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)`**: Further filters the objects, keeping only those with more than one cell.
5. **`merge(...)`**: Combines all remaining objects into a single object.
6. **`paint(...)`**: Paints the combined object onto the blank canvas, resulting in the desired output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  return paint(I, 
               merge(sfilter(objects(trim(I), True, False, True), 
                           lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`trim(I)`**: Removes the outer border of the input grid.
2. **`objects(trim(I), True, False, True)`**:  Extracts all objects from the trimmed grid. 
3. **`sfilter(..., lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)`**: Filters the objects, keeping only those with more than one cell.
4. **`merge(...)`**: Combines all remaining objects into a single object.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`**: Paints the combined object onto the original input grid, effectively removing objects touching the borders and isolated cells. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  return cover(I, 
              merge(sfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 
                           lambda obj: bordering(obj, I) and size(obj) == 1))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, False)`**: Extracts all single-color objects from the grid (including isolated cells).
2. **`sfilter(..., lambda obj: bordering(obj, I) and size(obj) == 1)`**: Filters for objects that are both touching the grid border and have a size of 1 (isolated cells on the border).
3. **`merge(...)`**: Combines all the isolated cells on the border into a single object.
4. **`cover(I, ...)`**:  Covers the combined object (isolated cells on the border) with the background color of the input grid. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  return paint(cover(I, merge(objects(I, True, False, True))), 
               merge(sfilter(objects(trim(I), True, False, True), 
                           lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version combines elements from Program_V2 and Program_V3.
2. It first removes all objects touching the border using the logic of Program_V2. 
3. Then, it removes isolated cells using the logic of Program_V3.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  return vconcat(
      tophalf(I),
      hconcat(
          lefthalf(bottomhalf(I)),
          hconcat(
              trim(righthalf(bottomhalf(I))),
              lefthalf(bottomhalf(I))
          )
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version uses a different approach by splitting the grid and rearranging its parts.
2. It keeps the top half intact.
3. For the bottom half, it trims the right half, effectively removing the bottom row of objects touching the bottom edge.
4. Then, it rearranges the pieces to create the final output. 


Each of these program versions offers a unique approach to achieving the desired transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and diverse capabilities of the provided DSL.
