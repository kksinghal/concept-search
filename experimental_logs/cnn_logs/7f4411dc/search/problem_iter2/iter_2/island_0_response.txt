## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids seems to **remove the bottom row of each distinct object** while preserving its original color.

**Input 0:** 
- Two 7-colored objects exist. 
- The bottom row of each 7-colored object is removed.

**Input 1:**
- Three 6-colored objects exist.
- The bottom row of each 6-colored object is removed.

**Input 2:**
- One 5-colored object exists.
- The bottom row of the 5-colored object is removed.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Identify all objects in the input grid
  new_objs = frozenset({frozenset({(v, (i,j)) for v, (i,j) in obj if i != lowermost(obj)}) for obj in objs}) # Remove the bottom row from each object
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), toobject(merge(new_objs), I)) # Paint the modified objects onto a blank canvas
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` finds all distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Remove bottom row:**  For every object, a new object is created without its bottom row using `lowermost(obj)` to determine the row to be removed.
3. **Paint modified objects:** The modified objects are merged and painted onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = partition(I)  # Partition the grid into objects based on color
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge({frozenset({(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if i < lowermost(obj)}) for obj in objs})) # Remove the bottom row of each object and paint
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition:** `partition(I)` divides the grid into objects based on color.
2. **Remove bottom row and paint:** For each object, the bottom row is removed, and the remaining cells are directly painted onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge({frozenset({(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if (i, j) not in {(x, y) for x, y in toindices(obj) if x == lowermost(obj)}}) for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)})) # Remove bottom row by checking for lowermost index and paint
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` finds all objects in the grid.
2. **Remove bottom row and paint:** The bottom row of each object is identified using `lowermost(obj)` and removed during the painting process.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda obj: frozenset({(v, (i,j)) for v, (i,j) in obj if i != lowermost(obj)}), objects(I, T, F, T)))) # Apply bottom row removal to each object and paint
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` finds all distinct objects.
2. **Apply removal and paint:**  `apply` function applies the bottom row removal logic to each object and then paints the result on a blank canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def remove_bottom(obj):
    return frozenset({(v, (i,j)) for v, (i,j) in obj if i != lowermost(obj)})
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), toobject(merge(apply(remove_bottom, objects(I, T, F, T))), I))  # Define separate function for bottom row removal and apply
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define removal function:**  A separate function `remove_bottom` encapsulates the logic for removing the bottom row from an object.
2. **Apply and paint:** The `remove_bottom` function is applied to each identified object, and the result is painted onto a blank canvas.


Each version uses a slightly different approach to achieve the desired outcome while utilizing the DSL functions effectively.
