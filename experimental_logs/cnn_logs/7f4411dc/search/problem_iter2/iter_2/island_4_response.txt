## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation removes the bottom row of the input grid.

**Input 0:** The last row of "7"s is removed.
**Input 1:** The last row of "0"s is removed.
**Input 2:** The last row of "0"s is removed.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return I[:-1]
```

**Explanation:**

This program directly slices the input grid `I` and returns everything except the last row. This is achieved using `[:-1]` which excludes the last element of a sequence. 


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  return crop(I,(0,0),(h-1,width(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

This program utilizes DSL functions to achieve the transformation:
* `height(I)`: Calculates the height of the input grid.
* `width(I)`: Calculates the width of the input grid.
* `crop(I, (0, 0), (h - 1, width(I)))`: Extracts a subgrid from the input grid. It starts at the top-left corner `(0, 0)` and has dimensions of `(height - 1, width)`, effectively removing the bottom row.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return vsplit(I,2)[0]
```

**Explanation:**

This program leverages the `vsplit` function to split the grid and select the desired part:
* `vsplit(I, 2)`: Splits the input grid `I` vertically into two equal parts (or as close to equal as possible).
* `[0]`: Selects the first part, which represents the top half of the grid, effectively removing the bottom row.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tophalf(I)
```

**Explanation:**

This program uses the DSL function `tophalf` to directly obtain the top portion of the grid:
* `tophalf(I)`: Returns the upper half of the input grid `I`. Since we want to remove only one row, this function may not always provide the exact desired output if the input grid has an odd number of rows.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return I[:len(I)-1]
```

**Explanation:**

This program utilizes list slicing to achieve the transformation:
* `len(I)`: Determines the number of rows in the input grid.
* `I[:len(I)-1]`:  Slices the input grid `I` from the beginning up to, but not including, the last row. This effectively removes the bottom row.
