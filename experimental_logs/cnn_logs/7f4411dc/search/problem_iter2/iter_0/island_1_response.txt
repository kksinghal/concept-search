## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation removes the bottom row of non-background cells from each connected object.

**Input_0:** The bottom row of 7s is removed from both objects.

**Input_1:** The bottom row of 6s is removed from both objects.

**Input_2:** The bottom row of 5s is removed from the object.

## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, True, False)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if i != lowermost(obj)), objs))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, True, False)` identifies all connected components (objects) in the grid `I`.
2. **Remove Bottom Row:**  For each `obj`, a new object is created using `frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if i != lowermost(obj))`, keeping only cells where the row index `i` is not the same as the bottom row index (`lowermost(obj)`).
3. **Merge and Paint:** The modified objects are merged back together (`merge`) and then painted (`paint`) onto the original grid `I`, effectively removing the bottom rows from each object.


**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (-1, 0)) if lowermost(obj) == len(I) - 1 else obj, objects(I, True, True, False))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1, we first identify all objects using `objects(I, True, True, False)`.
2. **Conditional Shift:** For each object, we check if its bottom row is the same as the grid's bottom row (`lowermost(obj) == len(I) - 1`). If so, we shift the entire object upwards by one row using `shift(obj, (-1, 0))`. Otherwise, the object is kept unchanged.
3. **Merge and Paint:** The potentially shifted objects are then merged and painted onto the original grid.


**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(mostcolor(I), toindices(obj) & {(i, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if i == lowermost(obj)}), objects(I, True, True, False))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Objects are identified as before.
2. **Recolor Bottom Row:** For each object, we identify the indices of its bottom row (`(i, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if i == lowermost(obj)`). We find the intersection of this set with the object's indices and then recolor these cells to the background color using `recolor(mostcolor(I), ...)`
3. **Merge and Paint:** The recoloured objects are merged and painted onto the grid.


**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, True, False)
  return paint(cover(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: toindices(obj) & {(i, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if i == lowermost(obj)}, objs))), merge(objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Objects are identified.
2. **Extract Bottom Row Indices:** For each object, the indices of its bottom row are identified.
3. **Cover Bottom Rows:** The `cover` function is used to "erase" the bottom rows of all objects by replacing them with the background color.
4. **Paint Original Objects:** The original objects are then painted back onto the modified grid, effectively leaving only the non-bottom row cells.


**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj:  frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if (i, j) not in {(k, l) for k, l in toindices(obj) if k == lowermost(obj)}), objects(I, True, True, False)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Objects are identified using `objects(I, True, True, False)`.
2. **Filter Out Bottom Row:** For each `obj`, a new object is created using `frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if (i, j) not in {(k, l) for k, l in toindices(obj) if k == lowermost(obj)})`. This line identifies the indices of the bottom row cells (`(k, l) for k, l in toindices(obj) if k == lowermost(obj)`) and then keeps only the cells in `obj` whose indices are not in the bottom row.
3. **Merge and Paint:** The filtered objects are then merged back together (`merge`) and painted (`paint`) onto the original grid `I`. This effectively removes the bottom rows from each object.
