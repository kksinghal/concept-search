## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation removes all objects that touch the border of the grid.

**Input 0:** The objects formed by '7's at the top, bottom, and right edges are removed.

**Input 1:** The objects formed by '6's at the bottom and right edges are removed.

**Input 2:** Part of the object formed by '5's at the left and right edges is removed, resulting in a smaller object that no longer touches the border.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(sfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:**  Identifies all connected objects within the input grid `I`. `True` indicates objects are univalued (all cells have the same value), `False` disables diagonal connections, and `True` excludes the background color.
2. **`sfilter(..., lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I))`:** Filters the objects, keeping only those that do not touch any border of the grid using `bordering(obj, I)`.
3. **`merge(...)`:** Combines the remaining objects into a single object.
4. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid `I` and filled with the background color.
5. **`paint(..., ...)`:**  Paints the merged object onto the blank canvas, resulting in the final output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  return paint(I, merge(frozenset(obj for obj in objs if not any(index(I, cell) is None for cell in outbox(obj)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Identifies all connected objects, excluding the background.
2. **`outbox(obj)`:**  For each object, generates indices surrounding its bounding box.
3. **`index(I, cell) is None`:**  Checks if any surrounding index falls outside the grid boundaries.
4. **`any(...)`:**  Returns `True` if any surrounding index is out of bounds, meaning the object touches the grid border.
5. **`frozenset(...)`:** Filters the objects, keeping only those fully within the grid.
6. **`paint(I, merge(...))`:** Paints the merged, non-bordering objects back onto the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(sfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: all((0 < i < len(I) - 1) and (0 < j < len(I[0]) - 1) for i, j in toindices(obj)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Extracts all foreground objects from the grid.
2. **`toindices(obj)`:** Converts each object into a set of its cell indices.
3. **`(0 < i < len(I) - 1) and (0 < j < len(I[0]) - 1)`:**  Checks if the cell index `(i, j)` is strictly within the grid boundaries, excluding the border rows and columns.
4. **`all(...)`:** Ensures all cell indices of an object satisfy the boundary condition.
5. **`sfilter(...)`:** Filters the objects, keeping only those whose cells are entirely within the grid.
6. **`paint(...)`:**  Paints the merged set of non-bordering objects onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(sfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: all(0 <= index(I, (i + di, j + dj)) is not None for i, j in toindices(obj) for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)])))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(...)`:**  Identifies all connected foreground objects in the grid.
2. **`toindices(obj)`:** Converts each object into its constituent cell indices.
3. **`for di, dj in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]`:**  Iterates through the four cardinal directions: right, down, left, up.
4. **`(i + di, j + dj)`:** Calculates the neighboring cell index in each direction.
5. **`index(I, ...)`:** Retrieves the value at the neighboring cell index. 
6. **`0 <= ... is not None`:** Checks if the neighboring cell is within the grid boundaries and has a valid value.
7. **`all(...)`:**  Ensures all neighboring cells around all object cells are valid, indicating the object doesn't touch the border.
8. **`sfilter(...)`:** Retains only those objects fully contained within the grid.
9. **`paint(I, merge(...))`:** Paints the merged set of non-bordering objects back onto the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge({obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if all(0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0]) for i, j in delta(toindices(obj)))}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Identifies connected foreground objects in the input grid.
2. **`toindices(obj)`:** Converts each object into a set of its cell indices.
3. **`delta(toindices(obj))`:** Finds the indices surrounding the object's bounding box, excluding the object itself. 
4. **`0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0])`:** Checks if each surrounding index is within the grid boundaries.
5. **`all(...)`:**  Ensures all surrounding indices are within the grid, indicating the object doesn't touch the border.
6. **`{...}`:** Filters objects, retaining only those fully contained within the grid.
7. **`paint(..., merge(...))`:**  Paints the merged set of non-bordering objects onto a blank canvas.

Each program version implements the same logic of identifying and removing objects touching the grid border. However, they employ different DSL functions and approaches to achieve this, demonstrating diverse solutions within the constraints of the provided DSL.
