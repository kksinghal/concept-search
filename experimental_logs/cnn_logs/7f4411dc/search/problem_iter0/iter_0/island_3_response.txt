## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to **remove any isolated digits from the input grid, retaining only the connected components**.  A connected component is defined as a group of digits of the same value connected horizontally or vertically.

Let's illustrate with examples:

* **Input 0:** The top-left '7' and the bottom '7' are isolated. The output removes them, preserving only the large connected component of '7's.
* **Input 1:**  Similar to Input 0, only the connected '6's remain in the output.
* **Input 2:** Only the '5' at position (1,6) is isolated and gets removed.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Extract all connected components
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1) #Filter for components larger than one cell
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(filtered_objs)) # Paint the filtered components onto a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:**  Extracts all connected components (objects) from the input grid (`I`). The parameters `(T, F, F)` indicate univalued objects (`T`), no diagonal connections (`F`), and including background (`F`).
2. **`sfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)`:** Filters the extracted objects, keeping only those with a size greater than 1 (meaning they have more than one cell and are therefore connected).
3. **`paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(filtered_objs))`:** Creates a blank canvas (`canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`) of the same size as the input and paints the filtered objects onto it using `merge` to combine them.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  connected = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: any(index(I, n) == index(I, loc) for n in dneighbors(loc)))
  O = fill(I, ZERO, difference(asindices(I), connected))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asindices(I)`:**  Gets the indices of all cells in the grid.
2. **`lambda loc: any(index(I, n) == index(I, loc) for n in dneighbors(loc))`:** This lambda function checks if a given location `loc` has any direct neighbor with the same value.
3. **`mfilter(asindices(I), ...)`:** Applies the lambda function to all indices, keeping only those that are connected to a neighbor with the same value.
4. **`difference(asindices(I), connected)`:**  Finds the indices that are not connected.
5. **`fill(I, ZERO, ...)`:** Fills the grid `I` with zeros at the indices of disconnected cells.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`:** Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):`**: Iterates over all connected components in the input.
3. **`if size(obj) > 1:`**: Checks if the component has more than one cell.
4. **`O = paint(O, obj)`**:  Paints the connected component onto the canvas if it's larger than one cell.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  is_isolated = lambda loc: all(index(I, loc) != index(I, n) or n == loc for n in dneighbors(loc) | ineighbors(loc))
  isolated_indices = sfilter(asindices(I), is_isolated)
  O = fill(I, ZERO, isolated_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_isolated` lambda function:** Checks if a location has any neighbor (including diagonals) with the same value. If not, it's considered isolated.
2. **`sfilter(asindices(I), is_isolated)`:** Applies the `is_isolated` function to all cell indices, filtering out those that are isolated.
3. **`fill(I, ZERO, isolated_indices)`:** Fills the input grid with zeros at the isolated cell indices.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
    O = I 
    for obj in objs:
      if size(obj) == 1:
        O = cover(O, obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`**: Extracts all connected components from the grid.
2. **`for obj in objs:`**: Iterates through the extracted objects.
3. **`if size(obj) == 1`**: If the object consists of a single cell (isolated).
4. **`O = cover(O, obj)`**:  Cover the isolated object with the background color.

These five programs demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each program leverages different functions and logic, showcasing the diverse ways to manipulate grid data within this DSL.
