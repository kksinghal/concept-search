## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** All '7' objects are moved upwards until they hit either the top border of the grid or another '7' object.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:** Similar to the previous transformation, all '6' objects are moved upwards until they encounter the top border of the grid or another '6' object.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:** Again, all '5' objects are moved upwards until they reach either the top border of the grid or encounter another '5' object.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  shifted_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    uppermost_row = uppermost(obj)
    while uppermost_row > 0 and index(I, (uppermost_row - 1, leftmost(obj))) == mostcolor(I):
      obj = shift(obj, (-1, 0))
      uppermost_row -= 1
    shifted_objs = shifted_objs.union({obj})
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), shifted_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extract all connected objects from the input grid 'I', excluding the background, using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Iterate & Shift:** Loop through each extracted object 'obj'. For each object:
   - Determine the row index of its uppermost cell using `uppermost(obj)`.
   - While the uppermost row is not the first row (index 0) and the cell directly above the object's leftmost cell is the background color (`mostcolor(I)`), shift the object one row upwards using `shift(obj, (-1, 0))`.
   - Add the shifted object to a new set 'shifted_objs'.
3. **Paint Shifted Objects:** Create a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid filled with the background color using `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`. Paint all shifted objects onto this canvas using `paint`. 


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)):
    column = frozenset((I[i][j], (i, j)) for i in range(height(I)) if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I))
    shifted_column = shift(column, (-uppermost(column), 0))
    O = paint(O, shifted_column)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Create a blank canvas 'O' of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color, using `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`.
2. **Iterate Columns:** Loop through each column index 'j' of the input grid.
3. **Process Column:** For each column:
   - Extract the column as an object, excluding background cells, using a list comprehension and converting it to a frozenset.
   - Determine the uppermost row of this column object using `uppermost(column)`.
   - Shift the column object upwards by the calculated offset using `shift(column, (-uppermost(column), 0))`.
   - Paint the shifted column object onto the canvas 'O' using `paint(O, shifted_column)`.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    offset = (0,0)
    for i in range(1, height(I)):
      if uppermost(obj) - i >= 0 and index(I, (uppermost(obj) - i, leftmost(obj))) == mostcolor(I):
        offset = (-i, 0)
      else:
        break
    O = paint(cover(O, obj), shift(obj, offset))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Objects:** Loop through each object (excluding background) in the input grid 'I', obtained using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Calculate Offset:** For each object 'obj':
   - Iterate through potential upward shifts, starting from 1 row up to the top of the grid.
   - If the shifted position is within the grid bounds and corresponds to a background cell, update the 'offset' tuple.
   - If an obstruction (non-background cell) is encountered, stop calculating the offset.
3. **Shift and Paint:** Cover the original object in the grid 'O' using `cover(O, obj)`, then paint the shifted version of the object using `paint(O, shift(obj, offset))`.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)-1,-1,-1):
    row_objs = objects(crop(I, (i, 0), (1, width(I))), T, F, T)
    for obj in row_objs:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj) + i, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** Initialize an empty canvas 'O' with the background color and the same shape as the input 'I'.
2. **Iterate Rows (Bottom-Up):** Loop through each row index 'i' of the input grid 'I' in reverse order (starting from the bottom row).
3. **Extract Row Objects:** For each row:
   - Extract objects present in that row using `objects(crop(I, (i, 0), (1, width(I))), T, F, T)`. This essentially isolates objects row by row.
4. **Shift and Paint:** For each extracted object 'obj' in the row:
   - Calculate the upward shift required to move the object to the top of the canvas. This is done by subtracting the object's `uppermost` row index from the current row index 'i'.
   - Shift the object using `shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj) + i, 0))`.
   - Paint the shifted object onto the canvas 'O' using `paint(O, shifted_object)`. 


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, T, F, T), key=lambda obj: uppermost(obj))
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), objs[0])
  for i in range(1, len(objs)):
    O = paint(O, shift(objs[i], (-uppermost(objs[i]) + uppermost(objs[i-1]) + 1, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Sort Objects:** Extract all connected objects from the input 'I' (excluding background) using `objects(I, T, F, T)`. Sort these objects based on their uppermost row index using `sorted(objects(...), key=lambda obj: uppermost(obj))`.
2. **Paint First Object:** Create a blank canvas 'O' with the background color and same size as 'I'. Paint the first object (which has the lowest uppermost row index) onto this canvas.
3. **Iterate and Position Remaining Objects:** Loop through the remaining sorted objects:
   - Calculate the vertical shift required to position the current object just above the previously painted object. 
   - Shift the current object using `shift(objs[i], (-uppermost(objs[i]) + uppermost(objs[i-1]) + 1, 0))`.
   - Paint the shifted object onto the canvas 'O'. 

Each of these five code versions provides a distinct approach to achieve the desired transformation, leveraging different DSL functions and logic.
