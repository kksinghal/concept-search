## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:** All the objects remain in the same position, but they are compressed vertically to a single row, effectively removing all empty rows within each object. 

**Input 1 -> Output 1:**  Similar to the previous transformation, objects are compressed vertically, removing internal empty rows. However, the objects are also shifted upwards so that they touch the top of the grid.

**Input 2 -> Output 2:** This transformation also involves vertical compression of objects, removing internal empty rows and shifting them to the top of the grid.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" inspired by the provided code snippets and aimed at achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Extract objects
  grid = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  # Create empty grid
  current_i = 0  # Track the next available row
  for obj in objs:
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj) + current_i, 0)) # Shift object to the top
    grid = paint(grid, shifted_obj) # Paint the object
    current_i += height(compress(subgrid(obj, I)))  # Update the next available row based on object height without internal empty rows
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. Extract objects from the input grid.
2. Create an empty grid with the same dimensions as the input.
3. Iterate over each object:
    - Calculate the object's height without internal empty rows.
    - Shift the object upwards to the current available row.
    - Paint the shifted object onto the new grid.
    - Update the next available row.
4. Return the transformed grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    grid = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objs:
        compressed_obj = {(v, (i - uppermost(obj), j)) for v, (i, j) in obj}  # Compress object vertically
        grid = paint(grid, shift(compressed_obj, (uppermost(obj), 0))) # Shift to original vertical position and paint
    return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. Extract objects from the input grid.
2. Create an empty grid with the same dimensions as the input.
3. Iterate over each object:
    - Compress the object vertically by shifting all its cells to the top.
    - Shift the compressed object back to its original vertical position.
    - Paint the shifted and compressed object onto the new grid.
4. Return the transformed grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  grid = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1):
      column = {(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, _) in obj if _ == j} # Extract a column from the object
      compressed_column = shift(column, (-uppermost(column), 0))  # Compress the column vertically
      grid = paint(grid, compressed_column)  # Paint the compressed column onto the grid
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. Extract objects from the input grid.
2. Create an empty grid with the same dimensions as the input.
3. Iterate over each object:
    - Iterate over each column of the object.
    - Extract the column from the object.
    - Compress the column vertically by shifting its cells upwards.
    - Paint the compressed column onto the new grid.
4. Return the transformed grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    grid = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if (val, (i, j)) in merge(objs):  # Check if the cell belongs to an object
                grid = paint(grid, {(val, (i - uppermost(extract(objs, lambda obj: (val, (i, j)) in obj)), j))}) # Shift cell to top of its object
    return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. Extract objects from the input grid.
2. Create an empty grid with the same dimensions as the input.
3. Iterate over each cell in the input grid:
    - Check if the cell belongs to any of the extracted objects.
    - If so, find the object the cell belongs to.
    - Calculate the cell's vertical offset within the object.
    - Paint the cell at its new position in the output grid.
4. Return the transformed grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    compressed_objs = {frozenset({(v, (i - uppermost(obj), j)) for v, (i, j) in obj}) for obj in objs} # Pre-compress all objects
    grid = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))
    current_i = 0
    for obj in compressed_objs:
        grid = paint(grid, shift(obj, (current_i, 0)))  # Shift and paint compressed objects
        current_i += height(obj)
    return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. Extract objects from the input grid.
2. Pre-compress all objects vertically by shifting their cells to the top.
3. Create an empty grid with the same dimensions as the input.
4. Iterate over each pre-compressed object:
    - Shift the object downwards to the current available row.
    - Paint the object onto the new grid.
    - Update the next available row.
5. Return the transformed grid.

These are just a few examples of how the "Program_to_be_generated" could be implemented to achieve the desired transformation. There are many other possibilities, depending on how you choose to combine the functions provided in the DSL. The key is to carefully analyze the input and output grids and identify the specific steps involved in the transformation. Once you have a good understanding of the logic, you can start writing code to implement it.
