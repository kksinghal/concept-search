## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation removes any digit that is on the bottom or right edge of the input grid. Essentially, it's "trimming" the rightmost column and bottommost row.

**Input_0:** The rightmost column and bottommost row of 7s are removed.

**Input_1:**  The rightmost column and bottommost row containing 6s are removed.

**Input_2:** The rightmost column and bottommost row containing 5s are removed.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return trim(I)  # Removes the rightmost column and bottommost row
```

**Explanation:** This version leverages the `trim` function directly. Since the `trim` function already implements the desired transformation, this single line achieves the goal.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I) - 1  # Calculate the row index of the bottom row
  w = width(I) - 1  # Calculate the column index of the rightmost column
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w)),  # Create a canvas sized one row and one column smaller
            crop(I, (0, 0), (h, w)))  # Crop the input to fit the canvas, removing the rightmost column and bottommost row 
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version manually achieves the trimming by creating a smaller canvas and cropping the input to fit. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, False, False, False) # Extract all objects from the grid
    trimmed_objs = frozenset(sfilter(objs, lambda obj: rightmost(obj) < width(I) - 1 and lowermost(obj) < height(I) - 1)) # Filter out objects touching the right or bottom edge
    O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), trimmed_objs) # Paint the remaining objects onto a blank canvas
    return O
```

**Explanation:** This version extracts all objects from the grid, then filters out any object that touches the right or bottom edge. The remaining objects are then painted onto a new canvas of the same size as the input.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  indices = difference(asindices(I), frozenset((h-1, j) for j in range(w)) | frozenset((i, w-1) for i in range(h))) # Create a set of indices excluding the rightmost column and bottommost row
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), toobject(indices, I)) # Paint the object represented by the remaining indices onto a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version creates a set of indices that represent all cells *except* those in the rightmost column and bottommost row. It then uses this set of indices to create an object and paints it onto a new canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return crop(I, (0,0), (height(I)-1, width(I)-1)) # Crop the input, excluding the last row and column
```

**Explanation:** This version uses the `crop` function to directly remove the last row and column by specifying the dimensions of the output grid to be one less than the input grid in both height and width.
