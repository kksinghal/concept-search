## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied in all the examples appears to be **"Remove all single-color rows and columns"**. Let's break down how this applies to each example:

**Input 0:** Many rows and columns contain only '0's. The transformation removes these, leaving only the '7' shape intact at the top.

**Input 1:** Similar to Input 0, numerous single-color rows and columns are eliminated. The remaining '6' shape clusters at the bottom center.

**Input 2:** This example is smaller but follows the same pattern. Single-color rows and columns are removed, leaving a more compact '5' shape.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return compress(I)  # Directly use the compress function
```

**Explanation:** 
This version utilizes the `compress` function, which is specifically designed to remove single-color rows and columns. This provides a concise solution by directly applying the function without needing intermediate steps.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I) 
  w = width(I)
  tr = T
  tc = T
  while tr or tc:
    tr = len(set(I[0])) == 1  # Check for top row
    tc = len(set(dmirror(I)[0])) == 1  # Check for leftmost column
    if tr:
      I = I[1:]
      h -= 1
    if tc:
      I = dmirror(dmirror(I)[1:])  # Remove leftmost column
      w -= 1
  return vconcat(hconcat(canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w - width(I))), I), canvas(mostcolor(I), (height(I) - h, width(I))))
```

**Explanation:**
This version iteratively checks for single-color rows and columns and removes them one by one. It then constructs the final output grid by padding the remaining grid with the background color to match the original dimensions.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  rows = tuple(r for r in I if len(set(r)) > 1) # Keep rows with more than one color
  cols = tuple(c for c in dmirror(I) if len(set(c)) > 1) # Keep columns with more than one color
  return dmirror(tuple(c for c in cols for i in range(len(rows))))
```

**Explanation:** 
This version first filters the rows and columns to keep only those containing multiple colors. It then reconstructs the grid using the remaining rows and columns.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, F, F, F)  # Get all objects
    filtered_objs = frozenset(obj for obj in objs if not (hline(obj) or vline(obj)))  # Remove single-row/column objects
    return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(filtered_objs))  # Paint remaining objects onto a blank canvas
```

**Explanation:** 
This version leverages object detection. It identifies all objects in the grid, filters out those representing single-color rows or columns, and then paints the remaining objects onto a blank canvas of the original size.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I)
  compressed = compress(I)  # Remove all single-color rows and columns (effectively removing single-cell objects)
  return vconcat(compressed, canvas(mostcolor(I), (h - height(compressed), width(I))))  # Fill the remaining space with the background color
```

**Explanation:** 
This version utilizes the `compress` function to remove single-color rows and columns. It then calculates the height difference between the original and compressed grids and uses this difference to pad the compressed grid with the background color at the bottom to match the original dimensions.
