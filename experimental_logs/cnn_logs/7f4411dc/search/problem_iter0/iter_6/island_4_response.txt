## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied in each input-output pair is **removing the bottom row and the rightmost column from the input grid**. 

Let's analyze each pair:

* **Input_0 - Output_0**: The last row and column containing both 0s and 7s are removed.
* **Input_1 - Output_1**: Similar to Input_0, the last row and column with a mix of 0s and 6s are removed.
* **Input_2 - Output_2**:  The last row and column containing 0s and 5s are removed.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return crop(I, (0, 0), (height(I) - 1, width(I) - 1))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `height(I) - 1`: Calculates the height of the new grid, excluding the bottom row.
2.  `width(I) - 1`: Calculates the width of the new grid, excluding the rightmost column.
3.  `(0, 0)`: Defines the starting point of the crop as the top-left corner.
4.  `crop(I, (0, 0), (height(I) - 1, width(I) - 1))`: Crops the input grid (`I`) from the top-left corner `(0, 0)` with the calculated height and width.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return rot90(trim(rot270(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `rot270(I)`: Rotates the input grid counter-clockwise by 270 degrees, effectively moving the bottom row to the rightmost position.
2.  `trim(...)`: Removes the rightmost column, which was originally the bottom row.
3.  `rot90(...)`: Rotates the grid clockwise by 90 degrees to restore the original orientation.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return hconcat(hsplit(I, width(I) - 1)[0], tuple())
```

**Explanation:**

1. `width(I) - 1`:  Calculates the desired width of the output grid.
2. `hsplit(I, width(I) - 1)`: Splits the input grid horizontally into 'width - 1' subgrids.
3. `[0]`: Selects the first subgrid, which represents all columns except the last one.
4. `hconcat(..., tuple())`: Concatenates the selected subgrid with an empty tuple horizontally. This effectively removes the last column.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), (height(I) - 1, width(I) - 1)), crop(I, (0, 0), (height(I) - 1, width(I) - 1)))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `canvas(mostcolor(I), (height(I) - 1, width(I) - 1))`: Creates a new canvas with the same background color as the input grid (`I`) and dimensions one row and one column smaller.
2.  `crop(I, (0, 0), (height(I) - 1, width(I) - 1))`:  Crops the input grid to the desired size.
3.  `paint(..., ...)`: Paints the cropped section onto the newly created canvas.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h = height(I) - 1
  w = width(I) - 1
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w)),  crop(I, (0, 0), (h, w))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 4 but pre-calculates the height and width for better readability.

1.  `h = height(I) - 1`: Calculates and stores the height of the output grid.
2.  `w = width(I) - 1`: Calculates and stores the width of the output grid.
3.  `canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))`: Creates a new canvas with the calculated dimensions and the same background color as the input grid.
4.  `crop(I, (0, 0), (h, w))`: Crops the input grid to the calculated dimensions.
5.  `paint(..., ...)`: Paints the cropped input grid onto the newly created canvas.


These five versions provide distinct approaches to removing the last row and column from the input grid using the DSL functions. They illustrate the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for solving this image manipulation task.
