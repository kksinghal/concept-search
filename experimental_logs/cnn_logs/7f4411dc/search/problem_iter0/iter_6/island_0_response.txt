## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation removes objects that touch the border of the grid. 

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:** The input grid has several '7' objects. The output grid keeps only the '7' objects that don't touch the border, effectively removing the top and rightmost '7' objects.

**Pair 1:** The input grid has several '6' objects. The output grid keeps only the '6' objects fully contained within the grid, removing any '6' object touching the border.

**Pair 2:** This pair further confirms the pattern. The input grid has '5' objects. The output grid keeps only the central '5' object that doesn't touch any border.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Removes objects touching the border of the grid.
  """
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Identify all objects in the grid.
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I)) # Keep only objects not touching the border.
  O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(filtered_objs)) # Paint the remaining objects onto a blank canvas.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Identifies all distinct objects in the grid.
2. **`sfilter(objs, lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I))`:** Filters the objects, keeping only those that don't satisfy the `bordering` condition (i.e., those not touching the grid border).
3. **`paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(filtered_objs))`:** Creates a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input grid and paints the remaining objects onto it.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Removes objects touching the border of the grid.
  """
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  # Initialize output as a blank canvas.
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):  # Iterate through each object.
    if not bordering(obj, I):
      O = paint(O, obj)  # Paint the object if it doesn't touch the border.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))`:** Initializes the output grid as a blank canvas with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid.
2. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Identifies all distinct objects in the input grid.
3. **`if not bordering(obj, I):`:**  For each object, it checks if it touches the grid border. 
4. **`O = paint(O, obj)`:** If the object doesn't touch the border, it's painted onto the output grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Removes objects touching the border of the grid.
  """
  border_indices = outbox(asindices(I))  # Find indices forming the grid border and the area outside.
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Identify all objects in the grid.
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: not intersection(toindices(obj), border_indices))  # Keep objects with no intersection with the border indices.
  O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(filtered_objs)) # Paint the remaining objects onto a blank canvas.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`outbox(asindices(I))`:**  Gets the indices forming the outer boundary and the region outside the grid.
2. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the grid.
3. **`sfilter(objs, lambda obj: not intersection(toindices(obj), border_indices))`:** Filters the objects, keeping only those that have no common indices with the `border_indices` set.
4. **`paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(filtered_objs))`:**  Creates a blank canvas and paints the remaining objects onto it.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Removes objects touching the border of the grid.
  """
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), (h, w)) # Initialize a blank canvas.
  for i in range(1, h - 1):
    for j in range(1, w - 1):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcommon(I):  # If the cell is not background:
        O = paint(O, {(index(I, (i, j)), (i, j))})  # Paint it to the output grid.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h, w = shape(I)`:**  Gets the height and width of the input grid.
2. **`canvas(mostcommon(I), (h, w))`:**  Creates a blank canvas of the same size and background color.
3.  **Iterates through the inner cells (excluding the border):**  The nested loops iterate from the second row/column to the second-to-last row/column, effectively excluding the border cells.
4. **`if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcommon(I):`:**  Checks if the cell at the current index is not the background color.
5. **`O = paint(O, {(index(I, (i, j)), (i, j))})`:** If it's not background, paint the cell onto the output grid.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    """
    Removes objects touching the border of the grid.
    """
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
    filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: all((i, j) != (0, 0) and (i, j) != (height(I) - 1, 0)
                                                  and (i, j) != (0, width(I) - 1) and (i, j) != (height(I) - 1, width(I) - 1)
                                                  for i, j in toindices(obj)))
    O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(filtered_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Identifies all distinct objects.
2. **`sfilter(objs, lambda obj: ...)`:**  Filters the objects based on a condition.
3. **The condition in `sfilter`:** Checks if all cell indices within the object do not match any of the four corner indices of the grid. 
4. **`paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(filtered_objs))`:** Creates a blank canvas and paints the remaining objects onto it.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same goal, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
