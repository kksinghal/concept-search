## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently removes objects that touch the outer border of the grid, leaving only objects fully contained within the interior. 

**Input 0:**  The large '7' object and single '7' objects on the left and bottom are removed because they touch the border. The remaining '7' object is preserved.

**Input 1:**  All '6' objects touch the border and are removed, resulting in an empty grid.

**Input 2:** The '5' objects forming a C shape are trimmed down, leaving only the inner portion that doesn't touch any border.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL to implement the border object removal transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    """
    Removes objects touching the border of the grid.
    """
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Identify all objects
    filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I))  # Filter out border-touching objects
    O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(filtered_objs))  # Paint remaining objects on a blank canvas
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Identifies all distinct objects within the input grid `I`.
2.  **`sfilter(objs, lambda obj: not bordering(obj, I))`:** Iterates through each identified object (`obj`) and applies a lambda function. This function checks if the object is bordering the grid `I`. If it is *not* bordering, the object is kept; otherwise, it's discarded.
3.  **`paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(filtered_objs))`:** Creates a blank canvas of the same size and background color as the input grid (`canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))`). Then, all the filtered objects are merged and painted onto this blank canvas. 

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    """
    Removes objects touching the border of the grid.
    """
    h, w = shape(I) 
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), (h, w)) # Create blank canvas
    for i in range(1, h-1):  # Iterate through inner grid cells
        for j in range(1, w-1):
            if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcommon(I):  # If not background
                O = paint(O, {(index(I, (i, j)), (i, j))})  # Paint onto output
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`h, w = shape(I)`:** Extracts the height (`h`) and width (`w`) of the input grid `I`.
2.  **`O = canvas(mostcommon(I), (h, w))`:** Initializes an empty output grid (`O`) with the same dimensions and background color as `I`.
3.  **Nested loops (`for i in range(1, h-1)` and `for j in range(1, w-1)`)**:  Iterates over each cell within the inner region of the grid (excluding the border). 
4.  **`if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcommon(I)`:** Checks if the current cell at index `(i, j)` in the input grid is different from the background color.
5.  **`O = paint(O, {(index(I, (i, j)), (i, j))})`:** If the cell is not background, it's painted onto the output grid `O` at the same position.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Removes objects touching the border of the grid.
  """
  border = outbox(asindices(I))  # Get border indices
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  # Create blank canvas
  for i, row in enumerate(I):  
      for j, val in enumerate(row):
          if (i, j) not in border and val != mostcommon(I):  # If not border and not background
              O = paint(O, {(val, (i, j))}) # Paint to output
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`border = outbox(asindices(I))`:** Calculates the indices that represent the border of the input grid `I` using the `outbox` function.
2.  **`O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))`:** Creates a blank output grid `O` with the same dimensions and background color as `I`.
3.  **Nested loops (for each `row` and `val` in `I`)**: Iterates over each cell and its value (`val`) in the input grid.
4.  **`if (i, j) not in border and val != mostcommon(I)`:** Checks if the current cell's index `(i, j)` is *not* part of the calculated border and if the cell's value is different from the background color.
5.  **`O = paint(O, {(val, (i, j))})`:** If both conditions are true (not on the border and not background), the cell is painted onto the output grid `O` at its corresponding position. 

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Removes objects touching the border of the grid.
  """
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  inner_objs = []
  h, w = shape(I)
  for obj in objs:
    if all(0 < i < h - 1 and 0 < j < w - 1 for _, (i, j) in obj):
      inner_objs.append(obj)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(inner_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`objs = objects(I, T, T, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the grid.
2.  **`inner_objs = []`:**  Initializes an empty list to store the objects that don't touch the border.
3.  **`h, w = shape(I)`:**  Gets the height and width of the grid.
4.  **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterates over each identified object.
5.  **`if all(0 < i < h - 1 and 0 < j < w - 1 for _, (i, j) in obj):`:**  Checks if all cells of the current object are within the inner region of the grid (not on the border).
6.  **`inner_objs.append(obj)`:** If the object is within the inner region, it is added to the `inner_objs` list.
7.  **`O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(inner_objs))`:**  Creates a blank canvas and paints all the `inner_objs` onto it.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    """
    Removes objects touching the border of the grid.
    """
    trimmed_grid = trim(I)  # Remove one layer of cells from the border
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Create output canvas
    O = paint(O, asobject(trimmed_grid)) # Paint the trimmed grid onto the output, implicitly filling the border with the background color
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1.  **`trimmed_grid = trim(I)`:**  The `trim` function removes one layer of cells from all sides of the input grid `I`, effectively getting rid of the border and any objects touching it.
2.  **`O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))`:**  Creates an empty output grid `O` of the same size and background color as the original input grid.
3.  **`O = paint(O, asobject(trimmed_grid))`:** Converts the `trimmed_grid` into an object representation and paints it onto the output canvas `O`. Since `trimmed_grid` is smaller, the painting leaves the border area of `O` filled with the background color, effectively achieving the desired transformation.

Each of these program versions provides a distinct approach to removing objects touching the border, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
