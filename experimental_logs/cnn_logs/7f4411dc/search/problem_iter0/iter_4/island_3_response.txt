## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation removes any isolated digits that are not directly connected to another digit of the same value.

**Input_0:**

* The isolated '7's are removed. 
* The connected '7's remain unchanged.

**Input_1:**

* The isolated '6' are removed.
* The connected '6's remain unchanged.

**Input_2:**

* The isolated '5's are removed.
* The connected '5's remain unchanged.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # Get all connected objects
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1) # Keep objects with more than one cell
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(filtered_objs)) # Paint the kept objects on a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Extracts all connected components from the input grid `I`. `T` indicates univalued objects, `F` indicates no diagonal connections and no background removal.
2. **`sfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)`:** Filters the connected components, keeping only those with a size greater than 1 (not isolated).
3. **`paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(filtered_objs))`:** Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input and paints the filtered objects onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  is_isolated = lambda loc: all(index(I, n) != index(I, loc) for n in dneighbors(loc))
  isolated_indices = sfilter(asindices(I), is_isolated)
  O = fill(I, ZERO, isolated_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_isolated = lambda loc: all(index(I, n) != index(I, loc) for n in dneighbors(loc))`:** Defines a function `is_isolated` to check if a location `loc` is isolated (no directly adjacent cell has the same value).
2. **`isolated_indices = sfilter(asindices(I), is_isolated)`:** Filters all indices of the input grid `I` and keeps only the isolated ones.
3. **`O = fill(I, ZERO, isolated_indices)`:** Fills the isolated indices in the input grid `I` with the value `ZERO`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  connected = lambda loc: any(index(I, n) == index(I, loc) for n in dneighbors(loc))
  connected_indices = sfilter(asindices(I), connected)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), toobject(connected_indices, I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`connected = lambda loc: any(index(I, n) == index(I, loc) for n in dneighbors(loc))`:** Defines a function `connected` to check if a location `loc` has at least one directly adjacent cell with the same value.
2. **`connected_indices = sfilter(asindices(I), connected)`:** Filters all indices of the input grid `I` and keeps only the connected ones.
3. **`O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), toobject(connected_indices, I))`:** Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input, converts the connected indices to an object using the original grid's values, and paints this object onto the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if is_isolated((i, j), I):
        O = fill(O, ZERO, {(i, j)})
  return O

def is_isolated(loc, grid):
  return all(index(grid, n) != index(grid, loc) for n in dneighbors(loc))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_isolated(loc, grid)`:**  This helper function checks if a given location `loc` is isolated within the given `grid` (same as in Program Version 2).
2. **Iterative Approach:** The program iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`. If a cell is isolated (using the `is_isolated` function), it is filled with `ZERO` in the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  not_isolated = lambda obj: size(obj) > 1
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  filtered_objects = sfilter(objs, not_isolated)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(filtered_objects))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`not_isolated = lambda obj: size(obj) > 1`:** Defines a function `not_isolated` to check if an object `obj` has a size greater than 1 (not isolated).
2. **`objs = objects(I, True, False, False)`:** Extracts all connected components from the input grid `I`, ensuring they are univalued and not diagonally connected.
3. **`filtered_objects = sfilter(objs, not_isolated)`:** Filters the connected components using the `not_isolated` function to keep only non-isolated objects.
4. **`paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(filtered_objects))`:** Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input and paints the merged, filtered objects onto it.


These five program versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL. Each version employs a distinct combination of functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL and the variety of approaches possible.
