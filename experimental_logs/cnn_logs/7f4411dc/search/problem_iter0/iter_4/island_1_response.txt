## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to shift all non-background objects upwards until they hit either the top border of the grid or another object.

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 
- The '7' objects are shifted upwards until they reach the top of the grid.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The '6' objects are shifted upwards. 
- The uppermost object stops when it hits the top border, while others are blocked by this object.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- The '5' objects are shifted upwards. 
- The leftmost '5' object reaches the top border. 
- The rightmost '5' object is blocked by the central '5' object, which stops at the second row.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects, no diagonals, without background
    for obj in objs:
        shifted_obj = obj
        while uppermost(shifted_obj) > 0 and index(I, add(ulcorner(shifted_obj), (-1, 0))) == mostcommon(I):
            shifted_obj = shift(shifted_obj, (-1, 0))
        I = paint(I, shifted_obj)
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extract all non-background objects from the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate and Shift:** Iterate through each object (`obj`):
    - Create a copy of the object (`shifted_obj`).
    - While the `shifted_obj` is not at the top border and the cell above its upper-left corner is background:
        - Shift the `shifted_obj` one row upwards.
    - Paint the `shifted_obj` onto the input grid (`I`), effectively moving the object.
3. **Return Modified Grid:** Return the modified input grid (`I`).


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  cleaned_grid = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  # Create a clean grid with the background color
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects, no diagonals, without background
  for obj in objs:
    shifted_obj = obj
    while uppermost(shifted_obj) > 0 and index(I, add(ulcorner(shifted_obj), (-1, 0))) == mostcommon(I):
      shifted_obj = shift(shifted_obj, (-1, 0))
    cleaned_grid = paint(cleaned_grid, shifted_obj)  # Paint the shifted object onto the clean grid
  return cleaned_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Clean Grid:** Create a blank grid filled with the background color and having the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. **Extract Objects:**  Extract all non-background objects from the input grid.
3. **Iterate and Shift:**  For each object:
    - Create a copy of the object and attempt to shift it upwards as long as the space above is empty (background color).
    - Paint the shifted object onto the clean grid.
4. **Return Clean Grid:**  Return the clean grid, now containing the shifted objects.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects
  shifted_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    shifted_obj = obj
    while uppermost(shifted_obj) > 0 and all(index(I, (i-1, j)) == mostcommon(I) for i, j in toindices(shifted_obj)):
      shifted_obj = shift(shifted_obj, (-1, 0))
    shifted_objs.add(shifted_obj)
  return paint(cover(I, merge(objs)), merge(shifted_objs))  # Paint the shifted objects onto the clean grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Get all non-background objects.
2. **Calculate Shifted Positions:** For each object:
    -  Make a copy.
    - Shift it upwards as long as there's empty space above all its cells.
    - Add the shifted object to a new set.
3. **Assemble Output:** 
    - Clear the original positions of all objects in the input grid.
    - Paint all the shifted objects onto the cleared grid.
4. **Return:** Return the modified grid.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grid = I
  for i in range(1, height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcommon(I) and index(I, (i - 1, j)) == mostcommon(I):
        shifted_grid = paint(cover(shifted_grid, {(index(I, (i, j)), (i, j))}), {(index(I, (i, j)), (i - 1, j))})
  return shifted_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Rows:** Loop through each row of the grid, starting from the second row (index 1).
2. **Iterate through Cells:**  For each cell in the current row:
    - If the cell is not the background color and the cell above it is the background color:
       -  Remove the current cell's content.
       - Paint the same content in the cell above.
3. **Return Shifted Grid:** Return the modified grid.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  shifted_objs = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: shift(obj, (-1, 0))) # Shift all the objects one cell up if possible
  cleaned_grid = cover(I, merge(objs)) # Clear the original positions of all objects
  return paint(cleaned_grid, merge(shifted_objs))  # Paint the shifted objects back onto the cleaned grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Get all non-background objects from the input grid.
2. **Shift Objects:** Attempt to shift each object one cell upwards.
3. **Clear Original Positions:**  Remove all objects from their original locations in the input grid.
4. **Paint Shifted Objects:**  Paint the shifted objects onto the cleaned grid.
5. **Return:** Return the modified grid with objects shifted upwards.
