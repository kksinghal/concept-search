## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids seems to involve **removing isolated cells (cells not connected to any other cell with the same value)** while preserving all other objects and their shapes. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**  The isolated '7's at the edges and within the object are removed, leaving the main connected '7' shapes intact.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:** The isolated '6's at the edges are removed. The main connected '6' shapes remain unchanged.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:** The isolated '5' at the top right corner and bottom right corner are removed. The main connected '5' shape remains unchanged. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program, each utilizing different DSL functions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # Identify all connected components
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1) # Keep components with more than one cell
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(filtered_objs)) # Paint kept components onto a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:**  Identifies all connected components (objects) in the input grid `I`. `T` specifies objects should be univalued, and `F`, `F` indicate no diagonal connections and no background removal.
2. **`sfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)`:** Filters the objects, keeping only those with a size greater than 1 (not isolated).
3. **`paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(filtered_objs))`:** Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid filled with zeros (`ZERO`). Then, it merges all the kept objects and paints them onto the canvas.


**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return cellwise(I, paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), efdfagbeacdbejicbdcaajhadcgcjfge(I)), ZERO) 
```
**Explanation:**

1. **`efdfagbeacdbejicbdcaajhadcgcjfge(I)`:** This is pre-existing function (Program B) to generate the objects with size greater than 1 on canvas of same shape.
2. **`paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), efdfagbeacdbejicbdcaajhadcgcjfge(I)))`:** Creating a blank canvas and painting the output of previous step to this canvas.
3.  **`cellwise(I, paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), efdfagbeacdbejicbdcaajhadcgcjfge(I)), ZERO)`:** This step does cell-wise comparison between input and output of previous step. If cell value match, it retain cell value from input else put ZERO.  

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
        if size(obj) > 1:
            O = paint(O, obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`:** Creates a blank canvas `O` of the same size as the input grid `I`, filled with zeros.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):`:** Iterates through each connected component (object) identified in the input grid.
3. **`if size(obj) > 1:`:**  Checks if the current object's size (number of cells) is greater than 1.
4. **`O = paint(O, obj)`:** If the object is not isolated, it is painted onto the canvas `O`.


**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    indices_to_remove = sfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: all(index(I, n) != index(I, loc) or n == loc for n in dneighbors(loc)))
    return fill(I, ZERO, indices_to_remove)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`indices_to_remove = sfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: all(index(I, n) != index(I, loc) or n == loc for n in dneighbors(loc)))`:** Identifies the indices of cells that need to be removed. It filters all indices of the input grid and checks if all the directly neighboring cells have a different value.
2. **`return fill(I, ZERO, indices_to_remove)`:**  Fills the identified indices in the input grid `I` with `ZERO`, effectively removing the isolated cells.


**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(sfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: any(dneighbors((i, j)).intersection(toindices(obj)) for i, j in toindices(obj)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:**  Identifies all connected components in the grid.
2. **`sfilter(..., lambda obj: any(dneighbors((i, j)).intersection(toindices(obj)) for i, j in toindices(obj)))`:**  Filters the objects, keeping only those where at least one cell has a directly neighboring cell belonging to the same object (meaning it's not isolated).
3. **`paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(...))`:**  Creates a blank canvas and paints the merged set of non-isolated objects onto it.

These five versions offer different approaches to achieve the same goal of removing isolated cells. Some versions focus on identifying and removing those cells directly, while others focus on extracting and preserving the connected components. Choose the version that you find most readable and efficient for your needs.
