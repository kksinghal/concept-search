## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:**  All the '7' objects are shifted upwards until they reach the top of the grid or encounter another '7'. The relative horizontal positioning of the objects remains unchanged.

**Input 1 -> Output 1:** Similar to the previous transformation, all the '6' objects are shifted upwards until they reach the top of the grid or another '6'.  

**Input 2 -> Output 2:** The bottom row of the grid is removed. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract connected objects, excluding background
  shifted_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    uppermost_row = uppermost(obj)  
    while uppermost_row > 0 and index(I, (uppermost_row - 1, leftmost(obj))) == 0:
      obj = shift(obj, (-1, 0))  # Shift object one row up
      uppermost_row -= 1
    shifted_objs = shifted_objs.union({obj})  # Add shifted object to the set
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), shifted_objs)  # Paint shifted objects onto a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Identify and extract all connected objects from the input grid, excluding the background color using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Iterate and Shift:** Loop through each extracted object. For each object:
   -  Determine its uppermost row.
   -  Continuously shift the object upwards as long as the cell above it is empty (value 0) and it's not at the top of the grid.
   -  Add the shifted object to a new set.
3. **Paint:** Create a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid filled with the background color. Paint the shifted objects onto this canvas.

**Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Start with a canvas filled with the background color
  for j in range(w):  # Iterate over columns
    for i in range(h): # Iterate over rows from top to bottom 
      if I[i][j] != mostcolor(I): # If the cell is not background
        O = paint(O, {(I[i][j],(0,j))}) # Move the cell to the top of the same column
        break # Move to the next column after moving one cell
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** Initialize an output grid filled with the background color.
2. **Column-wise Iteration:** Iterate through each column of the input grid.
3. **Find and Move:** For each column, find the first non-background cell.  Move this cell to the top of the column in the output grid.
4. **Repeat:** Repeat for all columns.

**Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = I
  for row in range(1,h):
    for col in range(w):
      if O[row][col] != mostcolor(I) and O[row - 1][col] == mostcolor(I):
        temp = O[row][col]
        O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(row,col)})
        O = fill(O, temp, {(row - 1, col)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Initialize the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate and Swap:**  Iterate through each cell of the grid (excluding the first row).
   - If a cell is non-background and the cell above it is background, swap the values of these two cells. 
3. **Return Output:** Return the modified output grid.

**Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h, w = shape(I)
    O = list(list(row) for row in I)  # Create a mutable copy of the grid
    for j in range(w):
        empty_row = 0
        for i in range(h):
            if O[i][j] != mostcolor(I):
                O[empty_row][j], O[i][j] = O[i][j], O[empty_row][j] # Swap non-background cell with the topmost empty cell
                empty_row += 1
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Mutable Copy:** Create a mutable copy of the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Track:** Iterate through each column. For each column:
   - Keep track of the topmost empty row. 
   - If a non-background cell is encountered, swap its value with the topmost empty cell and update the empty row index.
3. **Return Grid:** Return the modified grid.


**Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h = height(I)
    O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(objects(I, T, F, T))) # Create a canvas with only the objects
    for i in range(1, h):
        O = paint(O, shift(toobject(ofcolor(I, mostcolor(I)), I), (-i, 0))) # Paint the background over the objects from top to bottom, effectively shifting the objects up
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Isolate Objects:** Create a canvas containing only the objects from the input grid.
2. **Shift by Overlapping:**  Iteratively paint the background color onto the canvas with an upward offset, effectively pushing the objects upwards. 


Each of these program versions provides a different approach to achieving the desired transformation, leveraging different combinations of DSL functions.
