## Transformation Analysis:

The task is to remove objects that are touching any border of the grid. The remaining objects are kept in their original positions.

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The single '7' objects at the top, left, and bottom borders are removed, leaving only the large '7' object in the top right corner.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** The '6' objects touching the top, bottom, and right borders are removed. The two large '6' objects remain as they don't touch any borders.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** The '5' objects touching the left, right, and bottom borders are removed. The remaining '5' object forms a square shape.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using different logic and DSL functions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Iterates through each cell, checking if it's part of a border-touching object.
  """
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), (h, w))  # Create blank canvas
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if i == 0 or j == 0 or i == h - 1 or j == w - 1:  # Skip border cells
        continue
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcommon(I) and any(
          index(I, (ni, nj)) != mostcommon(I)
          for ni, nj in dneighbors((i, j))
          if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w
      ):  # Check if cell is part of an object not touching the border
        O = paint(O, {(index(I, (i, j)), (i, j))})  # Paint onto output
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 
- This version iterates through each cell of the grid. 
- It skips cells that are on the border. 
- For each non-border cell, it checks if it's part of an object and if any of its directly adjacent neighbors are also part of the same object and not on the border.
- If these conditions are met, the cell is considered part of a non-border-touching object and painted onto the output canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Uses object detection and filtering to remove border objects.
  """
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Identify all objects
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: all(0 < i < height(I) - 1 and 0 < j < width(I) - 1 for _, (i, j) in obj))  # Filter out border-touching objects
  O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(filtered_objs))  # Paint remaining objects on a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
- This version uses the `objects` function to identify all individual objects in the grid.
- It then filters the objects, keeping only those where all cell indices are within the inner area of the grid (not touching any border).
- Finally, it paints the remaining objects onto a blank canvas filled with the background color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Shrinks and expands the grid to eliminate border objects.
  """
  shrunk = trim(I) # Remove the border
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)) # Create a blank canvas of the original size
  O = paint(O, shift(asobject(shrunk), (1, 1))) # Shift and paint the shrunk grid back onto the canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
- This version uses the `trim` function to remove the outer layer of cells from the grid, effectively deleting all border-touching objects.
- It then creates a blank canvas of the original grid's size.
- Finally, it shifts the trimmed grid by one unit in both directions (down and right) to compensate for the trimming and paints it onto the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Overwrites border cells with background color.
  """
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = paint(I, recolor(mostcommon(I), box(asindices(I))))  # Overwrite border cells with background color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
- This version utilizes the `box` function to get the indices of all border cells. 
- It then uses `recolor` to create an object with the background color at those border indices.
- Finally, it paints this object onto the input grid, effectively overwriting the border cells with the background color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Identifies and removes objects intersecting with the grid borders.
  """
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Identify all objects
  border = box(asindices(I))  # Get indices of the border cells
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: not any(idx in border for _, idx in obj))  # Remove objects intersecting with the border
  O = paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), merge(filtered_objs))  # Paint remaining objects on a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
- This version identifies all objects in the grid using the `objects` function.
- It then identifies the indices of the border cells using the `box` function. 
- The program filters out any object that has at least one cell index overlapping with the border indices.
- Finally, it paints the remaining objects (which don't touch any border) onto a blank canvas.


These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
