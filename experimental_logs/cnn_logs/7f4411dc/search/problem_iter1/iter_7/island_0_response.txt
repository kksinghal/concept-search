## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation removes all single-cell objects from the input grid while preserving the rest of the structure.

**Example:**

- **Input_0:** Contains several single-cell '7' objects scattered throughout the grid.
- **Output_0:** All single-cell '7' objects are replaced with the background color '0'. The larger '7' objects remain untouched.

This pattern holds true for all input-output pairs.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") in the given DSL, each with an explanation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(sfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Extracts all connected components (objects) from the input grid `I`.
2. **`sfilter(objects(...), lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)`:** Filters the objects, keeping only those with more than one cell.
3. **`merge(...)`:** Combines the remaining objects into a single set of cells.
4. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the background color.
5. **`paint(canvas(...), ...)`:**  Paints the merged objects onto the blank canvas, effectively removing the single-cell objects.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, mostcolor(I), merge(mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) == 1)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Extracts all connected components from the input grid `I`.
2. **`mfilter(objects(...), lambda obj: size(obj) == 1)`:** Filters and merges the objects, keeping only the cells that belong to single-cell objects.
3. **`fill(I, mostcolor(I), ...)`:** Fills the cells identified in the previous step with the background color of the input grid, effectively removing single-cell objects.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  single_cells = mfilter(asobject(I), lambda cell: size(sfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: contained(cell, obj))) == 1)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), difference(asobject(I), single_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asobject(I)`:**  Converts the input grid to an object representation.
2. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:**  Extracts all connected components from the input grid.
3. **`sfilter(objects(...), lambda obj: contained(cell, obj))`:** For each cell, filters the objects to find the one that contains the cell.
4. **`size(...) == 1`:** Checks if the filtered object (containing the cell) has a size of 1, indicating a single-cell object.
5. **`mfilter(asobject(I), lambda cell: ...)`:**  Applies the above logic to each cell in the grid, resulting in a set of single-cell objects.
6. **`difference(asobject(I), single_cells)`:**  Removes the single-cell objects from the object representation of the grid.
7. **`paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), ...)`:** Paints the remaining objects onto a blank canvas filled with the background color.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
               merge(apply(lambda obj: sfilter(obj, lambda cell: size(extract(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda o: contained(cell, o))) > 1),
                           objects(I, T, F, F))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Extracts all connected components from the input grid `I`.
2. **`extract(objects(...), lambda o: contained(cell, o))`:** For each cell, extracts the object containing that cell.
3. **`size(...) > 1`:** Checks if the extracted object has a size greater than one.
4. **`sfilter(obj, lambda cell: ...)`:** Filters the cells of each object, keeping only those belonging to objects larger than one cell.
5. **`apply(lambda obj: ..., objects(I, T, F, F))`:** Applies the filtering to each object in the grid.
6. **`merge(...)`:**  Combines the filtered objects.
7. **`paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), ...)`:**  Paints the combined objects onto a blank canvas.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
               merge([obj for obj in objs if size(obj) > 1]))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:**  Extracts all connected components from the input grid `I`.
2. **`[obj for obj in objs if size(obj) > 1]`:**  Iterates through the objects and keeps only those with a size greater than one.
3. **`merge(...)`:**  Combines the filtered objects.
4. **`paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), ...)`:**  Paints the combined objects onto a blank canvas. 


These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the desired transformation in the given DSL. They highlight the flexibility and expressiveness of the language in solving spatial reasoning tasks.
