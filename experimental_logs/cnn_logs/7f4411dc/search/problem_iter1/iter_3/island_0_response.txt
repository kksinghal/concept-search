## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to all input grids involves removing single-celled objects while leaving larger objects intact. The background color remains unchanged.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The single-celled '7's are removed, while the larger '7' structures remain.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The single-celled '6's are removed, while the larger '6' structures remain.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- The single-celled '5's are removed, while the larger '5' structure remains.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  small_objs_indices = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) == 1)
  return fill(I, mostcolor(I), merge(apply(toindices, small_objs_indices))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`small_objs_indices = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) == 1)`:** 
   - `objects(I, T, F, F)`: Identifies all connected objects in the grid.
   - `lambda obj: size(obj) == 1`: Filters for objects containing only one cell.
   - `mfilter`: Applies the filter and merges the resulting objects into a single set of indices.
2. **`return fill(I, mostcolor(I), merge(apply(toindices, small_objs_indices)))`:**
   - `apply(toindices, small_objs_indices)`: Extracts the individual cell indices from the set of small objects.
   - `merge(...)`: Combines the extracted indices into a single set.
   - `fill(I, mostcolor(I), ...)`: Overwrites the cells at the identified indices with the background color (`mostcolor(I)`).


**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(sfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates a blank canvas filled with the background color and the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. **`sfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)`:** Filters the connected objects in the grid, keeping only those with more than one cell.
3. **`merge(...)`:** Combines the filtered objects.
4. **`paint(..., ...)`:**  Paints the merged objects onto the blank canvas, effectively removing the single-celled objects.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  single_cells = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) == 1)
  return cellwise(I, canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), extract(single_cells, lambda x: True))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`single_cells = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) == 1)`:** Identifies and merges all single-celled objects.
2. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates a blank canvas with the background color.
3. **`extract(single_cells, lambda x: True)`:** Extracts an arbitrary single-celled object's value.
4. **`cellwise(I, ..., ...)`:** Compares the input grid with the blank canvas. If a cell belongs to a single-celled object (identified by `extract`), it retains its original color; otherwise, it adopts the background color from the canvas.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(cover(I, merge(mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) == 1))), 
               merge(sfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`cover(I, merge(mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) == 1)))`:**
   - Identifies single-celled objects and covers them with the background color, effectively removing them.
2. **`paint(..., merge(sfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)))`:**
   - Identifies larger objects (more than one cell) and paints them onto the modified grid (where single-celled objects were removed).

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  large_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(large_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Identifies all connected objects in the grid.
2. **`large_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)`:** Filters for objects larger than one cell.
3. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:**  Creates a blank canvas with the background color.
4. **`paint(..., merge(large_objs))`:** Paints the large objects onto the blank canvas, achieving the desired transformation.
