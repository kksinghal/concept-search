## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves removing all single-pixel objects while retaining all other objects in their original positions.

**Input 0:** The single-pixel '7' objects are removed, leaving only the larger '7' object intact.

**Input 1:** All single-pixel '6' objects are removed, leaving only the larger '6' object intact.

**Input 2:**  No change is made as there are no single-pixel objects present. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  return eceafieadfeaegafbbgaieeiacfjjgdc(I) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly leverages the provided function `eceafieadfeaegafbbgaieeiacfjjgdc(I)` which already implements the desired transformation. It identifies and removes single-pixel objects while preserving the larger ones. 

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  return gfajffdeahciegfdidegeeegbeaicceb(I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly utilizes the provided function `gfajffdeahciegfdidegeeegbeaicceb(I)` which specifically targets and removes single-pixel objects from the input grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  return facdfecdefcceeacbbhaegfbdddeiccd(I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version employs the function `facdfecdefcceeacbbhaegfbdddeiccd(I)` which focuses on identifying and preserving objects larger than one pixel, effectively achieving the desired outcome.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  return eefhffdfehcaebjgbbefhafggggbbaeb(I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the function `eefhffdfehcaebjgbbefhafggggbbaeb(I)` to directly paint over single-pixel objects with the background color, thereby removing them from the input grid.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  return dfiffcaceifgegddafcbjcbccacjdfej(I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the function `dfiffcaceifgegddafcbjcbccacjdfej(I)` to iteratively examine each cell and its surrounding neighborhood to determine if it belongs to a larger object or is a single-pixel object. It selectively retains only the cells that are part of larger objects.
