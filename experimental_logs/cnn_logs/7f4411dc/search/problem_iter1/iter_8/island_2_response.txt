## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

**General Rule:** Remove any isolated cells from the grid, where an isolated cell is defined as a cell that doesn't share its color with any of its directly adjacent neighbors (up, down, left, right).

**Specific Examples:**

* **Input_0 to Output_0:**  All isolated '7' cells are removed.
* **Input_1 to Output_1:** All isolated '6' cells are removed. 
* **Input_2 to Output_2:**  The isolated '5' in the bottom-left corner is removed.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, inspired by Program_A and Program_B, along with explanations for each version:


**Program Version 1:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, mostcommon(I), mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: all(index(I, add(loc, d)) != index(I, loc) for d in {UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT} if (0 <= add(loc, d)[0] < len(I) and 0 <= add(loc, d)[1] < len(I[0])))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asindices(I)`:** Get all cell indices of the input grid `I`.
2. **`mfilter(...)`:** Filter the indices and merge the results:
   -  **`lambda loc: ...`:**  For each cell index `loc`:
     - **`all(...)`:** Check if ALL of the following conditions are true:
        - **`index(I, add(loc, d)) != index(I, loc)`:** The color at the neighbor in direction `d` is DIFFERENT from the color at `loc`.
        - **`for d in {UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT}`:**  Iterate over all four direct neighbor directions.
        - **`if (0 <= add(loc, d)[0] < len(I) and 0 <= add(loc, d)[1] < len(I[0]))`:** Only consider valid neighbor indices within the grid boundaries.
3. **`fill(I, mostcommon(I), ...)`:** Fill the cells at the filtered indices (isolated cells) with the most common color in the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_isolated(loc):
    return all(index(I, add(loc, d)) != index(I, loc) for d in {UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT} if 0 <= add(loc, d)[0] < len(I) and 0 <= add(loc, d)[1] < len(I[0]))
  return paint(cover(I, objects(I, True, False, False)), sfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: size(obj) > 1 and is_isolated(first(toindices(obj)))) )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, False)`:** Find all single-color objects in the grid.
2. **`sfilter(...)`:** Filter the objects:
   - **`lambda obj: size(obj) > 1 and ...`:** Keep objects with size greater than 1 that satisfy an additional condition.
   -  **`is_isolated(first(toindices(obj)))`:** Check if the first cell of the object is isolated using the same logic as in version 1.
3. **`cover(I, ...)`:**  Create a new grid with the filtered objects removed (covered by background color).
4. **`paint(..., ...)`:** Paint the kept objects back onto the covered grid. 


**Program Version 3:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def has_same_color_neighbor(loc):
    return any(index(I, add(loc, d)) == index(I, loc) for d in {UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT} if 0 <= add(loc, d)[0] < len(I) and 0 <= add(loc, d)[1] < len(I[0]))
  return fill(I, mostcommon(I), sfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: not has_same_color_neighbor(loc)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asindices(I)`:** Get all cell indices of the input grid.
2. **`sfilter(...)`:**  Filter the indices:
   - **`lambda loc: not has_same_color_neighbor(loc)`:** Keep indices where the cell does NOT have a same-colored neighbor.
     - **`has_same_color_neighbor(loc)`:**  Checks if any neighbor has the same color as the cell at `loc`.
3. **`fill(I, mostcommon(I), ...)`:** Fill the cells at the filtered indices (isolated cells) with the most common color.

**Program Version 4:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  non_isolated = set()
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      for di, dj in {UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT}:
        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
        if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] == I[i][j]:
          non_isolated.add((i, j))
          break
  return fill(I, mostcommon(I), frozenset((i, j) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0])) if (i, j) not in non_isolated)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`non_isolated = set()`:** Initialize an empty set to store indices of non-isolated cells.
2. **Nested loops:** Iterate over each cell in the grid.
   - **Inner loop:**  Iterate over the four neighbor directions.
     - **If condition:** If the neighbor is within grid boundaries and has the same color, add the current cell to `non_isolated` and break the inner loop (as it's no longer considered isolated).
3. **`fill(I, mostcommon(I), ...)`:**  Fill the cells at the indices that are NOT in the `non_isolated` set (meaning they are isolated) with the most common color.

**Program Version 5:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), objects(I, True, False, False) - sizefilter(objects(I, True, False, False), 1)), mostcommon(I))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`objects(I, True, False, False)`:** Get all single-color objects in the grid.
2. **`sizefilter(..., 1)`:**  Filter out objects of size 1 (isolated cells).
3. **`paint(canvas(...), ...)`:** Create a new grid filled with the most common color and paint the remaining objects onto it.
4. **`cellwise(I, ..., mostcommon(I))`:** Compare the original grid `I` with the newly created grid. For each cell:
   - If the colors match (meaning the cell was part of a non-isolated object), keep the original color.
   - If the colors don't match (meaning the cell was isolated), use the most common color.


## Code Extraction:

The code for each program version is clearly marked and can be easily extracted by copying the content between the `def Program_to_be_generated(I):` and the closing triple backticks (```).
