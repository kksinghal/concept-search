## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied in all input-output pairs can be described as: **Remove all single-pixel objects from the input grid.** This means any pixel not connected to another pixel of the same color should be replaced with the background color.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects, no diagonals, without background
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1) # Keep objects larger than one cell
  O = cover(I, merge(objs)) # Create a clean grid
  for obj in filtered_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)  # Paint back the larger objects
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts all objects from the input grid `I`. It considers objects connected horizontally and vertically (`T`, `F`), and excludes the background color (`T`).
2. **Filter Objects:** `sfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1)` filters the extracted objects and keeps only those with more than one cell.
3. **Clean Grid:** `cover(I, merge(objs))` creates a clean grid by replacing all pixels belonging to any object with the background color.
4. **Paint Back:** The code iterates through the filtered objects (those with more than one cell) and paints them back onto the clean grid using `paint(O, obj)`.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  single_pixels = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) == 1) # Find single-pixel objects
  O = cover(I, single_pixels)  # Cover single-pixel objects with background color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Single Pixels:** `mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) == 1)` extracts all objects and then filters and merges them to get a set of indices representing single-pixel objects.
2. **Cover with Background:** `cover(I, single_pixels)` replaces the pixels at the indices of the single-pixel objects with the background color.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects
  O = canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))  # Create an empty canvas
  for obj in objs:
    if size(obj) > 1:
      O = paint(O, obj)  # Paint objects larger than one cell
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts all objects from the input grid.
2. **Create Empty Canvas:** `canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I))` creates a new grid filled with the background color and the same dimensions as the input.
3. **Paint Larger Objects:** The code iterates through the extracted objects and paints only those with a size greater than one onto the new canvas.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
    return paint(cover(I, mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: size(o) == 1)),
                 mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: size(o) > 1))
```

**Explanation:**

This version condenses the logic into a single line using function composition:

1. **Identify Objects to Remove:** `mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: size(o) == 1)` finds all single-pixel objects.
2. **Remove Single Pixels:** `cover(I, ...)` removes those objects from the input grid by replacing them with the background color.
3. **Identify Objects to Keep:** `mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: size(o) > 1)` finds all objects larger than one pixel.
4. **Paint Larger Objects:** `paint(..., ...)` paints the larger objects back onto the cleaned grid.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
    single_pixel_indices =  frozenset({c for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if size(obj) == 1 for c in toindices(obj)})
    return fill(I, mostcommon(I), single_pixel_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Single Pixel Indices:** This version directly iterates through the extracted objects and builds a set of indices belonging to single-pixel objects. 
2. **Fill with Background:** It then uses `fill(I, mostcommon(I), single_pixel_indices)` to efficiently replace all pixels at these indices with the background color.

These five program versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the same transformation using various DSL functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided domain-specific language.
