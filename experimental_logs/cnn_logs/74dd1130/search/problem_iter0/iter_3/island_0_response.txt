## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves rotating each object within the input grid 90 degrees counterclockwise while maintaining its original color.

**Example:**

Input_0:
```
2 2 1
1 5 1
5 2 2
```

Output_0:
```
2 1 5
2 5 2
1 1 2
```

Here, the object consisting of '5's has been rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise, as has the object consisting of '1's (excluding the top-right '1', which is part of a different object).

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create an empty canvas
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T): # Iterate over objects in the input
    O = underpaint(O, recolor(color(obj), toindices(rot90(subgrid(obj, I))))) # Rotate and paint each object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`**: Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid (`I`), filled with the most common color in the input (presumably the background).
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Iterates over each object in the input grid.
3. **`rot90(subgrid(obj, I))`**: Extracts the smallest subgrid containing the current object, then rotates it 90 degrees counterclockwise.
4. **`recolor(color(obj), toindices(...))`**: Converts the rotated subgrid to indices and recolors them with the original object's color.
5. **`underpaint(O, ...)`**: Paints the rotated and recolored object onto the canvas, only overwriting cells that have the background color.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I # Initialize output as input
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T): # Iterate over objects in the input
    O = paint(cover(O, obj), recolor(color(obj), toindices(rot90(subgrid(obj, I))))) # Rotate and paint each object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version improves upon the previous one by modifying the input grid directly instead of using a separate canvas. This might offer slight efficiency gains. The core logic remains the same.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Get all objects in the input
  rotated_objs = frozenset({recolor(color(obj), toindices(rot90(subgrid(obj, I)))) for obj in objs}) # Rotate all objects
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(rotated_objs)) # Paint all rotated objects onto a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version first extracts and rotates all objects. Then, it paints all the rotated objects onto a blank canvas in a single step. This approach might be beneficial for situations where modifying the original grid directly is undesirable.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I # Initialize output as input
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I): # Check if cell is not background
        obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda x: contained((i, j), toindices(x))) # Get the object at this cell
        O = paint(cover(O, obj), recolor(color(obj), toindices(rot90(subgrid(obj, I))))) # Rotate and paint the object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each cell of the input grid. If the cell is not part of the background, it finds the object that contains the cell, rotates it, and paints it back onto the grid. This approach avoids explicitly calling `objects` for every object, potentially improving performance for grids with many objects.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create an empty canvas
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if value != mostcolor(I): # Check if cell is not background
                O = paint(O, {(value, (j, len(I) - 1 - i))}) # Rotate the cell and paint it
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly iterates over the input grid and rotates each non-background cell individually by 90 degrees counterclockwise before painting it onto a blank canvas. This approach avoids the need to identify objects explicitly and might be more efficient for simple transformations. 


All these versions achieve the same outcome â€“ rotating each object within the input grid by 90 degrees counterclockwise. The choice of which version to use would depend on factors like code readability, potential performance optimizations, and specific constraints of the task at hand.
