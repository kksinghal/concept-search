## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to be rotating each distinct object in the input grid 90 degrees clockwise, without affecting the background color. Let's analyze each input-output pair to confirm:

**Input_0:**
```
2 2 1  -->  2 1 5 
1 5 1  -->  2 5 2
5 2 2  -->  1 1 2 
```
- The "1" object, "2" object, and "5" object each rotate 90 degrees clockwise.

**Input_1:**
```
2 2 5  -->  2 6 5
6 2 2  -->  2 2 5
5 5 5  -->  5 2 5
```
- Similar rotation for "2", "5", and "6" objects.

**Input_2:**
```
9 9 5  -->  9 5 5
5 5 8  -->  9 5 8
5 8 9  -->  5 8 9
```
- Same rotation pattern for "5", "8", and "9" objects.

**Input_3:**
```
2 6 6  -->  2 2 2
2 1 1  -->  6 1 6
2 6 2  -->  6 1 2
```
-  Again, the "1", "2", and "6" objects follow the rotation rule.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve this transformation:

**Version 1 (Inspired by Program A's `mapply` approach):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)  # Identify objects excluding background
  def rotate_object(obj):
    indices = toindices(obj) 
    shifted_indices = frozenset((j, height(indices)-1-i) for i, j in indices)  # Rotate indices
    return recolor(color(obj), shifted_indices)  # Recolor with original object's color
  rotated_objs = mapply(rotate_object, objs)  # Apply rotation to each object
  O = paint(I, rotated_objs)  # Paint rotated objects onto original grid
  return O
```
**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Partitions the grid into distinct objects, excluding the background.
2. **`rotate_object(obj)`:** This inner function takes an object and performs a 90-degree clockwise rotation on its indices. It then recolors the rotated indices with the original object's color.
3. **`mapply(rotate_object, objs)`:** Applies the `rotate_object` function to each object identified in step 1. 
4. **`paint(I, rotated_objs)`:**  Overlays the rotated objects onto a copy of the original grid `I`.

**Version 2 (Leveraging matrix transposition and reversal):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  def rotate_object(obj):
    indices = toindices(obj)
    h = height(indices)
    w = width(indices)
    # Transpose and reverse each row for 90-degree rotation
    shifted_indices = frozenset((j, i) for i in range(w) for j in range(h-1, -1, -1) if (h-1-j, i) in indices)  
    return recolor(color(obj), shifted_indices)
  rotated_objs = mapply(rotate_object, objs)
  return paint(I, rotated_objs)
```
**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Same as Version 1.
2. **`rotate_object(obj)`:**  This version utilizes the logic of matrix transposition and row reversal to achieve the 90-degree rotation.
3. **`mapply(rotate_object, objs)`:**  Similar to Version 1.
4. **`paint(I, rotated_objs)`:** Similar to Version 1.

**Version 3 (Direct pixel manipulation):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h = height(I)
    w = width(I)
    O = canvas(mostcommon(I), (h, w)) # Create new grid with background color
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if (I[i][j] != mostcommon(I)):  # If not background color
                O[j][h - 1 - i] = I[i][j] # Rotate and place pixel
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h = height(I)`, `w = width(I)`:** Get the dimensions of the input grid.
2. **`O = canvas(mostcommon(I), (h, w))`:**  Create a new empty grid `O` of the same dimensions as the input grid `I`, filled with the background color (most common color) of `I`. 
3. **Nested loop:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`.
4. **`if (I[i][j] != mostcommon(I))`:** Checks if the current cell in `I` is not the background color. 
5. **`O[j][h - 1 - i] = I[i][j]`:**  If the current cell in `I` is not the background color, this line performs the 90-degree clockwise rotation and places the pixel value from `I` into the corresponding position in the output grid `O`.

**Version 4 (Using `rot90` and object reconstruction):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  def rotate_object(obj):
    subgrid_I = subgrid(obj, I) # Extract subgrid containing the object
    rotated_subgrid = rot90(subgrid_I) # Rotate the subgrid
    return toobject(asindices(rotated_subgrid), rotated_subgrid) # Reconstruct rotated object 
  rotated_objs = mapply(rotate_object, objs)
  return paint(canvas(mostcommon(I), shape(I)), rotated_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Same as in previous versions.
2. **`rotate_object(obj)`:**
    - `subgrid(obj, I)`: Extracts the smallest subgrid containing the current object.
    - `rotated_subgrid = rot90(subgrid_I)`: Rotates this subgrid using the built-in `rot90` function. 
    - `toobject(...)`: Reconstructs the rotated object by combining the rotated subgrid's data and its corresponding indices. 
3. **`mapply(rotate_object, objs)`:** Applies the rotation to all objects.
4. **`paint(...)`: ** Paints the rotated objects onto a new canvas filled with the background color, ensuring the correct output size.

**Version 5 (Using nested `apply` for rotation):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  def rotate_object(obj):
    indices = toindices(obj)
    h = height(indices)
    w = width(indices)
    return recolor(color(obj), frozenset(
        (j, h - 1 - i)
        for i in range(h)
        for j in range(w)
        if (i, j) in indices
    ))
  return paint(I, apply(rotate_object, objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Same as in previous versions.
2. **`rotate_object(obj)`:** Similar to Version 2, it calculates the rotated indices. However, it directly iterates through potential indices and checks if they exist in the original object before adding them to the rotated set.
3. **`apply(rotate_object, objs)`:** Applies the `rotate_object` function to each object.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the rotated objects onto the original grid.


These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired 90-degree clockwise object rotation. They demonstrate different ways to manipulate indices, leverage built-in functions, and reconstruct objects, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL.
