## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as a diagonal flip, followed by a counter-clockwise rotation by 90 degrees.

**Example:**

Let's look at `Input_0`:

```
2 2 1
1 5 1
5 2 2
```

1. **Diagonal Flip:**  Flipping the grid along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal results in:

```
2 5 2
2 5 1
1 1 2
```

2. **Rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise:** Rotating the flipped grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise results in:

```
2 1 5
2 5 2
1 1 2
```

This matches the `Output_0`. The same logic applies to all input-output pairs.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  return rot90(dmirror(I)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. `dmirror(I)`: Performs a diagonal flip of the input grid `I`.
2. `rot90(...)`: Rotates the diagonally flipped grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h = height(I)
  w = width(I)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      O = paint(O, {(index(I, (i, j)), (j, h - i - 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a blank canvas `O` with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid `I`.
2. Iterates through each cell of `I` using nested loops.
3. For each non-background cell in `I`, it paints the corresponding color at the rotated position in `O` (calculated as `(j, h - i - 1)`).

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):  # Iterate over each object
        O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), toindices(rot90(dmirror(subgrid(obj, I))))))  # Paint the rotated object
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates a blank canvas `O`.
2. Iterates through each object in the input grid.
3. For each object, it extracts the subgrid containing the object, performs a diagonal flip using `dmirror`, rotates it 90 degrees counter-clockwise using `rot90`, and paints it onto the canvas `O` at the corresponding position.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    transformed_objs = frozenset(recolor(color(obj), toindices(rot90(dmirror(subgrid(obj, I))))) for obj in objs)
    O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(transformed_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Extracts all objects from the input grid.
2. For each object, it extracts the subgrid containing the object, applies the diagonal flip and rotation transformations, and stores the transformed object.
3. Finally, it paints all the transformed objects onto a blank canvas and returns the result.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  return rot90(cmirror(hmirror(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `hmirror(I)`: Performs a horizontal mirror of the input grid `I`.
2. `cmirror(...)`: Performs a counter-diagonal flip of the horizontally mirrored grid.
3. `rot90(...)`: Rotates the transformed grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

Each of these program versions utilizes different DSL function combinations to achieve the same result, showcasing the flexibility and diversity of solutions possible within the provided DSL.
