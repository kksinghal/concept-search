## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all input-output pairs appears to involve shifting the leftmost column of each object in the input grid to the rightmost position of that object. This effectively "rotates" the object's columns to the right. The background color remains unchanged.

Here's a breakdown for each example:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
* The leftmost '2' of the top-left object becomes the rightmost '2'.
* The '1' in the second row of the top-left object becomes the rightmost '1'.
* Similarly, the leftmost column of the bottom-right object shifts to become its rightmost column.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
* The lone '6' in the second row shifts to the rightmost position of its object.
* The rest of the objects remain unchanged as their leftmost and rightmost columns are already the same.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
*  The transformation is applied to the top-left and bottom-right objects, shifting their leftmost columns to the rightmost position.

**Input_3 to Output_3:**
* The transformation is applied to all three objects, effectively rotating their columns to the right.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions implementing the described transformation, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  transformed_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    color = first(obj)[0]
    indices = toindices(obj)
    left_column = sfilter(indices, lambda loc: loc[1] == leftmost(indices)) 
    shifted_indices = shift(indices, (0, 1)) 
    right_column = shift(left_column, (0, width(indices) - 1)) 
    recolored_obj = recolor(color, (shifted_indices - left_column) | right_column)
    transformed_objs = insert(recolored_obj, transformed_objs)
  O = paint(I, transformed_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:** Extracts the foreground objects from the input grid.
2. **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterates over each extracted object.
3. **`color = first(obj)[0]`:** Gets the color of the current object.
4. **`indices = toindices(obj)`:** Gets the indices of all cells belonging to the object.
5. **`left_column = sfilter(indices, lambda loc: loc[1] == leftmost(indices))`:** Extracts the indices of the leftmost column of the object.
6. **`shifted_indices = shift(indices, (0, 1))`:** Shifts all indices of the object one position to the right.
7. **`right_column = shift(left_column, (0, width(indices) - 1))`:** Shifts the extracted left column to the rightmost position of the object.
8. **`recolored_obj = recolor(color, (shifted_indices - left_column) | right_column)`:**  Reconstructs the object with the shifted columns and original color.
9. **`transformed_objs = insert(recolored_obj, transformed_objs)`:** Adds the transformed object to the set of transformed objects.
10. **`O = paint(I, transformed_objs)`:** Paints the transformed objects onto the input grid to produce the output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(height(obj)):
      color = index(I, (uppermost(obj) + i, leftmost(obj)))
      O = fill(O, color, {(uppermost(obj) + i, rightmost(obj))})
      O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(uppermost(obj) + i, leftmost(obj))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:** Extracts the foreground objects.
2. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
3. **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterates over each object.
4. **`for i in range(height(obj)):`:** Iterates over each row of the object.
5. **`color = index(I, (uppermost(obj) + i, leftmost(obj)))`:** Retrieves the color of the leftmost cell in the current row of the object.
6. **`O = fill(O, color, {(uppermost(obj) + i, rightmost(obj))})`:**  Fills the rightmost cell in the current row with the retrieved color.
7. **`O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(uppermost(obj) + i, leftmost(obj))})`:**  Fills the original leftmost cell in the current row with the background color.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  shifted_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (0, width(obj) - 1)) for obj in objs)
  O = paint(I,  mapply(lambda obj: toobject(toindices(obj), I), shifted_objs)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:** Extracts the foreground objects.
2. **`shifted_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (0, width(obj) - 1)) for obj in objs)`:** Shifts each object to the right by a distance equal to its width minus 1, effectively moving the leftmost column to the rightmost position. 
3. **`O = paint(I, mapply(lambda obj: toobject(toindices(obj), I), shifted_objs))`:** Paints the shifted objects back onto the input grid, overwriting the original positions of the objects and leaving the background unchanged.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    row = I[i]
    O = fill(O, row[0], {(i, len(row)-1)})
    O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(i, 0)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. **`for i in range(len(I)):`:** Iterates over each row of the grid.
3. **`row = I[i]`:** Gets the current row.
4. **`O = fill(O, row[0], {(i, len(row)-1)})`:** Fills the rightmost cell of the current row with the value of the leftmost cell.
5. **`O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(i, 0)})`:** Fills the leftmost cell of the current row with the background color.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  transformed = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    color = color(obj)
    transformed_cells = frozenset()
    for c, (i, j) in obj:
      new_j = (j + 1) % width(obj) 
      transformed_cells = insert((color, (i, new_j)), transformed_cells)
    transformed = insert(transformed_cells, transformed)
  O = paint(I, transformed)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:** Extracts the foreground objects.
2. **`transformed = frozenset()`:** Initializes an empty set to store the transformed objects.
3. **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterates over each object.
4. **`color = color(obj)`:** Gets the color of the current object.
5. **`transformed_cells = frozenset()`:** Initializes an empty set to store the transformed cells for the current object.
6. **`for c, (i, j) in obj:`:** Iterates over each cell in the current object.
7. **`new_j = (j + 1) % width(obj)`:** Calculates the new column index for the current cell, effectively shifting it one position to the right and wrapping around to the beginning if it reaches the end.
8. **`transformed_cells = insert((color, (i, new_j)), transformed_cells)`:** Inserts the transformed cell with its original color and new position into the `transformed_cells` set.
9. **`transformed = insert(transformed_cells, transformed)`:** Adds the set of transformed cells for the current object to the `transformed` set.
10. **`O = paint(I, transformed)`:** Paints the transformed cells onto the input grid to produce the output. 

These five versions demonstrate diverse ways to achieve the desired transformation using different combinations of DSL functions, showcasing varied logic and approaches.
