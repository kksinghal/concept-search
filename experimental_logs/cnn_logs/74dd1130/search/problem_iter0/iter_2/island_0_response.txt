## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve a clockwise rotation of each object individually within the grid. The background color remains unchanged.

**Example:**

Input_0:

```
2 2 1
1 5 1
5 2 2 
```

Output_0:

```
2 1 5
2 5 2
1 1 2
```

Here, the object formed by the digit '5' is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The same applies to objects formed by '1' and '2'. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each utilizing a different approach to achieve the clockwise rotation:

**Program Version 1 (Object Iteration & Rotation):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):  # Iterate over each object
    O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), toindices(rot90(subgrid(obj, I)))))  # Paint the rotated object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** A blank canvas (`O`) is created with the same size and background color as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate Objects:**  The `objects` function identifies individual objects within the input grid.
3. **Rotate & Paint:** For each object:
    - `subgrid`:  Extracts the smallest grid containing the object.
    - `rot90`: Rotates the extracted subgrid 90 degrees clockwise.
    - `toindices`:  Gets the indices of the rotated object.
    - `recolor`:  Applies the object's original color to the rotated indices.
    - `paint`:  Paints the rotated object onto the canvas.
4. **Return Output:** The canvas (`O`) now contains the transformed grid.


**Program Version 2 (Index-Based Rotation):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = height(I), width(I)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I):
        O = paint(O, {(index(I, (i, j)), (j, h - i - 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:**  Similar to Version 1, a blank canvas is created.
2. **Iterate & Rotate:** The program iterates over each cell of the input grid. If the cell is not part of the background:
    - It retrieves the color at the current index.
    - It calculates the rotated position using `(j, h - i - 1)`.
    - It paints the color onto the canvas at the rotated index.
3. **Return Output:** The canvas is returned as the transformed grid.

**Program Version 3 (Transposed Rotation):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return rot270(dmirror(I))
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages a combination of mirroring and rotation functions for a concise solution:
1. **Diagonal Mirror:** The `dmirror` function creates a mirror image of the input grid along the main diagonal.
2. **Rotate 270 degrees:** The `rot270` function rotates the mirrored grid 270 degrees anticlockwise, effectively achieving a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the original grid. 

**Program Version 4 (Zip & Reverse):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(zip(*I[::-1])) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version cleverly utilizes Python's built-in `zip` and list slicing to achieve rotation:
1. **Reverse Rows:** `I[::-1]` reverses the order of rows in the input grid.
2. **Transpose & Convert:** `zip(*...)` transposes the grid (swapping rows and columns). The result is converted back to a tuple to maintain the grid structure.

**Program Version 5 (List Comprehension & Rotation Logic):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(tuple(I[j][width(I)-i-1] for j in range(height(I))) for i in range(width(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly implements the rotation logic within a nested list comprehension:
- The outer loop iterates over columns (`i`).
- The inner loop iterates over rows (`j`).
- `I[j][width(I)-i-1]` accesses the element at the rotated position within the input grid.
- The rotated elements are assembled into rows and then into the final output grid.
