## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be shifting each object's pixels one step to the right, wrapping around at the object's right edge. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
* The '5' object pixels shift one position to the right, with the rightmost '5' wrapping around to the leftmost position of the object.
* The same logic applies to the '2' object.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
* The '5' object pixels shift right, wrapping around.
* The '2' object pixels shift right, wrapping around.
* The single '6' remains unchanged as it's a single-pixel object.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
* The '5' object pixels shift right, wrapping around.
* The '8' object pixels shift right, wrapping around.
* The '9' object pixels shift right, wrapping around.

**Input_3 to Output_3:**
* The '2' object pixels shift right, wrapping around.
* The '6' object pixels shift right, wrapping around.
* The single '1' remains unchanged.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program implementing the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)  # Partition the grid into objects, excluding background.
  transformed = frozenset()  # Initialize an empty set to store transformed objects.
  for obj in objs:
    color = first(obj)[0]  # Get the color of the current object.
    shifted_indices = set()  # Initialize a set to store shifted indices.
    for _, (i, j) in obj:  # Iterate over each cell in the object.
      new_j = (j + 1) % width(obj)  # Calculate the new column index with wrapping.
      shifted_indices.add((i, new_j))  # Add the shifted index to the set.
    transformed = insert(recolor(color, frozenset(shifted_indices)), transformed)  # Recolor the shifted indices and add them to the transformed objects set.
  O = paint(I, transformed)  # Paint the transformed objects onto the original grid.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition:** The grid is divided into separate objects using `fgpartition(I)`.
2. **Iterate & Shift:** The code iterates over each object and each cell within the object. For every cell, it calculates the new column index (`new_j`) by shifting one position to the right and wrapping around using the modulo operator (`%`).
3. **Recolor & Combine:**  The shifted indices are then re-colored with the original object's color using `recolor()`. These transformed cells are added to the `transformed` set.
4. **Paint:** Finally, the `paint()` function paints the transformed objects back onto the original grid, producing the output.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, mapply(lambda obj: toobject(shift(toindices(obj), (0, 1)), I), fgpartition(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a more functional approach:

1. **Partition:** Similar to version 1, `fgpartition(I)` divides the grid into objects.
2. **Shift:** The `shift(toindices(obj), (0, 1))` function shifts each object's indices one position to the right.
3. **Map & Paint:** The `mapply` function applies the shift and `toobject` conversion to every object in the partitioned set. Finally, `paint` draws the shifted objects onto the input grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  transformed_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    indices = toindices(obj)
    shifted_indices = frozenset(((i, (j + 1) % width(indices)) for i, j in indices))
    transformed_objs = insert(recolor(color(obj), shifted_indices), transformed_objs)
  return paint(I, transformed_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

This version modifies how the shifting is performed within the loop:

1. **Partition & Initialize:** Similar to previous versions, we partition and initialize a set for transformed objects.
2. **Shifting within Loop:** Inside the loop, instead of calculating `new_j` separately, we use a set comprehension to directly generate the `shifted_indices` by applying the modulo operation during iteration.
3. **Recolor & Paint:** Similar to previous versions.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, mapply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), 
                                           frozenset((i, (j + 1) % width(obj)) for i, j in toindices(obj))), 
                         fgpartition(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version further compresses the logic by combining recoloring and shifting within the `mapply` function.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, frozenset(recolor(color(obj), 
                                   frozenset((i, (j + 1) % width(toindices(obj))) 
                                             for i, j in toindices(obj))) 
                             for obj in fgpartition(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version takes a more Pythonic approach by using nested set comprehensions to achieve the transformation in a single line, enhancing readability for those familiar with Python's concise syntax. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL. They range from explicit loops and updates to more functional and concise expressions, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL.
