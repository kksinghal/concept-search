## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to rotate the color values within each object clockwise, shifting the leftmost column to the rightmost position. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**

- The top row object (2 2 1) rotates to become (2 1 5).
- The middle object (5) remains unchanged.
- The bottom row object (5 2 2) rotates to become (1 1 2).

**Input_1 - Output_1:**

- The top row object (2 2 5) rotates to become (2 6 5).
- The middle object (2) remains unchanged.
- The bottom row object (5 5 5) rotates to become (5 2 5).

**Input_2 - Output_2:**

- The top row object (9 9 5) rotates to become (9 5 5).
- The middle object (5) remains unchanged.
- The bottom row object (5 8 9) rotates to become (5 8 9). 

**Input_3 - Output_3:**

- The top row object (2 6 6) rotates to become (2 2 2).
- The middle object (1) remains unchanged.
- The bottom row object (2 6 2) rotates to become (6 1 2).

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions for "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  transformed_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    color = first(obj)[0]
    indices = toindices(obj)
    shifted_indices = shift(indices, (0, 1)) 
    left_column = sfilter(indices, lambda loc: loc[1] == leftmost(indices)) 
    right_column = shift(left_column, (0, width(indices)-1))
    recolored_obj = recolor(color, shifted_indices - left_column | right_column)
    transformed_objs = insert(recolored_obj, transformed_objs)
  O = paint(I, transformed_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `fgpartition(I)` separates the input grid into objects, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate Through Objects:** The code iterates through each object (`obj`) in the identified objects set.
3. **Shift Indices:**  `shift(indices, (0, 1))` shifts all indices of the object one position to the right.
4. **Identify and Move Left Column:**  It identifies the leftmost column of the object, shifts it to the rightmost position, and then combines it with the shifted indices while removing the original left column. 
5. **Recolor and Combine:**  The shifted and adjusted indices are then recolored with the object's original color and added to the `transformed_objs` set.
6. **Paint to Output:** Finally, `paint(I, transformed_objs)` paints the transformed objects onto the input grid to generate the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  rotated_objs = mapply(lambda obj: toobject(shift(toindices(obj), (0, 1 - width(obj))), I), objs)
  O = paint(I, rotated_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1, `fgpartition(I)` identifies objects in the grid.
2. **Rotate Indices:**  For each object, it shifts its indices to the right by `1 - width(obj)`, effectively rotating the object's indices by one position to the right.
3. **Reconstruct and Combine:** `toobject` uses these rotated indices and the original grid `I` to reconstruct the rotated object.
4. **Paint to Output:** Like Version 1, it uses `paint(I, rotated_objs)` to generate the output grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  transformed = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    color = color(obj)
    transformed_cells = frozenset()
    for c, (i, j) in obj:
      new_j = (j + 1) % width(obj) 
      transformed_cells = insert((color, (i, new_j)), transformed_cells)
    transformed = insert(transformed_cells, transformed)
  O = paint(I, transformed)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Color:**  The program first identifies objects and extracts the color of each object.
2. **Iterate Through Cells:** It iterates through each cell (`c, (i, j)`) within the object.
3. **Calculate New Column Index:**  It calculates the new column index (`new_j`) for each cell by shifting it one position to the right, using the modulo operator (`%`) to wrap around the object's width.
4. **Construct Transformed Object:**  It then constructs a new object (`transformed_cells`) with the transformed cell indices and the original color. 
5. **Paint to Output:** Finally, it paints the transformed objects onto the input grid to generate the output.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, 1)), objs)
  O = paint(I,  mapply(lambda obj: toobject(toindices(obj), I), shifted_objs)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Shift Objects:**  This version identifies the objects and then directly shifts each object one position to the right using `shift(obj, (0, 1))`.
2. **Reconstruct Objects:** It reconstructs the shifted objects using `toobject` to ensure they have the correct color values from the original grid. 
3. **Paint to Output:**  Finally, it paints the reconstructed objects onto the input grid to generate the output. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  new_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    indices = toindices(obj)
    left_edge = sfilter(indices, lambda loc: loc[1] == leftmost(obj))
    new_indices = (indices - left_edge) | shift(left_edge, (0, width(obj) - 1))
    new_objs = insert(recolor(color(obj), new_indices), new_objs)
  O = paint(I, new_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** It identifies objects in the grid using `fgpartition(I)`.
2. **Extract Left Edge:** For each object, it extracts the indices of its leftmost column using `sfilter` and `leftmost`.
3. **Shift and Combine:** It shifts the left edge to the rightmost position, combines it with the remaining indices, and recolors the new set of indices with the object's original color.
4. **Paint to Output:** It paints the transformed objects onto the input grid to generate the output grid. 


## Conclusion:

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version leverages a unique combination of functions and logic, highlighting the possibility of diverse solutions within the DSL's framework.
