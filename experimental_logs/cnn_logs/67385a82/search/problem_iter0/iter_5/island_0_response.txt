## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects formed by the digit '3' and applies the following rules:

* **Horizontal Connection:** If two '3' cells are horizontally adjacent, they are connected and form a single object.
* **Top Row Transformation:**  The top row of each connected '3' object is transformed to '8'. 
* **Preservation:** All other digits ('0' in these examples) remain unchanged.

Let's illustrate with Input_2:

```
Input_2:       Transformation:        Output_2:
3 3 0 3       3 3 0 3  -> 8 8 0 3 
3 3 0 0       3 3 0 0  -> 8 8 0 0
3 0 0 3       3 0 0 3  -> 8 0 0 8
0 0 3 3       0 0 3 3  -> 0 0 8 8 
```

## Code Improvement:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = list(list(row) for row in I)
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == 3 and (i == 0 or I[i-1][j] != 3):
        O[i][j] = 8
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iteration:** Iterates through each cell in the grid.
3. **Top Row or Disconnected:**  If a cell contains '3' and is either in the top row (`i == 0`) or the cell above it is not '3' (`I[i-1][j] != 3`), it signifies the top of a new object.
4. **Transformation:**  The identified cell (top of the object) is changed to '8'.
5. **Output:** Returns the transformed grid `O`.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T) 
  top_indices = mfilter(lambda obj: uppermost(obj) == 0, objs)
  top_indices = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(lambda ind: index(I, ind) == 3, toindices(obj)), top_indices)
  return fill(I, 8, merge(top_indices)) 

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** Extracts objects from the input grid `I` using `objects` function (without diagonal connections and excluding the background).
2. **Top Objects:** Filters the objects to obtain only those whose uppermost row is 0, indicating they touch the top border.
3. **Filter '3' Indices:** Further filters the indices within each top object to only include those with the value '3'.
4. **Fill:** Fills the `I` grid with '8' at the indices identified in the previous step.
5. **Output:** Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  transformed_top = tuple(8 if v == 3 else v for v in I[0])
  return (transformed_top,) + I[1:]

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shape Extraction:** Gets the height and width of the grid.
2. **Top Row Transformation:** Directly transforms the top row of the grid, changing '3' to '8' and keeping other values the same.
3. **Combine:** Concatenates the transformed top row with the remaining rows of the original grid. 
4. **Output:** Returns the combined grid. 

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    threes = ofcolor(I, 3) 
    top_row = frozenset((0, j) for j in range(width(I)))
    target_cells = intersection(threes, top_row)
    return fill(I, 8, target_cells) 

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '3' Cells:** Finds the indices of all cells containing '3' using `ofcolor`.
2. **Define Top Row:** Creates a set representing indices of the top row.
3. **Intersection:** Finds the intersection of '3' indices and top row indices, effectively identifying target cells.
4. **Fill:** Fills the `I` grid with '8' at the identified target cells.
5. **Output:** Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return (tuple(8 if c == 3 else c for c in I[0]),) + I[1:]

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Top Row Transformation:** Uses list comprehension to directly transform the top row, changing '3' to '8' while preserving other values. 
2. **Concatenation:**  Concatenates the transformed top row tuple with the remaining rows of the original grid.
3. **Output:**  Returns the combined grid.
