## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the outer frame of 3s in the input grid and changing them to 8s. The inner 3s remain unchanged.

**Example:**

Input:

```
3 3 0 3
3 3 0 0
3 0 0 3
0 0 3 3
```

Output:

```
8 8 0 3
8 8 0 0
8 0 0 8
0 0 8 8
```

## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_8eb1be9a(I):
  h = height(I)
  w = width(I)
  O = canvas(8,(h,w))
  O = paint(O,recolor(3,crop(I,(1,1),(h-2,w-2))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a canvas:** `canvas(8,(h,w))` creates a grid of 8s with the same dimensions as the input grid `I`.
2. **Extract inner grid:** `crop(I,(1,1),(h-2,w-2))` extracts the inner portion of the input grid, removing the outer frame.
3. **Recolor inner grid:** `recolor(3, ...)` changes all the 3s in the extracted inner grid to 8s.
4. **Paint onto canvas:** `paint(O, ...)` overlays the recolored inner grid onto the canvas of 8s, effectively preserving the inner 3s.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_8eb1be9a(I):
  O = I
  h = height(I)
  w = width(I)
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if (i == 0 or i == h - 1 or j == 0 or j == w - 1) and I[i][j] == 3:
        O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through grid:** The code iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`.
2. **Check for frame condition:** For each cell, it checks if it's on the outer frame (first or last row, first or last column) and if the value is 3.
3. **Fill with 8:** If the conditions are met, it fills that cell with 8 in the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_8eb1be9a(I):
  h = height(I)
  w = width(I)
  frame = ([(0, j) for j in range(w)] + 
           [(i, 0) for i in range(1, h - 1)] + 
           [(h - 1, j) for j in range(w - 1, -1, -1)] + 
           [(i, w - 1) for i in range(h - 2, 0, -1)])
  O = I
  for i, j in frame:
    if I[i][j] == 3:
      O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define frame indices:** This version explicitly defines the indices of the outer frame.
2. **Iterate through frame:** It then iterates through these frame indices.
3. **Fill with 8:** If the cell at a frame index contains a 3, it fills it with 8.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_8eb1be9a(I):
  return paint(
      fill(I, 8, asindices(I)), 
      recolor(3, toobject(inbox(asindices(I)), I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Fill entire grid:** `fill(I, 8, asindices(I))` creates a grid entirely filled with 8s.
2. **Extract and recolor inbox:**  `toobject(inbox(asindices(I)), I)` extracts the objects within the inbox of the grid (effectively the inner area). `recolor(3, ...)` then changes any 3s in this extracted area to 8s.
3. **Paint onto filled grid:** Finally, it paints this recolored inbox onto the grid filled with 8s, resulting in the desired output.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_8eb1be9a(I):
  O = I
  outer_frame = difference(asindices(I),inbox(asindices(I)))
  for i, j in outer_frame:
    if I[i][j] == 3:
      O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate outer frame:** It calculates the `outer_frame` indices by finding the difference between all indices and the inbox indices. 
2. **Iterate and fill:** It iterates through the `outer_frame` indices and fills the cell with 8 if it contains a 3.
