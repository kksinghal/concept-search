## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring objects within the grid based on a specific color. All objects with a color of '3' in the input grid are recolored to '8' in the output grid, while other colors remain unchanged.

### Program Version 1:

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Extract all objects from the grid
  x2 = colorfilter(x1, THREE)  # Filter objects with color '3'
  x3 = mapply(lambda o: recolor(EIGHT, o), x2)  # Recolor filtered objects to '8'
  O = I  # Initialize output grid as input grid
  for obj in x3:  # Iterate through recolored objects
    O = paint(O, obj)  # Paint recolored objects onto output grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** `objects(I, T, T, T)` identifies all distinct objects within the grid.
2. **Filter by color:** `colorfilter(x1, THREE)` selects only those objects containing the color '3'.
3. **Recolor objects:** `mapply(lambda o: recolor(EIGHT, o), x2)` applies the `recolor` function to each object in the filtered set, changing their color to '8'.
4. **Paint to output:** The code iterates through the recolored objects and paints them onto a copy of the input grid, resulting in the desired transformation.

### Program Version 2:

```python
def solve(I):
  return tuple(tuple(EIGHT if v == THREE else v for v in r) for r in I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a more direct approach by iterating through each cell in the input grid and applying the recoloring logic directly. If a cell's value is '3', it is replaced with '8'; otherwise, it remains unchanged.

### Program Version 3:

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))  # Create an empty canvas with the same shape as the input
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      O = paint(O, {(EIGHT if value == THREE else value, (i, j))})  # Paint each cell onto the canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Empty canvas:** The code initializes an empty canvas of the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. **Iterate and paint:** It then iterates through each cell of the input grid. For each cell, it paints the corresponding cell on the canvas with the appropriate color â€“ either '8' if the input cell is '3' or the original color otherwise.

### Program Version 4:

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = asobject(I)  # Convert the grid into a single object containing all cells
  x2 = sfilter(x1, lambda c: c[0] == THREE)  # Filter cells with color '3'
  x3 = mapply(lambda c: (EIGHT, c[1]), x2)  # Recolor filtered cells to '8'
  O = paint(asobject(I), x3)  # Paint the recolored cells onto the input grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Convert to object:**  The input grid is converted into a single object containing all cells with their respective colors and locations.
2. **Filter cells:** Cells with color '3' are filtered out.
3. **Recolor cells:**  The filtered cells are then recolored to '8', preserving their original location information.
4. **Paint to grid:** Finally, the recolored cells are painted back onto the input grid, resulting in the desired transformation.

### Program Version 5:

```python
def solve(I):
  x1 = partition(I)  # Partition the grid into objects based on color
  x2 = extract(x1, lambda obj: color(obj) == THREE)  # Extract the object with color '3'
  x3 = recolor(EIGHT, x2)  # Recolor the extracted object to '8'
  O = paint(I, x3)  # Paint the recolored object onto the input grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition by color:** The grid is divided into separate objects, with each object containing cells of a single color.
2. **Extract target object:** The object containing cells with color '3' is extracted.
3. **Recolor object:** The extracted object is recolored to '8'.
4. **Paint to grid:** The recolored object is painted onto the input grid, replacing the original object with color '3'.

These five program versions demonstrate various approaches to achieve the same transformation within the given DSL. Each version utilizes different functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressive power of the DSL.
