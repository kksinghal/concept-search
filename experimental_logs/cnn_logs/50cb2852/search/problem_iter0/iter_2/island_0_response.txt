## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the grid and filling the "inner box" of each object with the value 8. The "inner box" is defined as the area within the object's bounding box, excluding the outermost layer of cells.

**Example:**

Consider the following object:

```
2 2 2
2 2 2
2 2 2
```

Its "inner box" would be:

```
. . .
. 8 . 
. . .
```

**Detailed Analysis for each Input-Output Pair:**

* **Input_0, Output_0:** The program correctly identifies the three objects (2s, 1s, and 3s).  It fills the inner box of each object with the value 8, leaving the outer layer unchanged.

* **Input_1, Output_1:**  Similar to the previous case, the program identifies the two objects and fills their respective inner boxes with 8. 

* **Input_2, Output_2:** Again, the program correctly identifies the objects and fills their inner boxes. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):
    O = underfill(O, 8, inbox(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:**  `for obj in objects(I, F, F, T)` iterates over each object in the input grid (`I`).
2. **Fill inner box:**  `O = underfill(O, 8, inbox(obj))` fills the "inner box" (`inbox(obj)`) of each object with the value 8, only replacing background cells.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):
    O = paint(fill(O, 8, backdrop(obj)), obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:**  `for obj in objects(I, F, F, T)` iterates over each object in the input grid (`I`).
2. **Fill bounding box:** `O = fill(O, 8, backdrop(obj))` fills the entire bounding box (`backdrop(obj)`) of each object with 8.
3. **Redraw the object:** `O = paint(O, obj)` paints the original object back onto the grid, effectively leaving only the inner box filled with 8. 

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  inner_boxes = mapply(lambda obj: difference(backdrop(obj), box(obj)), objects(I, F, F, T))
  return fill(I, 8, inner_boxes)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate inner boxes:**  `inner_boxes = mapply(lambda obj: difference(backdrop(obj), box(obj)), objects(I, F, F, T))` first calculates the difference between the backdrop and box of each object (which gives the inner box) and then merges the results. 
2. **Fill inner boxes:** `return fill(I, 8, inner_boxes)` fills the calculated inner boxes with 8.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):
    for i, j in difference(backdrop(obj), box(obj)):
      O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects and inner box cells:** The code iterates over each object and then each cell within its inner box.
2. **Fill individual cells:** `O = fill(O, 8, {(i, j)})` fills each inner box cell individually with the value 8. 

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  changed_cells = set()
  for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):
    for i, j in inbox(obj):
      if (i, j) not in box(obj):
        changed_cells.add((i, j))
  return fill(I, 8, frozenset(changed_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find cells to change:**  The code iterates over each object and identifies cells that are inside the object's inbox but not part of its outer box.
2. **Fill the identified cells:**  `return fill(I, 8, frozenset(changed_cells))` fills the identified cells with 8.
