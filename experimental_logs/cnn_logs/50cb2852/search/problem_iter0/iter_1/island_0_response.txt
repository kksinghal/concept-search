## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same color) in the input grid and filling the "inbox" of each object with the value '8'. The inbox refers to the area enclosed by the outermost cells of the object, excluding the outermost layer itself.

**Examples:**

* **Input_0:** The '2' object has its inbox filled with '8'. Similarly, the '3' object has its inbox filled.
* **Input_1:**  The inbox of the '2' object and the '1' object are filled.
* **Input_2:** The inboxes of the '2' object and the '1' object are filled. The '3' object, touching the border, remains unchanged.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
  inboxes = mapply(inbox, objs)
  return fill(I, 8, inboxes)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, F, F, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.  
2. **`inboxes = mapply(inbox, objs)`:** Computes the inbox for each object and merges them.
3. **`return fill(I, 8, inboxes)`:** Fills the identified inbox indices in the input grid with the value '8' and returns the result.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):
    O = underfill(O, 8, inbox(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid `O` with the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):`:** Iterates through each object in the input grid.
3. **`O = underfill(O, 8, inbox(obj))`:** Fills the inbox of the current object in the output grid `O` with the value '8' only if the current cell is the background color. This avoids overwriting previously filled inboxes.
4. **`return O`:** Returns the modified output grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, inbox(obj)))
    O = paint(O, toobject(obj, I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates a blank canvas `O` filled with the background color of the input grid and having the same dimensions.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):`:** Iterates through each object.
3. **`O = paint(O, recolor(8, inbox(obj)))`:** Paints the inbox of the current object with the value '8' onto the canvas.
4. **`O = paint(O, toobject(obj, I))`:** Paints the original object from the input grid onto the canvas, overwriting any '8's that were in the original object's location.
5. **`return O`:** Returns the final canvas with filled inboxes.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  filled = I
  for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):
    if size(delta(obj)) > 0: 
      filled = fill(filled, 8, inbox(obj))
  return filled
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`filled = I`:** Initializes a grid `filled` with the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):`:** Iterates through each object.
3. **`if size(delta(obj)) > 0:`:** Checks if the object has a non-empty delta (meaning it's not just a single cell).
4. **`filled = fill(filled, 8, inbox(obj))`:** If the object has a delta, its inbox is filled with '8' in the `filled` grid.
5. **`return filled`:** Returns the grid with filled inboxes. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):
    box_indices = difference(box(obj), obj) 
    inner_box = difference(box_indices, outbox(obj))
    O = fill(O, 8, inner_box)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:**  Initializes the output grid `O` with the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):`:** Iterates through each object.
3. **`box_indices = difference(box(obj), obj)`:** Calculates the indices of the outer boundary of the object's box.
4. **`inner_box = difference(box_indices, outbox(obj))`:** Removes the outer box indices, leaving only the inner box.
5. **`O = fill(O, 8, inner_box)`:** Fills the inner box indices with the value '8'. 
6. **`return O`:** Returns the modified output grid.

These are five distinct program versions, each using different functions and logic to achieve the same transformation.
