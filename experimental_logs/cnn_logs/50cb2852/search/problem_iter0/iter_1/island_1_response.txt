## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves replacing specific digits within objects in the input grid with the digit '8'.  The rule seems to be:

* **Identify objects:**  An object is defined as a connected group of the same digit.
* **For each object, locate cells NOT on the object's perimeter:** These are the inner cells.
* **Replace the digit in the inner cells with '8'.**

**Example:**

In Input_0, the '2' object has inner cells that are then replaced by '8' in the Output_0. Similarly, the '3' object's inner cells are also replaced. This pattern holds for the other input-output pairs as well.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**  Using `delta` and `underfill`

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  """
  Replaces the inner cells of each object in the grid with '8'.

  Args:
    grid: The input grid.

  Returns:
    The transformed grid.
  """
  objs = objects(grid, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  for obj in objs:
    grid = underfill(grid, EIGHT, delta(toindices(obj))) 
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(grid, ...)`:**  Identifies all connected objects in the grid.
2. **`for obj in objs:`:**  Iterates through each found object.
3. **`delta(toindices(obj))`:**  Finds the indices of the inner cells (not on the perimeter) of the current object.
4. **`underfill(grid, EIGHT, ...)`:** Replaces the digit at the inner cell indices with '8'.


**Version 2:** Using nested loops and `neighbors`

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  """
  Replaces the inner cells of each object in the grid with '8'.

  Args:
    grid: The input grid.

  Returns:
    The transformed grid.
  """
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  new_grid = [list(row) for row in grid]
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if all(0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and grid[ni][nj] == grid[i][j] for ni, nj in neighbors((i, j))):
        new_grid[i][j] = EIGHT
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`new_grid = ...`:** Creates a mutable copy of the input grid.
2. **Nested loops:** Iterates through each cell (`i`, `j`) of the grid.
3. **`if all(...)`:** Checks if all neighboring cells of the current cell have the same value. 
   - If true, the current cell is an inner cell.
4. **`new_grid[i][j] = EIGHT`:** Replaces the digit in the inner cell with '8'.


**Version 3:**  Leveraging `partition` and set operations

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  """
  Replaces the inner cells of each object in the grid with '8'.

  Args:
    grid: The input grid.

  Returns:
    The transformed grid.
  """
  new_grid = [list(row) for row in grid]
  for obj in partition(grid):
    indices = toindices(obj)
    inner_cells = indices - set().union(*(neighbors(loc) for loc in indices))
    for i, j in inner_cells:
      new_grid[i][j] = EIGHT
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`partition(grid)`:** Divides the grid into distinct objects based on cell value.
2. **`for obj in ...`:** Iterates through each object.
3. **`indices = toindices(obj)`:** Gets the indices of all cells in the object.
4. **`inner_cells = ...`:**  Calculates the inner cells by subtracting the set of all neighbor cells from the object's indices.
5. **`for i, j in inner_cells:`:** Iterates through the inner cells and replaces their value with '8'.

**Version 4:** Using recursion and `cahfbddhbjigeagfaaedddaabegechhj` as inspiration

```python
def replace_inner(grid, i, j, original_value):
  """
  Recursively replaces inner cells of an object with '8'.
  """
  if i < 0 or i >= len(grid) or j < 0 or j >= len(grid[0]) or grid[i][j] != original_value:
    return grid
  grid = fill(grid, EIGHT, {(i, j)})
  for ni, nj in neighbors((i, j)):
    grid = replace_inner(grid, ni, nj, original_value)
  return grid

def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  """
  Replaces the inner cells of each object in the grid with '8'.

  Args:
    grid: The input grid.

  Returns:
    The transformed grid.
  """
  h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
  new_grid = [list(row) for row in grid]
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if new_grid[i][j] == grid[i][j]:  # Check if cell is already modified
        new_grid = replace_inner(new_grid, i, j, grid[i][j])
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`replace_inner(...)`:** 
   - Takes the grid, cell coordinates (`i`, `j`), and the original value of the object as input.
   - If the cell is out of bounds or doesn't match the original value, it returns the grid unchanged (base case).
   - Otherwise, it replaces the current cell with '8' and recursively calls itself for each neighbor.
2. **`Program_to_be_generated(...)`:**
   - Iterates through every cell in the grid.
   - If a cell's value hasn't been modified yet, it calls `replace_inner` to handle the connected object.

**Version 5:** Combining `objects` and a flood-fill approach

```python
def flood_fill(grid, i, j, target_value, replacement_value):
  """
  Replaces a connected region of cells with a new value.
  """
  if i < 0 or i >= len(grid) or j < 0 or j >= len(grid[0]) or grid[i][j] != target_value:
    return grid
  grid = fill(grid, replacement_value, {(i, j)})
  for ni, nj in neighbors((i, j)):
    grid = flood_fill(grid, ni, nj, target_value, replacement_value)
  return grid

def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  """
  Replaces the inner cells of each object in the grid with '8'.

  Args:
    grid: The input grid.

  Returns:
    The transformed grid.
  """
  objs = objects(grid, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  new_grid = [list(row) for row in grid]
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if all(0 <= ni < len(grid) and 0 <= nj < len(grid[0]) and grid[ni][nj] == grid[i][j] for ni, nj in neighbors((i, j))):
        new_grid = flood_fill(new_grid, i, j, grid[i][j], EIGHT)
        break  # Only need to flood-fill once per object
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`flood_fill(...)`:**  Recursively replaces a connected region of cells that have `target_value` with `replacement_value`.
2. **`Program_to_be_generated(...)`:**
   - Uses `objects` to find connected objects.
   - For each object, it finds an inner cell (if any) and calls `flood_fill` to replace the inner region with '8'. 
   - The `break` statement ensures that the flood-fill happens only once per object.
