## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the location of the digit '1' and then drawing horizontal and vertical lines of '3's and '7's respectively, centered at the '1'. The lengths of these lines correspond to the number of occurrences of '3's and '7's in the input grid.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The '1' is located at (10, 11). There are four '3's and three '7's in the input. Therefore, a horizontal line of four '3's is drawn centered at (10, 11), and a vertical line of three '7's is drawn, also centered at (10, 11).
* **Input_1 & Input_2:**  The logic remains the same. The lines of '3's and '7's are drawn centered on the '1', with their lengths determined by the number of occurrences of each digit in the respective input grid.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") using the DSL:


### **Program Version 1:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Draws horizontal and vertical lines centered at '1' using set operations.
  """
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  h_line = frozenset({(THREE, (one_loc[0], j)) for j in range(one_loc[1] - colorcount(I, THREE) // 2, one_loc[1] + colorcount(I, THREE) // 2 + colorcount(I, THREE) % 2)})
  v_line = frozenset({(SEVEN, (i, one_loc[1])) for i in range(one_loc[0] - colorcount(I, SEVEN) // 2, one_loc[0] + colorcount(I, SEVEN) // 2 + colorcount(I, SEVEN) % 2)})
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), h_line | v_line | {(ONE, one_loc)})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1':**  Finds the location of the digit '1' using `first(ofcolor(I, ONE))`.
2. **Generate Horizontal Line:** Creates a set `h_line` representing the horizontal line of '3's. It calculates the starting and ending points of the line based on the '1' location and the count of '3's in the input.
3. **Generate Vertical Line:** Similarly, creates a set `v_line` representing the vertical line of '7's.
4. **Combine and Paint:** Combines the horizontal line, vertical line, and the '1' location into a single set. This set is then painted onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid using `paint` and `canvas`.


### **Program Version 2:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Uses nested apply functions for line generation.
  """
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  h_offset =  (0, - colorcount(I, THREE) // 2)
  v_offset =  (- colorcount(I, SEVEN) // 2, 0)
  h_line = apply(lambda j: (THREE, add(one_loc, add(h_offset, (0, j)))), range(colorcount(I, THREE)))
  v_line = apply(lambda i: (SEVEN, add(one_loc, add(v_offset, (i, 0)))), range(colorcount(I, SEVEN)))
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), frozenset(h_line) | frozenset(v_line) | {(ONE, one_loc)})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1':** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Calculate Offsets:** Calculates the offsets required to center the lines on the '1'.
3. **Generate Lines with Apply:**  Uses nested `apply` functions to generate the horizontal and vertical lines. The outer `apply` iterates over the length of each line, while the inner `apply` calculates the position of each digit in the line by adding the offset to the '1' location.
4. **Combine and Paint:**  Similar to Version 1.


### **Program Version 3:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Leverages connect function for line drawing.
  """
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  h_start = (one_loc[0], one_loc[1] - colorcount(I, THREE) // 2)
  h_end = (one_loc[0], one_loc[1] + colorcount(I, THREE) // 2 + colorcount(I, THREE) % 2 - 1)
  v_start = (one_loc[0] - colorcount(I, SEVEN) // 2, one_loc[1])
  v_end = (one_loc[0] + colorcount(I, SEVEN) // 2 + colorcount(I, SEVEN) % 2 - 1, one_loc[1])
  h_line = recolor(THREE, connect(h_start, h_end))
  v_line = recolor(SEVEN, connect(v_start, v_end))
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), toobject(h_line, I) | toobject(v_line, I) | {(ONE, one_loc)})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1':** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Calculate Line Endpoints:**  Calculates the start and end points of both horizontal and vertical lines based on the '1' location and digit counts.
3. **Connect to Draw Lines:** Utilizes the `connect` function to generate index sets representing the lines.
4. **Recolor and Combine:**  Recolors the index sets to '3' and '7' respectively using `recolor`. It then combines these with the '1' location and paints them onto a blank canvas.


### **Program Version 4:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Constructs lines by repeatedly shifting a single-cell object.
  """
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  h_line = initset((THREE, one_loc))
  v_line = initset((SEVEN, one_loc))
  for j in range(1, colorcount(I, THREE) // 2 + colorcount(I, THREE) % 2):
    h_line = h_line | shift(h_line, (0, 1))
  for j in range(1, colorcount(I, THREE) // 2):
    h_line = h_line | shift(h_line, (0, -1))
  for i in range(1, colorcount(I, SEVEN) // 2 + colorcount(I, SEVEN) % 2):
    v_line = v_line | shift(v_line, (1, 0))
  for i in range(1, colorcount(I, SEVEN) // 2):
    v_line = v_line | shift(v_line, (-1, 0))
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), h_line | v_line | {(ONE, one_loc)})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1':**  Similar to previous versions.
2. **Initialize Lines:**  Initializes `h_line` and `v_line` as single-cell objects at the '1' location.
3. **Shift to Extend Lines:**  Iteratively shifts and combines copies of the initial objects to extend the lines in both directions. The number of shifts is determined by the count of the respective digits.
4. **Combine and Paint:** Similar to previous versions.


### **Program Version 5:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Creates lines using range and conditional recoloring.
  """
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  h_range = range(one_loc[1] - colorcount(I, THREE) // 2, one_loc[1] + colorcount(I, THREE) // 2 + colorcount(I, THREE) % 2)
  v_range = range(one_loc[0] - colorcount(I, SEVEN) // 2, one_loc[0] + colorcount(I, SEVEN) // 2 + colorcount(I, SEVEN) % 2)
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  O = paint(O, {(ONE, one_loc)})
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if j in h_range:
        O = paint(O, {(THREE, (i, j))})
      if i in v_range:
        O = paint(O, {(SEVEN, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1':** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Define Line Ranges:**  Calculates the ranges of column and row indices for the horizontal and vertical lines respectively.
3. **Iterate and Recolor:** Iterates through all cells of a blank canvas. If a cell's column index falls within `h_range`, it's recolored to '3'. Similarly, if a cell's row index falls within `v_range`, it's recolored to '7'. Finally, the '1' is painted at its location.


These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and diversity of solutions possible within the given DSL.
