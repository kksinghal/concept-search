## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation centers around the digit '1' and applies the following rules:

* **Digit '3':** The '3's form a horizontal line centered on the '1's column position. The number of '3's in the input is preserved.
* **Digit '7':** The '7's form a vertical line centered on the '1's row position. The number of '7's in the input is preserved.
* **Digit '2':** A single '2' is placed one row below the '1'. 

All other digits in the input grid are replaced with '0's in the output grid.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(ZERO, (h, w))
  O = fill(O, THREE, {(one_loc[0], one_loc[1] - colorcount(I, THREE) // 2 + i) for i in range(colorcount(I, THREE))})
  O = fill(O, SEVEN, {(one_loc[0] - colorcount(I, SEVEN) // 2 + i, one_loc[1]) for i in range(colorcount(I, SEVEN))})
  O = fill(O, TWO, {add(one_loc, DOWN)})
  O = paint(O, {(ONE, one_loc)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Find '1' location:** `one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))` gets the coordinates of the first occurrence of '1'.
2.  **Create empty canvas:** `O = canvas(ZERO, (h, w))` initializes an output grid of the same size as the input, filled with zeros.
3.  **Place '3's:** The code calculates the starting position of the horizontal '3' line based on the '1' location and the number of '3's. It then uses `fill` to place the '3's. 
4.  **Place '7's:**  Similar to the '3's, this part calculates the starting position for the vertical '7' line and uses `fill` to place them.
5.  **Place '2':**  `O = fill(O, TWO, {add(one_loc, DOWN)})` places a '2' one row below the '1'.
6.  **Place '1':**  `O = paint(O, {(ONE, one_loc)})` places the '1' back at its original location.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), 
           {(THREE, (one_loc[0], one_loc[1] + i - colorcount(I, THREE) // 2)) for i in range(colorcount(I, THREE))}
           | {(SEVEN, (one_loc[0] + i - colorcount(I, SEVEN) // 2, one_loc[1])) for i in range(colorcount(I, SEVEN))}
           | {(TWO, add(one_loc, DOWN))}
           | {(ONE, one_loc)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version condenses the logic by creating all the target indices within a single statement and then painting them onto the canvas.

1.  **Find '1' location:** Same as version 1.
2.  **Create and paint canvas:** 
    *   `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))` creates the empty canvas.
    *   The `paint` function then places the '3's, '7's, '2', and '1' at their calculated locations in one go. The indices are calculated similarly to version 1, but using set comprehensions for conciseness.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  three_count = colorcount(I, THREE)
  seven_count = colorcount(I, SEVEN)
  return paint(paint(paint(fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), THREE, {(one_loc[0], one_loc[1] - three_count // 2 + i) for i in range(three_count)}), 
                            SEVEN, {(one_loc[0] - seven_count // 2 + i, one_loc[1]) for i in range(seven_count)}),
                       TWO, {add(one_loc, DOWN)}), 
                ONE, {one_loc})
```

**Explanation:**

Version 3 utilizes nested `paint` and `fill` functions for a more functional approach.

1.  **Find '1' location and count '3's and '7's:** Similar to previous versions.
2.  **Nested Painting:** This version creates a chain of `paint` and `fill` calls:
    *   `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))` creates the empty canvas.
    *   `fill` places the '3's.
    *   The next `paint` places the '7's on the existing canvas.
    *   Subsequent `paint` calls place the '2' and then the '1'.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for i in range(colorcount(I, THREE)):
    O = paint(O, {(THREE, (one_loc[0], one_loc[1] - colorcount(I, THREE) // 2 + i))})
  for i in range(colorcount(I, SEVEN)):
    O = paint(O, {(SEVEN, (one_loc[0] - colorcount(I, SEVEN) // 2 + i, one_loc[1]))})
  return paint(paint(O, {(TWO, add(one_loc, DOWN))}), {(ONE, one_loc)})
```

**Explanation:**

Version 4 utilizes a loop to place '3's and '7's individually, then places '2' and '1' using `paint`.

1.  **Find '1' location:** Same as previous versions.
2.  **Create empty canvas:**  Same as version 1.
3.  **Place '3's and '7's:**  The code uses two separate loops to iterate and place each '3' and '7' individually using `paint`. 
4.  **Place '2' and '1':** Similar to other versions, this part places '2' below '1' and finally places '1' at its original location. 


**Program Version 5**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  h, w = shape(I)
  return tuple(tuple(SEVEN if j == one_loc[1] and abs(i - one_loc[0]) <= colorcount(I, SEVEN) // 2 else
                   THREE if i == one_loc[0] and abs(j - one_loc[1]) <= colorcount(I, THREE) // 2 else
                   TWO if (i, j) == add(one_loc, DOWN) else
                   ONE if (i, j) == one_loc else
                   ZERO 
                   for j in range(w)) for i in range(h))
```

**Explanation:**

Version 5 uses a nested list comprehension for a more Pythonic approach.

1.  **Find '1' location:** Same as previous versions.
2.  **Nested List Comprehension:** The code uses a nested list comprehension to construct the output grid directly. 
    *   It iterates over each cell (i, j) in the grid.
    *   For each cell, it uses conditional expressions (`if-else`) to determine the appropriate digit based on its relative position to the '1' location and the counts of '3's and '7's.

These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
