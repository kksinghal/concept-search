## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the locations of digits '1', '3', and '7' in the input grid and then redrawing them with the following rules:

* **Digit '1'**: Remains unchanged in its original location.
* **Digit '3'**: Forms a horizontal line centered on the digit '1' with a length equal to the total count of '3's in the input grid. 
* **Digit '7'**: Forms a vertical line centered on the digit '1' with a length equal to the total count of '7's in the input grid. 

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
- One '1' at (10, 11) dictates the center of the lines.
- Four '3's form a horizontal line centered at (10, 11): (10, 10), (10, 11), (10, 12), (10, 13).
- Three '7's form a vertical line centered at (10, 11): (9, 11), (10, 11), (11, 11).

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- One '1' at (2, 3) dictates the center of the lines.
- Two '3's form a horizontal line centered at (2, 3): (2, 2), (2, 3).
- Four '7's form a vertical line centered at (2, 3): (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3).

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
- One '1' at (6, 10) dictates the center of the lines.
- Four '3's form a horizontal line centered at (6, 10): (11, 9), (11, 10), (11, 11), (11, 12).
- Three '7's form a vertical line centered at (6, 10): (6, 10), (7, 10), (8, 10).


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program in the provided DSL, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  """
  Constructs lines by shifting a repeated value to the correct location.
  """
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  h_line = shift(recolor(THREE, frozenset({(0, j) for j in range(colorcount(I, THREE))})), (one_loc[0], one_loc[1] - colorcount(I, THREE) // 2))
  v_line = shift(recolor(SEVEN, frozenset({(i, 0) for i in range(colorcount(I, SEVEN))})), (one_loc[0] - colorcount(I, SEVEN) // 2, one_loc[1]))
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), h_line | v_line | {(ONE, one_loc)})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1':** Find the location of digit '1' (one_loc).
2. **Horizontal Line:**
   - Create a horizontal line of '3's with the length equal to the count of '3's in the input.
   - Shift the line horizontally to center it on '1'.
3. **Vertical Line:**
   - Create a vertical line of '7's with the length equal to the count of '7's in the input.
   - Shift the line vertically to center it on '1'.
4. **Combine and Paint:** Create a blank canvas and paint the horizontal line, vertical line, and the digit '1' onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  """
  Iteratively paints each digit of the lines on a blank canvas.
  """
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for j in range(colorcount(I, THREE)):
    O = paint(O, {(THREE, (one_loc[0], one_loc[1] - colorcount(I, THREE) // 2 + j))})
  for i in range(colorcount(I, SEVEN)):
    O = paint(O, {(SEVEN, (one_loc[0] - colorcount(I, SEVEN) // 2 + i, one_loc[1]))})
  return paint(O, {(ONE, one_loc)})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1':** Find the location of digit '1'.
2. **Initialize Canvas:** Create a blank canvas.
3. **Paint Horizontal Line:** Iterate through the count of '3's and paint each '3' on the canvas, calculating its position relative to the '1' to form a horizontal line.
4. **Paint Vertical Line:** Iterate through the count of '7's and paint each '7' on the canvas, calculating its position relative to the '1' to form a vertical line.
5. **Paint '1':** Paint the digit '1' at its original location.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  """
  Utilizes product and shift functions to generate line indices efficiently.
  """
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  h_indices = shift(product({0}, range(colorcount(I, THREE))), (one_loc[0], one_loc[1] - colorcount(I, THREE) // 2))
  v_indices = shift(product(range(colorcount(I, SEVEN)), {0}), (one_loc[0] - colorcount(I, SEVEN) // 2, one_loc[1]))
  h_line = recolor(THREE, h_indices)
  v_line = recolor(SEVEN, v_indices)
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), h_line | v_line | {(ONE, one_loc)})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1':** Find the location of digit '1'.
2. **Generate Line Indices:**
   - Use `product` to generate indices for horizontal and vertical lines relative to (0,0).
   - Shift the indices to center the lines on the location of '1'. 
3. **Recolor Indices:**  Recolor the generated indices with '3' for the horizontal line and '7' for the vertical line.
4. **Combine and Paint:** Create a blank canvas and paint the recolored lines and the digit '1' onto it.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  """
  Applies apply function for concise code.
  """
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  h_offset = (one_loc[0], one_loc[1] - colorcount(I, THREE) // 2)
  v_offset = (one_loc[0] - colorcount(I, SEVEN) // 2, one_loc[1])
  h_line = apply(lambda j: (THREE, add(h_offset, (0, j))), range(colorcount(I, THREE)))
  v_line = apply(lambda i: (SEVEN, add(v_offset, (i, 0))), range(colorcount(I, SEVEN)))
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), frozenset(h_line) | frozenset(v_line) | {(ONE, one_loc)})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1':** Find the location of digit '1'.
2. **Calculate Offsets:** Calculate the offsets needed to center the lines on the location of '1'.
3. **Generate Line Cells:** 
   - Use `apply` to generate cells for both lines by adding the offsets to each index of the line length.
4. **Combine and Paint:** Create a blank canvas and paint the generated lines and the digit '1' onto it.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  """
  Employs list comprehension for compact line generation.
  """
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  h_line = {(THREE, (one_loc[0], one_loc[1] - colorcount(I, THREE) // 2 + j)) for j in range(colorcount(I, THREE))}
  v_line = {(SEVEN, (one_loc[0] - colorcount(I, SEVEN) // 2 + i, one_loc[1])) for i in range(colorcount(I, SEVEN))}
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), h_line | v_line | {(ONE, one_loc)})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1':** Find the location of digit '1'.
2. **Generate Line Cells (Comprehensions):**
   - Utilize list comprehensions to efficiently generate cells for both lines based on the location of '1' and the count of '3's and '7's.
3. **Combine and Paint:** Create a blank canvas and paint the generated line cells and the digit '1' onto it. 

These five program versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and power of the DSL.
