## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the positions of digits '1', '2', and '7' in the input grid and using them as anchors to draw a cross figure. The cross consists of a vertical line of '7's, a horizontal line of '3's, and the digit '2' placed one cell to the right of the central '1'. The rest of the grid is filled with '0's. 

**Let's break it down for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0:** 
    * The '1' is located at (10, 11).
    *  Three '7's form a vertical line centered at (10,11).
    *  Three '3's form a horizontal line centered at (10,11). 
    *  '2' is placed at (11, 11).
* **Input_1:**
    * The '1' is located at (2, 3).
    * Three '7's form a vertical line centered at (2,3).
    * Three '3's form a horizontal line centered at (2,3).
    * '2' is placed at (3, 3).
* **Input_2:**
    * The '1' is located at (6, 10).
    * Three '7's form a vertical line centered at (6,10).
    * Three '3's form a horizontal line centered at (6,10).
    * '2' is placed at (7, 10).


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1:** (Using shifts and paint)

```python
def program_v1(I):
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  seven_obj = recolor(SEVEN, shift({(0, 0), (1, 0), (-1, 0)}, one_loc))
  three_obj = recolor(THREE, shift({(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)}, one_loc))
  two_obj = {(TWO, add(one_loc, RIGHT))}
  return paint(paint(paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), seven_obj), three_obj), two_obj)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Find Anchor:**  Locate the position of '1' (`one_loc`).
2.  **Create Objects:** 
    *   Create a vertical line object of '7's (`seven_obj`) centered at `one_loc`.
    *   Create a horizontal line object of '3's (`three_obj`) centered at `one_loc`.
    *   Create a single-cell object with '2' (`two_obj`) to the right of `one_loc`.
3.  **Paint:** Paint the objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input, starting with `seven_obj`, then `three_obj`, and finally `two_obj`.

**Version 2:** (Iterative painting)

```python
def program_v2(I):
  """
  Iterative approach to paint the cross.
  """
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  O = paint(O, {(ONE, one_loc), (TWO, (one_loc[0] + 1, one_loc[1]))})
  for d in [-1, 0, 1]:
    O = paint(O, {(THREE, (one_loc[0], one_loc[1] + d))})
    O = paint(O, {(SEVEN, (one_loc[0] + d, one_loc[1]))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Create an empty canvas (`O`) of the same size as the input filled with zeros.
2. **Place '1' and '2':**  Paint '1' at its location and '2' to its right directly.
3. **Iterative Painting:**  Iterate through offsets `-1`, `0`, and `1` to paint '3's horizontally and '7's vertically, centered around `one_loc`.


**Version 3:** (Using connect function)

```python
def program_v3(I):
  """
  Constructs the cross using the connect function.
  """
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  h_line = recolor(THREE, connect(add(one_loc, (-1, 0)), add(one_loc, (1, 0))))
  v_line = recolor(SEVEN, connect(add(one_loc, (0, -1)), add(one_loc, (0, 1))))
  return paint(paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), h_line), v_line | {(TWO, add(one_loc, RIGHT))})
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Find Anchor:**  Locate the position of '1' (`one_loc`).
2. **Construct Lines:** 
    *   Construct a horizontal line of '3's (`h_line`) using `connect` to draw a line between the left and right points adjacent to `one_loc`, then recolor it to '3'.
    *   Similarly, construct a vertical line of '7's (`v_line`) using `connect`, then recolor it to '7'.
3. **Paint:** Paint the lines onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input and add '2' at its designated position. 

**Version 4:** (Functional approach with compose) 

```python
def program_v4(I):
  """
  Functional approach using compose to chain operations.
  """
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  paint_cross = compose(
      paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I))),
      lambda O: paint(O, recolor(THREE, connect(add(one_loc, (-1, 0)), add(one_loc, (1, 0))))),
  )
  return compose(paint_cross, lambda O: paint(O, recolor(SEVEN, connect(add(one_loc, (0, -1)), add(one_loc, (0, 1)))) | {(TWO, add(one_loc, RIGHT))}))(I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Anchor:**  Locate the position of '1' (`one_loc`).
2. **Define Functions:**
    * Define a function `paint_cross` using `compose` that first creates a blank canvas and then paints the horizontal line of '3's.
3. **Chain Operations:** Use another `compose` to chain `paint_cross` with painting the vertical line of '7's and placing the digit '2'.

**Version 5:** (Exploiting symmetry)

```python
def program_v5(I):
  """
  Constructs one arm of the cross and then uses mirroring for efficiency.
  """
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  arm = recolor(THREE, {(one_loc[0], one_loc[1] + i) for i in range(-1, 2)})
  cross = arm | hmirror(arm)
  return paint(paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), cross), recolor(SEVEN, shift(cross, (1, 0))) | {(TWO, add(one_loc, RIGHT))})
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Find Anchor:**  Locate the position of '1' (`one_loc`).
2.  **Construct Arm:** Create one horizontal arm of the cross (`arm`) using '3's.
3.  **Mirror:**  Mirror the `arm` horizontally to create the full horizontal line of the cross.
4. **Shift and Paint:** Paint the horizontal cross, then shift it down by one unit and recolor it to '7' to create the vertical line. Finally, paint the '2' at its designated position. 

These five programs offer distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation. Each leverages different DSL functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility of the language and providing multiple solutions to the problem.
