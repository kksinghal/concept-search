## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the location of the digit '1' and creating a cross pattern centered at this location. The cross has two arms:

* **Horizontal Arm:**  Formed by the digit '3' and has a length equal to the total count of '3's in the input grid.
* **Vertical Arm:** Formed by the digit '7' and has a length equal to the total count of '7's in the input grid. 

Additionally, the digit '2' is always placed one cell to the right of the digit '1'.

**Example:**

In Input_0, there are four '3's and three '7's. Therefore, the horizontal arm of the cross has a length of 4 (using '3's), and the vertical arm has a length of 3 (using '7's), both centered at the location of '1'.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Constructs the cross using shifting and set operations.
  """
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  h_length = colorcount(I, THREE)
  v_length = colorcount(I, SEVEN)
  h_arm = recolor(THREE, {(one_loc[0], one_loc[1] + j - h_length // 2) for j in range(h_length)})
  v_arm = recolor(SEVEN, {(one_loc[0] + i - v_length // 2, one_loc[1]) for i in range(v_length)})
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), h_arm | v_arm | {(ONE, one_loc), (TWO, add(one_loc, RIGHT))})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' Location:** `one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))` finds the location of the digit '1'.
2. **Calculate Arm Lengths:** `h_length` and `v_length` store the counts of '3's and '7's, respectively, representing the arm lengths.
3. **Create Arms:** 
    * `h_arm`: Generates the horizontal arm by creating a set of indices centered at `one_loc` and spanning `h_length` cells horizontally. Then, it uses `recolor` to set the value of these indices to '3'.
    * `v_arm`: Similarly, generates the vertical arm by creating a set of indices centered at `one_loc` and spanning `v_length` cells vertically. Then, it uses `recolor` to set the value of these indices to '7'.
4. **Combine Elements:** 
    * A canvas of zeros is created with the same dimensions as the input grid: `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`.
    * The horizontal arm (`h_arm`), vertical arm (`v_arm`), digit '1' at `one_loc`, and digit '2' to the right of '1' are painted onto the canvas using `paint` and set union (`|`).

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Constructs the cross using connect function for arms.
  """
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  h_start = subtract(one_loc, (0, colorcount(I, THREE) // 2))
  v_start = subtract(one_loc, (colorcount(I, SEVEN) // 2, 0))
  h_arm = recolor(THREE, connect(h_start, add(h_start, (0, colorcount(I, THREE) - 1))))
  v_arm = recolor(SEVEN, connect(v_start, add(v_start, (colorcount(I, SEVEN) - 1, 0))))
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), h_arm | v_arm | {(ONE, one_loc), (TWO, add(one_loc, RIGHT))}) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Location and Calculate Lengths:** Similar to Version 1, this part identifies the location of '1' and calculates the lengths of the arms.
2. **Calculate Arm Starting Points:** `h_start` and `v_start` calculate the starting indices for the horizontal and vertical arms, respectively. 
3. **Create Arms Using `connect`:**
    * `h_arm`: Utilizes the `connect` function to create a horizontal line of '3's starting at `h_start` and ending at a point `h_length - 1` cells to the right.
    * `v_arm`: Similarly, uses `connect` to create a vertical line of '7's starting at `v_start` and ending at a point `v_length - 1` cells below.
4. **Combine Elements:**  This part is identical to Version 1, where the arms, '1', and '2' are painted onto a zero canvas.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Constructs the cross iteratively using paint.
  """
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), {(ONE, one_loc), (TWO, add(one_loc, RIGHT))}) 
  for j in range(colorcount(I, THREE)):
    O = paint(O, {(THREE, (one_loc[0], one_loc[1] - colorcount(I, THREE) // 2 + j))})
  for i in range(colorcount(I, SEVEN)):
    O = paint(O, {(SEVEN, (one_loc[0] - colorcount(I, SEVEN) // 2 + i, one_loc[1]))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Finds the '1' location and creates a canvas like before. The digits '1' and '2' are directly painted onto the canvas. 
2. **Iterative Arm Drawing:**
    *  Two `for` loops iterate through the required lengths of the horizontal and vertical arms.
    * Inside each loop, `paint` is used to draw a single '3' or '7' at the appropriate position calculated relative to the center (`one_loc`) and arm length.


## Program Version 4: 

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Uses functional approach with compose and lambda functions.
  """
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  h_arm = lambda O: paint(O, recolor(THREE, {(one_loc[0], one_loc[1] + j - colorcount(I, THREE) // 2) for j in range(colorcount(I, THREE))}))
  v_arm = lambda O: paint(O, recolor(SEVEN, {(one_loc[0] + i - colorcount(I, SEVEN) // 2, one_loc[1]) for i in range(colorcount(I, SEVEN))}))
  base = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), {(ONE, one_loc), (TWO, add(one_loc, RIGHT))})
  return compose(h_arm, v_arm)(base)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Location and Canvas:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Lambda Functions for Arms:** 
    * `h_arm` and `v_arm` are defined as lambda functions. Each takes a grid (`O`) as input and returns the grid with the respective arm painted on it. 
3. **Compose for Sequential Painting:**
    * `compose(h_arm, v_arm)` creates a new function that first applies `v_arm` and then `h_arm` to its input.
    * This composed function is then applied to the `base` canvas (with '1' and '2' already painted) to produce the final output.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Constructs the cross using map and lambda functions.
  """
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  h_length = colorcount(I, THREE)
  v_length = colorcount(I, SEVEN)
  h_arm = recolor(THREE, set(map(lambda j: (one_loc[0], one_loc[1] + j - h_length // 2), range(h_length))))
  v_arm = recolor(SEVEN, set(map(lambda i: (one_loc[0] + i - v_length // 2, one_loc[1]), range(v_length))))
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), h_arm | v_arm | {(ONE, one_loc), (TWO, add(one_loc, RIGHT))})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Location and Canvas:** Same as before.
2. **`map` and Lambda for Arm Generation:**
    * `h_arm`: Uses `map` and a lambda function to generate a sequence of horizontal coordinates for the arm and then converts it to a set. 
    * `v_arm`: Similar approach for the vertical arm.
3. **Combine Elements:**  Identical to previous versions, painting the elements onto the canvas.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, using various DSL functions and programming paradigms, showcasing diverse solutions to the problem.
