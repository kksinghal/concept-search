## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving the digits '3' and '7' in the input grid to cluster around the digit '1', while maintaining their relative vertical and horizontal positions with respect to the '1'.  The remaining digits are replaced with '0'.

**Example:**

* **Input:**
    ```
    0 0 0 **3** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    **3** 0 0 **2** 0 0 0 0 **3** 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 **7** 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 **3** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 **7** 0 0 0 0 0 **1** 0 0 **7**
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 **7** 0 0 0
    ```

* **Output:**
    ```
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 **3** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 **3** **2** **3** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 **3** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 **7** 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 **7** **1** **7** 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 **7** 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    ```

**Logic:**

1. Identify the location of '1'.
2. For each '3' and '7', calculate its relative position (up, down, left, right) to '1'.
3. Create a new grid filled with '0'.
4. Place '1' at its original position in the new grid.
5. Place each '3' and '7' in the new grid based on their calculated relative positions to '1'.
6. The remaining digits from the input grid are discarded, and the new grid is returned.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  threes = ofcolor(I, THREE)
  sevens = ofcolor(I, SEVEN)
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  O = paint(O, {(ONE, one_loc)})
  for three_loc in threes:
    O = paint(O, {(THREE, (one_loc[0] + three_loc[0] - one_loc[0], one_loc[1] + three_loc[1] - one_loc[1]))})
  for seven_loc in sevens:
    O = paint(O, {(SEVEN, (one_loc[0] + seven_loc[0] - one_loc[0], one_loc[1] + seven_loc[1] - one_loc[1]))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1':**  Find the location of the digit '1' in the input grid (`one_loc`).
2. **Identify '3' and '7' positions:**  Get the indices of all '3's (`threes`) and '7's (`sevens`) in the input.
3. **Create blank canvas:** Generate a new grid (`O`) filled with '0's, having the same dimensions as the input.
4. **Place '1':**  Paint the digit '1' onto the new grid at its original location (`one_loc`).
5. **Relocate '3's:**  For each '3' location (`three_loc`):
    - Calculate its relative position to '1' by subtracting the coordinates of '1' from its coordinates.
    - Paint '3' onto the new grid at the corresponding relative position from the '1' location.
6. **Relocate '7's:**  Repeat step 5 for each '7' location (`seven_loc`).
7. **Return output:**  Return the modified grid (`O`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value in {THREE, SEVEN}:
        O = paint(O, {(value, (one_loc[0] + i - one_loc[0], one_loc[1] + j - one_loc[1]))})
  return paint(O, {(ONE, one_loc)})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1':** Same as Version 1.
2. **Create blank canvas:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Iterate and relocate:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid:
   - If the cell contains '3' or '7':
     - Calculate its relative position to '1'.
     - Paint the digit onto the new grid at the corresponding relative position from '1'.
4. **Place '1':** Same as Version 1.
5. **Return output:** Same as Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), {(ONE, one_loc)})
  return paint(O,  
               mapply(lambda loc: {(THREE, (one_loc[0] + loc[0] - one_loc[0], one_loc[1] + loc[1] - one_loc[1]))},
                      ofcolor(I, THREE))
               | 
               mapply(lambda loc: {(SEVEN, (one_loc[0] + loc[0] - one_loc[0], one_loc[1] + loc[1] - one_loc[1]))}, 
                      ofcolor(I, SEVEN)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1':** Same as Version 1.
2. **Create & initialize canvas:**  Generate a new grid filled with '0's and directly paint '1' at its original location.
3. **Relocate '3's and '7's:**
  - Use `mapply` to apply a lambda function to each '3' and '7' location.
  - The lambda function calculates the relative position from '1' and returns a set containing the digit and its new coordinates.
  - Use set union (`|`) to combine the results for '3's and '7's.
4. **Paint and return:** Use `paint` to paint the relocated digits onto the canvas and return the final grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  rel_threes = apply(lambda loc: (THREE, (loc[0] - one_loc[0], loc[1] - one_loc[1])), ofcolor(I, THREE))
  rel_sevens = apply(lambda loc: (SEVEN, (loc[0] - one_loc[0], loc[1] - one_loc[1])), ofcolor(I, SEVEN))
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  O = paint(O, {(ONE, one_loc)})
  for value, (i, j) in rel_threes | rel_sevens:
    O = paint(O, {(value, (one_loc[0] + i, one_loc[1] + j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1':** Same as Version 1.
2. **Calculate relative positions:** 
   - For '3's and '7's, calculate their relative positions to '1' and store them in `rel_threes` and `rel_sevens` respectively. 
3. **Create & initialize canvas:** Same as Version 3.
4. **Iterate and paint:**  Iterate through the combined set of relative positions:
   - Extract the digit value and its relative coordinates.
   - Calculate the absolute position by adding the relative coordinates to the '1' location.
   - Paint the digit onto the new grid at the calculated absolute position.
5. **Return output:** Same as Version 1.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  return paint(
    paint(
      canvas(ZERO, shape(I)),
      {(ONE, one_loc)}
    ),
    merge(
      apply(
        lambda loc: {(THREE, (one_loc[0] + loc[0] - one_loc[0], one_loc[1] + loc[1] - one_loc[1]))},
        ofcolor(I, THREE)
      ),
      apply(
        lambda loc: {(SEVEN, (one_loc[0] + loc[0] - one_loc[0], one_loc[1] + loc[1] - one_loc[1]))},
        ofcolor(I, SEVEN)
      )
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version combines several operations into a single return statement:

1. **Locate '1':** Same as Version 1.
2. **Create, initialize, and paint:** 
   - Create a blank canvas filled with '0's.
   - Directly paint '1' onto the canvas at its original location.
   - This painted canvas will be used as the base for further painting.
3. **Relocate and merge:**
   - Use two separate `apply` calls to calculate the new positions of '3's and '7's relative to '1', similar to Version 3.
   - Merge the results of both `apply` calls using `merge`, creating a single set of relocated digits. 
4. **Paint and return:** Paint the merged set of relocated digits onto the canvas created in step 2 and return the result.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same transformation. They illustrate the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL in solving spatial reasoning problems.
