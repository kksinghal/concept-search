## Transformation Analysis:

The task is to create a program that draws a vertical line of SEVENS centered on the ONE, with a length equal to the number of THREEs in the input grid. Additionally, the program should draw a horizontal line of THREEs centered on the ONE, with a length equal to the number of TWOs in the input grid.

Here's a breakdown of the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

* There are three THREEs and one TWO in the input.
* The program draws a vertical line of three SEVENS and a horizontal line of one THREE, both centered on the ONE.

**Input_1:**

* There is one THREE and two TWOs in the input.
* The program draws a vertical line of one SEVEN and a horizontal line of three THREEs, both centered on the ONE.

**Input_2:**

* There are four THREEs and two TWOs in the input.
* The program draws a vertical line of four SEVENS and a horizontal line of three THREEs, both centered on the ONE.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Constructs horizontal and vertical lines using color counts.
  """
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  h_len = colorcount(I, TWO)
  v_len = colorcount(I, THREE)
  h_start = (one_loc[0], one_loc[1] - h_len // 2)
  v_start = (one_loc[0] - v_len // 2, one_loc[1])
  h_line = {(THREE, (h_start[0], h_start[1] + i)) for i in range(h_len)}
  v_line = {(SEVEN, (v_start[0] + i, v_start[1])) for i in range(v_len)}
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), h_line | v_line | {(ONE, one_loc)})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find ONE location:**  Identifies the location of the ONE.
2. **Calculate line lengths:** Counts the occurrences of TWOs and THREEs to determine the length of each line.
3. **Calculate line starting points:** Determines the starting coordinates for both the horizontal and vertical lines based on the ONE's location and line lengths.
4. **Generate lines:** Creates the horizontal and vertical lines as sets of (value, location) pairs.
5. **Paint lines and ONE:** Paints the lines and the ONE onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Uses recursive functions to draw lines.
  """
  def draw_h_line(O, length, start):
    if length == 0:
      return O
    return draw_h_line(paint(O, {(THREE, start)}), length - 1, (start[0], start[1] + 1))
  def draw_v_line(O, length, start):
    if length == 0:
      return O
    return draw_v_line(paint(O, {(SEVEN, start)}), length - 1, (start[0] + 1, start[1]))
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  h_len = colorcount(I, TWO)
  v_len = colorcount(I, THREE)
  h_start = (one_loc[0], one_loc[1] - h_len // 2)
  v_start = (one_loc[0] - v_len // 2, one_loc[1])
  return draw_v_line(draw_h_line(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), h_len, h_start), v_len, v_start)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define recursive line drawing functions:** `draw_h_line` and `draw_v_line` recursively paint horizontal and vertical lines.
2. **Calculate line lengths and starting points:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Draw lines recursively:**  Draws lines using the recursive functions, starting with a blank canvas.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Uses `interval` and set comprehension for line generation.
  """
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  h_len = colorcount(I, TWO)
  v_len = colorcount(I, THREE)
  h_range = interval(-h_len // 2 + one_loc[1], h_len // 2 + one_loc[1], 1) 
  v_range = interval(-v_len // 2 + one_loc[0], v_len // 2 + one_loc[0], 1) 
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), {(THREE, (one_loc[0], j)) for j in h_range} | {(SEVEN, (i, one_loc[1])) for i in v_range} | {(ONE, one_loc)})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate line lengths and ranges:** Calculates line lengths and generates ranges of column/row indices for horizontal/vertical lines.
2. **Generate lines using set comprehension:** Creates lines using set comprehension with calculated ranges and ONE's location.
3. **Paint lines and ONE:** Paints lines and the ONE onto a blank canvas.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Leverages `shift` and `recolor` for line creation.
  """
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  h_len = colorcount(I, TWO)
  v_len = colorcount(I, THREE)
  h_line = recolor(THREE, shift({(0, j) for j in range(h_len)}, (one_loc[0], one_loc[1] - h_len // 2)))
  v_line = recolor(SEVEN, shift({(i, 0) for i in range(v_len)}, (one_loc[0] - v_len // 2, one_loc[1])))
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), h_line | v_line | {(ONE, one_loc)})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate line lengths:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Create base lines at origin:** Generates base horizontal and vertical lines at the origin with calculated lengths.
3. **Shift and recolor lines:** Shifts the base lines to be centered on the ONE and recolors them to THREE and SEVEN respectively.
4. **Paint lines and ONE:** Same as previous versions.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Utilizes `connect` for line creation.
  """
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  h_len = colorcount(I, TWO)
  v_len = colorcount(I, THREE)
  h_start = (one_loc[0], one_loc[1] - h_len // 2)
  v_start = (one_loc[0] - v_len // 2, one_loc[1])
  h_end = (h_start[0], h_start[1] + h_len - 1)
  v_end = (v_start[0] + v_len - 1, v_start[1])
  h_line = recolor(THREE, connect(h_start, h_end))
  v_line = recolor(SEVEN, connect(v_start, v_end))
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), h_line | v_line | {(ONE, one_loc)})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate line lengths, start and end points:** Calculates line lengths and determines the starting and ending coordinates for both lines.
2. **Generate lines using `connect`:** Creates the lines using the `connect` function with calculated starting and ending points.
3. **Recolor lines:** Recolors the generated lines to THREE and SEVEN.
4. **Paint lines and ONE:** Same as previous versions.

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation using different DSL functions and logic, ensuring zero similarity between them.
