## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves the following steps:

1. **Identify the target object:** The target object is the object with the least common color in the trimmed input grid. 
2. **Move other objects towards the target:**  All objects, except the target object, are moved towards the target object's center of mass. The movement is constrained to a single direction: either horizontally or vertically.  Objects with color '7' are always moved horizontally.
3. **Position on a blank canvas:** The moved objects, along with the stationary target object, are then painted onto a blank canvas of the same dimensions as the input grid.

## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  target_color = leastcolor(trim(I))
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  target_obj = extract(objs, matcher(color, target_color))
  target_center = centerofmass(target_obj)

  def move_towards_target(obj):
    h, v = gravitate(obj, {target_center})  # Get horizontal and vertical components of gravitation
    return shift(obj, (h, v if color(obj) != 7 else 0))  # Move horizontally if color is 7, otherwise both directions

  moved_objs = frozenset(move_towards_target(obj) for obj in objs if obj != target_obj)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), moved_objs | {target_obj})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Similar to previous programs, it identifies the target color, objects, target object, and its center of mass.
2. **`move_towards_target` Function:** This function calculates the gravitation vector using `gravitate`. It then uses a conditional to either move the object horizontally (if color is 7) or in both directions based on the gravitation vector.
3. **Moving and Painting:**  It applies `move_towards_target` to all non-target objects and paints them, along with the target object, onto a blank canvas. 

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  target_color = leastcolor(trim(I))
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  target_obj = extract(objs, matcher(color, target_color))
  target_center = centerofmass(target_obj)

  def move_towards_target(obj):
    direction = gravitate(obj, {target_center})
    return shift(obj, (direction[0], direction[1] * (color(obj) != 7))) # Multiply vertical component by 0 if color is 7

  moved_objs = frozenset(move_towards_target(obj) for obj in objs if obj != target_obj)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), moved_objs | {target_obj})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Same as version 1.
2. **`move_towards_target` Function:** This version calculates the full gravitation vector. It then cleverly uses a boolean expression `(color(obj) != 7)` to multiply the vertical component, effectively setting it to 0 for color 7 objects.
3. **Moving and Painting:**  Similar to version 1.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  target_color = leastcolor(trim(I))
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  target_obj = extract(objs, matcher(color, target_color))
  target_center = centerofmass(target_obj)

  def move_towards_target(obj):
    return shift(obj, (gravitate(obj, {target_center})[0], 0) if color(obj) == 7 else gravitate(obj, {target_center})) # Directly use horizontal component if color is 7

  moved_objs = frozenset(move_towards_target(obj) for obj in objs if obj != target_obj)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), moved_objs | {target_obj})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Same as previous versions.
2. **`move_towards_target` Function:**  This version directly extracts and uses the horizontal component of the gravitation vector when the object color is 7. Otherwise, it uses the full gravitation vector.
3. **Moving and Painting:** Same as previous versions.


**Program Version 4**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  target_color = leastcolor(trim(I))
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  target_obj = extract(objs, matcher(color, target_color))
  target_center = centerofmass(target_obj)

  def conditional_shift(obj, direction):
    return shift(obj, (direction[0], 0)) if color(obj) == 7 else shift(obj, direction) # Separate function for conditional shifting

  moved_objs = frozenset(conditional_shift(obj, gravitate(obj, {target_center})) for obj in objs if obj != target_obj) 
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), moved_objs | {target_obj})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Similar to previous versions.
2. **`conditional_shift` Function:** This version introduces a separate function to handle the conditional shifting based on the object color.
3. **Moving and Painting:** It calculates the gravitation vector and then uses `conditional_shift` to apply the appropriate shift to each non-target object.


**Program Version 5**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  target_color = leastcolor(trim(I))
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  target_obj = extract(objs, matcher(color, target_color))
  target_center = centerofmass(target_obj)

  def move_towards_target(obj):
    direction = gravitate(obj, {target_center})
    return shift(obj, (direction[0], branch(color(obj) == 7, 0, direction[1]))) # Use branch for conditional vertical movement

  moved_objs = frozenset(move_towards_target(obj) for obj in objs if obj != target_obj)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), moved_objs | {target_obj}) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Same as previous versions.
2. **`move_towards_target` Function:** This version uses the `branch` function to conditionally set the vertical component of the movement. If the object color is 7, it moves 0 units vertically; otherwise, it uses the vertical component of the gravitation vector.
3. **Moving and Painting:** Similar to other versions.

These five program versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the same transformation in the DSL. Each version showcases a distinct logic or combination of DSL functions, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
