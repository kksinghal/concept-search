## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on moving non-background objects within the grid towards the bottom-right corner while maintaining their relative horizontal positions. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The "3" objects move downwards until they reach the bottom of the grid or encounter another object.
- The "2" object moves downwards until it touches the top of a "3" object.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The "7" objects move downwards until they reach the bottom of the grid or encounter another object.
- The "1" and "2" objects move downwards until they touch the top of another object.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- The "7" objects move downwards until they reach another object.
- The "1" object moves downwards until it touches the top of a "7" object.
- The "3" objects on the right edge remain in their original positions.
- The two "3" objects on the left move downwards until they reach the bottom of the grid or encounter another object. The "2" object moves downwards until it touches the top of the lower "3" object. 

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def drop(obj, objs):
    bottom = height(I) - 1 # Bottom of the grid
    for other in objs:
      if other != obj and hmatching(obj, other) and bottom > uppermost(other): 
        bottom = min(bottom, uppermost(other) - height(obj))
    return shift(obj, (bottom - uppermost(obj), 0))
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda obj: drop(obj, objects(I, False, True, True)), objects(I, False, True, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`drop(obj, objs)` Function:** 
   - Takes an object `obj` and a set of all objects `objs`.
   - Calculates the lowest possible position `bottom` for `obj` to move down to without overlapping other objects.
   - It starts by assuming the lowest position is the bottom of the grid.
   - It iterates through all other objects in `objs`.
   - If an `other` object is in the same column as `obj` (`hmatching`) and `bottom` is lower than the top of `other`, it updates `bottom` to be just above `other`.
   - Returns the `obj` shifted downwards to the calculated `bottom` position.

2. **Main Function:**
   - Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid `I` filled with zeros.
   - Identifies all objects in `I` using `objects(I, False, True, True)`.
   - For each object, it calls the `drop` function to determine its new position.
   - Merges all the repositioned objects using `merge`.
   - Paints the merged objects onto the blank canvas using `paint`.
   - Returns the final transformed grid.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def reachable_bottom(obj, grid):
    bottom = lowermost(obj)
    while bottom < height(grid) - 1 and index(grid, (bottom + 1, leftmost(obj))) == 0:
      bottom += 1
    return bottom
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge({shift(obj, (reachable_bottom(obj, I) - lowermost(obj), 0)) for obj in objects(I, False, True, True)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`reachable_bottom(obj, grid)` Function:**
   - Takes an object `obj` and the input grid `grid`.
   - Starts with the initial `bottom` as the lowermost row of the object.
   - Iteratively checks if the cell below the current `bottom` is empty (value 0). 
   - If empty, it moves `bottom` one row down.
   - Returns the final reachable `bottom` row index.

2. **Main Function:**
   - Creates a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid `I`.
   - Identifies all non-background objects in `I`.
   - For each object:
     - It calculates the `reachable_bottom` using the defined function.
     - It then shifts the object downwards by the difference between the `reachable_bottom` and the object's original `lowermost` point.
   - Merges all shifted objects.
   - Paints the merged objects onto the blank canvas.
   - Returns the transformed grid.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def find_landing(obj, grid):
    i, j = lrcorner(obj)
    while i < height(grid) and index(grid, (i, j)) == 0:
      i += 1
    return (i - 1, j)
  objs = objects(I, False, True, True)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(shift(obj, subtract(find_landing(obj, I), lrcorner(obj))) for obj in objs)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`find_landing(obj, grid)` Function:**
   - Takes an object `obj` and the input grid `grid`.
   - Starts from the lower-right corner (`lrcorner`) of the object.
   - Iteratively moves downwards (increasing row index `i`) as long as it encounters empty cells (value 0).
   - Returns the index of the last empty cell before hitting a non-empty cell or the grid boundary.

2. **Main Function:**
   - Creates an empty canvas of the same size as the input grid.
   - Extracts all non-background objects from the input grid.
   - For each object:
     - It calls `find_landing` to determine the position where the object should land after moving down.
     - Calculates the offset required to move the object to its landing position. 
     - Shifts the object using the calculated offset.
   - It merges all the shifted objects.
   - Paints the merged objects onto the blank canvas. 
   - Returns the final transformed grid. 

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def drop_object(obj, grid):
    landing = height(grid) - 1
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      landing = min(landing, max([row for row in range(i, height(grid)) if index(grid, (row, j)) == 0] + [i]))
    return shift(obj, (landing - uppermost(obj), 0))
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda obj: drop_object(obj, I), objects(I, False, True, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`drop_object(obj, grid)` Function:**
   - Takes an object `obj` and the input grid `grid`.
   - Determines the landing row for each column of the object by finding the highest empty cell in that column below or at the object's current position.
   - Calculates the shift needed to move the object to its landing row.
   - Returns the shifted object.

2. **Main Function:**
   - Creates a blank canvas the same size as the input grid.
   - Extracts all non-background objects from the input grid.
   - Applies `drop_object` to each object to find its new position after falling.
   - Merges all the moved objects together.
   - Paints the merged objects onto the blank canvas.
   - Returns the resulting grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def simulate_gravity(obj, grid):
    offset = (1, 0)  # Downward direction
    new_obj = shift(obj, offset)
    while not any(index(grid, loc) != 0 for loc in toindices(new_obj)):
      obj = new_obj
      new_obj = shift(obj, offset)
    return obj
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda obj: simulate_gravity(obj, I), objects(I, False, True, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`simulate_gravity(obj, grid)` Function:**
   - Takes an object `obj` and the input grid `grid`.
   - Simulates gravity by shifting the object one row down at a time.
   - Continues shifting until the object encounters a non-empty cell in the grid. 
   - Returns the object's final position before the collision.

2. **Main Function:**
   - Creates an empty canvas with the same size as the input grid.
   - Identifies all non-background objects in the input grid.
   - For each object, it calls the `simulate_gravity` function to determine its final position after falling. 
   - Merges all the repositioned objects.
   - Paints the merged objects onto the blank canvas.
   - Returns the final transformed grid.
