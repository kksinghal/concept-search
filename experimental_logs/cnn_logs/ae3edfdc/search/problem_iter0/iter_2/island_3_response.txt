## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all three examples can be described as follows:

1. **Identify Non-Zero Objects:**  The transformation focuses on objects (connected regions) formed by non-zero digits in the input grid. The background (digit '0') is ignored.

2. **Move Objects Upwards:** Each non-zero object is moved upwards until it reaches the top of the grid or encounters another non-zero object. 

3. **Retain Object Shape and Relative Position:** The shape and relative horizontal position of the objects are maintained during the transformation.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, F, T, T)
    shifted_objs = frozenset()
    for obj in objs:
        uppermost_row = uppermost(obj)
        shifted_objs = shifted_objs | shift(obj, (-uppermost_row, 0))
    O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(shifted_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objs = objects(I, F, T, T)` extracts all non-zero objects from the input grid `I`. 
2. **Shift Objects Upwards:** For each `obj` in `objs`,  `uppermost_row = uppermost(obj)` finds the topmost row index of the object. Then `shift(obj, (-uppermost_row, 0))` shifts the object upwards by `uppermost_row` units.
3. **Paint on Canvas:**  A blank canvas `canvas(0, shape(I))` of the same size as the input grid is created. All shifted objects are merged using `merge(shifted_objs)` and painted onto the canvas using `paint`.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(1, len(I)):
      for j in range(len(I[0])):
        if O[i][j] != 0:
          temp = O[i][j]
          k = i
          while k > 0 and O[k-1][j] == 0:
            k -= 1
          O = paint(cover(O, {(temp, (i, j))}), {(temp, (k, j))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Move:** The program iterates through each cell of the grid from the second row onwards. If a non-zero cell is encountered, it is moved upwards until it reaches the top or another non-zero cell.
2. **In-place Modification:**  The movement is done by painting and covering in-place on the input grid `I`, directly modifying it to become the output `O`.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
        non_zeros = tuple((I[i][j], i) for i in range(len(I)) if I[i][j] != 0)
        for k, (v, i) in enumerate(non_zeros):
            O = paint(O, {(v, (k, j))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Column-wise Processing:** This version processes the grid column by column. 
2. **Extract and Reposition:** For each column `j`, it extracts all non-zero values and their original row indices into `non_zeros`. Then, it paints these values onto the canvas `O` at the top of the column, maintaining their order.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, F, T, T)
    new_objs = frozenset(shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), 0)) for obj in objs)
    O = I
    for obj in new_objs:
        O = underpaint(O, obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Shift Objects:** Similar to Version 1, it identifies non-zero objects and shifts them upwards.
2. **Underpaint:** Instead of painting on a blank canvas, this version uses `underpaint` to paint the shifted objects onto the original grid `I`, overwriting only the background cells.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
    h, w = shape(I)
    O = canvas(0, (h, w))
    for j in range(w):
        col = tuple(I[i][j] for i in range(h))
        new_col = tuple(v for v in col if v != 0) + tuple(0 for _ in range(h - len(tuple(v for v in col if v != 0))))
        for i, v in enumerate(new_col):
            O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Column-wise Restructuring:** This version iterates through each column of the input grid and constructs a new column where non-zero values are moved to the top, followed by zeros.
2. **Construct and Paint:**  This new column is then used to paint the corresponding column in the output canvas `O`.
