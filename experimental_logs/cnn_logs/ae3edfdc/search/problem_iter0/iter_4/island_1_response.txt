## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the digit '7' and its surrounding pattern:

* **Identify '7' Columns:** The grid is divided into columns. Any column containing the digit '7' is targeted.
* **Shift '7' Right:**  The identified '7' columns are shifted to the far right of the grid, maintaining their relative order.
* **Clear Other Cells:** All cells not containing a shifted '7' are set to '0'.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  This version utilizes fjajfhafgbgdejfcjdfecacdffhcbdfi as a base, 
  then clears all non-'7' digits.
  """
  x1 = fjajfhafgbgdejfcjdfecacdffhcbdfi(I)
  O = fill(x1, ZERO, ofcolor(x1, ZERO))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Reuse Column Logic:**  The function `fjajfhafgbgdejfcjdfecacdffhcbdfi` from the provided examples is directly used. This efficiently handles the identification and right-shifting of '7' columns.
2. **Clear Non-'7's:** The `ofcolor` function identifies all cells with the value '0' (which represents all digits except the shifted '7's). `fill` then sets these cells to '0', effectively clearing them.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  This version iterates over rows, reconstructing each with '7's at the end.
  """
  O = ()
  for row in I:
    sevens = tuple(SEVEN for _ in range(row.count(SEVEN)))
    others = tuple(v for v in row if v != SEVEN)
    O = O + (others + sevens,) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Row-wise Processing:**  This version iterates through each row of the input grid.
2. **Extract and Count '7's:** For each row, it counts the occurrences of '7' and creates a tuple (`sevens`) containing that many '7's.
3. **Gather Other Digits:** Another tuple (`others`) is created, containing all digits from the row that are not '7'.
4. **Reconstruct Row:** The `others` tuple is concatenated with the `sevens` tuple, placing all '7's at the end of the new row.
5. **Assemble Output:** The reconstructed row is appended to the output grid (`O`).

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  This version uses transpose and object manipulation for '7' shifting.
  """
  x1 = dmirror(I)  # Transpose
  x2 = objects(x1, T, F, F)
  x3 = colorfilter(x2, SEVEN)
  x4 = merge(x3)
  x5 = toindices(x4)
  x6 = shift(x5, (0, width(I) - len(x5)))
  x7 = recolor(SEVEN, x6)
  x8 = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), x7)
  O = dmirror(x8)  # Transpose back
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transpose:**  The grid is transposed using `dmirror` to treat columns as rows.
2. **Extract '7' Objects:** Objects are identified in the transposed grid, and those containing '7' are filtered.
3. **Merge and Shift:** The '7' objects are merged into a single patch, its indices are extracted, and then shifted to the right edge of the transposed grid.
4. **Paint and Transpose Back:** The shifted '7's are painted onto a blank canvas, and the result is transposed back to the original orientation.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  This version uses recursion to move '7's to the right.
  """
  def move_seven(grid, offset=0):
    if offset == width(grid):
      return grid
    new_grid = tuple()
    for row in grid:
      sevens = tuple(SEVEN for _ in range(row.count(SEVEN)))
      others = tuple(v for v in row if v != SEVEN)
      new_grid = new_grid + (others + sevens,)
    return move_seven(new_grid, offset + 1)
  
  x1 = move_seven(I)
  O = fill(x1, ZERO, ofcolor(x1, ZERO)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Recursive Shifting:** This version defines a recursive function `move_seven` that shifts '7's one position to the right with each call.
2. **Base Case:**  The recursion stops when the offset reaches the grid's width, indicating all '7's have been shifted.
3. **Clear Non-'7's:** Similar to Version 1, `ofcolor` and `fill` are used to clear cells without '7's.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  This version flattens the grid, sorts, and then reshapes it.
  """
  x1 = tuple(v for row in I for v in row)
  x2 = tuple(sorted(x1, key=lambda v: 0 if v == SEVEN else 1))
  O = tuple(x2[i * width(I):(i + 1) * width(I)] for i in range(height(I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Flatten Grid:** The 2D grid is converted into a single flat tuple.
2. **Sort by '7' Priority:** The flattened tuple is sorted using a custom key function. This function prioritizes '7's, placing them at the end of the sorted tuple.
3. **Reshape:** The sorted tuple is then sliced back into rows based on the original grid's width, effectively placing all '7's in the rightmost columns.
