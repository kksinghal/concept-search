## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the least common non-zero color in the input grid (excluding the outer border) and moving all other objects towards its center of mass. Objects with color "7" are only moved horizontally towards the target.

**Example Breakdowns:**

* **Input_0:** The least common color is "2". All "3" objects gravitate towards the "2", with the "7" objects moving only horizontally towards it.
* **Input_1:**  The least common color is "2". The "7" objects move horizontally towards it, while the "3" objects gravitate fully.
* **Input_2:** The least common color is "1". The "3" objects move towards the "1", and the "7" objects move horizontally towards it.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  target_color = leastcolor(trim(I))
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  target_obj = extract(objs, matcher(color, target_color))
  target_center = centerofmass(target_obj)
  
  def move_towards_target(obj):
    h_move, v_move = gravitate(obj, {target_center})
    return shift(obj, (h_move, 0 if color(obj) == 7 else v_move))

  moved_objs = frozenset(move_towards_target(obj) for obj in objs if obj != target_obj)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), moved_objs | {target_obj})
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target:** Find the least common color in the trimmed grid and extract the object with that color.
2. **Calculate Gravitation:** For each object, calculate the horizontal and vertical movements needed to gravitate towards the target.
3. **Conditional Movement:**  Move each object based on its color. If the color is "7", move only horizontally; otherwise, move in both directions.
4. **Reconstruct Grid:** Paint the moved objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  target_color = leastcolor(trim(I))
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  target_obj = next((obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == target_color), None)
  target_center = centerofmass(target_obj) if target_obj else (0, 0) 

  def move_towards_target(obj):
    direction = gravitate(obj, {target_center})
    return shift(obj, (direction[0], direction[1] if color(obj) != 7 else 0))

  moved_objs = frozenset(move_towards_target(obj) for obj in objs)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), moved_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Target:** Similar to version 1, but uses a generator expression for potentially improved efficiency.
2. **Handle Missing Target:** Includes logic to handle cases where the target color might not be present in the grid.
3. **Simplified Movement:**  Combines horizontal and vertical movement logic into a single line using conditional indexing.
4. **Paint All Objects:**  Paints all moved objects onto the canvas without explicitly handling the target object separately. 


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  trimmed = trim(I)
  target_color = leastcolor(trimmed)
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  target_center = centerofmass(extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == target_color))

  def move_object(obj):
    h_diff, v_diff = subtract(target_center, centerofmass(obj))
    return shift(obj, (h_diff, v_diff * (color(obj) != 7)))

  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), frozenset(move_object(obj) for obj in objs)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Pre-trim Grid:** Trims the input grid upfront for efficiency.
2. **Direct Calculation:**  Calculates the difference in center of mass directly instead of using `gravitate`.
3. **Inline Conditional:**  Uses an inline conditional within `subtract` to control vertical movement based on color.
4. **Concise Painting:**  Paints all moved objects onto the canvas in a single line. 


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  tc = leastcolor(trim(I))
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  t_center = centerofmass(extract(objs, lambda o: color(o) == tc))

  def move_if_not_7(obj):
    direction = subtract(t_center, centerofmass(obj))
    return shift(obj, direction) if color(obj) != 7 else shift(obj, (direction[0], 0))
  
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), frozenset(move_if_not_7(obj) for obj in objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shorter Variable Names:**  Uses more concise variable names for improved readability.
2. **Explicit Conditional:**  Moves the conditional logic for color "7" into a separate `if-else` block within the `move_if_not_7` function.
3. **Clearer Movement:**  Separates horizontal and vertical movement calculations for improved clarity.


**Program Version 5:**
```python
def program_v5(I):
  target_color = leastcolor(trim(I))
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  target_obj = next((obj for obj in objs if color(obj) == target_color), next(iter(objs), None))
  target_center = centerofmass(target_obj)

  def move_towards_target(obj):
    if obj == target_obj:
      return obj
    direction = gravitate(obj, {target_center})
    return shift(obj, (direction[0], direction[1] if color(obj) != 7 else 0))

  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), frozenset(move_towards_target(obj) for obj in objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Default Target:**  Selects a default target object if the least common color is not found.
2. **Explicit Target Handling:**  Explicitly handles the target object within the `move_towards_target` function to avoid unnecessary calculations.
3. **Combined Movement Logic:**  Similar to version 2, combines movement logic into a single line using a conditional expression. 

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches and coding styles while achieving the same transformation logic. Each version provides a unique combination of functions and logic, making them significantly distinct from one another.
