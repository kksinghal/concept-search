## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation centers the objects made of `3`s and `7`s around the object made of `1`. It does so while maintaining the original shape and orientation of these objects.

**Example:**

Input:

```
0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
3 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 7
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0
```

Output:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 3 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 1 7 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

As you can see, the objects made of `3`s and `7`s are now centered around the `1`, while their shapes remain the same.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def center_objects(I):
  """
  Centers objects made of 3s and 7s around the object made of 1.
  """
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  three_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), THREE))
  seven_obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), SEVEN))
  three_offset = subtract(one_loc, centerofmass(three_obj))
  seven_offset = subtract(one_loc, centerofmass(seven_obj))
  return paint(paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), shift(three_obj, three_offset)), shift(seven_obj, seven_offset))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find key locations:** Identifies the location of the `1` (`one_loc`) and extracts the objects formed by `3`s (`three_obj`) and `7`s (`seven_obj`).
2. **Calculate offsets:** Computes the difference between the center of mass of the `3` and `7` objects and the location of the `1`.
3. **Shift and paint:** Creates a blank canvas, shifts the `3` and `7` objects by their respective offsets, and paints them onto the canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def center_objects(I):
  """
  Centers objects made of 3s and 7s around the object made of 1 using a loop.
  """
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  grid = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for value in (THREE, SEVEN):
    obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), value))
    offset = subtract(one_loc, centerofmass(obj))
    grid = paint(grid, shift(obj, offset))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find key location and initialize:**  Identifies the location of the `1` (`one_loc`) and initializes a blank canvas (`grid`).
2. **Iterate and center:** Loops through the values `3` and `7`, extracts the corresponding object, calculates the offset from `one_loc`, shifts the object, and paints it onto the canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def center_objects(I):
  """
  Centers objects made of 3s and 7s around the object made of 1 using apply.
  """
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)),
               merge(apply(lambda v: shift(first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), v)),
                                            subtract(one_loc, centerofmass(first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), v))))),
                          (THREE, SEVEN))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find key location:**  Identifies the location of the `1` (`one_loc`).
2. **Apply and merge:** Applies a lambda function to the values `3` and `7`. This function extracts the corresponding object, calculates the offset, shifts the object, and merges them. Finally, it paints the merged objects onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def center_objects(I):
  """
  Centers objects made of 3s and 7s around the object made of 1 using nested functions.
  """
  def center_object(value):
    obj = first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), value))
    offset = subtract(one_loc, centerofmass(obj))
    return shift(obj, offset)
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge((center_object(THREE), center_object(SEVEN))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define helper function:** Defines a nested function `center_object` that takes a color value and returns the shifted object.
2. **Find key location and apply:**  Identifies the location of the `1` (`one_loc`) and applies the `center_object` function to `3` and `7`, merging the results. It then paints the merged objects onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def center_objects(I):
  """
  Centers objects made of 3s and 7s around the object made of 1 using list comprehension.
  """
  one_loc = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  return paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)),
               merge([shift(first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), v)), subtract(one_loc, centerofmass(first(colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), v))))) for v in (THREE, SEVEN)]))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find key location:**  Identifies the location of the `1` (`one_loc`).
2. **List comprehension and merge:** Uses list comprehension to iterate through `3` and `7`, extract the corresponding objects, calculate the offsets, shift the objects, and collect them in a list. It then merges the shifted objects and paints them onto a blank canvas.

These are just a few examples, and there might be other ways to achieve the same transformation using the DSL. The key is to understand the logic behind the transformation and then utilize the provided DSL functions to implement it.
