## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving all non-background objects to the top of the grid while maintaining their relative horizontal positions. 

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 -> Output_0:** The '3' objects and the '7' object with value '1' have moved to the top of the grid. The '7' object consisting of just one cell stays in its original column. Similarly, the three-celled '3' object retains its horizontal configuration.
* **Input_1 -> Output_1:** The '7' objects and the '3' and '2' object are moved to the top. Notice how the relative horizontal spacing between the objects is maintained.
* **Input_2 -> Output_2:** Similar to the previous examples, the '7', '1', '3', and '2' objects are moved upwards.  The '3' objects, even though separated in the input, are joined at the top as they collide during the upward movement.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Extract non-background objects
  grid_height = height(I) 
  for obj in objs:
    obj_height = height(obj)
    I = move(I, obj, (-grid_height + obj_height, 0)) # Move each object to the top
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify all non-background objects using `objects(I, True, False, True)`.
2. **Calculate Movement:** Determine the required vertical shift for each object to reach the top. 
3. **Move Objects:**  Use the `move` function to shift each object to its new position at the top.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Create an empty canvas
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), 0))) # Paint each object onto the canvas at the top
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Similar to Version 1, identify the non-background objects.
2. **Create Empty Canvas:** Generate a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input using `canvas`.
3. **Paint Objects:** Shift each object to the top using `shift` and then "paint" it onto the empty canvas with the `paint` function.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  new_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    new_objs.add(shift(obj, (-uppermost(obj), 0))) # Calculate the shifted position of each object
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = cover(O, obj) # Remove original objects from the grid
  for obj in new_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj) # Paint the shifted objects onto the grid
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Get the non-background objects.
2. **Calculate Shifted Positions:** Determine the new positions of the objects at the top.
3. **Clear Original Objects:** Erase the original objects from the input grid.
4. **Paint Shifted Objects:** Draw the objects at their new positions on the cleared grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Create an empty canvas
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
      for j, value in enumerate(row):
          if value != 0: # If not a background cell
              O = paint(O, {(value, (0, j))}) # Paint the cell at the top of its column
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** Make a blank canvas of the same size as the input.
2. **Iterate and Paint:** Go through each cell of the input grid. If a cell is not part of the background, paint it directly onto the canvas at the top of its corresponding column.

**Program Version 5:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  transposed = rot90(I)  # Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise
  objs = objects(transposed, True, False, True)
  for obj in objs:
    transposed = move(transposed, obj, (0, -leftmost(obj))) # Move objects to the left edge
  return rot270(transposed)  # Rotate back to original orientation
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Rotate:** Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise using `rot90` to treat columns as rows.
2. **Move Objects:**  Move each object to the left edge (originally the top) using `move`.
3. **Rotate Back:** Rotate the grid 270 degrees clockwise using `rot270` to restore the original orientation. 


These five versions showcase diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation. Each uses a different combination of DSL functions, demonstrating flexibility in problem-solving within the given constraints.
