## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all three examples involves moving the "7" shaped object to be adjacent to the object formed by digits "2" and "3".  Here's a breakdown:

* **Movement:** The "7" object always moves to become diagonally adjacent to the "2" within the "2-3" object.
* **Orientation:** The "7" object maintains its original orientation after the move.
* **"1" Insertion:** A single "1" is inserted at the point of adjacency between the moved "7" object and the "2" digit.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct programs implementing the transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  seven_indices = ofcolor(I, 7)
  two_index = center(ofcolor(I, 2))
  move_vector = gravitate(seven_indices, {two_index})
  new_seven = shift(seven_indices, move_vector)
  adjacent_index = extract(toindices(new_seven), lambda ind: manhattan(ind, two_index) == 1)
  O = paint(paint(I, recolor(SEVEN, new_seven)), recolor(ONE, {adjacent_index}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify objects:** Get indices of the "7" object and the center index of the "2".
2.  **Calculate movement:** Use `gravitate` to determine the shift needed for adjacency.
3.  **Move "7":** Shift the "7" object using the calculated `move_vector`.
4.  **Find adjacency point:** Find the index in the moved "7" object that's adjacent to the "2".
5.  **Paint:** Paint the moved "7" and the "1" at the adjacency point onto the original grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  two_three_indices = toindices(toobject(ofcolor(I, 2) | ofcolor(I, 3), I))
  seven_indices = toindices(toobject(ofcolor(I, 7), I))
  move_vector = gravitate(seven_indices, two_three_indices)
  new_seven = shift(seven_indices, move_vector)
  adjacent_index = first(intersection(neighbors(center(two_three_indices)), new_seven))
  O = paint(paint(I, recolor(SEVEN, new_seven)), recolor(ONE, {adjacent_index}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify objects and indices:** Get indices of "2-3" object and "7" object.
2.  **Calculate movement:** Use `gravitate` to determine the shift for adjacency.
3.  **Move "7":** Shift the "7" object.
4.  **Find adjacency point:** Find the first common index between neighbors of "2-3" center and the moved "7".
5.  **Paint:** Paint the moved "7" and "1" at the adjacency point.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  seven_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 7), I)
  two_three_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2) | ofcolor(I, 3), I)
  two_index = center(ofcolor(I, 2))
  v = gravitate(toindices(seven_obj), {two_index})
  new_seven = shift(seven_obj, v)
  diff = subtract(center(toindices(new_seven)), two_index)
  adj = add(two_index, sign(diff))
  return paint(paint(I, new_seven), {(ONE, adj)})
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Get objects:** Extract "7" and "2-3" objects.
2.  **Get "2" center:** Find the center of the "2" digit.
3.  **Calculate move vector:** Use `gravitate` for the shift vector.
4.  **Move "7":** Apply the shift to the "7" object.
5.  **Calculate adjacency:** Determine the adjacency point based on relative positions.
6.  **Paint:** Paint the moved "7" and a "1" at the calculated adjacent position.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  seven_indices = ofcolor(I, 7)
  two_three_center = center(ofcolor(I, 2) | ofcolor(I, 3))
  move_dir = sign(subtract(two_three_center, center(seven_indices)))
  new_seven = shift(seven_indices, move_dir)
  while not adjacent(new_seven, {two_three_center}):
    new_seven = shift(new_seven, move_dir)
  adj_index = extract(toindices(new_seven), lambda ind: manhattan(ind, two_three_center) == 1)
  return paint(paint(I, recolor(SEVEN, new_seven)), recolor(ONE, {adj_index}))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify key locations:** Get indices of the "7" and the center of the "2-3" object.
2.  **Determine move direction:** Calculate the direction to move the "7" towards the "2-3" center.
3.  **Iteratively move:** Shift the "7" one step at a time in the determined direction until adjacent.
4.  **Find adjacency point:**  Identify the index within the moved "7" object adjacent to the "2-3" center.
5.  **Paint:** Paint the moved "7" and a "1" at the determined adjacency point.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  two_three_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 2) | ofcolor(I, 3), I)
  seven_obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 7), I)
  two_center = center(ofcolor(I, 2)) 
  move_vector = subtract(two_center, centerofmass(seven_obj))
  shifted_seven = shift(seven_obj, move_vector)
  adjacent_point = extract(toindices(shifted_seven), lambda p: manhattan(p, {two_center}) == 1)
  return paint(paint(I, shifted_seven), {(ONE, adjacent_point)})
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Extract objects:** Get the "2-3" object and the "7" object.
2.  **Find "2" center:** Determine the center of the "2" digit.
3.  **Calculate shift:**  Compute the vector to move the "7" object's center of mass to the "2" center.
4.  **Shift "7":** Apply the calculated shift to the "7" object.
5.  **Find adjacency:**  Find the index in the shifted "7" that's adjacent to the "2" center.
6.  **Paint:**  Paint the shifted "7" and a "1" at the identified adjacent point onto the original grid.
