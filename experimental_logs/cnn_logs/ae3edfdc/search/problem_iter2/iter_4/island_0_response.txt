## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects comprised of specific colors (2, 3, and 7), mirroring them either horizontally or vertically, and then placing the mirrored object at a different location on the grid. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**

- The object made of colors 2, 3, and 7 is identified.
- This object is mirrored horizontally.
- The mirrored object is shifted upwards by a specific amount and placed on the grid. 

**Input_1 - Output_1:**

- The object made of colors 2, 3, and 7 is identified.
- This object is mirrored vertically.
- The mirrored object is placed on the grid, shifted downwards and to the right.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**

- The object made of colors 2, 3, and 7 is identified.
- This object is mirrored vertically.
- The mirrored object is placed on the grid, shifted downwards.

## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") to perform the required transformations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  obj = first(sfilter(objects(I, F, F, F), lambda o: color(o) in {TWO, THREE, SEVEN}))
  if color(obj) == TWO:
    new_obj = hmirror(obj)
    O = paint(cover(I, obj), shift(new_obj, (uppermost(obj) - ONE, ZERO)))
  else:
    new_obj = vmirror(obj)
    O = paint(cover(I, obj), shift(new_obj, (height(I) - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), ZERO)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** `first(sfilter(objects(I, F, F, F), lambda o: color(o) in {TWO, THREE, SEVEN}))` finds the first object containing colors 2, 3, or 7.
2. **Mirroring:** If the object's color is 2, it's mirrored horizontally using `hmirror(obj)`. Otherwise, it's mirrored vertically using `vmirror(obj)`.
3. **Shifting:** 
    - For horizontally mirrored objects, `shift(new_obj, (uppermost(obj) - ONE, ZERO))` moves the object one row above its original position. 
    - For vertically mirrored objects, `shift(new_obj, (height(I) - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), ZERO))` places it at the bottom, aligned with the original object's leftmost column.
4. **Placement:** `paint(cover(I, obj), ...)` first covers the original object with the background color and then paints the mirrored and shifted object onto the grid.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  obj = extract(objects(I, F, F, F), lambda o: color(o) in {TWO, THREE, SEVEN})
  if color(obj) == TWO:
    new_obj = hmirror(shift(obj, (NEG_ONE, ZERO)))
  else:
    new_obj = vmirror(shift(obj, (height(I) - TWO * height(obj) - ONE, ZERO)))
  O = paint(cover(I, obj), new_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** Similar to version 1, but using `extract` instead of `first`.
2. **Shifting and Mirroring:**
    - For horizontally mirrored objects, the original object is shifted one row up (`shift(obj, (NEG_ONE, ZERO))`) before mirroring.
    - For vertically mirrored objects, it's shifted downwards using `shift(obj, (height(I) - TWO * height(obj) - ONE, ZERO))` before mirroring. 
3. **Placement:** Same as version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, F, F, F)
  obj = next((o for o in objs if color(o) in {TWO, THREE, SEVEN}), None)
  if obj is None:
    return I
  if color(obj) == TWO:
    new_obj = shift(hmirror(obj), (uppermost(obj) - ONE, ZERO))
  elif color(obj) == THREE:
    new_obj = shift(vmirror(obj), (height(I) - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj) - rightmost(vmirror(obj))))
  else:
    new_obj = shift(vmirror(obj), (height(I) - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), ZERO))
  O = paint(cover(I, obj), new_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** Similar to version 1, but using a generator expression.
2. **Mirroring and Shifting:** 
    -  Handles color 3 separately, shifting the vertically mirrored object to align with the original object's rightmost column using `rightmost(obj) - rightmost(vmirror(obj))`.
3. **Placement:** Same as version 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  for obj in objects(I, F, F, F):
    if color(obj) == TWO:
      new_obj = hmirror(obj)
      I = paint(cover(I, obj), shift(new_obj, (uppermost(obj) - ONE, ZERO)))
    elif color(obj) in {THREE, SEVEN}:
      new_obj = vmirror(obj)
      I = paint(cover(I, obj), shift(new_obj, (height(I) - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), ZERO)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Identify:** Iterates through all objects and checks if their color is 2, 3, or 7.
2. **Mirroring and Shifting:** Similar to version 1, but performs the transformations within the loop.
3. **Placement:**  Modifies the grid (`I`) directly within the loop.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  obj_list = list(objects(I, F, F, F))
  for i, obj in enumerate(obj_list):
    if color(obj) in {TWO, THREE, SEVEN}:
      if color(obj) == TWO:
        new_obj = shift(hmirror(obj), (uppermost(obj) - ONE, ZERO))
      else:
        new_obj = shift(vmirror(obj), (height(I) - height(obj) - uppermost(obj), ZERO))
      I = paint(cover(I, obj), new_obj)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object List:** Creates a list of objects from the grid.
2. **Iterate and Identify:** Similar to version 4, iterates through the object list and identifies the target object.
3. **Mirroring and Shifting:** Same as version 1.
4. **Placement:** Same as version 4.


These five versions offer different approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing diverse DSL function combinations and logic. This fulfills the requirement of having significantly different code versions.
