## Transformation Analysis:

**General Transformation:**

The transformation identifies the smallest object on the grid, replaces it with 1s, and then draws a vertical line centered on the smallest object's center. The endpoints of this line are marked with 3s. A 2 is placed one unit below the center of the original object. 

**Specific Transformations:**

* **Input 0:**  The smallest object (the '7's) is replaced by 1s. A vertical line of 3s is drawn through the center of where the object was, with a single 2 below the center point. 
* **Input 1:** Similar to Input 0, but the smallest object is a single '1'.
* **Input 2:** Again, similar to the above, but demonstrating the transformation functions correctly even when the smallest object is not perfectly symmetrical.

## Program_to_be_generated: 

Let's break down the required logic step-by-step and write the code using the DSL provided.

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  smallest_obj = argmin(objects(I, True, True, True), lambda obj: len(obj))  # Find the smallest object
  O = paint(cover(I, smallest_obj), recolor(1, smallest_obj)) # Replace smallest object with 1s
  center_i, center_j = center(toindices(smallest_obj)) # Get center coordinates
  v_line = frozenset((i, center_j) for i in range(center_i - height(smallest_obj) // 2, 
                                                  center_i + height(smallest_obj) // 2 + 1)) # Create vertical line indices
  O = paint(O, recolor(3, frozenset({(uppermost(v_line), center_j), 
                                   (lowermost(v_line), center_j)}))) # Paint endpoints with 3s
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, frozenset({(center_i + 1, center_j)}))) # Place the 2 marker
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find the smallest object:**
   - `objects(I, True, True, True)`:  Identifies all objects in the grid `I`.  `True, True, True` specifies that objects can be multi-valued, diagonally connected, and the background should be excluded.
   - `argmin(objects(...), lambda obj: len(obj))`:  Finds the object with the minimum size (number of cells).

2. **Replace the smallest object with 1s:**
   - `cover(I, smallest_obj)`:  Replaces the cells belonging to the `smallest_obj` with the background color.
   - `recolor(1, smallest_obj)`:  Creates a new object with the same shape as `smallest_obj` but with all cells having a value of 1.
   - `paint(cover(...), recolor(...))`:  Combines the above steps to replace the smallest object with 1s.

3. **Get Center Coordinates:**
   - `toindices(smallest_obj)`: Converts the object representation to a set of cell indices.
   - `center(toindices(...))`:  Calculates the center coordinates (row, column) of the smallest object.

4. **Create Vertical Line Indices:**
   -  This code generates a set of indices that form a vertical line centered on the smallest object's center and extending vertically to cover the entire height of the smallest object.

5. **Paint Endpoints and 2 Marker:**
   - `(uppermost(v_line), center_j)` and  `(lowermost(v_line), center_j)` get the indices of the top and bottom points of the vertical line.
   -  The code then recolors these endpoints to 3 and places a 2 one unit below the center.

6. **Return the Modified Grid:**
   -  The function returns the modified grid `O`.
