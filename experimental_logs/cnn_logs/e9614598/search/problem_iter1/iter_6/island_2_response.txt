## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the positions of the digit '1' in the input grid and then drawing a horizontal line of '3's, three cells long, starting two cells to the right of each '1'. The original '1's remain unchanged. 

**Example:**

In Input_0, there are two '1's:
- At position (4, 1)
- At position (4, 7)

The output grid fills the following positions with '3's:
- (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5) for the first '1'
- (4, 9) goes out of bounds for the second '1' and is ignored.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

### **Program Version 1:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Get indices of '1's
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Generate shifted indices for the line
  shifted_indices = mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + 2 + i) for i in range(3)}, ones)
  # Fill the shifted indices with '3'
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(shifted_indices)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1's:** We use `ofcolor(I, ONE)` to get the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **Shift Indices:** For each '1' location, we generate three new indices shifted two positions to the right using `(loc[0], loc[1] + 2 + i) for i in range(3)`.
3. **Fill with '3's:** We merge all the shifted indices and use `fill(I, THREE, ...)` to replace the corresponding cells in the input grid with '3's. 

### **Program Version 2:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find '1' locations
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Create horizontal lines of length 3, shifted by 2
  lines = mapply(lambda loc: connect(loc, (loc[0], loc[1] + 4)), ones)
  # Remove the first two elements of each line (original '1' and the cell next to it)
  trimmed_lines = mapply(lambda line: set(list(line)[2:]), lines)
  # Fill the trimmed lines with '3's
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(trimmed_lines))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1's:**  Similar to Version 1, we first find all '1' positions.
2. **Generate Lines:** For each '1', we create a horizontal line of length 5 using `connect` (ensuring we cover the desired three cells after trimming).
3. **Trim Lines:** We remove the first two elements of each line to exclude the original '1' and its right neighbor.
4. **Fill with '3's:** Similar to Version 1, we merge and fill the remaining indices with '3's.

### **Program Version 3:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Identify '1' indices
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Create a shifted grid with '1's moved two cells to the right
  shifted_grid = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), recolor(ONE, shift(ones, (0, 2))))
  # Find overlapping '1's between original and shifted grid
  overlap = intersection(ones, ofcolor(shifted_grid, ONE))
  # Extend horizontal lines of '3's from overlapping '1's
  lines = mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + i) for i in range(3)}, overlap)
  # Fill the lines in the original grid with '3's
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(lines))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1's:**  Locate all '1' positions in the input grid.
2. **Shift and Paint:** Create a new grid filled with '0's and paint the '1's shifted two cells to the right.
3. **Find Overlap:**  Find the indices where '1's exist in both the original and the shifted grids.
4. **Extend Lines:** Draw horizontal lines of '3's, three cells long, from each overlapping '1' position.
5. **Fill Grid:** Fill the identified lines in the original grid with '3's. 

### **Program Version 4:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Get '1' indices
    ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
    # Create pairs of original and shifted indices 
    pairs = mapply(lambda loc: ((loc[0], loc[1]), (loc[0], loc[1] + 2)), ones)
    # Filter out pairs where the shifted index is out of bounds
    valid_pairs = sfilter(pairs, lambda pair: pair[1][1] < len(I[0]))
    # Extract the shifted indices from valid pairs
    shifted_indices = mapply(lambda pair: {pair[1] + (i,) for i in range(3)}, valid_pairs)
    # Fill the original grid with '3's at the shifted indices
    O = fill(I, THREE, merge(shifted_indices))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get '1' Indices:** Locate all '1' positions in the input grid.
2. **Create Pairs:** Generate pairs of indices, where the first element is the original '1' location and the second is shifted two positions to the right.
3. **Filter Valid Pairs:**  Remove pairs where the shifted index goes out of bounds of the grid.
4. **Extract Shifted Indices:** Get the shifted indices from the valid pairs and generate the three indices for the line.
5. **Fill Grid:** Fill the original grid with '3's at the valid shifted indices.


### **Program Version 5:** 

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Get indices of '1's
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Generate shifted indices with possible out-of-bounds
  all_shifted = mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + 2 + i) for i in range(3)}, ones)
  # Filter out-of-bounds indices
  in_bounds_indices = sfilter(merge(all_shifted), lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]))
  # Fill the in-bounds indices with '3'
  O = fill(I, THREE, in_bounds_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get '1' Indices:**  Similar to previous versions, we first identify '1' positions.
2. **Generate All Shifted Indices:**  Create all shifted indices, even those that might be out of bounds.
3. **Filter In-Bounds Indices:**  Remove any indices that fall outside the grid's boundaries.
4. **Fill Grid:** Fill the remaining in-bounds indices with '3's in the original grid.


These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. Each version provides a unique solution using different combinations of DSL functions.
