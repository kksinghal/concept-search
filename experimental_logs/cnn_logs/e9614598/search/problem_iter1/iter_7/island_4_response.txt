## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves drawing a cross shape centered on each object in the input grid. The cross extends horizontally to the edges of the object and vertically one cell above and below the center. The cross is drawn in the color of the object it's based on.

**Input_0 Example:**

* **Object:** The single object is represented by the '1's.
* **Cross:** A cross is drawn centered on the object, extending horizontally from the leftmost '1' to the rightmost '1'. Vertically, it extends one cell above and below the center of the object.

**Input_1 Example:**

* **Object:** Two separate objects are represented by the '1's.
* **Cross:**  A cross is drawn on each object, following the same rules as in Input_0. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  def make_cross(obj):
    c_i, c_j = centerofmass(obj)
    return recolor(color(obj), frozenset(
        {(c_i, j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)} |
        {(i, c_j) for i in range(c_i - 1, c_i + 2)}))
  crosses = mapply(lambda obj: toobject(make_cross(obj), I), objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(crosses))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Identifies all foreground objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`make_cross(obj)`:** 
    *  Calculates the center of mass (`c_i`, `c_j`) of the object.
    * Generates two sets of indices: one for the horizontal line of the cross and one for the vertical line.
    * Colors the generated indices with the object's color.
3. **`mapply(...)`:**  Applies the `make_cross` function to each object and converts the resulting indices into objects using `toobject`.
4. **`merge(crosses)`:** Combines all cross objects into a single set.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the combined cross objects onto the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    c_i, c_j = centerofmass(obj)
    O = fill(O, color(obj), frozenset(
        {(c_i, j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)}))
    O = fill(O, color(obj), frozenset({(c_i - 1, c_j), (c_i, c_j), (c_i + 1, c_j)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:**  Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in fgpartition(I):`:** Iterates through each foreground object in the input grid.
3. **`c_i, c_j = centerofmass(obj)`:** Calculates the object's center of mass.
4. **`O = fill(...)`:**  Fills the output grid with the object's color at the calculated indices for the horizontal and vertical lines of the cross.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def draw_cross(obj):
    c_i, c_j = centerofmass(obj)
    h_line = connect((c_i, leftmost(obj)), (c_i, rightmost(obj)))
    v_line = connect((c_i - 1, c_j), (c_i + 1, c_j))
    return toobject(recolor(color(obj), h_line | v_line), I)
  return paint(I, merge(mapply(draw_cross, fgpartition(I)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`draw_cross(obj)`:**
   * Calculates the center of mass of the object.
   * Uses `connect` to create the horizontal and vertical lines of the cross.
   * Combines the lines using set union (`|`).
   * Colors the combined lines with the object's color.
   * Converts the result to an object using `toobject`.
2. **`mapply(draw_cross, fgpartition(I))`:**  Applies the `draw_cross` function to each foreground object in the input grid.
3. **`merge(...)`:** Combines all cross objects into a single set.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the combined cross objects onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  crosses = set()
  for obj in objs:
    ci, cj = centerofmass(obj)
    cross =  {(ci, j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)}
    cross |= {(ci - 1, cj), (ci, cj), (ci + 1, cj)}
    crosses.add(recolor(color(obj), cross))
  return paint(I, merge(mapply(lambda x: toobject(x, I), crosses)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:**  Identifies all foreground objects.
2. **`crosses = set()`:** Initializes an empty set to store the cross objects.
3. **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterates through each object.
4. **`ci, cj = centerofmass(obj)`:**  Calculates the object's center of mass.
5. **`cross = ...`:**  Generates the indices for the cross shape.
6. **`crosses.add(...)`:**  Adds the re-colored cross to the `crosses` set.
7. **`paint(I, merge(mapply(lambda x: toobject(x, I), crosses)))`:** Paints the combined cross objects onto the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def cross_indices(obj):
    ci, cj = centerofmass(obj)
    width = rightmost(obj) - leftmost(obj) + 1
    return {(ci, cj + j - width // 2) for j in range(width)} | {(ci - 1, cj), (ci, cj), (ci + 1, cj)}
  return paint(I, merge(
      toobject(recolor(color(obj), cross_indices(obj)), I) for obj in fgpartition(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`cross_indices(obj)`:** 
   * Calculates the object's center of mass and width.
   * Generates indices for the horizontal and vertical lines of the cross.
2. **`paint(I, merge(...))`:** Paints the combined cross objects onto the input grid.
   * `toobject(recolor(color(obj), cross_indices(obj)), I)`:  Creates the colored cross object for each foreground object.
   * `merge(...)`: Combines all cross objects.

These five programs demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility of the provided DSL.
