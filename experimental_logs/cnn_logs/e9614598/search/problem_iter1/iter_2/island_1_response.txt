## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same color, excluding the background) and drawing a plus sign within the bounding box of each object. The plus sign extends to the edges of the bounding box, but only within the object itself, meaning it does not color the background.

**Input_0:** Two single-cell objects (color 1) are identified. For each, a plus sign (color 3) is drawn within the object's bounding box.

**Input_1:** Two single-cell objects (color 1) are identified. For each, a plus sign (color 3) is drawn within the object's bounding box.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  
  def draw_plus(obj):
    ul = ulcorner(obj)
    lr = lrcorner(obj)
    center_i = (ul[0] + lr[0]) // 2
    center_j = (ul[1] + lr[1]) // 2
    return (connect((center_i, ul[1]), (center_i, lr[1])) | connect((ul[0], center_j), (lr[0], center_j))) & toindices(obj)
  plus_indices = mapply(draw_plus, objs)
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(plus_indices)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies objects in the input grid `I`, treating diagonally adjacent cells of the same color as separate objects (T, F), and excluding the background color (T).
2. **`draw_plus(obj)`:** Defines a function that takes an object as input and returns the indices of its plus sign.
    - It calculates the upper-left (`ul`) and lower-right (`lr`) corners of the object's bounding box.
    - It calculates the center point (`center_i`, `center_j`) of the bounding box.
    - It draws horizontal and vertical lines spanning the bounding box using `connect` and intersects the result with the object's indices (`toindices(obj)`) to ensure the plus sign stays within the object.
3. **`plus_indices = mapply(draw_plus, objs)`:** Applies the `draw_plus` function to each object in `objs` and merges the resulting sets of indices.
4. **`return fill(I, THREE, merge(plus_indices))`:** Fills the input grid `I` with the color `THREE` at the indices specified by `plus_indices`.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  def draw_plus(obj):
    c = centerofmass(obj)
    return frozenset(
        (i, j)
        for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)
        for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)
        if i == c[0] or j == c[1]
    ) & toindices(obj)
  plus_signs = mapply(draw_plus, objs)
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(plus_signs))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a different approach to calculate the plus sign indices by iterating through all indices within the object's bounding box and selecting those that align with either the horizontal or vertical center line. 

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  def draw_plus(obj):
    c = center(obj)
    return (hfrontier(c) | vfrontier(c)) & toindices(obj)
  plus_indices = mapply(draw_plus, objs)
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(plus_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages the `hfrontier` and `vfrontier` functions to generate horizontal and vertical lines extending indefinitely from the object's center and then intersects them with the object's indices. This achieves the same result as connecting the bounding box edges but with a more concise syntax.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  def draw_plus(obj):
    ul = ulcorner(obj)
    lr = lrcorner(obj)
    h_line = connect((ul[0], ul[1]), (ul[0], lr[1]))
    v_line = connect((ul[0], ul[1]), (lr[0], ul[1]))
    return ((h_line | v_line) & toindices(obj))
  plus_indices = mapply(draw_plus, objs)
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(plus_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

This version draws lines from the upper-left corner of each object's bounding box to its opposite edges, creating a cross shape. This cross is then intersected with the object's actual indices to form the plus sign. 

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  def draw_plus(obj):
    return box(obj) & (shoot(center(obj), (1, 0)) | shoot(center(obj), (0, 1)))
  plus_indices = mapply(draw_plus, objs)
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(plus_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses `shoot` function to draw lines from the object's center in both horizontal and vertical directions. It then intersects these lines with the object's bounding box (`box`) to obtain the plus sign indices within the object.
