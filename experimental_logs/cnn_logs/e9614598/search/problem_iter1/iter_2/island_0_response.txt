## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

The transformation identifies any horizontal line of '1's and replaces it with a horizontal line of '3's, centered on the original line. The new line is one cell longer on each side than the original.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

Similar to the first transformation, but this time it operates on vertical lines of '1's, replacing them with vertical lines of '3's centered on the original line and extending one cell above and below.

## Program to be Generated:

### Version 1: 
**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  if not ones:
    return I
  is_horizontal = hline(ones)
  line_center = centerofmass(ones)
  half_length = (width(ones) // 2) + 1

  if is_horizontal:
    newline = {(THREE, (line_center[0], j)) for j in range(line_center[1] - half_length, line_center[1] + half_length)}
  else:
    newline = {(THREE, (i, line_center[1])) for i in range(line_center[0] - half_length, line_center[0] + half_length)}

  return underfill(I, THREE, newline)
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find the '1's:** `ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)` identifies the locations of all '1's in the input grid.
2. **Handle empty case:** `if not ones: return I` If there are no '1's, the input is returned unchanged.
3. **Determine line orientation:** `is_horizontal = hline(ones)` checks if the '1's form a horizontal line.
4. **Calculate line center:** `line_center = centerofmass(ones)` finds the center point of the line of '1's.
5. **Calculate half-length:**  `half_length = (width(ones) // 2) + 1` gets the half-length of the new line (including the extension).
6. **Create new line:** Depending on `is_horizontal`, it creates a set of indices for a horizontal or vertical line of '3's centered on `line_center` and extending `half_length` in each direction.
7. **Fill the grid:** `return underfill(I, THREE, newline)` fills the input grid with '3's at the calculated indices of the new line.

### Version 2:
**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  new_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == ONE:
      center_i, center_j = centerofmass(obj)
      h, w = height(obj), width(obj)
      new_h, new_w = h + 2, w + 2
      new_obj = set()
      for i in range(center_i - new_h // 2, center_i + new_h // 2 + new_h % 2):
        for j in range(center_j - new_w // 2, center_j + new_w // 2 + new_w % 2):
          new_obj.add((THREE, (i, j)))
      new_objs.add(frozenset(new_obj))
  return paint(I, merge(new_objs))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify objects:** `objs = objects(I, True, False, False)` finds all connected objects of the same color in the input grid.
2. **Iterate through objects:** It iterates through each object `obj` in the set of objects `objs`.
3. **Process objects of color ONE:**  If the color of the object is ONE (`color(obj) == ONE`):
    - Calculate center, height, and width of the object.
    - Calculate new height and width, adding 2 to each.
    - Create a new object `new_obj` with color THREE, centered on the original object and with the new dimensions.
    - Add the `new_obj` to the set of `new_objs`.
4. **Paint the objects:** `return paint(I, merge(new_objs))` paints all the new objects onto the input grid, effectively replacing the original objects with the expanded versions.

### Version 3:
**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for i, r in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(r):
      if v == ONE:
        I = underfill(I, THREE, {(THREE, (i - 1, j - 1)), (THREE, (i - 1, j)), (THREE, (i - 1, j + 1)),
                         (THREE, (i, j - 1)), (THREE, (i, j)), (THREE, (i, j + 1)),
                         (THREE, (i + 1, j - 1)), (THREE, (i + 1, j)), (THREE, (i + 1, j + 1))})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through cells:** It iterates through each cell in the grid using nested loops.
2. **Check for '1's:**  If a cell contains '1' (`v == ONE`):
    - It constructs a set of indices representing a 3x3 square centered on the current cell.
    - It uses `underfill` to replace any '0's within this 3x3 square with '3's. This effectively expands the '1' into a plus-shaped object. 
3. **Return modified grid:** After processing all cells, it returns the modified grid.


### Version 4:
**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  if not ones:
    return I
  is_horizontal = hline(ones)
  min_j = leftmost(ones)
  max_j = rightmost(ones)
  min_i = uppermost(ones)
  max_i = lowermost(ones)
  if is_horizontal:
    newline =  {(THREE, (min_i, j)) for j in range(min_j - 1, max_j + 2)}
  else:
    newline =  {(THREE, (i, min_j)) for i in range(min_i - 1, max_i + 2)}
  return underfill(I, THREE, newline)
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Find '1's and handle empty case:** Similar to previous versions, it identifies '1's and handles cases with no '1's.
2. **Determine line orientation:** Similar to before, it checks if '1's form a horizontal line.
3. **Find extreme indices:** It finds the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the '1's. 
4. **Create new line:** Based on the orientation, it creates a set of indices representing a line extending one cell beyond the extreme indices of the original '1's line.
5. **Fill the grid:**  Similar to previous versions, it uses `underfill` to replace '0's at the new line indices with '3's.


### Version 5:
**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  if not one_indices:
    return I

  line = toobject(one_indices, I)
  if hline(line):
    expanded_line = {(THREE, (i, j)) for _, (i, j) in line for k in range(-1, 2)}
  else:
    expanded_line = {(THREE, (i, j)) for _, (i, j) in line for k in range(-1, 2)}

  return underpaint(I, expanded_line)
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find '1's and handle empty case:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Create object from indices:** It creates an object `line` representing the '1's using their indices and the input grid.
3. **Determine line orientation and expand:**  Based on the orientation, it creates a new object `expanded_line` where each cell of the original line is expanded horizontally or vertically by one cell in each direction.
4. **Underpaint with new object:** It uses `underpaint` to apply the `expanded_line` to the input grid, replacing only background cells ('0's) with the new color '3'.
