## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves the following steps:

1. **Identify Objects:** The input grid is analyzed to identify distinct objects, where an object is defined as a group of connected cells with the same digit value (excluding the background color, which is typically the most frequent color).

2. **Draw Crosses:**  For each identified object, a cross shape is drawn with the object's color. 
    * The horizontal line of the cross spans the entire width of the object, centered on the object's center of mass.
    * The vertical line of the cross extends one cell above and below the center of mass.

3. **Paint Grid:** The original input grid is then overlaid with the drawn crosses.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  def make_cross(obj):
    c_i, c_j = centerofmass(obj)
    cross = {(c_i, j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)}
    cross.update({(c_i - 1, c_j), (c_i, c_j), (c_i + 1, c_j)})
    return recolor(color(obj), cross)
  crosses = mapply(make_cross, fgpartition(I))
  return paint(I, merge(toobject(c, I) for c in crosses))
```

**Explanation:**

* **`make_cross(obj)` function:** This function takes an object as input and returns a cross-shaped patch with the object's color. 
    * It calculates the center of mass (`c_i`, `c_j`) of the object.
    * It creates a set of indices representing the horizontal line of the cross, spanning the width of the object.
    * It adds indices for the vertical line of the cross, one cell above and below the center of mass.
    * It uses `recolor` to assign the object's color to the cross-shaped patch.

* **Main program:**
    * It identifies foreground objects using `fgpartition`.
    * It applies the `make_cross` function to each object using `mapply`.
    * It converts the resulting cross patches to objects using `toobject`.
    * It merges all cross objects using `merge`.
    * Finally, it paints the merged cross object onto the original input grid using `paint`.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, merge(toobject(recolor(color(obj),
                                          {(centerofmass(obj)[0], j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)} |
                                          {(centerofmass(obj)[0] + i, centerofmass(obj)[1]) for i in range(-1, 2)}), I)
                           for obj in fgpartition(I)))

```

**Explanation:**

* This version compresses the logic into a single line by using generator expressions. 
* It iterates through each object from `fgpartition(I)`.
* For each object, it:
    * Calculates the `centerofmass`.
    * Generates indices for the horizontal line using a set comprehension.
    * Generates indices for the vertical line using another set comprehension.
    * Uses `recolor` to apply the object's color to the combined indices.
    * Uses `toobject` to convert the colored indices to an object.
* All the resulting cross objects are then `merged` and `painted` onto the input grid.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  def cross_patch(obj):
    ci, cj = centerofmass(obj)
    return (connect((ci, leftmost(obj)), (ci, rightmost(obj))) |
            connect((ci - 1, cj), (ci + 1, cj)))
  return paint(I, merge(toobject(recolor(color(obj), cross_patch(obj)), I)
                          for obj in fgpartition(I)))

```

**Explanation:**

* This version introduces a `cross_patch` function to encapsulate the cross generation logic.
* **`cross_patch(obj)` function:** 
    * It calculates the center of mass (`ci`, `cj`) of the input object.
    * It uses the `connect` function to create the horizontal and vertical lines of the cross based on the object's boundaries and center of mass.
    * It combines both lines using set union (`|`) and returns the resulting cross-shaped patch. 
* The main program follows the same structure as previous versions, using `fgpartition`, `color`, `recolor`, `toobject`, `merge`, and `paint` to apply the transformation.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  crosses = set()
  for obj in objs:
    ci, cj = centerofmass(obj)
    h_line = {(ci, j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)}
    v_line = {(ci + i, cj) for i in range(-1, 2)}
    crosses.add(toobject(recolor(color(obj), h_line | v_line), I))
  return paint(I, merge(crosses))
```

**Explanation:**

* This version uses a more explicit approach by iterating through objects and building the crosses step-by-step.
* It initializes an empty set `crosses` to store the generated cross objects.
* For each object obtained from `fgpartition(I)`:
    * It calculates the `centerofmass`.
    * It generates the horizontal line `h_line` and vertical line `v_line` of the cross separately using set comprehensions.
    * It combines `h_line` and `v_line` using set union (`|`).
    * It uses `recolor` to apply the object's color to the combined line indices.
    * It converts the colored indices to an object using `toobject` and adds it to the `crosses` set.
* Finally, it merges all cross objects from the `crosses` set and paints them onto the input grid.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  def cross_obj(obj):
    ci, cj = centerofmass(obj)
    width = rightmost(obj) - leftmost(obj) + 1
    return toobject(recolor(color(obj),
                           {(ci, cj + j - width // 2) for j in range(width)} | 
                           {(ci + i, cj) for i in range(-1, 2)}), I)
  return paint(I, merge(cross_obj(obj) for obj in fgpartition(I)))

```

**Explanation:**

* This version defines a function `cross_obj` that directly generates the cross object.
* **`cross_obj(obj)` function:**
    * It calculates the center of mass (`ci`, `cj`) and the width of the input object.
    * It generates indices for both horizontal and vertical lines using set comprehensions, directly incorporating the width and center of mass calculations for concise code.
    * It uses `recolor` to apply the object's color to the combined indices.
    * It converts the colored indices to an object using `toobject` and returns the result.
* The main program applies this function to each foreground object using a generator expression and then uses `merge` and `paint` to finalize the transformation on the input grid. 

These five different versions demonstrate various ways to achieve the same transformation using the DSL. Each version offers a unique approach in terms of code structure, function usage, and level of abstraction, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
