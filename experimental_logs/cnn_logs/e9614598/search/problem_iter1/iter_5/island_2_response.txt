## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the '1' cells in the input grid and extends a horizontal line of '3's to the right from those cells. 

**Input_0:** Two '1' cells are present.  A horizontal line of three '3's (including the original '1' position) is drawn to the right from each '1'.

**Input_1:** Again, two '1' cells exist. The same logic applies â€“ a three-cell horizontal line of '3's extends rightward from each '1'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:** (Inspired by Program_A's shifting logic)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find indices of '1's
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Generate horizontal lines of length 3 starting from '1's
  lines = mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + i) for i in range(3)}, ones)
  # Fill those lines with '3' on the original grid
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(lines))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' cells:** We use `ofcolor(I, ONE)` to find the indices of all cells containing the value '1'.
2. **Generate lines:**  For each '1' cell (using `mapply`), we generate a set of indices representing a horizontal line extending three cells to the right.
3. **Fill lines:** We use `merge` to combine all the generated line indices and then `fill` to change the values at those indices to '3' in the original grid. 

**Version 2:** (Leveraging `hfrontier` and set operations)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Get '1' indices
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Extend a horizontal line to the right for each '1'
  extensions = mapply(lambda loc: hfrontier((loc[0], loc[1])) & {(i, loc[1]) for i in range(loc[0], loc[0] + 3)}, ones)
  # Fill the extended cells with '3'
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(extensions))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1's:**  Like before, `ofcolor` finds the '1' cell indices.
2. **Horizontal extensions:**  For each '1', we use `hfrontier` to get an infinite horizontal line.  We then intersect this line with a set of indices representing the three cells to the right of the '1', effectively "cutting" the line to the desired length.
3. **Fill:**  `merge` combines the line segments, and `fill` paints them with '3'.

**Version 3:** (Using `connect` for line generation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Locate the '1' cells
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE) 
  # For each '1', draw a line 3 cells long to the right
  lines = mapply(lambda loc: connect(loc, (loc[0], loc[1] + 2)), ones)
  # Fill the lines with '3's 
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(lines))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1's:**  `ofcolor` locates the '1' cells.
2. **Connect for lines:** We use `connect` to draw a line from each '1' cell to a point two cells to its right, effectively creating the desired three-cell line.
3. **Fill:** Similar to previous versions, we `merge` and `fill` to paint the lines.

**Version 4:** (Direct index manipulation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find '1' cell coordinates
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE) 
  # Create a set of indices to be filled
  fill_indices = set()
  for i, j in ones:
    for k in range(3):
      fill_indices.add((i, j + k))
  # Fill the indices with '3'
  O = fill(I, THREE, frozenset(fill_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **'1' locations:**  We get the '1' cell indices with `ofcolor`.
2. **Manual index generation:**  We iterate through each '1' and use nested loops to directly calculate the indices of the three-cell line to its right.
3. **Fill:** After converting to a frozenset, we use `fill` to place '3's at the calculated indices.

**Version 5:** (Using `shift` multiple times)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Identify the '1' cells
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Shift '1' positions one and two steps to the right
  shifted_ones_1 = shift(ones, RIGHT)
  shifted_ones_2 = shift(shifted_ones_1, RIGHT)
  # Combine original and shifted positions
  all_positions = merge([ones, shifted_ones_1, shifted_ones_2])
  # Fill combined positions with '3'
  O = fill(I, THREE, all_positions)
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **Find '1's:**  `ofcolor` gets the '1' cell indices.
2. **Cascading shifts:** We use `shift` twice to get indices one and two positions to the right of each '1'.
3. **Combine and fill:** We `merge` the original and shifted indices and then use `fill` to paint them with '3'.
