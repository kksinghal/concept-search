## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying cells with value '1' and creating a plus-shaped pattern around them filled with the value '3'. The plus shape does not include the original '1' cell itself.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. Identify the '1' cells at (4,1) and (4,7).
2. Create a plus shape around each '1' cell, excluding the '1' itself, using the value '3'. 
3. The resulting grid has '3' values at (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4) and (5,5).

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. Identify the '1' cells at (0,3) and (8,3).
2. Create a plus shape around each '1' cell, excluding the '1' itself, using the value '3'.
3. The resulting grid has '3' values at (1,3), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,3) and (6,3).


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Identify cells with value '1'
    ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
    # Generate indices for the plus shape around each '1' cell
    plus_shape = mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0] - 1, loc[1]), (loc[0] + 1, loc[1]), (loc[0], loc[1] - 1), (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)}, ones)
    # Fill the identified indices with '3' on the original grid
    O = fill(I, THREE, merge(plus_shape)) 
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)`: Identifies the indices of cells with the value '1'.
2. `plus_shape = mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0] - 1, loc[1]), (loc[0] + 1, loc[1]), (loc[0], loc[1] - 1), (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)}, ones)`: For each '1' cell index, this generates a set of indices forming the plus shape around it.
3. `O = fill(I, THREE, merge(plus_shape))`: Merges all plus shape indices and fills them with '3' on the original grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the locations of '1's
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Define a function to generate the plus shape indices around a location
  def make_plus(loc):
    i, j = loc
    return {(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)}
  # Generate the plus shapes around all '1's
  plus_shapes = mapply(make_plus, ones)
  # Fill the plus shapes with '3'
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(plus_shapes))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)`: Identifies the indices of cells with the value '1'.
2. `def make_plus(loc):`: Defines a function that takes a location and returns a set of indices forming a plus shape around it.
3. `plus_shapes = mapply(make_plus, ones)`: Applies the `make_plus` function to each '1' cell index, generating a set of plus-shaped indices.
4. `O = fill(I, THREE, merge(plus_shapes))`: Merges all plus shape indices and fills them with '3' on the original grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Locate all '1' cells
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Create plus shape indices using dneighbors and set difference
  plus_indices = mapply(lambda loc: dneighbors(loc) - {loc}, ones)
  # Fill the plus shape indices with '3' on the original grid
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(plus_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)`: Identifies the indices of cells with the value '1'.
2. `plus_indices = mapply(lambda loc: dneighbors(loc) - {loc}, ones)`: Uses the `dneighbors` function to get all directly adjacent neighbors of each '1' cell. Then, it removes the '1' cell itself from the set using set difference.
3. `O = fill(I, THREE, merge(plus_indices))`: Merges all plus shape indices and fills them with '3' on the original grid.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Identify '1' cells
  ones_locations = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Create a set to store the plus shape indices
  plus_shape = set()
  # Iterate over '1' cell locations
  for loc in ones_locations:
    # Add the indices for the plus shape around the current '1' cell
    plus_shape.update({(loc[0] - 1, loc[1]), (loc[0] + 1, loc[1]), (loc[0], loc[1] - 1), (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)})
  # Fill the plus shape indices with '3' on the original grid
  O = fill(I, THREE, frozenset(plus_shape))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `ones_locations = ofcolor(I, ONE)`: Identifies the indices of cells with the value '1'.
2. `plus_shape = set()`: Initializes an empty set to store the plus shape indices.
3. The code iterates through each '1' cell location (`for loc in ones_locations:`) and adds the indices of its surrounding plus shape to the `plus_shape` set using `plus_shape.update()`.
4. `O = fill(I, THREE, frozenset(plus_shape))`: Fills the indices in the `plus_shape` set with '3' on the original grid.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  # Iterate through each cell of the input grid
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      # If the cell value is '1'
      if I[i][j] == ONE:
        # Fill the surrounding plus shape in the output grid with '3'
        for di, dj in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
          # Check if the current index is within the grid boundaries
          if 0 <= i + di < height(I) and 0 <= j + dj < width(I):
            O = fill(O, THREE, {(i + di, j + dj)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`: Creates a new output grid filled with zeros, having the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. The code iterates through each cell of the input grid using nested loops (`for i in range(height(I)):` and `for j in range(width(I)):`).
3. For each cell containing '1', it iterates through the four directions representing the plus shape (`for di, dj in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:`).
4. For each valid direction (within grid boundaries), it fills the corresponding cell in the output grid with '3' using `O = fill(O, THREE, {(i + di, j + dj)})`.
5. Finally, it returns the modified output grid `O`.
