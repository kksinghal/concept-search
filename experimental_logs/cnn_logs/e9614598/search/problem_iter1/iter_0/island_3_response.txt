## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on expanding non-background objects within the input grid. Let's break down the specific changes for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The single '1' object is used as a base.
* A new '3' object is created, taking the shape and size of the '1' object's bounding box.
* This new '3' object is positioned one cell above the original '1' object.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* Similar to the previous transformation, the two '1' objects are used as bases.
* For each '1' object, a '3' object is created with the bounding box dimensions of the '1'.
* These '3' objects are again positioned one cell above their corresponding '1' objects.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_generated_1(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(recolor(3, backdrop(obj)), (-1, 0)), objs)
    O = paint(I, merge((objs, shifted_objs)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:**  Extracts all non-background objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **`shifted_objs = ...`:**  This part iterates over each object (`obj`) in `objs` and performs the following:
    * **`recolor(3, backdrop(obj))`:** Creates a new object with value '3' shaped like the bounding box of the current object.
    * **`shift(..., (-1, 0))`:**  Shifts the newly created '3' object one cell upwards.
3. **`O = paint(I, merge((objs, shifted_objs)))`:**  Combines the original objects (`objs`) and the shifted '3' objects (`shifted_objs`) and paints them onto the input grid `I`, resulting in the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_generated_2(I):
    O = I
    for obj in fgpartition(I):
        box_indices = backdrop(obj)
        shifted_box = shift(box_indices, (-1, 0))
        O = underfill(O, 3, shifted_box)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in fgpartition(I): ...`:** Iterates through each non-background object (`obj`).
    * **`box_indices = backdrop(obj)`:** Gets the indices of the object's bounding box.
    * **`shifted_box = shift(box_indices, (-1, 0))`:** Shifts the bounding box indices one cell upwards.
    * **`O = underfill(O, 3, shifted_box)`:** Fills the shifted bounding box area with '3' only if the cell is currently background in `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_generated_3(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    new_objs = mapply(lambda obj: toobject(shift(backdrop(obj), (-1, 0)), canvas(3, shape(obj))), objs)
    O = paint(I, merge((objs, new_objs)))
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:** Extracts all non-background objects.
2. **`new_objs = ...`:** Creates new objects based on the originals:
    * **`canvas(3, shape(obj))`:** Creates a grid filled with '3' and the same dimensions as the current object.
    * **`shift(backdrop(obj), (-1, 0))`:**  Gets the object's shifted bounding box indices.
    * **`toobject(..., ...)`:** Creates a new object with '3' values at the shifted bounding box locations.
3. **`O = paint(I, merge((objs, new_objs)))`:** Combines original and new objects and paints them onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_generated_4(I):
    O = I
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if value != mostcommon(I):
                O = fill(O, 3, {(i-1, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initializes output as a copy of input.
2. **`for i, row in ...`:** Iterates through each cell in the grid.
3. **`if value != mostcommon(I): ...`:** If the cell is not background:
    * **`O = fill(O, 3, {(i-1, j)})`:** Fills the cell above with '3'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_generated_5(I):
    return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(3, shift(backdrop(obj), (-1, 0))), fgpartition(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Extracts non-background objects.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: ..., ...)`:** Applies a lambda function to each object:
    * **`shift(backdrop(obj), (-1, 0))`:** Gets the shifted bounding box indices.
    * **`recolor(3, ...)`:** Creates a '3'-colored object at those indices.
3. **`merge(...)`:** Combines all new objects.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the merged objects onto the input grid. 

These five versions offer different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. Each utilizes a unique combination of functions and logic, demonstrating the potential for diverse solutions in this DSL.
