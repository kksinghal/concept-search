## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a grid and draws a cross centered on each object, where the object itself is not part of the cross. 

* **Horizontal Line:**  The horizontal line of the cross extends to the leftmost and rightmost points of the object.
* **Vertical Line:** The vertical line of the cross extends to the uppermost and lowermost points of the object.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1**

```python
def fhfcbdbhbcabecaebbeffebaihefgaci(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  make_cross = lambda obj: paint(
      canvas(0, shape(obj)),
      recolor(3, frozenset(
          {(centerofmass(obj)[0] - uppermost(obj), j) for j in range(width(obj))} | 
          {(i, centerofmass(obj)[1] - leftmost(obj)) for i in range(height(obj))}))
  )
  crosses = (compose(
      paint, 
      lambda obj: toobject(shift(asindices(make_cross(obj)), ulcorner(obj)), make_cross(obj))
  ))(objs)
  O = merge(crosses)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Identifies all the foreground objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`make_cross(obj)`:** This function takes an object and creates a grid of the same shape as the object, but filled with 0s. Then, it draws a cross using the value 3 on this grid, centered on the object's center of mass and extending to its edges.
3. **`crosses`:**  This part applies the `make_cross` function to each object. It first shifts the indices of the cross grid to the upper-left corner of the object in the original grid. Then, it uses `toobject` to get the actual object representation with color '3' from the shifted cross grid. Finally, it paints all the transformed crosses onto the input grid `I`. 
4. **`merge(crosses)`:** Merges all the painted crosses into a single object.
5. **`return O`:** Returns the final object `O` which contains all the crosses.


**Version 2**

```python
def fhfcbdbhbcabecaebbeffebaihefgaci(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  def make_cross(obj):
    c_i, c_j = centerofmass(obj)
    u_i, l_j = uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)
    return recolor(3, frozenset(
        {(c_i - u_i, j) for j in range(width(obj))} |
        {(i, c_j - l_j) for i in range(height(obj))}))
  crosses = mapply(lambda obj: shift(make_cross(obj), ulcorner(obj)), objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(crosses))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Identifies all the foreground objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`make_cross(obj)`:** This function calculates the center of mass, uppermost row, and leftmost column of the object.  It then creates a cross using the value 3, centered on the object's relative center of mass and extending to the object's width and height.
3. **`crosses`:** This part applies a lambda function to each object using `mapply`. The lambda function shifts the generated cross from `make_cross(obj)` to the correct position on the grid by using the upper-left corner of the object.
4. **`paint(I, merge(crosses))`:**  Merges all the shifted crosses into a single object and paints it onto the input grid `I`.
5. **`return O`:** Returns the final modified grid `O`.

**Version 3**

```python
def fhfcbdbhbcabecaebbeffebaihefgaci(I):
    O = I
    for obj in fgpartition(I):
        c_i, c_j = centerofmass(obj)
        u_i, l_j = uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)
        for j in range(width(obj)):
            O = paint(O, {(3, (c_i - u_i + ulcorner(obj)[0], j + ulcorner(obj)[1]))})
        for i in range(height(obj)):
            O = paint(O, {(3, (i + ulcorner(obj)[0], c_j - l_j + ulcorner(obj)[1]))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:**  Initializes the output grid `O` with the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in fgpartition(I)`:** Iterates through each foreground object in the input grid.
3. **Calculate center, upper, left:**  Calculates the center of mass (`c_i`, `c_j`), uppermost row (`u_i`), and leftmost column (`l_j`) of the current object.
4. **Draw horizontal line:** Iterates through the width of the object and paints a pixel with value 3 for each column, creating the horizontal line of the cross.
5. **Draw vertical line:** Iterates through the height of the object and paints a pixel with value 3 for each row, creating the vertical line of the cross.
6. **`return O`:** Returns the final modified grid `O`.


**Version 4**

```python
def fhfcbdbhbcabecaebbeffebaihefgaci(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  def make_cross_indices(obj):
    c_i, c_j = centerofmass(obj)
    u_i, l_j = uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)
    h_line = frozenset((c_i - u_i, j) for j in range(width(obj)))
    v_line = frozenset((i, c_j - l_j) for i in range(height(obj)))
    return shift(h_line | v_line, ulcorner(obj))
  cross_indices = merge(apply(make_cross_indices, objs))
  O = paint(I, recolor(3, cross_indices))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:**  Identifies the foreground objects in the grid.
2. **`make_cross_indices(obj)`:** This function generates the indices for the cross. It first calculates the relative positions of the cross lines based on the object's center of mass, uppermost row, and leftmost column. It then combines the horizontal and vertical line indices and shifts them to the correct absolute position on the grid using the upper-left corner of the object.
3. **`cross_indices`:**  Applies the `make_cross_indices` function to each object and merges the resulting indices into a single set.
4. **`paint(I, recolor(3, cross_indices))`:** Recolors the `cross_indices` with the value 3 and paints them onto the input grid.
5. **`return O`:** Returns the final grid with the crosses.


**Version 5**

```python
def fhfcbdbhbcabecaebbeffebaihefgaci(I):
  def cross_at(loc):
      obj = extract(fgpartition(I), lambda o: contained(loc, toindices(o)))
      if not obj:
          return I
      c_i, c_j = centerofmass(obj)
      u_i, l_j = uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)
      return paint(
          canvas(0, shape(I)), 
          recolor(3, frozenset({
              (c_i - u_i, j) for j in range(width(obj))} | 
              {(i, c_j - l_j) for i in range(height(obj))}))
      )
  crosses = (rapply(cross_at, asindices(I)))
  O = merge(crosses)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`cross_at(loc)`:** This function takes a location on the grid and determines if it belongs to an object. If it does, it calculates the cross indices relative to the object and paints them on a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid. If not, it returns the original input grid.
2. **`crosses`:** Applies the `cross_at` function to all indices of the input grid, creating a set of grids, each with a potential cross.
3. **`merge(crosses)`:** Merges all the grids from `crosses` into a single output grid.
4. **`return O`:** Returns the final grid with all crosses. 

These five versions use different approaches and combinations of DSL functions, showcasing the flexibility of the language and the variety of solutions possible for a single transformation.
