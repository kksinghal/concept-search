## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying '1' cells and extending a horizontal line of '3's to the right from those cells. The line's length appears to be three cells, including the original '1' cell.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- Each '1' cell now has a horizontal line of '3's extending two cells to its right.
- The lines do not wrap around the grid boundaries.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- Similar to the above, each '1' has a three-cell horizontal line of '3's extending to the right.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1 (inspired by Program_A's shifting and merging):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find '1' cells
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Generate horizontal lines
  lines = mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + i) for i in range(3)}, ones)
  # Fill the lines with '3'
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(lines))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' cells:** Similar to Program_A, it identifies the locations of '1's using `ofcolor(I, ONE)`.
2. **Generate horizontal lines:** Instead of shifting in all directions, it directly generates the indices for a three-cell horizontal line extending to the right from each '1' location.
3. **Fill the lines with '3':**  It merges all generated lines and uses `fill` to replace the corresponding cells in the input grid with '3'.

**Version 2 (inspired by Program_B's sequential filling):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find '1' cells
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Fill right cells sequentially
  O = I
  for i in range(1, 3):
    O = fill(O, THREE, shift(ones, (0, i)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' cells:**  Identifies the locations of '1's.
2. **Fill right cells sequentially:** It iterates twice, shifting the '1' locations one and two cells to the right and filling those locations with '3' in each iteration.

**Version 3 (using `hfrontier` for line generation):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find '1' cells
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Generate lines using hfrontier
  lines = mapply(lambda loc: {(i, loc[1]) for i in range(loc[0], loc[0] + 3)}, ones)
  # Fill the lines with '3'
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(lines))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' cells:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Generate lines using `hfrontier`:** It leverages the `hfrontier` function to generate a horizontal line starting from the '1' location and extending three cells to the right.
3. **Fill the lines with '3':**  It merges the lines and fills them with '3'.

**Version 4 (using list comprehension for compactness):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Fill right cells using list comprehension
  O = tuple(tuple(THREE if (k == j or k == j + 1 or k == j + 2) and I[i][j] == ONE else I[i][k] for k in range(len(I[0]))) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j in range(len(row)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Fill right cells using list comprehension:** This version utilizes a nested list comprehension to directly modify the grid. It iterates through each cell and checks if it's within a three-cell horizontal range starting from a '1' cell. If it is, it replaces the cell with '3'; otherwise, it keeps the original value.

**Version 5 (using `connect` for line drawing):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find '1' cells
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Generate lines using connect
  lines = mapply(lambda loc: connect(loc, (loc[0], loc[1] + 2)), ones)
  # Fill the lines with '3'
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(lines))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' cells:**  Similar to previous versions.
2. **Generate lines using `connect`:** This version uses the `connect` function to draw a line starting from the '1' location and ending two cells to the right. 
3. **Fill the lines with '3':**  It merges the lines and fills them with '3'.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. You can choose the version that best suits your needs based on factors like readability, conciseness, or computational efficiency.
