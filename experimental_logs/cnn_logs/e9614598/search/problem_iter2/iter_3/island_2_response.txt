## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to identify objects with the value '1' and then expands them horizontally to the right, filling the expanded area with the value '3'. The original '1' objects remain unchanged.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
* The '1' at location (4,1) expands rightward, filling (4,2), (4,3), and (4,4) with '3'.
* The '1' at location (4,7) expands rightward, filling (4,8) with '3'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
* The '1' at location (0,3) expands rightward, filling (0,4) with '3'.
* The '1' at location (8,3) expands rightward, filling (8,4) with '3'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE) # Find indices of all '1's
  expansion_lines = apply(lambda loc: {(i, loc[1]) for i in range(loc[0], width(I))}, totuple(ones)) # Create horizontal lines from each '1' to right edge
  expanded_indices = merge(expansion_lines) - ones # Merge lines and remove original '1' indices
  O = fill(I, THREE, expanded_indices)  # Fill expanded indices with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify '1' locations:** `ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)` finds all indices where the value is '1'.
2. **Create expansion lines:**  For each '1' location, `apply` generates a horizontal line of indices extending to the right edge of the grid. 
3. **Merge and remove originals:** `merge(expansion_lines)` combines all lines, and then `- ones` removes the original '1' indices.
4. **Fill with '3':** `fill(I, THREE, expanded_indices)` fills the identified indices with '3'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Initialize output as input
  for j in range(width(I)): # Iterate through columns
    for i in range(height(I)): # Iterate through rows
      if I[i][j] == ONE: # If a '1' is found
        O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, k) for k in range(j + 1, width(I))}) # Fill horizontally to the right with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate through the grid:** The code iterates through each cell of the grid.
2. **Identify '1's:** If a cell contains '1', it triggers the expansion.
3. **Horizontal fill:** `fill` is used to replace values with '3' from the cell to the right edge of the grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # Get all objects in the grid
  expanded_objs = apply(lambda obj: fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), THREE, {(i, k) for (v, (i, j)) in obj for k in range(j + 1, width(I))}) if color(obj) == ONE else obj, objs)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(expanded_objs)) # Paint all objects onto an empty canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Extract objects:** `objects` is used to extract all objects from the grid.
2. **Expand '1' objects:** `apply` iterates through objects. If an object's color is '1', it creates a new object on a blank canvas, filling a horizontal line from each cell to the right edge with '3'. Otherwise, the object remains unchanged.
3. **Combine and paint:** All objects, expanded and unchanged, are merged and painted onto a blank canvas to create the output.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) # Initialize output as an empty canvas
  for i, row in enumerate(I): # Iterate through rows
    for j, val in enumerate(row): # Iterate through cells in a row
      O = paint(O, {(val, (i, j))}) # Paint the current cell's value onto the output
      if val == ONE: # If the value is '1'
        O = paint(O, {(THREE, (i, k)) for k in range(j + 1, width(I))}) # Paint '3' horizontally to the right edge
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate and paint:** This version iterates through the input grid and paints each cell onto a blank canvas.
2. **Expand '1's:** If it encounters '1', it additionally paints a horizontal line of '3's to the right edge. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def expand_right(grid, i, j): # Define a function to expand rightward
    return fill(grid, THREE, {(i, k) for k in range(j + 1, width(I))})
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I): # Iterate through rows
    for j, val in enumerate(row): # Iterate through cells in a row
      if val == ONE:
        O = expand_right(O, i, j) # Expand if the value is '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Helper function:** This version defines a helper function `expand_right` for clarity.
2. **Iterate and expand:** The main function iterates through the grid and calls `expand_right` if a '1' is found.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic. Each version provides a unique solution while adhering to the defined DSL.
