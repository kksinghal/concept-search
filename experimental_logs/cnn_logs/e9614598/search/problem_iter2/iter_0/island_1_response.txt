## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify specific patterns in the input grid and replace them with a cross-shaped pattern centered around the original pattern's location. The cross is formed using the digit '3'. Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- **Identified pattern:** Two horizontally adjacent '1' digits surrounded by '0's. 
- **Transformation:** The adjacent '1's are replaced by the central '3' of the cross pattern. Three additional '3's are added: one above, one below, and one to the right of the central '3'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- **Identified pattern:**  Same as Input_0: Two horizontally adjacent '1' digits surrounded by '0's.
- **Transformation:** Same as Input_0: The adjacent '1's are replaced with a cross of '3's.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" in the provided DSL, each with an explanation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find the indices of all '1's in the grid
  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  
  # Identify pairs of horizontally adjacent '1's
  adjacent_ones = frozenset(
    (i, j) for i, j in ones_indices 
    if (i, j + 1) in ones_indices and I[i][j] == I[i][j + 1]
  )
  
  # Create the cross pattern indices
  cross_indices = mapply(lambda ij: frozenset({ij, (ij[0] - 1, ij[1]), (ij[0] + 1, ij[1]), (ij[0], ij[1] + 1)}), adjacent_ones)
  
  # Fill the cross pattern with '3's
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(cross_indices)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' indices:** `ofcolor(I, ONE)` identifies all grid cells containing the digit '1'.
2. **Identify adjacent '1's:**  The code iterates through the '1' indices, checking if a horizontally adjacent cell also contains a '1'.
3. **Create cross pattern:** For each pair of adjacent '1's, it generates the indices of a cross pattern centered on the rightmost '1'.
4. **Fill with '3's:** The `fill` function replaces the values at the cross pattern indices with the digit '3'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Generate all possible 2x2 subgrids 
  subgrids = frozenset(crop(I, (i, j), (2, 2)) for i in range(len(I) - 1) for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1))
  
  # Check if subgrid matches the pattern [0, 1, 0, 1] (horizontally adjacent '1's)
  pattern = lambda g: g[0] == (0, 1) and g[1] == (0, 1) 
  
  # Find top-left corner indices of matching subgrids
  cross_starts = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(len(I) - 1) for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1) if pattern(crop(I, (i, j), (2, 2))))
  
  # Generate cross pattern indices for each matching subgrid
  cross_indices = mapply(lambda ij: frozenset({(ij[0], ij[1] + 1), (ij[0] - 1, ij[1] + 1), (ij[0] + 1, ij[1] + 1), (ij[0], ij[1] + 2)}), cross_starts)
  
  # Fill the pattern with '3's
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(cross_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Generate subgrids:** The code creates all possible 2x2 subgrids from the input grid.
2. **Match pattern:** A lambda function checks if a subgrid matches the pattern of horizontally adjacent '1's.
3. **Find pattern indices:** The code iterates through the subgrids and identifies the top-left corner indices of matching subgrids.
4. **Generate cross pattern:**  For each matching subgrid, it generates the indices for the cross pattern.
5. **Fill with '3's:**  Similar to Version 1, the `fill` function is used to replace the values at the cross pattern indices with '3'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find all objects in the grid
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  
  # Filter for objects with two cells and color '1' 
  target_objs = sizefilter(colorfilter(objs, ONE), TWO)
  
  # Check if object's cells are horizontally adjacent 
  is_horizontal = lambda obj: width(obj) == 2 and height(obj) == 1
  
  # Get the indices of the rightmost cell of horizontally adjacent objects
  cross_centers = mapply(lambda obj: (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj)), sfilter(target_objs, is_horizontal))
  
  # Generate and apply the cross pattern
  cross_indices = mapply(lambda ij: frozenset({ij, (ij[0] - 1, ij[1]), (ij[0] + 1, ij[1]), (ij[0], ij[1] + 1)}), cross_centers)
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(cross_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts all objects from the grid.
2. **Filter objects:** The code filters the objects to find those with two cells and color '1'.
3. **Check horizontal adjacency:** `is_horizontal` checks if the object's cells are horizontally adjacent.
4. **Get rightmost cell indices:**  For horizontally adjacent objects, the code extracts the indices of the rightmost cell.
5. **Generate and apply cross pattern:** Similar to previous versions, it generates the cross pattern indices and uses `fill` to apply it.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  shifted_right = shift(asobject(I), (0, 1))
  shifted_right_grid = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), shifted_right)
  
  # Find overlapping '1's by comparing with the shifted grid 
  overlap_indices = ofcolor(cellwise(I, shifted_right_grid, lambda a, b: ONE if a == b and a == ONE else ZERO), ONE)
  
  # Generate and apply the cross pattern
  cross_indices = mapply(lambda ij: frozenset({(ij[0], ij[1] - 1), (ij[0] - 1, ij[1]), (ij[0] + 1, ij[1]), (ij[0], ij[1])}), overlap_indices) 
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(cross_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift grid:** The code creates a copy of the input grid shifted one cell to the right.
2. **Find overlaps:**  It compares the original and shifted grids, marking cells with overlapping '1's.
3. **Generate and apply cross pattern:**  Using the overlap indices, it generates the cross pattern indices, shifting one step left to center the pattern correctly, and applies the '3's using `fill`. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    # Directly iterate and check for the pattern
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    cross_indices = set()
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w - 1):
            if I[i][j] == ONE and I[i][j+1] == ONE:
                cross_indices.update({(i, j+1), (i-1, j+1), (i+1, j+1), (i, j+2)})

    # Fill the identified indices with '3'
    O = fill(I, THREE, frozenset(ij for ij in cross_indices if 0 <= ij[0] < h and 0 <= ij[1] < w))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Iteration:** Iterates over the grid, checking for consecutive '1's horizontally.
2. **Pattern Found:** If a pattern is found, it adds the indices for the cross pattern to the `cross_indices` set.
3. **Boundary Check:** Before filling, it filters out any indices that fall outside the grid boundaries.
4. **Fill with '3's:** The `fill` function then replaces the values at the valid `cross_indices` with '3'.


This provides five distinct approaches to solving the given transformation task within the DSL constraints. Each version offers a different perspective on how to identify the target pattern and apply the desired changes.
