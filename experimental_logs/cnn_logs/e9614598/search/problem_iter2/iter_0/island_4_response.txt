## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (groups of connected cells with the same value) consisting of only the digit '1' in the input grid. Then, a new object is created by extending the original object both horizontally and vertically to form a cross shape, with the original object at the center. This new cross-shaped object is filled with the digit '3' and overlaid onto the original grid, potentially overwriting existing digits.

**Example:**

Input: 
```
0 0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0 0 
0 0 1 0 0
```

Output:
```
0 0 3 0 0
0 3 3 3 0 
0 0 3 0 0
```

## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve_44d8ac46(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  ones = colorfilter(objs, ONE)
  crosses = mapply(lambda o: toindices(o) | hfrontier(center(o)) | vfrontier(center(o)), ones)
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(crosses))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' objects:**  We first find all objects in the grid using `objects(I, T, F, T)`, filter for objects with color '1' using `colorfilter(objs, ONE)` and store them in `ones`.

2. **Create crosses:** For each object in `ones`, we compute the horizontal and vertical frontiers passing through its center using `hfrontier` and `vfrontier`. We combine these frontiers with the original object's indices using `|` to form the cross shape. This is done for all objects using `mapply`.

3. **Fill and overlay:** Finally, we merge all crosses using `merge` and fill the resulting indices with the digit '3' using `fill`. This creates the final output grid.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve_44d8ac46(I):
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == ONE:
        I = fill(I, THREE, hfrontier((i,j)))
        I = fill(I, THREE, vfrontier((i,j)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and check:** We iterate through each cell in the grid.

2. **Create cross:** If the cell value is '1', we compute the horizontal and vertical frontiers passing through the cell using `hfrontier` and `vfrontier`. We then directly fill these frontiers with '3' using `fill` on the original grid.

3. **Return modified grid:**  The loop continues, potentially overwriting some cells multiple times. Finally, the modified grid is returned.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve_44d8ac46(I):
  def make_cross(obj):
    i, j = center(toindices(obj))
    h_line = {(i, k) for k in range(len(I[0]))}
    v_line = {(k, j) for k in range(len(I))}
    return h_line | v_line

  ones = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), ONE)
  crosses = mapply(make_cross, ones)
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(crosses))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `make_cross` function:** We define a helper function `make_cross` which takes an object as input and computes the indices of a cross centered at that object.

2. **Identify '1' objects:** Similar to version 1, we identify objects with color '1'.

3. **Generate crosses:**  We apply the `make_cross` function to each '1' object using `mapply` to generate a set of cross indices.

4. **Fill and overlay:** The crosses are merged and filled with '3' using `merge` and `fill`, creating the final output grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve_44d8ac46(I):
  def extend_cross(I, i, j):
    for k in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][k] == 0:
        I = fill(I, THREE, {(i, k)})
    for k in range(len(I)):
      if I[k][j] == 0:
        I = fill(I, THREE, {(k, j)})
    return I

  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == ONE:
        I = extend_cross(I, i, j)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `extend_cross` function:** We define a helper function `extend_cross` which takes the grid and coordinates of a cell as input. It then extends a cross from that cell, filling with '3' only if the cell value is currently '0'.

2. **Iterate and extend:**  Similar to version 2, we iterate through each cell and call `extend_cross` if the cell value is '1'.

3. **Return modified grid:** The modified grid is returned after iterating through all cells. 


**Version 5:**

```python
def solve_44d8ac46(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  crosses = frozenset()
  for one in ones:
    crosses = crosses |  hfrontier(one) | vfrontier(one)
  return fill(I, THREE, crosses)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' cells:** We find the indices of all cells with value '1' using `ofcolor`.

2. **Iteratively build crosses:**  We initialize an empty set `crosses` and iterate through the `ones` indices. For each index, we compute its horizontal and vertical frontiers using `hfrontier` and `vfrontier`, then combine them with the existing `crosses` set using the union operation (`|`).

3. **Fill and return:** Finally, we fill the indices in `crosses` with '3' on the original grid using `fill` and return the modified grid.
