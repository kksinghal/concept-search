## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to replace all occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid with a '+' shape formed by the digit '3', while maintaining the rest of the grid unchanged.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* Each '1' in the input is replaced by a '3' in the output at the same location.
* Four additional '3's are added to form the '+' shape: one above, one below, one to the left, and one to the right of the original '1' location.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The same transformation logic applies as in the first example, demonstrating that the position of the '1's in the grid does not affect the transformation.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions ("Program_to_be_generated") implementing the described transformation using only the DSL functions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE) # Find indices of '1's
  make_cross = lambda ij: {(ij[0] + di, ij[1] + dj) for di, dj in [(0, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]} # Generate '+' shape indices
  crosses = mapply(make_cross, ones) # Apply '+' shape generation to all '1' indices
  O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), THREE, merge(crosses)) # Fill '+' shape indices with '3' on a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)`**:  Identifies the indices of all cells containing the value '1' in the input grid 'I'.
2. **`make_cross = lambda ij: ...`**: Defines a lambda function `make_cross` that takes an index `(i, j)` and returns a set of indices representing a '+' shape centered at that index.
3. **`crosses = mapply(make_cross, ones)`**:  Applies the `make_cross` function to each index in the `ones` set and merges the resulting sets of indices, effectively generating a set of all indices that need to be filled with '3' to create the '+' shapes. 
4. **`O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), THREE, merge(crosses))`**: Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid (`canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`), fills all indices in the `crosses` set with the value '3' using the `fill` function, and assigns the result to the output grid 'O'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = objects(I, True, False, True) # Find objects of '1's
  make_cross = lambda obj: toindices(shift(obj, UP)) | toindices(shift(obj, DOWN)) | toindices(shift(obj, LEFT)) | toindices(shift(obj, RIGHT)) | toindices(obj)  # Generate '+' shape indices
  crosses = merge(apply(make_cross, ones)) # Apply '+' shape generation to all '1' objects and merge
  O = fill(I, THREE, crosses) # Fill '+' shape indices with '3' on the input grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = objects(I, True, False, True)`**:  Identifies objects formed by '1's in the input grid, treating them as single units.
2. **`make_cross = lambda obj: ...`**: Defines a lambda function `make_cross` that takes an object `obj` and returns a set of indices representing a '+' shape centered at that object's location. It does so by shifting the object in all four directions and merging the resulting indices with the object's original indices.
3. **`crosses = merge(apply(make_cross, ones))`**:  Applies the `make_cross` function to each object in the `ones` set and merges the resulting sets of indices into a single set.
4. **`O = fill(I, THREE, crosses)`**:  Fills all indices in the `crosses` set with the value '3' on the input grid 'I' using the `fill` function and assigns the result to the output grid 'O'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid
  for i in range(1, len(I) - 1):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == ONE:
        O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j), (i - 1, j), (i + 1, j), (i, j - 1), (i, j + 1)})  # Fill '+' shape if '1' is found
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`**:  Initializes the output grid 'O' as a copy of the input grid 'I'.
2. **`for i in range(1, len(I) - 1):`** and **`for j in range(1, len(I[0]) - 1):`**:  Iterates through each cell of the input grid, excluding the border cells.
3. **`if I[i][j] == ONE:`**: Checks if the current cell contains the value '1'.
4. **`O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j), (i - 1, j), (i + 1, j), (i, j - 1), (i, j + 1)})`**: If the current cell contains '1', this line fills a '+' shape centered at the current cell with the value '3' in the output grid 'O'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  padded_I = canvas(ZERO, (height(I) + 2, width(I) + 2)) # Create a padded grid with zeros
  padded_I = fill(padded_I, ONE, shift(asindices(I), (1, 1))) # Fill the inner part with the input grid shifted by (1, 1)
  cross = {(0, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)}  # '+' shape relative indices
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) # Initialize output grid
  for i in range(1, height(padded_I) - 1):
    for j in range(1, width(padded_I) - 1):
      if padded_I[i][j] == ONE:
        O = fill(O, THREE, {(i + di - 1, j + dj - 1) for di, dj in cross}) # Fill '+' shape in the output grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`padded_I = ...`**: Creates a padded version of the input grid with an extra row and column of zeros on all sides.
2. **`cross = ...`**: Defines the '+' shape relative indices.
3. **`O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`**: Initializes an empty output grid.
4. **`for i in ...`** and **`for j in ...`**: Iterates through the padded grid (excluding the padding).
5. **`if padded_I[i][j] == ONE:`**:  If a '1' is found, it fills a '+' shape centered at the corresponding location in the output grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = objects(I, True, False, True) # Find objects of '1's
  make_cross = lambda obj: toobject(dneighbors(centerofmass(obj)), I) | obj  # Generate '+' shape object
  crosses = merge(apply(make_cross, ones)) # Apply '+' shape generation to all '1' objects and merge
  O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), THREE, toindices(crosses)) # Fill '+' shape indices with '3' on a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = objects(I, True, False, True)`**:  Finds objects formed by '1's in the input grid.
2. **`make_cross = lambda obj: ...`**: Defines a lambda function that takes an object and returns a new object representing the '+' shape. It finds the direct neighbors of the object's center of mass and combines them with the original object.
3. **`crosses = merge(apply(make_cross, ones))`**:  Applies `make_cross` to each object of '1's and merges the resulting objects.
4. **`O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), THREE, toindices(crosses))`**:  Creates a blank canvas, fills the indices corresponding to the `crosses` object with '3', and returns the result.

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation, using various DSL function combinations and logic.
