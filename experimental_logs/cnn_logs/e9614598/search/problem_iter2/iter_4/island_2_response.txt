## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects with the value '1' and extending them to the right edge of the grid with the value '3'. All other values in the grid remain unchanged.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The '1' at position (4,1) is extended to the right with '3's, resulting in the sequence '0 1 3 3 3 3 0 1 0 0'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* Two '1's are present, at positions (0,3) and (8,3). Both are extended to the right with '3's.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)  # Find indices of all '1's
  expansion_lines = apply(lambda loc: {(i, loc[1]) for i in range(loc[0] + 1, width(I))}, totuple(ones)) # Create horizontal lines from each '1' to the right edge, excluding the '1' itself.
  expanded_indices = merge(expansion_lines)  # Merge lines
  O = fill(I, THREE, expanded_indices)  # Fill expanded indices with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' locations:**  `ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)` finds the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **Generate expansion lines:** `apply(lambda loc: {(i, loc[1]) for i in range(loc[0] + 1, width(I))}, totuple(ones))` creates a set of horizontal lines starting from the column next to each '1' and extending to the right edge of the grid.
3. **Merge lines:** `merged_indices = merge(expansion_lines)` combines all the generated lines into a single set of indices.
4. **Fill with '3':**  `O = fill(I, THREE, merged_indices)` fills the identified indices in the original grid with the value '3'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # Get all objects
  expanded_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, {(i, k) for (v, (i, j)) in obj for k in range(j + 1, width(I))}) if color(obj) == ONE else obj, objs) # Expand right with 3s if color is 1
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(expanded_objs)) # Paint on a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all connected objects in the grid.
2. **Expand objects:** `apply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, {(i, k) for (v, (i, j)) in obj for k in range(j + 1, width(I))}) if color(obj) == ONE else obj, objs)` iterates through the objects. If an object's color is '1', it creates a new object with '3's extending to the right edge. Otherwise, the object remains unchanged.
3. **Paint objects:**  `O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(expanded_objs))` merges all the expanded objects and paints them onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) # Start with a blank canvas
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      O = paint(O, {(val, (i, j))}) # Paint the current cell
      if val == ONE:
        O = paint(O, {(THREE, (i, k)) for k in range(j + 1, width(I))}) # Extend right with 3s if the cell is 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize canvas:** `O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))` creates a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input.
2. **Iterate and paint:** The code iterates through each cell of the input grid. For each cell, it paints the cell's value onto the corresponding position on the canvas. If the cell contains '1', it paints '3's from the next column to the right edge. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)  # Get grid dimensions
  O = I  # Initialize output as input
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == ONE:
        O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, k) for k in range(j + 1, w)}) # Fill with 3s from current column to the right
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get dimensions:**  `h, w = shape(I)` retrieves the height and width of the input grid.
2. **Initialize output:**  `O = I` creates a copy of the input grid to use as the output.
3. **Iterate and fill:** The code iterates through each cell of the grid. If a cell contains '1', it fills the output grid with '3's starting from the column next to the '1' and extending to the right edge.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return  fill(I, THREE, merge(apply(lambda loc: {(i, loc[1]) for i in range(loc[0] + 1, width(I))}, totuple(ofcolor(I, ONE))))) # Concise one-liner
```

**Explanation:**

This version combines all the steps into a single line of code:

* `ofcolor(I, ONE)` identifies the indices of '1's.
* `apply(lambda loc: {(i, loc[1]) for i in range(loc[0] + 1, width(I))}, ...)` generates the expansion lines for each '1'.
* `merge(...)` combines all the expansion lines.
* `fill(I, THREE, ...)` fills the identified indices with '3' in the input grid.
