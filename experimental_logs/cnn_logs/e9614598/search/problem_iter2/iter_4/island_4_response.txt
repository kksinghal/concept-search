## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The program identifies the isolated "1" digit. It then creates a cross shape of "3"s centered around this "1", with the arms of the cross extending horizontally and vertically until they reach another digit or the edge of the grid.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the first transformation, the program locates all isolated "1" digits. For each, it generates a cross of "3"s centered on the "1". The arms of the cross, in this case, are only one unit long in each direction.


## Program Versions & Explanations:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  crosses = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE and size(obj) == 1)
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(apply(lambda cross: frozenset((i, j) for i in range(uppermost(cross) - 1, lowermost(cross) + 2) for j in range(leftmost(cross) - 1, rightmost(cross) + 2)), crosses)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`crosses = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE and size(obj) == 1)`:**  This line identifies objects that consist of a single cell containing the value "1". 
2. **`lambda cross: frozenset((i, j) for i in range(uppermost(cross) - 1, lowermost(cross) + 2) for j in range(leftmost(cross) - 1, rightmost(cross) + 2))`:** This lambda function takes a cross object as input and generates a set of indices that form a 3x3 square centered on the cross.
3. **`merge(apply(..., crosses))`:** The lambda function is applied to each cross object, generating a set of indices for each. `merge` then combines these sets into a single set.
4. **`fill(I, THREE, ...)`:** Finally, the `fill` function replaces the values at the generated indices with "3"s in the input grid `I`.


### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def make_cross(obj):
        i, j = centerofmass(obj)
        return frozenset({(i, j), (i + 1, j), (i - 1, j), (i, j + 1), (i, j - 1)})
    crosses = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE and size(obj) == 1)
    return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda cross: recolor(THREE, make_cross(cross)), crosses)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def make_cross(obj): ...`**: This function defines how to create the cross shape given an object (which will be the single-cell "1" object). It calculates the center and returns indices for the cross.
2. **`crosses = ...`**:  Identifies single-cell objects with value "1" like in Version 1.
3. **`lambda cross: recolor(THREE, make_cross(cross))`**: This lambda function takes a cross object, generates the cross indices using `make_cross`, and recolors them to "3".
4. **`merge(apply(..., crosses))`**: Applies the lambda to each cross, merging the results.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`**: Paints the recoloured cross indices onto the input grid `I`.


### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  cross_indices = mfilter(ones, lambda loc: index(I, add(loc, UP)) == ZERO and index(I, add(loc, DOWN)) == ZERO and index(I, add(loc, LEFT)) == ZERO and index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == ZERO)
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(apply(lambda loc: frozenset({loc, add(loc, UP), add(loc, DOWN), add(loc, LEFT), add(loc, RIGHT)}), cross_indices)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)`:** This line finds the indices of all cells containing the value "1".
2. **`cross_indices = ...`:** This line filters the `ones` set to only keep indices that represent isolated "1"s (those surrounded by "0"s).
3. **`lambda loc: ...`**: This lambda function takes an index `loc` and generates a set of indices representing the cross centered at that location.
4. **`merge(apply(..., cross_indices))`**: Applies the lambda function to each index in `cross_indices`, merging the resulting sets of cross indices.
5. **`fill(I, THREE, ...)`**:  Fills the input grid `I` with "3"s at the calculated cross indices. 


### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def expand_cross(loc):
    return frozenset({loc, add(loc, UP), add(loc, DOWN), add(loc, LEFT), add(loc, RIGHT)})
  cross_centers = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == ONE and index(I, add(loc, UP)) != ONE and index(I, add(loc, DOWN)) != ONE and index(I, add(loc, LEFT)) != ONE and index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) != ONE)
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(apply(expand_cross, cross_centers)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def expand_cross(loc): ...`**:  Similar to `make_cross` in Version 2, this function generates cross indices given a center `loc`.
2. **`cross_centers = ...`**:  Finds indices of "1"s that are not directly adjacent to other "1"s (ensuring they are isolated).
3. **`merge(apply(expand_cross, cross_centers))`**: Applies `expand_cross` to each center, merging the resulting cross indices.
4. **`fill(I, THREE, ...)`**:  Fills "3"s at the cross indices in the input grid `I`.


### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def cross_area(loc):
        return frozenset((i, j) for i in range(loc[0] - 1, loc[0] + 2) for j in range(loc[1] - 1, loc[1] + 2))
    crosses = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE and size(obj) == 1)
    return fill(I, THREE, merge(apply(lambda cross: cross_area(centerofmass(cross)), crosses)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def cross_area(loc): ...`**:  Defines a function to get indices for a 3x3 area around a given location `loc`.
2. **`crosses = ...`**:  Identifies single-cell objects of value "1".
3. **`lambda cross: cross_area(centerofmass(cross))`**: This lambda function takes a cross object, finds its center, and uses `cross_area` to get the 3x3 area indices.
4. **`merge(apply(..., crosses))`**: Applies the lambda to each cross, merging the resulting area indices.
5. **`fill(I, THREE, ...)`**:  Fills the input grid `I` with "3"s at the calculated area indices.
