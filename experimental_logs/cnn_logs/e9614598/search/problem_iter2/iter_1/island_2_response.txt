## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects with color '1' and extending them horizontally to the right until they encounter another object or the edge of the grid. The extended cells are filled with the color '3'.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- The '1' at (4, 1) is extended rightwards, filling (4, 2), (4, 3), and (4, 4) with '3' until it reaches the object with '6'.
- The '1' at (4, 7) is extended rightwards, filling (4, 8) with '3' until it reaches the edge of the grid.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- The '1' at (0, 3) is extended rightwards, filling (0, 4) with '3' until it reaches the edge of the grid.
- The '1' at (8, 3) is extended rightwards, filling (8, 4) with '3' until it reaches the edge of the grid.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Identify objects, excluding background
  ones = colorfilter(objs, ONE)  # Filter for objects with color '1'
  expanded_indices = merge(apply(lambda obj: connect(ulcorner(obj), (uppermost(obj), 9)), ones))  # Extend each '1' object to the right edge
  O = fill(I, THREE, expanded_indices)  # Fill the extended indices with color '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify '1' objects:**  We first identify all objects in the grid and filter for those with color '1'.
2.  **Extend horizontally:**  For each '1' object, we create a line of indices from its upper-left corner to the right edge of the grid (column index 9).
3.  **Merge and fill:**  We merge all the extended indices and fill them with color '3' in the original grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)  # Find indices of all '1's
  expansion_lines = apply(lambda loc: {(i, loc[1]) for i in range(loc[0], 10)}, totuple(ones)) # Create horizontal lines from each '1' to right edge
  expanded_indices = merge(expansion_lines) - ones # Merge lines and remove original '1' indices
  O = fill(I, THREE, expanded_indices)  # Fill expanded indices with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Find '1' indices:**  Locate all indices of cells containing '1'.
2.  **Generate expansion lines:**  For each '1' index, generate a horizontal line of indices extending to the right edge (column index 9).
3.  **Merge and exclude originals:**  Merge the generated lines and remove the original indices of '1's to avoid overwriting them.
4.  **Fill:**  Fill the remaining indices in the expansion with '3'.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Initialize output as input
  for i, row in enumerate(I): # Iterate through rows
    for j, value in enumerate(row): # Iterate through columns
      if value == ONE:  # If a '1' is encountered
        for k in range(j + 1, 10): # Fill rightwards with '3'
          if O[i][k] == ZERO:
            O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, k)})
          else:
            break  # Stop if another object is encountered
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Iterate and Fill:** This version iterates directly through the grid, cell by cell.
2.  **Horizontal Extension:** Upon encountering a '1', it fills the cells to the right with '3' until it hits another non-zero value or the grid edge.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE) # Find indices of all '1's
  h_frontiers = apply(hfrontier, totuple(ones)) # Get horizontal frontiers for each '1'
  filtered_frontiers = apply(lambda frontier: sfilter(frontier, lambda loc: index(I, loc) == ZERO), h_frontiers) # Filter frontiers to keep only indices with '0'
  expanded_indices = merge(filtered_frontiers) # Merge all filtered frontiers
  O = fill(I, THREE, expanded_indices) # Fill the expanded indices with '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify '1' and Frontiers:**  Locate all indices of '1's and compute their horizontal frontiers.
2.  **Filter Frontiers:**  For each '1', filter its frontier to keep only indices containing '0'.
3.  **Merge and Fill:**  Merge all filtered frontiers and fill the resulting indices with '3'.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Identify objects, excluding background
  extended_objs = apply(lambda obj: toobject(product(range(uppermost(obj),lowermost(obj)+1),range(leftmost(obj),10)), I), objs)  # Extend each object to the right edge
  filtered_objs = mfilter(extended_objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE) # Filter for extended objects that were originally '1's
  O = paint(I, recolor(THREE, toindices(filtered_objs))) # Paint the filtered objects onto the original grid with color '3'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify and Extend Objects:**  Identify all objects and extend them horizontally to the right edge of the grid.
2.  **Filter '1' Objects:**  Filter the extended objects, keeping only those originally containing '1'.
3.  **Recolor and Paint:**  Recolor the filtered objects to '3' and paint them onto the original grid.

These are five distinct versions of the program, each employing a different approach to achieve the desired transformation. Remember to test these solutions thoroughly to ensure they produce the correct output for various inputs.
