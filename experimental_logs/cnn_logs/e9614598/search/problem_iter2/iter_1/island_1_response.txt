## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation centers around the digit '1' and applies a cross-shaped overlay with the digit '3'. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Identify '1' Locations:** The code needs to locate all occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid.
2. **Create Cross Pattern:** For each '1', a cross pattern is generated, extending one cell vertically and horizontally.
3. **Overlay with '3':**  The cells forming the cross pattern are filled with the digit '3'. The original '1' remains unchanged.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

The same logic applies to this input-output pair. The difference lies in the positions of the '1' digits, resulting in a different placement of the '3' crosses.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_cross_overlay(I):
  # Find indices of '1's
  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)  
  
  # Generate cross pattern indices for each '1'
  cross_indices = mapply(lambda ij: frozenset({(ij[0] - 1, ij[1]), (ij[0] + 1, ij[1]), (ij[0], ij[1] - 1), (ij[0], ij[1] + 1)}), ones_indices)
  
  # Fill the cross pattern with '3's
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(cross_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, ONE)`:**  Identifies the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **`mapply(...)`:**  Iterates over each '1' index and generates a set of indices representing the cross pattern around it.
3. **`merge(cross_indices)`:**  Combines all individual cross pattern indices into a single set.
4. **`fill(I, THREE, ...)`:** Overlays the input grid (`I`) with '3's at the specified `cross_indices`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_cross_overlay(I):
  # Create a canvas of '0's with the same dimensions as the input
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  
  # Iterate over the input grid
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      # If a cell contains '1', draw a '3' cross
      if I[i][j] == ONE:
        for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
          ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
          if 0 <= ni < height(I) and 0 <= nj < width(I):
            O = fill(O, THREE, {(ni, nj)})
      # Otherwise, copy the original value
      else:
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`:** Creates a blank canvas filled with '0's, matching the input grid's size.
2. **Nested loops:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
3. **`if I[i][j] == ONE`:**  If the current cell is '1', it calculates the indices of its four neighbors and fills those positions on the output canvas with '3'.
4. **`else`:** If the current cell isn't '1', its value is directly copied to the corresponding position on the output canvas. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_cross_overlay(I):
  ones = asobject(I) & recolor(ONE, asindices(I))
  cross = mapply(lambda cell: frozenset({(cell[1][0]-1, cell[1][1]), (cell[1][0]+1, cell[1][1]), (cell[1][0], cell[1][1]-1), (cell[1][0], cell[1][1]+1)}), ones)
  return paint(I, recolor(THREE, merge(cross))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asobject(I) & recolor(ONE, asindices(I))`:** Extracts all cells with value '1' as an object.
2. **`mapply(...)`:**  For each cell in the `ones` object, it computes the indices of the cross pattern and creates a new set of indices.
3. **`recolor(THREE, merge(cross))`:** Merges all cross pattern indices and recolors them to '3', forming an object representing the overlay.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the '3' overlay onto the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_cross_overlay(I):
  # Find the object representing all '1's
  ones_object = next(obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, False) if color(obj) == ONE)

  # Create a cross pattern object
  cross_object = mapply(lambda cell: frozenset(
      {(cell[0], (cell[1][0] + di, cell[1][1] + dj)) for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]}
  ), ones_object)

  # Paint the cross pattern onto the grid
  O = paint(I, recolor(THREE, merge(cross_object)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`next(obj for obj in objects(...) if color(obj) == ONE)`:** Identifies the object composed of '1's.
2. **`mapply(...)`:**  Iterates over each cell in the `ones_object` and generates an object representing a cross pattern around it, maintaining the original cell's color.
3. **`recolor(THREE, merge(cross_object))`:**  Merges all the cross pattern objects and changes their color to '3'.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the '3' cross pattern object onto the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_cross_overlay(I):
  cross = frozenset()
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
      for j, value in enumerate(row):
          if value == ONE:
              if i > 0:
                  cross |= {(i - 1, j)}
              if i < len(I) - 1:
                  cross |= {(i + 1, j)}
              if j > 0:
                  cross |= {(i, j - 1)}
              if j < len(row) - 1:
                  cross |= {(i, j + 1)}
  return fill(I, THREE, cross)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`cross = frozenset()`:** Initializes an empty set to store the cross pattern indices.
2. **Nested loops:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
3. **`if value == ONE`:** For cells containing '1', it checks if neighboring cells are within the grid boundaries and adds their indices to the `cross` set.
4. **`fill(I, THREE, cross)`:**  Fills the input grid `I` with '3's at the indices specified in the `cross` set.


Each of these program versions offers a distinct approach to achieve the cross-overlay transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressive power of the provided DSL.
