## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects consisting of the digit '1' and drawing a '+' shape centered at their center of mass. The '+' shape is filled with the digit '3'. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* A single '1' object is detected.
* A '+' shape is drawn with '3' at its center and extending one unit in each cardinal direction.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* Two '1' objects are detected.
*  A '+' shape is drawn for each object as described above.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each with an explanation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def make_cross(obj):
    center_i, center_j = centerofmass(obj)
    return frozenset({(center_i, center_j), (center_i + 1, center_j), 
                      (center_i - 1, center_j), (center_i, center_j + 1), 
                      (center_i, center_j - 1)})
  crosses = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == ONE and make_cross(obj))
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(crosses)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`make_cross(obj)` Function:** This function takes an object and calculates the indices of a '+' shape centered at the object's center of mass.
2. **`mfilter`:** This function filters the objects in the grid, keeping only those that are of color '1' and have a valid '+' shape (using `make_cross`).
3. **`merge`:** This combines the indices of all '+' shapes.
4. **`fill`:** Finally, the grid is filled with '3' at the specified indices.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_cell(i, j):
    if index(I, (i,j)) == ONE:
      return frozenset({(i, j), (i + 1, j), (i - 1, j), (i, j + 1), (i, j - 1)})
    else:
      return frozenset()
  crosses = mpapply(process_cell, *astuple(height(I), width(I))) 
  return fill(I, THREE, crosses)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`process_cell(i, j)` Function:** This function checks if a cell at index (i, j) has the value '1'. If so, it returns the indices of a '+' shape centered at that cell.
2. **`mpapply`:**  This function applies `process_cell` to all possible cell indices within the grid dimensions.
3. **`fill`:** The grid is filled with '3' at the indices returned by `mpapply`.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  crosses = frozenset()
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == ONE:
      center_i, center_j = centerofmass(obj)
      cross = frozenset({(center_i, center_j), (center_i + 1, center_j), 
                         (center_i - 1, center_j), (center_i, center_j + 1), 
                         (center_i, center_j - 1)})
      crosses = crosses | cross
  return fill(I, THREE, crosses)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** This version iterates through each object in the grid.
2. **Check Color:** If an object's color is '1', it calculates the '+' shape indices.
3. **Union with `crosses`:** The '+' shape indices are added to the `crosses` set.
4. **`fill`:**  The grid is filled with '3' at the collected indices.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def make_cross(i, j):
    return frozenset({(i, j), (i + 1, j), (i - 1, j), (i, j + 1), (i, j - 1)})
  crosses =  mapply(make_cross, *totuple(ofcolor(I, ONE)))
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(crosses))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`make_cross(i, j)` Function:** Takes indices and returns indices forming a '+' shape centered at that location.
2. **`ofcolor`:** Finds indices of all cells containing '1'.
3. **`mapply`:**  Applies `make_cross` to each '1' cell index.
4. **`merge`:** Combines the '+' shape indices.
5. **`fill`:** Fills the grid with '3' at the combined indices.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  crosses = frozenset()
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) == ONE:
        crosses = crosses | frozenset({(i, j), (i + 1, j), (i - 1, j), (i, j + 1), (i, j - 1)})
  return fill(I, THREE, crosses)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:** Iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check for '1':** If a cell contains '1', it calculates the '+' shape indices.
3. **Union with `crosses`:** The '+' shape indices are added to the `crosses` set.
4. **`fill`:** Fills the grid with '3' at the collected indices.


These five programs use different approaches and combinations of DSL functions, showcasing diverse solutions for the given transformation. Each version accurately creates the '+'-shaped patterns around '1' objects in the input grids.
