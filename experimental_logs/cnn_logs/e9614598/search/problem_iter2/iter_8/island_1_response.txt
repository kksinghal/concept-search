## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves identifying objects of the digit '1' and drawing a '+' shape around them using the digit '3'. 

* **Input_0 to Output_0:**  A single '1' object is present. The transformation draws a '+' shape around it using '3's.  
* **Input_1 to Output_1:** Two separate '1' objects are present. The transformation independently draws '+' shapes around each '1' object.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1 (Inspired by Program_A's object manipulation):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True) # Find all '1' objects
  make_cross = lambda obj: merge({shift(obj, d) for d in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, ORIGIN]}) # Generate '+' shape indices
  crosses = mapply(make_cross, ones) # Apply '+' shape generation to all '1' objects
  O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), THREE, merge(crosses)) # Fill '+' shapes with '3' on a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' objects:** `ones = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` finds all connected components of '1's.
2. **Create '+' shape function:** `make_cross` takes an object and returns a new set of indices representing the '+' shape around it using shifts.
3. **Apply '+' shape to all objects:** `crosses = mapply(make_cross, ones)` applies `make_cross` to each '1' object. 
4. **Fill '+' shape with '3':** `O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), THREE, merge(crosses))` creates a blank canvas, merges all '+' shape indices, and fills them with '3'.

**Program Version 2 (Inspired by Program_B's index manipulation):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)  # Find indices of all '1's
  cross_at = lambda ij: frozenset({(ij[0] + di, ij[1] + dj) for di, dj in [(0, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]})  # '+' shape indices
  cross_indices = mapply(cross_at, ones_indices) # Apply '+' shape generation to all '1' indices
  O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), THREE, merge(cross_indices))  # Fill '+' shape indices with '3' on a blank canvas
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' indices:** `ones_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)` directly gets the indices of all '1' cells.
2. **Create '+' shape function:** `cross_at` takes an index (i, j) and returns indices of a '+' shape centered at (i, j).
3. **Apply '+' shape to all indices:** `cross_indices = mapply(cross_at, ones_indices)` applies `cross_at` to each '1' index.
4. **Fill '+' shape with '3':** Similar to version 1, it creates a blank canvas, merges '+' shape indices, and fills them with '3'.

**Program Version 3 (Concise object-based approach):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), THREE, 
           merge({shift(obj, d) for obj in ones for d in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, ORIGIN]}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version combines steps 2 & 3 from Version 1 into a single line for conciseness.

**Program Version 4 (Direct index manipulation):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v == ONE:
        for di, dj in [(0, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
          if 0 <= i+di < len(O) and 0 <= j+dj < len(O[0]):
            O = fill(O, THREE, {(i+di, j+dj)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version iterates through the grid and directly fills in the '+' shape for each encountered '1'.

**Program Version 5 (Functional index-based approach):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  cross_indices = {
      (i + di, j + dj)
      for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(row) if v == ONE
      for di, dj in [(0, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
      if 0 <= i + di < len(I) and 0 <= j + dj < len(I[0])
  }
  return fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), THREE, cross_indices)
```

**Explanation:** This version uses set comprehension to generate all '+' shape indices and then fills them in a single step. 

Each of these programs achieves the desired transformation by utilizing different combinations of DSL functions and logic, showcasing diverse approaches to the problem.
