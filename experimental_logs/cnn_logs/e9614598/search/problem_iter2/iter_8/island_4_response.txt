## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on isolated '1' digits within the grid. An isolated '1' is a '1' digit not directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to any other '1' digit.  The transformation then changes these isolated '1's and their surrounding cells (forming a plus sign shape) to '3'. 

**Input 0:**

* The isolated '1's are identified at locations (5, 1) and (5, 7).
* A plus sign shape centered at each isolated '1' is filled with '3's.

**Input 1:**

* The isolated '1's are identified at locations (0, 3) and (8, 3).
* A plus sign shape centered at each isolated '1' is filled with '3's.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def expand_plus(loc):
    i, j = loc
    return frozenset({(i, j), (i + 1, j), (i - 1, j), (i, j + 1), (i, j - 1)})
  isolated_ones = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == ONE and all(index(I, n) != ONE for n in dneighbors(loc)))
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(apply(expand_plus, isolated_ones))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`expand_plus(loc)` function:** Takes a location `loc` and returns a set of indices forming a plus shape around it.
2. **`isolated_ones`:** Identifies the indices of isolated '1's using `mfilter`, `asindices`, `index` and `dneighbors` functions.
3. **`merge(apply(expand_plus, isolated_ones))`:**  Applies the `expand_plus` function to each isolated '1' location and merges the resulting sets of indices. 
4. **`fill(I, THREE, ...)`:** Fills the identified plus-shaped regions with the value '3' in the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return fill(I, THREE, merge(apply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1]), (loc[0] + 1, loc[1]), (loc[0] - 1, loc[1]), (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), (loc[0], loc[1] - 1)}, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == ONE and len(intersection({ONE}, {index(I, n) for n in dneighbors(loc)})) == 0))))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  This version combines the plus-shape generation directly within the `fill` function. 
2.  It uses a lambda function to calculate the plus shape indices based on the identified isolated '1' location.
3.  The isolation check is performed by ensuring the intersection of the neighboring values and a set containing only '1' is empty.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_isolated_one(loc):
    return index(I, loc) == ONE and all(index(I, n) != ONE for n in dneighbors(loc))
  def expand_to_plus(loc):
    i, j = loc
    return {(i, j), (i + 1, j), (i - 1, j), (i, j + 1), (i, j - 1)}
  plus_indices = set()
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if is_isolated_one((i, j)):
        plus_indices.update(expand_to_plus((i, j)))
  return fill(I, THREE, frozenset(plus_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_isolated_one(loc)` function:**  Checks if a given location in the grid corresponds to an isolated '1'.
2. **`expand_to_plus(loc)` function:** Generates the indices for a plus shape centered at the given location.
3. **Iterative Approach:** Uses nested loops to iterate through the grid and identify isolated '1's. For each isolated '1', it expands the region to a plus shape and adds the indices to the `plus_indices` set.
4. **`fill` function:**  Finally, fills the identified indices with '3'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(THREE if any((i + di, j + dj) in mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == ONE and all(index(I, n) != ONE for n in dneighbors(loc)))
                       for di, dj in [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)])
              else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) 
        for i, row in enumerate(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version directly modifies the grid using nested loops and list comprehensions.
2. For every cell, it checks if it's part of a plus shape originating from an isolated '1'.
3. If so, it replaces the cell value with '3', otherwise, keeps the original value.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def get_neighbors_values(loc):
    i, j = loc
    neighbors = [(i - 1, j), (i + 1, j), (i, j - 1), (i, j + 1)]
    return {index(I, (i, j)) for i, j in neighbors if 0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0])}
  
  new_grid = []
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    new_row = []
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == ONE and not ONE in get_neighbors_values((i, j)):
        new_row.append(THREE)
        if i > 0: new_grid[i-1][j] = THREE
        if i < len(I) - 1: new_row.append(THREE)
        if j > 0: new_row[j-1] = THREE
        if j < len(row) - 1: new_row.append(THREE)
      else:
        new_row.append(val)
    new_grid.append(new_row)
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`get_neighbors_values(loc)` function:**  Retrieves the values of the four direct neighbors of a given location.
2. **Iterative Modification:** Iterates through the grid and checks for isolated '1's by examining neighbor values. If an isolated '1' is found, it modifies the current cell and its neighbors directly within the loop to create the plus shape. 
3. **Constructs New Grid:** Builds a new grid with the desired changes.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches and combinations of functions from the DSL to achieve the desired transformation.  They highlight the flexibility of the DSL in representing the same logic in multiple ways.
