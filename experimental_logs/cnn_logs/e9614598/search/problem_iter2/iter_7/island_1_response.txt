## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to identify objects consisting of the digit '1' and then expands them into a '+' shape, replacing the original '1' with a '3' and filling the adjacent cells with '3's. 

**Let's analyze the Input-Output pairs:**

* **Input_0 to Output_0:** The two isolated '1's in the input grid are expanded into '+' shapes in the output, with the '1's replaced by '3's.
* **Input_1 to Output_1:**  Similarly, the isolated '1's in this input grid are expanded into '+' shapes in the output.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each improving upon existing program structures and utilizing different DSL function combinations:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find all '1' objects
  ones = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  # Define a function to create a '+' shape around an object
  make_cross = lambda obj: merge({shift(obj, d) for d in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, ORIGIN]})
  # Generate '+' shapes for all '1' objects
  crosses = mapply(make_cross, ones) 
  # Fill the '+' shapes with '3'
  filled_crosses = recolor(THREE, merge(crosses))
  # Paint the filled crosses onto a blank canvas
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), filled_crosses)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` finds all connected components of '1's, excluding the background.
2. **Create '+' shape:** `make_cross` function generates a '+' shape by shifting the object in all four directions and merging them.
3. **Apply to all '1's:** `mapply` applies `make_cross` to each '1' object and merges the results.
4. **Fill with '3':** `recolor` changes the color of the '+' shapes to '3'.
5. **Paint on canvas:**  `paint` draws the filled crosses onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find indices of all '1's
  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  # Define a function to generate a '+' shape around a single index
  cross_at = lambda ij: frozenset({(ij[0] + di, ij[1] + dj) for di, dj in [(0, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]})
  # Generate '+' shape indices for each '1' index
  cross_indices = mapply(cross_at, ones_indices)
  # Fill the cross indices with '3's on a blank canvas
  O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), THREE, merge(cross_indices))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' indices:**  `ofcolor(I, ONE)` retrieves the indices of all '1's in the input.
2. **Create '+' shape indices:** `cross_at` generates a set of indices forming a '+' shape around a given index.
3. **Apply to all indices:** `mapply` applies `cross_at` to all '1' indices.
4. **Fill with '3':** `fill` directly fills the identified '+' shape indices with '3's on a blank canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Define the '+' shape as a base object
  cross_shape = frozenset({(0, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)})
  # Find all occurrences of '1's in the grid
  one_locations = occurrences(I, {(ONE, (0, 0))})
  # Shift and merge the cross shape to each '1' location
  crosses = merge({shift(cross_shape, loc) for loc in one_locations})
  # Fill the cross indices with '3's on a blank canvas
  O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), THREE, crosses)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define '+' shape:** A base '+' shape is defined directly as a set of indices.
2. **Find '1' locations:** `occurrences` locates all instances of the '1' object within the grid.
3. **Shift and merge:** The base '+' shape is shifted to each '1' location and merged to create the final shape.
4. **Fill with '3':** `fill` fills the resulting indices with '3's on a blank canvas.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Create a function to expand a single '1' into a '+' shape
  expand_one = lambda i, j: fill(canvas(ZERO, (3, 3)), THREE, frozenset({(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 1), (2, 1)})) if I[i][j] == 1 else canvas(ZERO, (3, 3))
  # Apply the expansion function to each cell of the input grid
  expanded_grid = tuple(tuple(v for row in expand_one(i, j) for v in row) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0])))
  # Downscale the expanded grid to the original size 
  O = downscale(expanded_grid, 3)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Expand '1' to '+' shape:** `expand_one` checks if a cell is '1' and generates a 3x3 grid with a '+' shape filled with '3's; otherwise, it returns a blank 3x3 grid.
2. **Apply to each cell:** This function is applied to each cell of the input grid, creating an upscaled grid.
3. **Downscale:** The upscaled grid is then downscaled back to the original size, effectively drawing the '+' shapes around the '1's.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Create a grid with '3's at the locations of '1's and their neighbors
  crosses = cellwise(I, switch(I, ZERO, ONE), THREE)
  # Replace remaining '1's with '0's
  O = replace(crosses, ONE, ZERO)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Mark '1's and neighbors:**  `switch` temporarily replaces all '0's with '1's and vice versa. Then, `cellwise` compares this modified grid with the original, marking cells with '3' where both have '1's (original '1' and its neighbors). 
2. **Replace remaining '1's:** Finally, any remaining '1's are replaced with '0's to obtain the desired output.

These five program versions offer diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation using different combinations of DSL functions. Each version provides a unique perspective on the problem and highlights the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
