## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on isolated occurrences of the digit "1" (those not directly adjacent to other "1"s) within the input grid.  For each such isolated "1", the transformation does the following:

* **Replaces the "1" with a "3".**
* **Fills the four cells directly above, below, left, and right of the original "1" with "3"s.** 

This effectively creates a plus-sign shape of "3"s centered on the location of each isolated "1" in the input grid.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program `Program_to_be_generated` using the provided DSL:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def expand_plus(loc):
    i, j = loc
    return frozenset({(i, j), (i + 1, j), (i - 1, j), (i, j + 1), (i, j - 1)})
  isolated_ones = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == ONE and all(index(I, n) != ONE for n in dneighbors(loc)))
  return fill(I, THREE, merge(apply(expand_plus, isolated_ones)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`expand_plus(loc)`:** This helper function takes a location `(i, j)` and returns a set containing that location and its four direct neighbors.
2. **`isolated_ones`:** This line identifies the locations of isolated "1"s in the grid. It uses `mfilter` to select only the locations where the value is "1" and none of its direct neighbors are also "1"s.
3. **`fill(...)`:**  This line performs the main transformation. It uses `apply` to apply the `expand_plus` function to each isolated "1" location, generating a set of indices to be filled. Then, it merges these sets of indices and uses `fill` to replace the values at those indices with "3" in the input grid `I`. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_isolated_one(loc):
    return index(I, loc) == ONE and all(index(I, n) != ONE for n in dneighbors(loc))
  return tuple(tuple(THREE if is_isolated_one((i, j)) or any(is_isolated_one(n) for n in dneighbors((i, j))) else I[i][j] for j in range(len(I[0]))) for i in range(len(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_isolated_one(loc)`:** This helper function checks if a given location contains an isolated "1". 
2. **Nested comprehensions:** This version directly iterates through each cell in the grid using nested comprehensions. For every cell, it checks if the cell itself or any of its direct neighbors are isolated "1"s. If so, it replaces the cell value with "3"; otherwise, it keeps the original value.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val == ONE and all(I[i + di][j + dj] != ONE for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)] if 0 <= i + di < len(I) and 0 <= j + dj < len(row)):
                O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j), (i + 1, j), (i - 1, j), (i, j + 1), (i, j - 1)})
            else:
                O = fill(O, val, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(...)`:** This creates an output grid `O` of the same shape as the input grid `I`, filled with zeros.
2. **Nested loops:** This version uses nested loops to iterate through each cell in the input grid `I`.
3. **Conditional filling:** For each cell, it checks if it's an isolated "1". If so, it fills a plus-sign shape centered at that cell with "3"s in the output grid `O`. Otherwise, it simply copies the cell value from `I` to `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def expand_cross(loc):
        i, j = loc
        return frozenset({(i - 1, j), (i, j - 1), (i, j), (i, j + 1), (i + 1, j)})
    return fill(I, THREE, merge(apply(expand_cross, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == ONE and all(index(I, n) != ONE for n in dneighbors(loc))))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`expand_cross(loc)`:** Similar to `expand_plus`, this helper function takes a location and returns a set of indices representing a plus-sign shape centered at that location.
2. **Chained operations:** This version uses a more compact style with chained operations. It identifies isolated "1" locations, applies `expand_cross` to each, merges the resulting sets, and finally uses `fill` to modify the input grid.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    ones_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == ONE and all(index(I, n) != ONE for n in dneighbors(loc)))
    plus_indices = merge(apply(lambda loc: {(loc[0]-1, loc[1]), (loc[0], loc[1]-1), loc, (loc[0], loc[1]+1), (loc[0]+1, loc[1])}, ones_indices))
    return tuple(tuple(THREE if (i, j) in plus_indices else I[i][j] for j in range(len(I[0]))) for i in range(len(I))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones_indices`:** This line identifies and stores the locations of isolated "1"s in the grid.
2. **`plus_indices`:**  This line generates a set of all indices that need to be changed to "3". It iterates through each isolated "1" location and expands it into a plus-sign shape of indices.
3. **Nested comprehensions with conditional replacement:** This part iterates through each cell in the grid and checks if its index is present in the `plus_indices` set. If so, it replaces the cell value with "3"; otherwise, it keeps the original value.
