## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation replaces occurrences of the digit '1' with a '+' shape formed by the digit '3'. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- Each '1' at position (i, j) is replaced by a '+' shape of '3's centered at (i, j).
- The '+' shape extends one cell in each of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

-  The same transformation is applied as in the previous example. 
- Note that the position of the '1's and hence the '+' shapes have changed, but the core transformation logic remains the same.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Identifies '1's and replaces them with '+' shapes of '3's.
  """
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda loc: recolor(THREE, {(loc[0] + i, loc[1]) for i in range(-1, 2)} | {(loc[0], loc[1] + j) for j in range(-1, 2)}), ones)))

```
**Explanation:**
1. **Identify '1' locations:** `ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)` finds all indices of '1's in the input grid `I`.
2. **Generate '+' shapes:** For each location `loc` in `ones`, it creates a set of indices representing a '+' shape centered at `loc` using set comprehension. The shape is then recolored to '3' using `recolor(THREE, shape)`.
3. **Paint the shapes:** Finally, the `paint` function merges all generated '+' shapes and paints them onto the input grid `I`, replacing the original '1's.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Replaces '1's with '+' shapes of '3's using nested loops.
  """
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(ZERO, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == ONE:
        for di in range(-1, 2):
          for dj in range(-1, 2):
            if 0 <= i + di < h and 0 <= j + dj < w:
              O = fill(O, THREE, {(i + di, j + dj)})
      else:
        O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, j)})
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Create an empty canvas:** `O = canvas(ZERO, (h, w))` creates an output grid `O` filled with zeros, with the same dimensions as the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through the grid:** The program iterates over each cell in the input grid using nested loops.
3. **Identify '1's and create '+' shapes:** If a cell contains '1', it iterates over its surrounding cells (including itself) and fills the corresponding cells in the output grid `O` with '3', forming a '+' shape. 
4. **Copy other digits:** If a cell doesn't contain '1', its value is directly copied to the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Replaces '1's with '+' shapes of '3's using shifts.
  """
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  shifts = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 0)]
  crosses = mapply(lambda loc: merge({shift({loc}, d) for d in shifts}), ones)
  return paint(I, recolor(THREE, merge(crosses)))
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Find '1' locations:** Similar to previous versions, this version starts by identifying the indices of '1's in the grid.
2. **Define shifts:** `shifts` is a list of tuples representing the four cardinal directions and the origin (0, 0), used to generate the '+' shape.
3. **Generate '+' shapes using shifts:** For each '1' location, it applies all the shifts to generate the indices of its '+' shape and merges them.
4. **Recolor and Paint:** Finally, it recolors the merged shape to '3' and paints it onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Replaces '1's with '+' shapes of '3's using map and lambda function.
  """
  return apply(lambda row: tuple(THREE if any([I[max(0, i-1)][j] == ONE, I[min(i+1, len(I)-1)][j] == ONE, I[i][max(0, j-1)] == ONE, I[i][min(j+1, len(I[0])-1)] == ONE]) else v for j, v in enumerate(row)), enumerate(I))
```
**Explanation:**
This version uses a more functional approach with `apply` and a lambda function to process each row of the input grid. For each cell, it checks its four neighbors for the presence of '1' and replaces the cell with '3' if any neighbor is '1', otherwise keeps the original value.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Replaces '1's with '+' shapes of '3's by iterating through object cells.
  """
  ones = asobject(I) & recolor(ONE, asindices(I))
  shifted_ones = merge([shift({cell[1]}, d) for cell in ones for d in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1), (0, 0)]])
  return paint(I, recolor(THREE, shifted_ones))
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Identify '1' cells as objects:** This version treats individual cells as objects. It finds all cells with value '1' and stores their value and indices.
2. **Shift cell indices:**  It then iterates through each '1' cell and generates its '+' shape by shifting its index in all four directions and merging the results. 
3. **Recolor and Paint:** Finally, it recolors the combined shifted indices to '3' and paints them onto the input grid.


These five versions provide different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL. Each version leverages different functions and strategies, offering distinct logic and function combinations.
