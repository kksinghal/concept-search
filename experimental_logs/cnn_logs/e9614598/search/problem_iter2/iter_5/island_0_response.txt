## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects in the input grid and replacing them with solid squares of color '3'. The size of the square corresponds to the maximum dimension (height or width) of the original object. The square is then positioned such that its center aligns with the center of mass of the original object. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- The '2' object with size (2,2) is replaced by a 2x2 square of '3's centered at its original center.
- The '1', '6', '7', '8' object with size (1,4) is replaced by a 4x4 square of '3's centered at its original center.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- The '2' object with size (1,1) is replaced by a 1x1 square of '3's at its original position.
- The '1', '6', '7', '8' object with size (2,4) is replaced by a 4x4 square of '3's centered at its original center.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def make_square(obj):
    c = centerofmass(obj)
    s = max(shape(obj))
    return frozenset(((3, (c[0] - s // 2 + i, c[1] - s // 2 + j))) for i in range(s) for j in range(s))

  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  new_objs = frozenset(make_square(obj) for obj in objs)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(new_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **make_square(obj):** This function takes an object as input and returns a square object. It calculates the center of mass (c) and the maximum dimension (s) of the input object. It then creates a new object with color '3' and cells arranged in a square shape of size 's' centered at 'c'. 
2. **objects(I, T, F, T):** This extracts all objects from the input grid 'I'.
3. **frozenset(make_square(obj) for obj in objs):** This applies the `make_square` function to each object and stores the resulting square objects in a frozenset.
4. **paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(new_objs)):** This creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid 'I', and then paints all the square objects onto it.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    c = centerofmass(obj)
    s = max(shape(obj))
    for i in range(s):
      for j in range(s):
        O = fill(O, 3, ((c[0] - s // 2 + i, c[1] - s // 2 + j),))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **objects(I, T, F, T):** Extracts all objects from the input grid.
2. **O = canvas(0, shape(I)):** Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input.
3. **for obj in objs:** Iterates through each extracted object.
4. **c = centerofmass(obj), s = max(shape(obj)):** Calculates the center of mass and maximum dimension of the object.
5. **Nested loop (i, j):** Iterates through the cells of the square, filling them with '3' at appropriate locations calculated relative to the center of mass.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def square_patch(obj):
    c = centerofmass(obj)
    s = max(shape(obj))
    return frozenset((c[0] - s // 2 + i, c[1] - s // 2 + j) for i in range(s) for j in range(s))
  
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    O = fill(O, 3, square_patch(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **square_patch(obj):** Similar to `make_square` in Version 1, but returns only indices of the square without color information.
2. **objects(I, T, F, T):** Extracts all objects from the input.
3. **O = canvas(0, shape(I)):** Creates a blank canvas.
4. **for obj in objs:** Iterates through each object, creating the corresponding square indices using `square_patch`.
5. **O = fill(O, 3, square_patch(obj)):** Fills the canvas with '3' at the calculated square indices.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def paint_square(grid, obj):
    c = centerofmass(obj)
    s = max(shape(obj))
    return paint(grid, recolor(3, frozenset((c[0] - s // 2 + i, c[1] - s // 2 + j) for i in range(s) for j in range(s))))

  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint_square(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **paint_square(grid, obj):** Takes the grid and object as input, calculates the square indices, and directly paints the square with color '3' onto the provided grid.
2. **objects(I, T, F, T):** Extracts objects from the input.
3. **O = canvas(0, shape(I)):** Creates a blank canvas.
4. **for obj in objs:** Iterates through each object and paints its corresponding square onto the canvas using `paint_square`.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def square_object(obj):
    c = centerofmass(toindices(obj))
    s = max(shape(obj))
    return frozenset(((3, (c[0] - s // 2 + i, c[1] - s // 2 + j))) for i in range(s) for j in range(s))

  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(apply(square_object, objs)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **square_object(obj):** Similar to `make_square` but explicitly converts the object to indices before calculating the center of mass.
2. **objects(I, T, F, T):** Extracts objects.
3. **apply(square_object, objs):** Applies `square_object` to each object, generating a list of square objects.
4. **merge(...), paint(...):** Merges the list of squares and paints them onto a blank canvas.


These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation. They showcase different ways to leverage the provided DSL functions, demonstrating the flexibility and power of the language.
