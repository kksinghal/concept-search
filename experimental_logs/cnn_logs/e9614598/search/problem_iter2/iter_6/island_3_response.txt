## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the input grid and drawing a horizontal line of '3's one row below the object. The length of the line matches the width of the object.  

**Input_0:**
- Two objects are detected: {(2,(4,1)), (2,(4,7))}, {(1,(5,1)), (6,(5,2)), (7,(5,0)), (7,(5,6)), (1,(5,7)), (6,(5,8))}
- For each object, a line of '3's is drawn one row below:
    - Object 1: {(3,(6,1)), (3,(6,2)), (3,(6,3)), (3,(6,4)), (3,(6,5)), (3,(6,6)), (3,(6,7)), (3,(6,8)), (3,(6,9))}
    - Object 2: {(3,(4,0)), (3,(4,1)), (3,(4,2)), (3,(4,3)), (3,(4,4)), (3,(4,5)), (3,(4,6)), (3,(4,7)), (3,(4,8)), (3,(4,9))}

**Input_1:**
- Two objects are detected: {(7,(0,2)), (1,(0,3)), (6,(0,4)), (7,(8,2)), (1,(8,3)), (6,(8,4))}, {(8,(1,3)), (8,(9,3))} 
- For each object, a line of '3's is drawn one row below:
    - Object 1: {(3,(1,2)), (3,(1,3)), (3,(1,4))}
    - Object 2: {(3,(9,2)), (3,(9,3)), (3,(9,4)), (3,(9,5)), (3,(9,6)), (3,(9,7)), (3,(9,8)), (3,(9,9))}


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_60b61512(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I)  # Extract foreground objects
    lines = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(3, {(i+1, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) for k in range(width(obj))}), objs)  # Create lines of 3s below objects
    return paint(I, lines)  # Paint the lines onto the original grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:** Extracts all foreground objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **`lines = mapply(...)`:** 
   - Iterates through each `obj` in `objs`.
   - For each cell `(i, j)` in the object, it generates a horizontal line of `3`s with the same width as the object, starting one row below the cell.
   - `recolor(3, ...)`: Sets the color of the generated indices to `3`.
3. **`return paint(I, lines)`:**  Paints the generated `lines` onto the original grid `I`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_60b61512(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I)
    lines = merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(3, {(lowermost(obj) + 1, j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)}), objs))  # Create lines based on object boundaries
    return paint(I, lines) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:**  Same as Version 1.
2. **`lines = merge(...)`:**
   - Iterates through each object `obj`.
   - Determines the object's boundaries (`lowermost`, `leftmost`, `rightmost`).
   - Creates a horizontal line of '3's one row below the object's `lowermost` row, spanning from its `leftmost` to `rightmost` columns.
   - `recolor(3, ...)`: Sets the color of these indices to `3`.
3. **`return paint(I, lines)`:** Same as Version 1. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_60b61512(I):
    return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(3, {(lowermost(obj) + 1, j) for j in range(width(I)) if (lowermost(obj) + 1, j) in backdrop(obj)}), fgpartition(I))))  # Combine object extraction and line creation
```

**Explanation:**

This version combines the object extraction and line creation steps within a single line of code. 

1. **`fgpartition(I)`:** Extracts foreground objects.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: ..., ...)`:**  For each object:
    - Determines its lower boundary (`lowermost`).
    - Generates a horizontal line of `3`s one row below (`lowermost(obj) + 1`), spanning the entire width of the input grid.
    - It ensures these new indices fall within the object's backdrop using `(lowermost(obj) + 1, j) in backdrop(obj)`.
    - `recolor(3, ...)`:  Sets the color of these indices to `3`.
3. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the lines generated for each object.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged lines onto the original grid `I`.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_60b61512(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  lines = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(3, {(y + 1, x) for _, (y, x) in obj if y + 1 < height(I)}), objs)  # Check boundary before adding a line
  return paint(I, lines) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version adds a boundary check to prevent lines from extending beyond the grid's bottom edge.

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`:** Extracts foreground objects.
2. **`lines = mapply(...)`:** For each object:
   - Generates a line of '3's only if the line's y-coordinate (`y + 1`) is within the grid's height (`y + 1 < height(I)`).
3.  **`return paint(I, lines)`:**  Paints the lines onto the original grid `I`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_60b61512(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
    shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (1, 0)), objs) # Shift objects downwards
    lines = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(3, intersection(toindices(obj), backdrop(shift(obj, (-1, 0))))), shifted_objs) # Find intersection with the original object's backdrop 
    return paint(I, lines)
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a different approach by shifting objects and finding intersections to determine line placement. 

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, T, T)`:** Extract all objects from the input grid.
2. **`shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (1, 0)), objs)`:** Shift each object one row downwards.
3. **`lines = mapply(...)`:**  For each shifted object:
   - Finds the intersection (`intersection`) between the shifted object's indices and the backdrop of the original (unshifted) object. 
   - This intersection represents the cells where the line of '3's should be drawn.
4. **`return paint(I, lines)`:**  Paints the lines onto the original grid.

These program versions provide different ways to achieve the same transformation. You can choose the version that you find most efficient or readable for your use case.
