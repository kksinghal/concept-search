## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific digits (1, 6, 7, 8) in the input grid and replacing them with a new digit (3) in the output grid, while maintaining their relative spatial arrangement.  The digit '2' remains unchanged.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* Digits 1, 6, 7, and 8 in the input are replaced by 3 in the output, forming a horizontal line. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

*  Similar to the previous transformation, digits 1, 6, 7, and 8 are replaced by 3 in the output. The spatial arrangement of these digits results in two vertical lines.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions for "Program_to_be_generated":

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  target_colors = {1, 6, 7, 8}
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) in target_colors)
  recolored_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(3, obj), filtered_objs)
  painted_grid = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(recolored_objs))
  return paint(painted_grid,  colorfilter(objs, 2))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** We first identify all objects in the input grid using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Filter objects by color:** We then filter the objects to only keep those with colors 1, 6, 7, or 8 using `sfilter` and a lambda function checking if the `color(obj)` is in `target_colors`.
3. **Recolor objects:**  We recolor the filtered objects to color 3 using `apply` and a lambda function applying `recolor(3, obj)`.
4. **Paint objects onto a blank canvas:** We create a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid using `canvas(0, shape(I))` and paint the recolored objects onto it using `paint`.
5. **Paint digit 2:** Finally, we paint the digit '2' from the original objects onto the canvas using `paint` and `colorfilter`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    target_indices = merge([ofcolor(I, value) for value in [1, 6, 7, 8]])
    return fill(fill(I, 0, target_indices), 3, target_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find target indices:** We use list comprehension and `merge` to find all indices of digits 1, 6, 7, and 8.
2. **Fill with 0:** We then use `fill` to replace all digits at the target indices with 0.
3. **Fill with 3:** Finally, we use `fill` again to replace the 0s at the target indices with the desired digit 3.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  return tuple(
        tuple(
            3 if v in {1, 6, 7, 8} else (2 if v == 2 else 0) 
            for v in row
        ) 
        for row in I
    )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested list comprehensions to iterate through every cell in the grid. It replaces the target digits with 3, keeps 2 as is, and sets all other cells to 0.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    new_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if value in {1, 6, 7, 8}:
                new_grid = fill(new_grid, 3, {(i, j)})
            elif value == 2:
                new_grid = fill(new_grid, 2, {(i, j)})
    return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each cell and uses `fill` to selectively replace target digits with 3 and keep 2 unchanged on a blank canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def transform_cell(v):
    return 3 if v in {1, 6, 7, 8} else (2 if v == 2 else 0)
  return tuple(tuple(map(transform_cell, row)) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a helper function `transform_cell` to handle the cell transformation logic. It then uses nested `map` functions to apply this transformation to every cell in the grid.


These are just five examples, and many other valid programs could be written using the provided DSL. The key is to understand the transformation logic and leverage the DSL functions effectively.
