## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify the positions of the digit '1' in the input grid and draw a vertical line of '3's centered on each '1'. The line's length is always three, with one '3' above, one below, and one replacing the original '1'.

**Example:**

Input:

```
0 0 0 1 0 
0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 
```

Output:

```
0 0 0 3 0 
0 0 3 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 
```


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
    line = lambda x: {astuple(add(x, UP)), x, astuple(add(x, DOWN))} 
    threes = mpapply(line, ones)
    O = fill(I, THREE, threes)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' positions:** `ofcolor(I, ONE)` identifies the indices of all cells containing the value '1'.
2. **Generate vertical lines:** `line` is a lambda function that takes a single index and returns a set of three indices representing a vertical line centered at the input index. 
3. **Apply line generation to all '1' positions:** `mpapply(line, ones)` applies the `line` function to each index in `ones` and merges the resulting sets into a single set `threes` containing the indices for all '3's.
4. **Fill the grid:** `fill(I, THREE, threes)` fills the input grid `I` with the value '3' at all indices present in the `threes` set.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    targets = ofcolor(I, ONE)
    shifted_up = shift(targets, UP)
    shifted_down = shift(targets, DOWN)
    all_threes = merge({targets, shifted_up, shifted_down})
    O = fill(I, THREE, all_threes)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' locations:** `ofcolor(I, ONE)` finds the indices of cells containing '1'.
2. **Shift Up and Down:** `shift(targets, UP)` and `shift(targets, DOWN)` create new sets of indices shifted one unit up and down, respectively, from the original '1' locations.
3. **Combine Indices:** `merge({targets, shifted_up, shifted_down})` combines the original and shifted indices into a single set `all_threes`.
4. **Fill with '3's:**  `fill(I, THREE, all_threes)` fills the input grid `I` with '3' at the combined indices.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    one_positions = ofcolor(I, ONE)
    verticals = apply(lambda p: connect(add(p, UP), add(p, DOWN)), one_positions)
    three_positions = mfilter(verticals, lambda line: size(line) == THREE)
    O = fill(I, THREE, three_positions)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1's:** `ofcolor(I, ONE)` identifies the indices of cells with '1'.
2. **Create Vertical Lines:** `apply(lambda p: connect(add(p, UP), add(p, DOWN)), one_positions)` generates vertical lines of indices by connecting the points one unit above and below each '1' location.
3. **Filter Valid Lines:** `mfilter(verticals, lambda line: size(line) == THREE)` keeps only the lines that are exactly three indices long, ensuring only complete vertical lines are used.
4. **Place '3's:** `fill(I, THREE, three_positions)` fills the grid with '3's at the filtered line indices.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    object_one = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), ONE))
    center_one = centerofmass(object_one)
    three_indices = apply(lambda d: astuple(add(center_one, d)), (UP, ORIGIN, DOWN))
    O = fill(I, THREE, frozenset(three_indices))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Isolate '1' Object:**  `first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), ONE))` extracts the object (connected component) consisting of '1's from the input grid.
2. **Find Center:** `centerofmass(object_one)` determines the center index of the '1' object.
3. **Calculate '3' Positions:** `apply(lambda d: astuple(add(center_one, d)), (UP, ORIGIN, DOWN))` calculates the indices for the '3's by adding the `UP`, `ORIGIN` (0, 0), and `DOWN` vectors to the center index.
4. **Fill Grid:** `fill(I, THREE, frozenset(three_indices))` fills the grid with '3's at the calculated indices.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  one_location = first(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  vertical_line = shoot(one_location, (1, 0))
  three_locations = intersection(vertical_line, backdrop(shift(toobject(one_location, I), DOWN)))
  O = fill(I, THREE, three_locations)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate a '1':** `first(ofcolor(I, ONE))` finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the grid.
2. **Generate Vertical Line:** `shoot(one_location, (1, 0))` generates an infinite vertical line passing through the '1' location.
3. **Determine '3' Intersections:** `intersection(vertical_line, backdrop(shift(toobject(one_location, I), DOWN)))` finds the indices where the infinite vertical line intersects with the bounding box of the '1' shifted downwards. This intersection represents the positions for the '3's. 
4. **Fill with '3's:**  `fill(I, THREE, three_locations)` fills the input grid `I` with '3' at the intersection indices.
