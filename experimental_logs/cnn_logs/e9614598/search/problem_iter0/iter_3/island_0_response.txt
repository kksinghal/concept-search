## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the '1' digits in the input grid and drawing a plus sign ('+') centered on those digits using the digit '3'. The plus sign extends either horizontally or vertically to reach the furthest extent of the existing '1' digits. 

**Input 0:**

* There are two '1' digits on the same row. 
* The transformation draws a horizontal line of '3's connecting the '1's and a vertical line of '3's extending from the center of the horizontal line.

**Input 1:**

* There are two '1' digits on the same column.
* The transformation draws a vertical line of '3's connecting the '1's and a horizontal line of '3's extending from the center of the vertical line.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL provided in `dsl.py`:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  line = mfilter(lambda p: vline(p) or hline(p), mpapply(connect, ones, ones))
  center_point = center(line)
  newline = hfrontier(center_point) if vline(line) else vfrontier(center_point)
  O = underfill(I, THREE, newline)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1's and their connections:**
   - `ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)`: Find the indices of all '1' digits.
   - `line = mfilter(lambda p: vline(p) or hline(p), mpapply(connect, ones, ones))`: Connect every pair of '1' indices and keep only the connections that form a straight vertical or horizontal line.
2. **Determine the center and orientation:**
   - `center_point = center(line)`: Find the center index of the line.
   - `newline = hfrontier(center_point) if vline(line) else vfrontier(center_point)`:  If the line is vertical, create a new horizontal line at the center index. If the line is horizontal, create a new vertical line at the center index.
3. **Fill the new line:**
   - `O = underfill(I, THREE, newline)`: Fill the grid with '3' at the indices of the new line, but only where the original grid had the background color (likely '0').

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  h_line = mfilter(hline, mpapply(connect, ones, ones))
  v_line = mfilter(vline, mpapply(connect, ones, ones))
  center_point = center(h_line if h_line else v_line)
  newline = vfrontier(center_point) if h_line else hfrontier(center_point)
  O = underfill(I, THREE, newline)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find horizontal and vertical lines:** This version explicitly separates the search for horizontal and vertical lines formed by the '1' digits.
2. **Determine orientation and center based on existing lines:** The center point and orientation of the new line are determined based on whether a horizontal or vertical line already exists.
3. **The rest of the logic remains the same as in Version 1.**

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    obj = extract(objs, lambda o: color(o) == ONE)
    center_point = center(obj)
    newline = hfrontier(center_point) if vline(obj) else vfrontier(center_point)
    O = underfill(I, THREE, newline)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects and extract the one with '1':** 
   - `objs = objects(I, True, False, True)`: Find all connected objects in the grid.
   - `obj = extract(objs, lambda o: color(o) == ONE)`: Extract the object made of '1's.
2. **Determine orientation and center based on the object:** The center point and orientation are determined based on the extracted object's shape.
3. **The rest of the logic remains the same as in Version 1.**

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = toindices(ofcolor(I, ONE))
  is_vline = len(set(j for i, j in ones)) == 1
  center_i = (minimum(set(i for i, j in ones)) + maximum(set(i for i, j in ones))) // 2
  center_j = (minimum(set(j for i, j in ones)) + maximum(set(j for i, j in ones))) // 2
  newline = {(THREE, (center_i, j)) for j in range(len(I[0]))} if is_vline else \
            {(THREE, (i, center_j)) for i in range(len(I))}
  O = paint(I, newline)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' indices and determine line orientation:**
   - `ones = toindices(ofcolor(I, ONE))`: Find indices of '1' digits.
   - `is_vline = len(set(j for i, j in ones)) == 1`: Check if all '1's have the same column index (vertical line).
2. **Calculate center coordinates:** Explicitly calculate the center row and column indices of the '1' digits.
3. **Construct the new line based on orientation:** Construct the new line as a set of tuples representing cell values and coordinates.
4. **Paint the new line:**
   - `O = paint(I, newline)`: Directly paint the new line onto the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    line = mfilter(lambda p: vline(p) or hline(p), prapply(connect, asindices(I), asindices(I)))
    center_i, center_j = center(line)
    line = {(THREE, (center_i, j)) for j in range(len(I[0]))} if vline(line) else \
           {(THREE, (i, center_j)) for i in range(len(I))}
    O = paint(I, line)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Directly find vertical or horizontal lines:** This version directly finds vertical or horizontal lines by connecting all pairs of indices in the input grid.
2. **The rest of the logic is the same as in Version 4.**

These five versions demonstrate different approaches and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same transformation. Each version provides a distinct solution with varying levels of abstraction and efficiency.
