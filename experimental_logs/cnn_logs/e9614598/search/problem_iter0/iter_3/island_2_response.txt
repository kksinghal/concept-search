## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying '1's in the input grid and drawing a horizontal line of '3's below each '1'. The line starts one position below the '1' and extends three positions to the right.  Let's break it down per input-output pair:

**Input_0:**
* Two '1's are present. 
* Below the first '1', a line of three '3's is drawn. 
* The same pattern is repeated for the second '1'.

**Input_1:**
* Two '1's are present.
* Lines of three '3's are drawn below both '1's, as described above.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE) # Get locations of all '1's
  shadow = mapply(lambda loc: frozenset({(loc[0]+1, loc[1]+i) for i in range(1, 4)}), ones) # Generate indices for the 'shadow' of 3s
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(shadow)) # Fill the 'shadow' indices with '3's
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)`**: Identifies the locations of all '1's in the input grid `I`.
2. **`shadow = mapply(lambda loc: frozenset({(loc[0]+1, loc[1]+i) for i in range(1, 4)}), ones)`**: This line generates the indices where the '3's should be placed. For each '1' location, it creates a set of indices shifted one row down and extending three columns to the right.
3. **`O = fill(I, THREE, merge(shadow))`**: This line takes the input grid `I` and fills the indices present in the `shadow` set with the value '3', creating the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_right_one = apply(lambda row: row[1:] + (ZERO,), I) # Shift each row one position to the right
  shifted_right_two = apply(lambda row: row[2:] + (ZERO, ZERO), I) # Shift each row two positions to the right
  shifted_down = apply(lambda row: (ZERO,) + row[:-1], I) # Shift each row one position down
  shadow = mpapply(lambda a, b, c, d: THREE if (a == ONE or b == ONE or c == ONE) and d == ZERO else d, astuple(I, shifted_right_one, shifted_right_two, shifted_down))
  O = tuple(tuple(row) for row in shadow)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create shifted grids:**
    * `shifted_right_one`: Each row is shifted one position to the right, padding with '0' at the beginning.
    * `shifted_right_two`: Each row is shifted two positions to the right, padding with '0's at the beginning.
    * `shifted_down`: Each row is shifted one position down, padding with '0' at the beginning.

2. **`shadow = ...`**: This line creates a new grid called `shadow` using `mpapply`. It iterates over all corresponding cells from the original grid and the shifted grids. If a cell in the original grid or its right-shifted counterparts is '1' and the cell below it is '0', then the corresponding cell in `shadow` is set to '3'. Otherwise, it retains the value from the `shifted_down` grid.

3. **`O = tuple(tuple(row) for row in shadow)`**: This line converts the `shadow` grid back to the desired tuple-of-tuples format, generating the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) # Create a blank canvas of same size as input, filled with '0's
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == ONE:
        for k in range(1, 4):
          if j + k < len(row):  # Boundary check
            O = fill(O, THREE, {(i + 1, j + k)}) # Fill with '3's horizontally
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`**: Creates a new grid `O` of the same size as input `I`, filled with '0's. 
2. **Nested loops:**  Iterate through each cell of the input grid `I`.
3. **`if val == ONE`**: If a cell contains '1':
    *  Another loop runs from 1 to 3 (representing the horizontal offset).
    *  `O = fill(O, THREE, {(i + 1, j + k)})`: Fills the corresponding cell in the output grid `O` with '3', one row below and offset horizontally by `k`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
    shadow_indices = set()
    for one in ones:
        for k in range(1, 4):
            shadow_indices.add((one[0]+1, one[1]+k))  # Add indices for 'shadow'
    O = I 
    for i, row in enumerate(O):
        for j, _ in enumerate(row):
            if (i, j) in shadow_indices:
                O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j)})  # Fill '3' at 'shadow' indices
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)`**:  Finds the indices of all '1's in the input grid `I`.
2. **`shadow_indices = set()`**: Initializes an empty set to store indices for the '3's.
3. **Outer loop**: Iterates through the `ones` indices.
4. **Inner loop**:  For each '1', calculates the indices for the horizontal line of '3's and adds them to the `shadow_indices` set.
5. **Iterate and fill**:  The code then iterates through the input grid again. If the current cell's index is present in the `shadow_indices` set, it fills that cell in the output grid with '3'. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def draw_shadow(row, i):
    new_row = list(row)
    for j in range(len(row)-3):
      if row[j] == ONE:
        new_row[j+1:j+4] = [THREE]*3
    return tuple(new_row)

  O = tuple(draw_shadow(row, i) if i < len(I) - 1 else row for i, row in enumerate(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`draw_shadow` function**: 
    * Takes a row and its index as input.
    * Creates a modifiable list copy of the row.
    * Iterates through the row, checking for '1's. If it finds a '1', it replaces the next three elements with '3's.
    * Returns the modified row as a tuple.
2. **List comprehension**:  Iterates through each row of the input grid.
   * If the row is not the last row, it applies the `draw_shadow` function.
   * If it's the last row, it keeps the row as is.
3. **`O = ...`**:  Assigns the result of the list comprehension to the output grid `O`.

These five program versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation, illustrating the flexibility and diversity of solutions possible within the provided DSL.
