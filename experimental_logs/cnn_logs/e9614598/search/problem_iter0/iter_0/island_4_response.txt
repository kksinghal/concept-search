## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid and drawing a horizontal line of a new digit (3 in this case) centered on each object. The line's length is equal to the object's width.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** A single object formed by the digit '1'.
    * **Output_0:** A horizontal line of '3's, with the same width as the '1' object, centered on the object's location. 
* **Input_1:** Two single-cell objects formed by the digit '1'.
    * **Output_1:**  Two horizontal lines of a single '3', each centered on the corresponding '1' object.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_custom(I):
    x1 = fgpartition(I)  # Identify objects in the grid
    x2 = mapply(lambda o: (width(o), centerofmass(o)[0]), x1)  # Extract width and center row index of each object
    x3 = mapply(lambda x: connect((x[1], x[0] // 2), (x[1], x[0] // 2 - x[0] + 1)), x2) # Generate horizontal lines based on width and center
    x4 = merge(x3) # Merge lines into single set of indices
    O = paint(I, recolor(3, x4)) # Paint the lines with '3' onto the original grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `fgpartition(I)`: Identifies and separates the objects within the input grid.
2. `mapply(lambda o: (width(o), centerofmass(o)[0]), x1)`: For each object, extracts its width and the row index of its center of mass.
3. `mapply(lambda x: connect((x[1], x[0] // 2), (x[1], x[0] // 2 - x[0] + 1)), x2)`: Generates a horizontal line of indices for each object, using its width and center row index.
4. `merge(x3)`: Combines all generated lines into a single set of indices.
5. `paint(I, recolor(3, x4))`: Paints the original grid with the color '3' at the indices specified by the merged lines.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_custom(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  lines = set()
  for obj in objs:
    w = width(obj)
    center_i, center_j = centerofmass(obj)
    start_j = center_j - w // 2
    end_j = start_j + w
    for j in range(start_j, end_j):
      lines.add((center_i, j))
  O = paint(I, recolor(3, frozenset(lines)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objs = fgpartition(I)`: Identifies objects in the grid.
2. `lines = set()`: Initializes an empty set to store line indices.
3. Iterates through each `obj` in `objs`:
    - `w = width(obj)`: Calculates object width.
    - `center_i, center_j = centerofmass(obj)`: Finds object's center coordinates.
    - `start_j`, `end_j`: Determine starting and ending column indices for the horizontal line based on width and center.
    - Inner loop adds each point of the horizontal line to the `lines` set.
4. `O = paint(I, recolor(3, frozenset(lines)))`: Paints the grid with '3' at the calculated line indices.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_custom(I):
    x1 = fgpartition(I)
    x2 = mapply(lambda o: (centerofmass(o), astuple(NEG_ONE, width(o))), x1)
    x3 = mapply(lambda x: connect(add(first(x), multiply(halve(second(x)), LEFT)), add(first(x), multiply(halve(second(x)), RIGHT))), x2)
    O = paint(I, recolor(THREE, merge(x3)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `fgpartition(I)`: Identifies objects in the grid.
2. `mapply(...)`: Extracts center coordinates and width for each object and transforms them into a format suitable for generating line segments.
3. `connect(...)`: Generates a horizontal line segment for each object based on calculated center and half-width offsets.
4. `paint(...)`: Paints the lines on the original grid using color '3'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_custom(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  line_indices = set()
  for obj in objs:
    i, j = centerofmass(obj)
    w = width(obj)
    for k in range(w):
      line_indices.add((i, j - w // 2 + k))
  return paint(I, recolor(3, frozenset(line_indices)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objs = fgpartition(I)`: Identifies objects in the input grid.
2. `line_indices = set()`: Initializes an empty set to store the indices of the lines to be drawn.
3. For each object:
    - `i, j = centerofmass(obj)`: Calculates the center coordinates of the object.
    - `w = width(obj)`: Gets the width of the object.
    - Iterates through the width of the object and calculates the indices of the horizontal line centered at the object's center.
    - Adds these indices to the `line_indices` set.
4. `return paint(I, recolor(3, frozenset(line_indices)))`: Paints the input grid with color `3` at the calculated `line_indices`, effectively drawing the horizontal lines.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_custom(I):
    def process_object(obj):
        w = width(obj)
        i, j = centerofmass(obj)
        return {(i, k) for k in range(j - w // 2, j + w // 2 + (w % 2))}

    line_indices = merge(apply(process_object, fgpartition(I)))
    return paint(I, recolor(3, line_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1. Defines a helper function `process_object(obj)` which takes an object as input and returns a set of indices representing the horizontal line segment corresponding to that object.
2. `fgpartition(I)`:  Identifies objects in the input grid.
3. `apply(process_object, fgpartition(I))`: Applies the `process_object` function to each object, resulting in a collection of line index sets.
4. `merge(...)`: Combines all line indices into a single set.
5. `paint(I, recolor(3, line_indices))`: Draws the horizontal lines by painting the grid with '3' at the calculated line indices. 


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation. They showcase the flexibility of the DSL and highlight the importance of choosing the most efficient and readable solution for the given task.
