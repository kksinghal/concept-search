## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects in the grid represented by the digit '1'. It aims to create a rectangular 'frame' around these objects using the digit '3'. 

* **Input_0:** The single '1' object is surrounded by a frame of '3's, effectively creating a larger rectangular object.
* **Input_1:**  The transformation is applied independently to both '1' objects in the grid. Each is surrounded by a '3' frame. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct programs to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  up_left = ulcorner(obj)
  down_right = lrcorner(obj)
  frame =  frozenset((i, j) for i in range(up_left[0] - 1, down_right[0] + 2) for j in range(up_left[1] - 1, down_right[1] + 2))
  O = underfill(I, THREE, frame)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = ofcolor(I, ONE)`:** Identify the indices of cells containing the value '1'.
2. **`up_left = ulcorner(obj)`:** Find the upper-left corner coordinates of the object.
3. **`down_right = lrcorner(obj)`:** Find the lower-right corner coordinates of the object.
4. **`frame = frozenset(...)`:** Generate the indices for the frame surrounding the object, expanding one unit in each direction.
5. **`O = underfill(I, THREE, frame)`:** Fill the 'frame' indices in the input grid with '3' to produce the output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  box_indices = box(obj)
  expanded_box = box(shift(box_indices, (-1, -1)))
  frame = expanded_box - box_indices
  O = underfill(I, THREE, frame)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = ofcolor(I, ONE)`:**  Get the indices of cells with '1'.
2. **`box_indices = box(obj)`:**  Calculate the indices forming the outline of the object.
3. **`expanded_box = box(shift(box_indices, (-1, -1)))`:** Create an expanded box by shifting the original box one unit up and left and recalculating the box indices.
4. **`frame = expanded_box - box_indices`:**  The frame is the difference between the expanded box and the original box.
5. **`O = underfill(I, THREE, frame)`:** Fill the frame indices in the grid with '3'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
    filled = I
    for obj in objs:
        shifted_obj = shift(obj, (1, 1))
        shifted_obj = shift(shifted_obj, (1, 0))
        shifted_obj = shift(shifted_obj, (0, 1))
        filled = underpaint(filled, shifted_obj)
    O = fill(filled, THREE, ofcolor(filled, ONE))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(...)`:** Isolate the objects in the grid (in this case, just the '1's)
2. **`filled = I`:** Initialize a grid `filled`, which will be a copy of the input grid.
3. **`for obj in objs:`:** For each object (group of connected '1's) in the grid:
    - **`shifted_obj = shift(obj, (1, 1))`:** Shift the object diagonally down-right by 1 unit.
    - **`shifted_obj = shift(shifted_obj, (1, 0))`:** Further shift the object to the right by 1 unit.
    - **`shifted_obj = shift(shifted_obj, (0, 1))`:** Finally, shift the object down by 1 unit.
    - **`filled = underpaint(filled, shifted_obj)`:** Paint this shifted object onto the `filled` grid, but only on cells that are currently the background color. 
4. **`O = fill(filled, THREE, ofcolor(filled, ONE))`:**  Finally, replace all occurrences of '1' in the `filled` grid with '3'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    one_locations = ofcolor(I, ONE)
    frame_locations = set()
    for loc in one_locations:
        frame_locations.update(neighbors(loc)) 
    O = underfill(I, THREE, frozenset(frame_locations))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`one_locations = ofcolor(I, ONE)`:** Find all the locations of '1's in the input grid.
2. **`frame_locations = set()`:** Initialize an empty set to store the locations of the frame.
3. **`for loc in one_locations:`:** Iterate over each location of '1'.
4. **`frame_locations.update(neighbors(loc))`:**  For each location, add its neighboring locations to the `frame_locations` set.
5. **`O = underfill(I, THREE, frozenset(frame_locations))`:** Finally, fill the input grid (`I`) with '3' at the `frame_locations`, but only if those locations are currently the background color. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
    frame = mapply(dneighbors, ones)
    frame = frame | mapply(ineighbors, ones)
    O = underfill(I, THREE, frame)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)`:**  Obtain the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **`frame = mapply(dneighbors, ones)`:** Find the direct neighbors of each '1' cell and merge them into the `frame` set. 
3. **`frame = frame | mapply(ineighbors, ones)`:**  Add the indirect (diagonal) neighbors to the `frame` set.
4. **`O = underfill(I, THREE, frame)`:**  Fill the `frame` locations on the grid with '3', only overwriting the background color.
