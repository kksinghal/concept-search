## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of the least frequent color (excluding the background) in the grid and creating a new object that forms a cross shape centered around each of these objects. 

* **Input_0:** The least frequent color (excluding background 0) is 1. Two crosses made of the digit 3 are placed centered on each occurrence of 1.
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, crosses are formed around each occurrence of the least frequent color 1.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_cross(I):
    x1 = leastcolor(I)  
    x2 = objects(I, T, F, T) 
    x3 = colorfilter(x2, x1) 
    x4 = mapply(toindices, x3) 
    x5 = mapply(lambda x: neighbors(x), x4) 
    x6 = merge(x5)
    O = fill(I, THREE, x6)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **x1:**  Identify the least frequent color in the grid (excluding background).
2.  **x2:**  Find all objects in the grid.
3.  **x3:**  Filter for objects with the least frequent color.
4.  **x4:** Extract the indices of each object in x3.
5.  **x5:**  For each set of indices, find their neighbors.
6.  **x6:**  Merge all neighbor indices into one set.
7.  **O:** Fill the grid with the desired color (3) at the neighbor indices.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_cross(I):
    c = leastcolor(I)
    o = objects(I, True, False, True)
    p = mfilter(lambda x: color(x) == c, o)
    f = lambda x: {(x[0]-1, x[1]), (x[0]+1, x[1]), (x[0], x[1]-1), (x[0], x[1]+1)}
    n = mapply(lambda obj: mapply(f, toindices(obj)), p)
    O = fill(I, THREE, merge(n))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **c:** Identify the least frequent color.
2.  **o:**  Find all objects.
3.  **p:**  Filter objects matching the least frequent color.
4.  **f:** Define a lambda function to get direct neighbors of a cell.
5.  **n:**  Apply `f` to each cell index of each object in `p` and merge the results.
6.  **O:** Fill the grid with 3 at the identified neighbor indices.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_cross(I):
  target_color = leastcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  target_objs = sfilter(lambda o: color(o) == target_color, objs)
  cross_indices = set()
  for obj in target_objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      cross_indices.update({(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)})
  O = fill(I, THREE, frozenset(cross_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **target\_color:** Find the least frequent color.
2.  **objs:**  Find all objects.
3.  **target\_objs:**  Filter objects with the target color.
4.  **cross\_indices:**  Iterate over each cell of target objects, calculate and collect cross indices.
5.  **O:**  Fill the grid with 3 at the collected cross indices.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_cross(I):
  min_color = leastcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  target_indices = merge([toindices(obj) for obj in objs if color(obj) == min_color])
  shifted_indices = merge([shift(target_indices, d) for d in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]])
  O = fill(I, THREE, shifted_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **min\_color:**  Find the least frequent color.
2.  **objs:**  Find all objects.
3.  **target\_indices:** Extract indices of objects with the least frequent color and merge them.
4.  **shifted\_indices:** Shift `target_indices` in all four directions and merge the results.
5.  **O:** Fill the grid with 3 at the shifted indices.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_cross(I):
    target_color = leastcolor(I)
    def create_cross(i, j):
        return {(i - 1, j), (i + 1, j), (i, j - 1), (i, j + 1)}
    cross_indices = set()
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
      for j, value in enumerate(row):
        if value == target_color:
          cross_indices.update(create_cross(i, j))
    O = fill(I, THREE, frozenset(cross_indices))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **target\_color:**  Find the least frequent color.
2.  **create\_cross:** Define a function to get cross indices for a given cell.
3.  **cross\_indices:** Iterate through the grid, call `create_cross` for cells with the target color, and collect indices.
4.  **O:** Fill the grid with 3 at the collected cross indices.

Each version uses a slightly different approach to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL and providing five distinct solutions.
