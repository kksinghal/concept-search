## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to draw a vertical cross (a single column) of '3's centered on each '1' in the input grid. The cross extends only vertically and doesn't extend beyond the existing grid boundaries.

**Input_0 Example:**
- Two '1's are present at locations (4, 1) and (4, 7). 
-  Vertical crosses of '3's are drawn, resulting in the output grid.

**Input_1 Example:**
- Two '1's are present at (0, 3) and (8, 3).
- Vertical crosses are drawn centered at these locations.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  # Find locations of digit "1"
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  
  # For each "1", create a vertical line of "3"s
  crosses = mapply(lambda loc: frozenset({(i, loc[1]) for i in range(len(I))}), ones)
  
  # Combine all cross indices
  all_cross_indices = merge(crosses)
  
  # Recolor the combined indices to "3" and paint onto the original grid
  O = paint(I, recolor(THREE, all_cross_indices))
  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1's:** `ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)` identifies the indices of all '1's in the input grid.
2. **Generate Vertical Lines:** For each '1' location `loc`,  `frozenset({(i, loc[1]) for i in range(len(I))})` generates a set of indices representing a vertical line spanning the entire height of the grid at the same column as the '1'.
3. **Combine Lines:** `mapply` applies the line generation to each '1' location and `merge` combines the resulting lines into a single set of indices.
4. **Recolor and Paint:** `recolor(THREE, all_cross_indices)` sets the color of all cross indices to '3', and `paint` applies these changes to the original grid.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  # Transpose the grid, making columns into rows
  transposed = dmirror(I)
  
  # Use Program_B logic to draw horizontal lines (which are now vertical)
  x1 = fgpartition(transposed)
  x2 = compose(last, first)
  x3 = power(last, TWO)
  x4 = fork(connect, x2, x3)
  x5 = fork(recolor, color, x4)
  x6 = mapply(x5, x1)
  temp = paint(transposed, x6)
  
  # Transpose back to the original orientation
  O = dmirror(temp)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transpose:**  The grid is transposed using `dmirror(I)`, turning columns into rows.
2. **Apply Program_B Logic:**  Program_B's logic, which draws horizontal lines, is applied to the transposed grid. This effectively draws vertical lines on the original grid.
3. **Transpose Back:** The grid is transposed back to its original orientation using `dmirror(temp)`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  # Find "1" locations
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  
  # Create vertical lines by repeatedly shifting upwards and downwards
  crosses = mapply(lambda loc: merge([shift({loc}, (i, 0)) for i in range(-len(I)//2 + 1, len(I)//2 + 1)]), ones)
  
  # Recolor and paint as before
  O = paint(I, recolor(THREE, crosses))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1's:**  Similar to previous versions, `ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)` finds '1' locations.
2. **Shifting to Create Lines:** For each '1' location, `shift({loc}, (i, 0))` creates a series of shifted single-cell "patches" along the vertical direction. The range ensures the line covers the entire grid height. `merge` combines these shifted patches.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** The process of recoloring and painting remains the same as in previous versions.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  # Find "1" locations
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)

  # Use vfrontier to directly generate vertical lines 
  crosses = mapply(lambda loc: toindices(recolor(THREE, vfrontier(loc))), ones)

  # Recolor and paint as before
  O = paint(I, recolor(THREE, crosses))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1's:** `ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)` finds the '1' locations.
2. **Vertical Frontier:** `vfrontier(loc)` generates a set of indices representing a vertical line across the grid at the given '1' location.
3. **Recolor and Combine:** The frontier is immediately recolored to '3' and then combined with other lines using `mapply` and `merge`.
4. **Final Painting:**  The final recoloring and painting remain the same.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  # Create a full-height vertical line object
  line = frozenset((THREE, (i, 0)) for i in range(len(I)))

  # Find occurrences of "1" and shift the line accordingly
  crosses =  merge(apply(lambda loc: shift(line, (0, loc[1])), ofcolor(I, ONE)))
  
  # Paint the shifted lines onto the grid
  O = paint(I, crosses)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a Template Line:** A full-height vertical line object (`line`) consisting of '3's is created.
2. **Locate '1's and Shift:** `ofcolor(I, ONE)` finds '1' locations. `shift(line, (0, loc[1]))` shifts the template line to the column of each '1'.
3. **Combine and Paint:**  The shifted lines are combined using `merge` and painted directly onto the input grid.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation. Each version leverages different DSL functions and strategies, highlighting the flexibility of the DSL and the variety of possible solutions.
