## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation adds a "shadow" of 3s to the right and below each 1 in the input grid. The shadow extends three cells diagonally. 

**Example:**

```
Input:      Output:
0 1 0       0 1 0 
0 0 0       0 3 3
0 0 0       0 3 0 
```

## Program Versions:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE) # Get indices of all '1's
  shadow_indices = mapply(lambda loc: frozenset({(loc[0]+i, loc[1]+j) for i in range(1, 4) for j in range(1, i+1)}), ones) # Generate indices for the shadow
  O = fill(I, THREE, merge(shadow_indices)) # Fill the shadow indices with '3's
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get '1' indices:** `ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)` identifies the locations of all '1's in the input grid.
2. **Generate shadow indices:** `shadow_indices = mapply(...)` creates a set of indices representing the shadow for each '1'. It iterates through each '1' location and calculates the diagonal shadow indices using nested loops.
3. **Fill shadow:** `O = fill(I, THREE, merge(shadow_indices))` fills the generated shadow indices with '3's on the input grid. 

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shadow = frozenset()  # Initialize an empty set for the shadow
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == ONE:  # Check for '1'
        for k in range(1, 4): # Generate diagonal shadow
          if i+k < len(I) and j+k < len(I[0]):
            shadow = shadow | {(i+k, j+k)}  
  O = fill(I, THREE, shadow) # Fill shadow indices with '3's
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize shadow:** An empty set `shadow` is created to store shadow indices.
2. **Iterate and generate shadow:** The program iterates through each cell of the grid. If a cell contains '1', it calculates and adds the corresponding diagonal shadow indices to the `shadow` set.
3. **Fill shadow:** The `fill` function places '3's at the collected `shadow` indices within the input grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Copy the input grid
  for i in range(len(I)-1, 0, -1): # Iterate rows in reverse
    for j in range(len(I[0])-1, 0, -1): # Iterate columns in reverse
      if I[i][j] == ONE:
        for k in range(1,4): # Generate diagonal shadow
          if i+k < len(I) and j+k < len(I[0]):
            O = fill(O, THREE, {(i+k,j+k)}) # Fill shadow during iteration
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Copy input:**  The input grid is copied to `O`.
2. **Reverse iteration:**  The program iterates through the grid in reverse order (bottom-right to top-left). This ensures that each shadow cell is filled only once.
3. **Fill during iteration:**  The program fills the shadow cells with '3's as it encounters '1's, simplifying the process.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_down = apply(lambda row: (ZERO,) + row[:-1], I)
  shifted_right = apply(lambda row: row[1:] + (ZERO,), shifted_down)
  shifted_right_2 = apply(lambda row: row[2:] + (ZERO, ZERO), shifted_down) 
  shadow = mpapply(lambda a, b, c, d: THREE if (a == ONE or b == ONE or c == ONE) and d == ZERO else d, astuple(I, shifted_down, shifted_right, shifted_right_2))
  O = tuple(tuple(row) for row in shadow)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create shifted grids:** Generates three shifted versions of the input grid: one shifted down, one shifted right and down, and one shifted right twice and down.
2. **Identify shadow cells:**  Uses `astuple` and `mpapply` to compare the original grid with the shifted grids. A cell is identified as a shadow cell if a '1' exists in any of the three corresponding shifted positions and the current cell is a '0'.
3. **Fill shadow:** Fills the identified shadow cells with '3's and reconstructs the grid.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas of the same size as input
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  for i, j in ones:  # Iterate through '1' locations
    for k in range(1, 4):
      if 0 <= i + k < len(I) and 0 <= j + k < len(I[0]):
        O = fill(O, THREE, {(i + k, j + k)}) # Fill shadow on the canvas
  O = cellwise(I, O, O)  # Overlay '1's from the input onto the canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create blank canvas:**  Initializes an empty grid (`O`) of the same size as the input, filled with '0's.
2. **Iterate and fill shadow:** Iterates through the locations of '1's in the input grid and directly fills the corresponding shadow cells with '3's on the canvas (`O`).
3. **Overlay input:** Uses `cellwise` to combine the input grid with the canvas, ensuring that the original '1's are preserved.

These are five distinct versions of the program, each using different approaches and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the desired transformation.
