## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves drawing horizontal lines centered on each foreground object, extending to the leftmost and rightmost points of the object. The lines are drawn in color '3'.

**Input_0:**
- Two '1' objects are present.
- For each object, a horizontal line of '3's is drawn, centered on the object and spanning its width.

**Input_1:**
- Two '1' objects are present.
- The same horizontal line logic is applied, resulting in two vertical lines of '3's.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I) # Get foreground objects
  lines = mapply(lambda obj: connect((centerofmass(obj)[0], leftmost(obj)),
                                    (centerofmass(obj)[0], rightmost(obj))),
                 objs) # Draw lines for each object
  O = paint(I, recolor(3, merge(lines))) # Paint lines onto original grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`**: Identifies all foreground objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`lines = mapply(...)`**: Iterates over each object in `objs` and calculates the start and end points of the horizontal line. It uses `centerofmass(obj)[0]` to get the row index of the center of mass for the line, and `leftmost(obj)` and `rightmost(obj)` to define the horizontal span of the line. The `connect` function generates the indices for the line.
3. **`O = paint(I, recolor(3, merge(lines)))`**: Merges all the generated line indices, recolors them to '3', and paints them onto the original grid `I` to produce the output `O`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for obj in fgpartition(I):
        row = centerofmass(obj)[0]
        for col in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1):
            O = paint(O, {(3, (row, col))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`**: Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in fgpartition(I):`**: Iterates through each foreground object in the input grid.
3. **`row = centerofmass(obj)[0]`**: Determines the row index where the horizontal line will be drawn based on the object's center of mass.
4. **`for col in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1):`**:  Iterates through each column index within the object's horizontal span.
5. **`O = paint(O, {(3, (row, col))})`**: Paints a cell with color '3' at the calculated `(row, col)` coordinates on the output grid `O`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               recolor(3, 
                       merge(
                           mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((centerofmass(obj)[0], j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)), 
                                  fgpartition(I)))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version compresses the logic into a single line using nested function calls.

1.  **`fgpartition(I)`**: Extracts foreground objects from the input grid.
2.  **`mapply(...)`**:  For each object, it generates a set of (row, column) indices representing the horizontal line, spanning from the leftmost to the rightmost column of the object, all at the row index of the object's center of mass.
3.  **`merge(...)`**: Combines all the generated indices into a single set.
4.  **`recolor(3, ...)`**: Assigns the color '3' to all indices in the set.
5.  **`paint(I, ...)`**:  Paints the recoloured indices onto the input grid `I` to produce the output.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def draw_line(obj):
    i = centerofmass(obj)[0]
    return frozenset((3, (i, j)) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1))

  lines = mapply(draw_line, fgpartition(I))
  return paint(I, merge(lines))
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a helper function `draw_line` for better code readability.

1. **`def draw_line(obj):`**: This function takes an object as input and returns a set of indices representing the horizontal line associated with that object.
2. **`lines = mapply(draw_line, fgpartition(I))`**:  This line first identifies the foreground objects using `fgpartition(I)`. Then, it applies the `draw_line` function to each object to generate the corresponding line indices.
3. **`return paint(I, merge(lines))`**: Finally, it merges all the line indices and paints them onto the input grid `I` to produce the output.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I,
               recolor(3,
                       merge([frozenset((centerofmass(obj)[0], j) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)) 
                              for obj in fgpartition(I)])))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses list comprehension for a more compact syntax.

1.  **`[frozenset(...) for obj in fgpartition(I)]`**: This list comprehension iterates through the foreground objects and generates a list where each element is a set of indices representing the horizontal line for the corresponding object.
2. **`merge(...)`**: Merges all the line index sets into a single set.
3. **`recolor(3, ...)`**:  Recolors all indices in the set to '3'.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`**: Paints the recoloured indices onto the input grid `I` to produce the output.

These different versions demonstrate various approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
