## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of the least common color in the input grid and expanding them by one layer using the color 3. 

**Input_0:**

* The least common color is 1.
* Two objects of color 1 exist.
* Each object is expanded by one layer, meaning cells directly above, below, left, and right of the object's cells are filled with 3.

**Input_1:**

* The least common color is 1.
* Two objects of color 1 exist.
* Similar to Input_0, each object is expanded by one layer, filling surrounding cells with 3.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  c = leastcolor(I)
  objs = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), c)
  expanded_indices = merge([dneighbors(cell) for obj in objs for _, cell in obj])
  O = fill(I, THREE, expanded_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`c = leastcolor(I)`:** Determine the least common color in the grid.
2. **`objs = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), c)`:** Identify objects of the least common color (`c`).
3. **`expanded_indices = merge([dneighbors(cell) for obj in objs for _, cell in obj])`:**  For each cell in each object, find its direct neighbors (above, below, left, right) and merge all these neighbor indices.
4. **`O = fill(I, THREE, expanded_indices)`:** Fill the input grid (`I`) with the value `THREE` at the identified `expanded_indices`.
5. **`return O`:** Return the transformed grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  return fill(I, THREE, 
             merge(apply(lambda o: 
                         mapply(dneighbors, 
                                toindices(o)), 
                         colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), 
                                    leastcolor(I)))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version achieves the same outcome as Version 1 but with a more compact and nested structure using functional programming concepts. 

1. It identifies objects of the least common color using `colorfilter` and `leastcolor`.
2. For each object, it applies `dneighbors` to every cell's index using `mapply` and `toindices`.
3. All the resulting neighbor indices are then merged using `merge`.
4. Finally, the input grid is filled with `THREE` at these indices using `fill`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    min_color = leastcolor(I)
    expanded_cells = set()
    for _, (i, j) in asobject(I):
        if index(I, (i, j)) == min_color:
            expanded_cells |= {(i - 1, j), (i + 1, j), (i, j - 1), (i, j + 1)}
    return fill(I, THREE, expanded_cells)
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a more iterative approach.

1. It iterates through each cell of the input grid (`I`).
2. If a cell's value matches the least common color (`min_color`), it adds the indices of its four direct neighbors to the `expanded_cells` set.
3. Finally, it fills the input grid (`I`) with the value `THREE` at the identified `expanded_cells` indices.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    c = leastcolor(I)
    objs = colorfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), c)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        for _, (i, j) in obj:
            O = fill(O, THREE, {(i - 1, j)})
            O = fill(O, THREE, {(i + 1, j)})
            O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j - 1)})
            O = fill(O, THREE, {(i, j + 1)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each object of the least common color. 

1. For every cell within these objects, it individually fills its four neighboring cells with `THREE` in the grid `O`, which is initially a copy of the input grid `I`. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    return fill(I, THREE,
                merge([
                    {(i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1)} 
                    for i, row in enumerate(I) 
                    for j, value in enumerate(row) 
                    if value == leastcolor(I)
                ]))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested list comprehensions for a more concise solution.

1. It iterates over each cell in the grid using nested loops within the list comprehension.
2. If a cell's value matches the `leastcolor`, it generates a set of its four neighbor indices.
3. All these neighbor indices are merged using `merge`, and the grid is filled with `THREE` at those locations using `fill`.
