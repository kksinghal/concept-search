## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying individual digits "1" in the input grid and replacing them with a cross shape of digit "3" centered on the original "1" location. 

**Example:**

Input Grid:

```
0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 
```

Output Grid:

```
0 0 0 1 0
0 0 3 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 
```

## Code Improvement:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve_cross(I):
  # Find locations of digit "1"
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  
  # Generate cross indices for each "1"
  crosses = mapply(lambda loc: frozenset({(loc[0]-1,loc[1]), (loc[0], loc[1]-1), loc, (loc[0], loc[1]+1), (loc[0]+1, loc[1])}), ones)
  
  # Combine all cross indices
  all_cross_indices = merge(crosses)
  
  # Recolor the cross indices to "3"
  cross_obj = recolor(THREE, all_cross_indices)
  
  # Paint the crosses onto the original grid
  O = paint(I, cross_obj)
  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify "1" locations:** `ofcolor(I, ONE)` finds all indices in the grid `I` with the value "1".
2. **Generate cross indices:** For each location `loc` of "1", it generates a set of indices forming a cross shape centered at `loc`.
3. **Combine crosses:**  `merge(crosses)` combines all individual cross index sets into a single set.
4. **Recolor:** `recolor(THREE, all_cross_indices)` creates an object with value "3" for all indices in `all_cross_indices`.
5. **Paint:** `paint(I, cross_obj)` paints the generated cross object onto the original grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve_cross(I):
  # Partition the grid based on digit "1"
  obj_ones = colorfilter(fgpartition(I), ONE)
  
  # Generate cross shape for each "1" object
  crosses = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE, backdrop(toindices(obj))), obj_ones)
  
  # Paint crosses onto a blank canvas
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(crosses))
  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Isolate "1" objects:** `colorfilter(fgpartition(I), ONE)` separates objects from the grid where the color is "1".
2. **Create crosses:** For each object containing "1", it generates a cross shape covering its bounding box using `backdrop` and recolors it to "3".
3. **Paint on blank canvas:** `paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), merge(crosses))` creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input and paints the generated crosses onto it.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve_cross(I):
  # Find "1" locations
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)

  # Create horizontal and vertical lines for each "1"
  hlines = mapply(lambda loc: recolor(THREE, hfrontier((loc[0]-1, loc[1]))), ones)
  vlines = mapply(lambda loc: recolor(THREE, vfrontier((loc[0], loc[1]-1))), ones)

  # Combine lines and paint on original grid
  O = paint(I, merge(hlines | vlines)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate "1"s:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Generate lines:** It creates horizontal and vertical lines using `hfrontier` and `vfrontier` extending from each "1" location, recoloring them to "3".
3. **Combine and paint:** The lines are combined and painted onto the original grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve_cross(I):
  # Define a function to generate cross indices
  def make_cross(loc):
    i, j = loc
    return frozenset({(i-1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j), (i,j+1), (i+1,j)})

  # Apply cross generation to each "1" location
  crosses = mapply(lambda loc: recolor(THREE, make_cross(loc)), ofcolor(I, ONE))

  # Paint crosses onto the original grid
  O = paint(I, merge(crosses))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `make_cross`:** A helper function is defined to specifically generate cross indices given a location.
2. **Apply to "1"s:**  `make_cross` is applied to each "1" location's indices.
3. **Paint:** Similar to previous versions.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve_cross(I):
  # Find "1" objects
  objects_one = colorfilter(objects(I, False, False, True), ONE)
  
  # Generate a cross object for each "1" object
  crosses = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(THREE,  
                      frozenset((i + di, j + dj) for i, j in toindices(obj) 
                      for di in range(-1, 2) for dj in range(-1, 2) 
                      if abs(di) != abs(dj))), objects_one)
  
  # Paint the crosses onto the original grid
  O = paint(I, merge(crosses))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find "1" objects:**  `colorfilter(objects(...), ONE)` extracts objects from the input grid that consist only of the digit "1".
2. **Generate cross object:** For each "1" object, it iterates over its indices and creates a new set of indices forming a cross shape, excluding the diagonal neighbors.
3. **Paint:** Similar to previous versions.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL.
