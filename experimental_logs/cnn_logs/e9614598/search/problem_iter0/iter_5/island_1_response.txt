## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects with the value '1' and draws a horizontal line of '3's centered on each object. The line's length is three cells. 

**Input_0:** 
- Two separate '1' objects exist.
- For each, a 3-cell horizontal line of '3's is drawn, centered on the '1'.

**Input_1:** 
- Two '1' objects exist.
- The transformation is applied identically to Input_0.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  line = lambda x: frozenset({astuple(add(x, LEFT)), x, astuple(add(x, RIGHT))})
  threes = mapply(line, ones, ones)
  O = fill(I, THREE, threes)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)`:**  Identifies the locations of all '1's in the input grid `I`.
2. **`line = lambda x: frozenset({astuple(add(x, LEFT)), x, astuple(add(x, RIGHT))})`:**  Defines a lambda function `line` that takes a location `x` and returns a set containing the location itself and its immediate left and right neighbors. This effectively creates the 3-cell horizontal line.
3. **`threes = mapply(line, ones, ones)`:** Applies the `line` function to each location in `ones`. It essentially duplicates the `ones` set as input to `mapply` to ensure it iterates through each element individually.
4. **`O = fill(I, THREE, threes)`:**  Fills the input grid `I` with the value '3' at the locations specified by `threes`.
5. **`return O`:** Returns the modified grid `O`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  ones = colorfilter(objs, ONE)
  threes = mfilter(ones, lambda obj: frozenset((THREE, i) for i in connect((add(centerofmass(obj), LEFT)), (add(centerofmass(obj), RIGHT)))))
  O = paint(I, merge(threes))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Identifies all objects in the grid `I`, treating cells with the same value as connected (but not diagonally).
2. **`ones = colorfilter(objs, ONE)`:** Filters the objects to keep only those consisting of '1's.
3. **`threes = mfilter(ones, lambda obj: frozenset((THREE, i) for i in connect((add(centerofmass(obj), LEFT)), (add(centerofmass(obj), RIGHT)))))`:** For each object of '1's, it calculates its center of mass, determines the locations one cell to the left and right, and connects them with a line of '3's.
4. **`O = paint(I, merge(threes))`:** Merges all the generated lines of '3's and paints them onto the input grid `I`.
5. **`return O`:** Returns the modified grid `O`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_locations = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  make_line = lambda loc: frozenset({astuple(add(loc, LEFT)), loc, astuple(add(loc, RIGHT))})
  three_locations = mapply(make_line, one_locations, one_locations)
  O = fill(I, THREE, three_locations)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`one_locations = ofcolor(I, ONE)`:**  Gets the locations of all cells with value '1'.
2. **`make_line = lambda loc: frozenset({astuple(add(loc, LEFT)), loc, astuple(add(loc, RIGHT))})`:** Defines a lambda function that generates a set of locations representing a horizontal 3-cell line centered at the input location.
3. **`three_locations = mapply(make_line, one_locations, one_locations)`:** Applies the `make_line` function to each location in `one_locations`. Similar to Version 1, it duplicates the input set for individual element iteration.
4. **`O = fill(I, THREE, three_locations)`:**  Fills the input grid with '3' at the computed `three_locations`.
5. **`return O`:**  Returns the transformed grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = objects(I, True, False, True)
  ones = colorfilter(ones, ONE)
  horizontal_line = lambda obj: frozenset((THREE, (i, j)) for i, j in connect((uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj) - 1), (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)))
  threes = mfilter(ones, horizontal_line)
  O = paint(I, merge(threes))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = objects(I, True, False, True)`:**  Finds all connected objects (non-diagonal) in the grid.
2. **`ones = colorfilter(ones, ONE)`:** Filters for objects consisting only of the value '1'.
3. **`horizontal_line = lambda obj: ...`:** Defines a function to create a horizontal line of '3's. It finds the top and leftmost/rightmost points of an object and connects them with a line, extending one cell beyond on each side.
4. **`threes = mfilter(ones, horizontal_line)`:** Applies the line drawing function to each object of '1's.
5. **`O = paint(I, merge(threes))`:**  Paints the generated lines onto the input grid.
6. **`return O`:** Returns the final grid.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  draw_line = lambda idx: frozenset((THREE, (idx[0], j)) for j in range(idx[1]-1, idx[1]+2))
  three_indices = mapply(draw_line, one_indices, one_indices)
  O = fill(I, THREE, three_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`one_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)`:** Finds all indices of cells containing the value '1'.
2. **`draw_line = lambda idx: ...`:**  Creates a lambda function that takes an index (i, j) and generates a set representing a 3-cell horizontal line centered at that index.
3. **`three_indices = mapply(draw_line, one_indices, one_indices)`:** Applies the line drawing to each '1' index. It duplicates the `one_indices` set to iterate through each element individually.
4. **`O = fill(I, THREE, three_indices)`:** Fills the grid with '3' at the specified indices.
5. **`return O`:** Returns the transformed grid.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, using various DSL functions and logic.
