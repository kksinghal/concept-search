## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific shapes within the input grid and recoloring them based on their position and orientation. 

* **Horizontal rectangles:** These are filled with the color '8'.
* **Vertical rectangles:** These are filled with the color '7'.
* **Single cells at the intersection of horizontal and vertical rectangles:** These cells are colored '6'.

This recoloring happens for all instances of the shapes across all input grids.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  hori = mfilter(objs, hline)
  verti = mfilter(objs, vline)
  inter = mfilter(prapply(intersection, hori, verti), sizefilter(ONE))
  hori_filled = fill(I, EIGHT, merge(hori))
  verti_filled = fill(hori_filled, SEVEN, merge(verti))
  O = fill(verti_filled, SIX, inter)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify shapes:** We first use `objects` to find all distinct shapes. Then, we filter for horizontal lines (`hori`) and vertical lines (`verti`) using `mfilter`, `hline`, and `vline`.
2. **Find intersections:**  We find intersections between horizontal and vertical lines using `prapply` with `intersection`. Then, single-cell intersections are extracted using `sizefilter` and `ONE`.
3. **Recolor:** We use `fill` to recolor the grid in three steps: 
    * Fill horizontal lines with '8'.
    * Fill vertical lines with '7'.
    * Fill intersections with '6'.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  hori = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: hline(obj) and size(obj) > ONE)
  verti = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: vline(obj) and size(obj) > ONE)
  inter = prapply(intersection, hori, verti)
  grid1 = fill(I, EIGHT, merge(hori))
  grid2 = fill(grid1, SEVEN, merge(verti))
  O = fill(grid2, SIX, merge(inter))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Similar to Version 1, but directly filters for horizontal and vertical lines larger than one cell during object identification using `lambda` functions.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  hori = sfilter(objs, hline)
  verti = sfilter(objs, vline)
  inter = mpapply(intersection, totuple(hori), totuple(verti))
  O = fill(fill(fill(I, EIGHT, merge(hori)), SEVEN, merge(verti)), SIX, inter)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Employs `sfilter` instead of `mfilter` for initial shape identification and utilizes `totuple` to convert sets to tuples before applying `mpapply` for intersection finding. The final recoloring is condensed into a single line using nested `fill` calls.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  hori = frozenset(filter(hline, objs))
  verti = frozenset(filter(vline, objs))
  inter = merge(apply(lambda x: intersection(*x), product(hori, verti)))
  O = paint(paint(paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), recolor(EIGHT, merge(hori))), recolor(SEVEN, merge(verti))), recolor(SIX, inter))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Uses Python's built-in `filter` function for shape identification and leverages `product` to generate all possible pairs of horizontal and vertical lines. Intersection finding is done using a lambda function within `apply`. Instead of `fill`, this version utilizes `paint` with `canvas` and `recolor` for a more visual approach to grid manipulation. 

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  hori = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda o: hline(o) and width(o) > 1)
  verti = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda o: vline(o) and height(o) > 1)
  grid = I
  for obj in hori:
    grid = fill(grid, EIGHT, obj)
  for obj in verti:
    grid = fill(grid, SEVEN, obj)
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(grid, (i, j)) == ZERO and any(contained((i,j), obj) for obj in hori) and any(contained((i,j), obj) for obj in verti):
        grid = fill(grid, SIX, {(i,j)})
  O = grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version prioritizes a more iterative approach. It identifies horizontal and vertical lines greater than one cell in length and then uses loops to iterate through them, filling them with the appropriate colors directly on a copy of the input grid. Finally, it iterates through every cell in the grid to locate and fill intersections with the color '6'.

These five versions showcase different ways to approach the same transformation using the provided DSL, offering a diverse set of solutions. Each version has its own strengths and weaknesses in terms of readability, efficiency, and conciseness.
