## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on modifying the visual appearance of objects within the grid. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:**  The transformation changes the central 3x3 square of each 5x5 object from 0 to a different digit. The top 5x5 object is filled with '8', and the bottom one with '7'.

**Pair 1:**  Similar to Pair 0, the central 3x3 portion of each 5x5 object is modified. The top object's center changes to '7', and the bottom one's to '8'. Additionally, a single '6' is placed in the object that was a horizontal line in the input.

**Pair 2:** This transformation follows the pattern of modifying the central 3x3 portion of 5x5 objects. The top object's center becomes '8' and the bottom one's becomes '7'. 

**Overall Logic:**

The transformation consistently targets the central 3x3 area of 5x5 objects, changing the values based on their position (top or bottom) within the grid.  The specific digits used for filling (7, 8) seem to be dependent on the object's position and are sometimes swapped.

## Code Generation:

Due to the prompt's constraint of using only functions from existing programs (which are not provided in this excerpt), I cannot generate the code using the specific DSL you provided. 

However, I can provide a conceptual outline and pseudocode demonstrating the logic required for the transformation. You can adapt this to your specific DSL:

**Conceptual Outline:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Use a function like `objects()` to identify distinct objects within the grid.
2. **Filter by Size:** Filter the objects to isolate those with a specific size (5x5 in this case).
3. **Determine Position:** For each 5x5 object, determine if it's the top or bottom one in the grid.
4. **Modify Center:**  Modify the central 3x3 area of each object based on its position:
    - Top object: Fill with digit '8' (or '7' depending on the pattern)
    - Bottom object: Fill with digit '7' (or '8')
5. **Handle Special Cases:**  If an object's shape needs special modification (like adding a '6' in Pair 1), add conditional logic.
6. **Reconstruct Grid:** Combine the modified objects with the original grid to produce the final output.

**Pseudocode Example:**

```python
def transform_grid(grid):
  objects = identify_objects(grid)
  five_by_five_objects = filter_objects_by_size(objects, (5,5))

  for obj in five_by_five_objects:
    if is_top_object(obj):
      fill_value = 8 # or 7
    else: 
      fill_value = 7 # or 8

    obj = modify_object_center(obj, fill_value)
    
    # Handle special case modifications here (e.g., adding '6')

  output_grid = reconstruct_grid(grid, modified_objects)
  return output_grid
```

**Note:** This is a simplified representation. You'll need to adapt it based on the available functions in your DSL and potentially add more complex logic for specific cases. 

## Code Extraction:

Since I cannot provide the exact code due to the prompt's limitations, there's no code to extract. Once you provide the missing programs with their function definitions, I can help you generate the exact DSL code and format it for easy extraction.
