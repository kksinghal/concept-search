## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on modifying the shape of objects within the grid while preserving their original color. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation expands the horizontal objects (sequences of 5s) vertically by one cell above and below. The central cell of these expanded segments is replaced with '6', and the newly added cells adjacent to the original object are replaced with '7'. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the previous transformation, horizontal objects are expanded vertically.  However, in this case, only the bottom part of the object is expanded.  The central cell of the expanded segment is replaced with '6', and the newly added cells adjacent to the original object are replaced with '8'.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** This transformation applies the same logic as the previous two but to vertical objects instead of horizontal ones. The expansion happens to the right side of the object. The central cell of the expanded segment is replaced with '6', and the newly added cells adjacent to the original object are replaced with '7'.

## Code Generation:

Based on the analysis, here are five distinct program versions:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    for obj in objs:
        if hline(obj):
            I = underfill(I, 7, shift(toindices(obj), (1, 0)))
            I = underfill(I, 7, shift(toindices(obj), (-1, 0)))
        if vline(obj):
            I = underfill(I, 7, shift(toindices(obj), (0, 1)))
            I = underfill(I, 7, shift(toindices(obj), (0, -1)))
        I = fill(I, 6, {center(obj)})
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** It identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Expand:** For each object, it checks if it's a horizontal or vertical line. If it is, it expands the object by one cell in the respective direction by filling with '7'.
3. **Fill Center:** It fills the center of each object with '6'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    for obj in objs:
        h, w = shape(obj)
        if h > w:
            for i in range(1, h // 2 + 1):
                I = underfill(I, 7, shift(toindices(obj), (i, 0)))
                I = underfill(I, 7, shift(toindices(obj), (-i, 0)))
        if w > h:
            for i in range(1, w // 2 + 1):
                I = underfill(I, 7, shift(toindices(obj), (0, i)))
                I = underfill(I, 7, shift(toindices(obj), (0, -i)))
        I = fill(I, 6, {center(obj)})
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** It identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Expand:** For each object, it determines if it's taller than it is wide (vertical line) or wider than it is tall (horizontal line). It then iterates through half of the object's height or width, respectively, and expands the object one cell at a time by filling with '7'.
3. **Fill Center:** It fills the center of each object with '6'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    for v in palette(I) - {0}:
        obj = {(v, (i, j)) for i, r in enumerate(I) for j, c in enumerate(r) if c == v}
        if hline(obj):
            I = underfill(I, 7, shift(toindices(obj), (1, 0)))
            I = underfill(I, 7, shift(toindices(obj), (-1, 0)))
        if vline(obj):
            I = underfill(I, 7, shift(toindices(obj), (0, 1)))
            I = underfill(I, 7, shift(toindices(obj), (0, -1)))
        I = fill(I, 6, {center(obj)})
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Colors:** It iterates through each non-background color in the grid.
2. **Reconstruct Object:** It reconstructs the object corresponding to the current color.
3. **Expand and Fill:** Similar to Program Version 1, it expands and fills the center of horizontal and vertical line objects.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    for obj in objs:
        h, w = shape(obj)
        if h > 1 and w == 1:
            I = paint(I, shift(recolor(7, obj), (1, 0)))
            I = paint(I, shift(recolor(7, obj), (-1, 0)))
        if w > 1 and h == 1:
            I = paint(I, shift(recolor(7, obj), (0, 1)))
            I = paint(I, shift(recolor(7, obj), (0, -1)))
        I = fill(I, 6, {center(obj)})
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** It identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Check Line Type:** For each object, it checks if it's a vertical or horizontal line using dimensions. 
3. **Recolor and Shift:** If a line, it recolors the object to '7' and paints shifted copies above/below or left/right of the original object.
4. **Fill Center:** It fills the center of each object with '6'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val != 0:
                if (i > 0 and I[i-1][j] == val) or (i < len(I)-1 and I[i+1][j] == val):
                    if i > 0:
                        I = fill(I, 7, {(i - 1, j)})
                    if i < len(I) - 1:
                        I = fill(I, 7, {(i + 1, j)})
                if (j > 0 and I[i][j-1] == val) or (j < len(row)-1 and I[i][j+1] == val):
                    if j > 0:
                        I = fill(I, 7, {(i, j - 1)})
                    if j < len(row) - 1:
                        I = fill(I, 7, {(i, j + 1)})
                I = fill(I, 6, {(i, j)})
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:** It iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check Neighbors:** For each non-background cell, it checks its neighbors to determine if it's part of a horizontal or vertical line.
3. **Fill Adjacent Cells:** If a line is detected, it fills the adjacent cells with '7'.
4. **Fill Center:** It fills the current cell (center of the detected line segment) with '6'.
