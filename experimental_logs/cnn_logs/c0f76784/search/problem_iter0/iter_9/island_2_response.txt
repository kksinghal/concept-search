## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects (connected regions of the same digit) within the grid, specifically targeting the digit '5'. The goal is to change the color of the cells within these objects based on their spatial relationship to other objects:

* **Inner Cells:**  Cells within '5' objects that are not directly adjacent to another object are changed to '8'. 
* **Border Cells:** Cells within '5' objects that are directly adjacent to another object are changed to '7'.
* **Special Case:** In some instances, a single cell within a '5' object, adjacent to a border cell, is changed to '6'. This seems to occur when the cell is horizontally or vertically aligned with a non-border cell of a different object.

This logic applies consistently to all three input-output pairs.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def solve_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
    fives = colorfilter(objs, FIVE)
    others = difference(objs, fives)
    
    border = mfilter(fives, lambda obj: any(adjacent(obj, other) for other in others))
    inner = difference(mapply(toindices, fives), mapply(toindices, border))

    special = set()
    for obj in fives:
        for i, j in toindices(obj):
            if (i, j) in inner:
                if any((i + 1, j) in toindices(other) or (i - 1, j) in toindices(other) for other in others) or \
                   any((i, j + 1) in toindices(other) or (i, j - 1) in toindices(other) for other in others):
                    special.add((i, j))

    O = fill(I, EIGHT, inner)
    O = fill(O, SEVEN, mapply(toindices, border))
    O = fill(O, SIX, frozenset(special))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  The code identifies all objects in the grid and separates '5' objects from the rest.
2. **Find Border:** It determines 'border' objects, which are '5' objects adjacent to any other object.
3. **Find Inner:** 'Inner' cells are identified by finding cells within '5' objects that are not part of the border.
4. **Special Case:** The code iterates through '5' objects and identifies the 'special' cells adjacent to the border and aligned with non-border cells of other objects.
5. **Fill Colors:** Finally, it fills the grid with the appropriate colors: '8' for inner cells, '7' for border cells, and '6' for special cells.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def solve_generated(I):
    fives = mapply(toindices, colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), FIVE))
    non_fives = mapply(toindices, difference(objects(I, T, F, F), colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), FIVE)))
    
    border = mfilter(fives, lambda loc: any(manhattan(frozenset({loc}), frozenset({other})) == 1 for other in non_fives))
    inner = fives - border

    special = set()
    for i, j in inner:
        if any((i + 1, j) in non_fives or (i - 1, j) in non_fives or (i, j + 1) in non_fives or (i, j - 1) in non_fives):
            special.add((i, j))

    O = fill(I, EIGHT, inner)
    O = fill(O, SEVEN, border)
    O = fill(O, SIX, frozenset(special))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Indices:** Directly extracts indices of '5' cells and non-'5' cells.
2. **Simplified Border:**  Finds 'border' cells by checking the Manhattan distance between each '5' cell and all non-'5' cells.
3. **Direct Special Case:**  Identifies 'special' cells within the 'inner' cells by directly checking adjacency to non-'5' cells.
4. **Color Filling:**  Similar to version 1, it fills the grid with the appropriate colors based on cell classification.

This version simplifies the logic by working directly with cell indices and using Manhattan distance for border detection.
