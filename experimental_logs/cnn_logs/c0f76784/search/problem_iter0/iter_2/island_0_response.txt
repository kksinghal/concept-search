## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying specific rectangular patterns within the input grids and recoloring them with specific values. The patterns and recoloring logic are as follows:

* **Pattern 1:** Rectangles with an odd height. These are filled with the value **7**.
* **Pattern 2:** Rectangles with an even height. These are filled with the value **8**. 
* **Pattern 3:** Single cells (1x1 squares) located at the top left corner of even height rectangles. These are filled with the value **6**.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    odd_height_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda o: not even(height(o)))
    even_height_objs = difference(objs, odd_height_objs)
    single_cell_objs = mfilter(even_height_objs, lambda o: square(o) and size(o) == 1)
    O = fill(I, 7, merge(apply(toindices, odd_height_objs)))
    O = fill(O, 8, merge(apply(toindices, even_height_objs)))
    O = fill(O, 6, merge(apply(toindices, single_cell_objs)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extracts all objects from the input grid `I` (`objects(I, T, F, T)`).
2. **Filter by Height:** Separates objects into two groups: those with odd height (`odd_height_objs`) and those with even height (`even_height_objs`).
3. **Find Single Cells:** Identifies single-cell objects within the even height group (`single_cell_objs`).
4. **Recolor Grid:** Fills the grid with the specified values based on the object categories:
    * Odd height objects are filled with **7**.
    * Even height objects are filled with **8**.
    * Single-cell objects at the corners of even height objects are filled with **6**.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
    even_rectangles = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: even(height(o)))
    odd_rectangles = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: not even(height(o)))
    corner_cells = mfilter(even_rectangles, lambda o: square(o) and size(o) == 1)
    O = paint(I, recolor(8, even_rectangles))
    O = paint(O, recolor(7, odd_rectangles))
    O = paint(O, recolor(6, corner_cells))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Rectangles:** Extracts all rectangles from the input grid `I` and categorizes them as even or odd based on their height.
2. **Find Corner Cells:** Identifies single-cell rectangles within the even height group.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** Recolors the identified rectangles and cells with the target values (8, 7, and 6) and paints them onto the input grid.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
    all_objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    O = I
    for obj in all_objs:
        if even(height(obj)):
            O = fill(O, 8, toindices(obj))
            if square(obj) and size(obj) == 1:
                O = fill(O, 6, toindices(obj))
        else:
            O = fill(O, 7, toindices(obj))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Objects:** Iterates through each object extracted from the input grid.
2. **Conditional Recoloring:** Based on the object's height, fills the grid with the corresponding value (8 for even, 7 for odd).
3. **Single Cell Handling:** For even height objects, checks if it's a single cell and fills it with 6 if true.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
    def recolor_rule(v, loc):
        obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: contained(loc, toindices(o)))
        return 6 if square(obj) and size(obj) == 1 and even(height(obj)) else (8 if even(height(obj)) else 7)
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I)):
            O = fill(O, recolor_rule(I[i][j], (i, j)), {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Recoloring Rule:** Defines a rule that determines the new color for each cell based on its belonging object's properties.
2. **Iterate and Apply:** Iterates through each cell in the grid, applies the recoloring rule, and constructs the output grid.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    even_height_indices = merge(apply(toindices, sfilter(objs, lambda o: even(height(o)))))
    odd_height_indices = difference(asindices(I), even_height_indices)
    single_cell_indices = mfilter(objs, lambda o: square(o) and size(o) == 1 and contained(ulcorner(o), even_height_indices))
    O = fill(I, 8, even_height_indices)
    O = fill(O, 7, odd_height_indices)
    O = fill(O, 6, merge(apply(toindices, single_cell_indices)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Indices:** Instead of working with objects directly, this version identifies the indices of cells belonging to each pattern.
2. **Recolor by Indices:** Fills the grid with the target values based on the pre-identified indices for each pattern. 

These five versions offer different approaches to achieve the desired transformation, each leveraging a different combination of DSL functions and logic.
