## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves highlighting the inner and outer boundaries of objects within the grid. Here's a breakdown:

**Outer Boundary:** The cells directly surrounding the object (touching at least one side). These cells are filled with the value **7**.

**Inner Boundary:** The cells that are completely enclosed within the object, forming a "hole". These cells are filled with the value **8**.

**Object Preservation:** The original object cells retain their values.

**Background Preservation:** All other cells (background) remain unchanged.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  outer_boundary = difference(mapply(backdrop, objs), mapply(toindices, objs))
  inner_boundary = difference(mapply(inbox, mapply(toindices, objs)), mapply(toindices, objs))
  O = fill(I, SEVEN, outer_boundary)
  O = fill(O, EIGHT, inner_boundary)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Outer Boundary:**  
   - `mapply(backdrop, objs)` creates a set of all cells within the bounding boxes of each object.
   - `mapply(toindices, objs)` creates a set of all object cell indices.
   - `difference` between these two sets isolates the outer boundary cells.
3. **Inner Boundary:**
   - `mapply(inbox, mapply(toindices, objs))` finds the indices of the inner boxes of each object.
   - `difference` with `mapply(toindices, objs)` removes the actual object cells, leaving the inner boundary.
4. **Fill Boundaries:**
   - `fill(I, SEVEN, outer_boundary)` fills the outer boundary cells with the value 7.
   - `fill(O, EIGHT, inner_boundary)` fills the inner boundary cells with the value 8.
5. **Return:** The modified grid `O` is returned.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, recolor(SEVEN, delta(obj)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(EIGHT, difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Iterative Painting:** This version iterates through each object individually.
3. **Outer Boundary:**
   - `delta(obj)` directly identifies the outer boundary cells for the current object.
   - `recolor(SEVEN, delta(obj))` recolors these cells with the value 7.
   - `paint(O, ...)` updates the grid `O` with the recolored boundary.
4. **Inner Boundary:**
   - `difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))` identifies the inner boundary cells for the current object.
   - `recolor(EIGHT, ...)` recolors these cells with the value 8.
   - `paint(O, ...)` updates the grid `O` again.
5. **Return:** The final modified grid `O` is returned.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    outer = mapply(lambda obj: difference(dneighbors(centerofmass(obj)), toindices(obj)), objs)
    inner = mapply(lambda obj: difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj)), objs)
    O = fill(I, SEVEN, outer)
    O = fill(O, EIGHT, inner)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Outer Boundary (Approximation):**
   - This version approximates the outer boundary by finding the direct neighbors of the object's center of mass. 
   - `centerofmass(obj)` calculates the center of mass for each object.
   - `dneighbors(...)` gets the directly adjacent cells to the center of mass.
   - `difference(..., toindices(obj))` removes any actual object cells from this set, leaving a rough approximation of the outer boundary.
3. **Inner Boundary:** Same logic as Version 2.
4. **Fill Boundaries:** Same as Version 1.
5. **Return:**  Same as Version 1.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  outer_boundary = set()
  inner_boundary = set()
  for obj in objs:
    outer_boundary.update(difference(dneighbors(c), toindices(obj)) for c in toindices(obj))
    inner_boundary.update(difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj)))
  O = fill(I, SEVEN, frozenset(outer_boundary))
  O = fill(O, EIGHT, frozenset(inner_boundary))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Iterative Boundary Construction:** This version iterates through objects and directly builds the boundary sets.
3. **Outer Boundary:**
   - It iterates through each cell `c` in the object.
   - `dneighbors(c)` gets the direct neighbors of the cell.
   - `difference(..., toindices(obj))` removes any object cells, leaving potential outer boundary cells.
   - `outer_boundary.update(...)` adds these potential boundary cells to the set.
4. **Inner Boundary:** Same logic as Version 2.
5. **Fill Boundaries:** Same logic as Version 1, with conversion to `frozenset` before filling.
6. **Return:** Same as Version 1.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]:
        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
        if (ni, nj) not in toindices(obj) and 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]):
          O = fill(O, SEVEN, {(ni, nj)})
      inner = difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))
      O = fill(O, EIGHT, inner)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Iterates through objects using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Outer Boundary (Direct Iteration):**
   - For each object cell, it iterates through its four direct neighbors (up, down, left, right).
   - It checks if the neighbor is within the grid bounds and not part of the object.
   - If both conditions are true, it fills the neighbor cell with the value 7.
3. **Inner Boundary:** Same logic as Version 2, calculated and filled within the object loop.
4. **Return:** Returns the modified grid `O`.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the desired transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic. Remember that these are just a few examples, and numerous other valid solutions might exist using this DSL.
