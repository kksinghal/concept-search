## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation identifies objects within the grid (clusters of the same digit). It then recolors these objects based on their size, using the following rules:

* **Single cells:** Recolored to **6**
* **Objects smaller than 9 cells:** Recolored to **7**
* **Objects larger than or equal to 9 cells:** Recolored to **8**

This logic applies consistently across all input-output pairs.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    recolor_value = 6 if size(obj) == 1 else (7 if size(obj) < 9 else 8)
    I = fill(I, recolor_value, toindices(obj))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through objects:**  The code iterates through each `obj` in `objs`.
3. **Determine recolor value:** `recolor_value` is set based on the object's size using a conditional expression.
4. **Fill object:** `I = fill(I, recolor_value, toindices(obj))` recolors the object in the grid `I`.
5. **Return modified grid:** The transformed grid `I` is returned.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), 
               merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(6 if size(obj) == 1 else (7 if size(obj) < 9 else 8), obj),
                         objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a blank canvas:** `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` generates a grid of the same size as the input `I`, filled with the background color.
2. **Identify objects and recolor:** `apply(lambda obj: recolor(6 if size(obj) == 1 else (7 if size(obj) < 9 else 8), obj), objects(I, T, F, T))` extracts objects, applies the recoloring logic within a lambda function, and returns a list of recolored objects.
3. **Merge and paint:**  `merge(...)` combines all recolored objects. Finally, `paint(...)` paints the merged objects onto the blank canvas, resulting in the output grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  small_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) == 1)
  medium_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) > 1 and size(obj) < 9)
  large_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) >= 9)
  I = fill(I, 6, small_objs)
  I = fill(I, 7, medium_objs)
  I = fill(I, 8, large_objs)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Categorize objects:** The code first identifies and separates objects into three categories based on size: `small_objs`, `medium_objs`, and `large_objs`.
2. **Recolor by category:** Each category is then filled with its corresponding color (6, 7, and 8) using `fill`.
3. **Return modified grid:** The transformed grid `I` is returned.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i,j)) != mostcolor(I):
        obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: contained((i,j), toindices(obj)))
        recolor_value = 6 if size(obj) == 1 else (7 if size(obj) < 9 else 8) 
        I = fill(I, recolor_value, toindices(obj))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** This version iterates through each cell of the grid using nested loops.
2. **Check for non-background color:** If a cell isn't the background color, it identifies the object to which the cell belongs.
3. **Recolor object:**  The object is then recolored based on its size using the same logic as before.
4. **Return modified grid:** The transformed grid `I` is returned.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_object(obj):
    return recolor(6 if size(obj) == 1 else (7 if size(obj) < 9 else 8), obj)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(apply(recolor_object, objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define recoloring function:** `recolor_object` function encapsulates the logic for determining the recolor value based on object size.
2. **Identify and recolor objects:** Similar to Version 2, this version identifies objects, applies the `recolor_object` function to each, and merges them.
3. **Paint onto canvas:** The merged, recolored objects are painted onto a blank canvas and returned.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL. Each version provides a distinct logical flow and uses different function combinations.
