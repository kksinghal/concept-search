## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the grid and then highlighting specific regions around those objects with different colors.

**Specifically:**

* **Inner Boundary:** The cells directly within the bounding box of an object, but not part of the object itself, are colored with the value **8**.
* **Outer Boundary:** The cells directly outside the bounding box of an object, but only those adjacent to the object itself, are colored with the value **7**.
* **Special Case:** There seems to be a special case where if the object is a single vertical line, the outer boundary is filled with value **6** instead of **7**.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    outer_boundary = set()
    inner_boundary = set()
    for obj in objs:
        if vline(toindices(obj)):
            outer_boundary.update(difference(dneighbors(c), toindices(obj)) for c in toindices(obj))
            outer_boundary = recolor(6, frozenset(outer_boundary)) 
        else:
            outer_boundary.update(difference(dneighbors(c), toindices(obj)) for c in toindices(obj))
            outer_boundary = recolor(7, frozenset(outer_boundary)) 
        inner_boundary.update(difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj)))
    O = fill(I, color(outer_boundary), toindices(outer_boundary))
    O = fill(O, EIGHT, frozenset(inner_boundary))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all distinct objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate Through Objects:** For each `obj` in `objs`:
    * **Special Case Check:** `if vline(toindices(obj))` checks if the object is a vertical line.
        * **Vertical Line:** If true, the outer boundary is calculated using `dneighbors` and `difference`, then recolored to **6**.
        * **Other Shapes:** If false, the outer boundary is calculated similarly but recolored to **7**.
    * **Inner Boundary Calculation:** The inner boundary is calculated using `inbox` and `difference`.
3. **Fill Grid:** 
    * The input grid `I` is filled with the appropriate outer boundary color using `fill`.
    * The resulting grid is further filled with **8** for the inner boundary using `fill`.
4. **Return Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        O = paint(O, recolor(EIGHT, difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))))
        if vline(toindices(obj)):
            O = paint(O, recolor(SIX, difference(mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))))
        else:
            O = paint(O, recolor(SEVEN, difference(mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Iterate and Modify:** Iterates through each object and directly modifies the grid `O`:
    * **Inner Boundary:**  Calculates and paints the inner boundary with **8** using `paint`, `recolor`, `inbox`, and `difference`.
    * **Outer Boundary:**
        * **Check for Vertical Line:** Uses `vline` to determine if the object is a vertical line.
        * **Conditional Coloring:** Based on the line check, the outer boundary is calculated and painted with either **6** (for vertical lines) or **7** using `paint`, `recolor`, `mapply`, `dneighbors`, and `difference`.
3. **Return Modified Grid:** The modified grid `O` is returned.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  outer = mapply(lambda obj: branch(vline(obj), 
                                    recolor(SIX, difference(mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))), 
                                    recolor(SEVEN, difference(mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj)), toindices(obj)))),
                  objs)
  inner = mapply(lambda obj: difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj)), objs)
  O = fill(I, mostcolor(outer), toindices(outer))
  O = fill(O, EIGHT, inner)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1 and 2.
2. **Calculate Boundaries:** 
    * **Outer Boundary:** Uses `mapply` and a lambda function to calculate the outer boundary for all objects simultaneously. The lambda function uses `branch` to choose between recoloring the boundary with **6** (if `vline` is True) or **7** (if `vline` is False).
    * **Inner Boundary:** Similar to Version 1, calculates the inner boundary for all objects using `mapply`, `inbox`, and `difference`.
3. **Fill the Grid:**
    * Fills the input grid `I` with the appropriate outer boundary color (determined by `mostcolor(outer)`) at the calculated outer boundary indices.
    * Fills the resulting grid with **8** at the calculated inner boundary indices.
4. **Return Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        inner_boundary = difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))
        O = fill(O, EIGHT, inner_boundary)
        for c in toindices(obj):
            neighbors_c = dneighbors(c)
            for n in neighbors_c:
                if n not in toindices(obj):
                    if vline(toindices(obj)):
                        O = fill(O, SIX, {n})
                    else:
                        O = fill(O, SEVEN, {n})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** Iterates through each object and directly fills the grid `O`:
    * **Inner Boundary:** Calculates and fills the inner boundary with **8** similar to previous versions.
    * **Outer Boundary:** 
        * **Iterate through Object Cells:** For each cell `c` in the object's indices:
            * **Find Neighbors:**  Gets the direct neighbors of `c` using `dneighbors`.
            * **Check for Boundary:**  Iterates through each neighbor `n` and checks if it's not part of the object.
            * **Conditional Filling:** If `n` is a boundary cell:
                * Checks if the object is a vertical line using `vline`.
                * Fills `n` with **6** if a vertical line, otherwise fills with **7**.
3. **Return Output:** Returns the modified grid `O`.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, recolor(EIGHT, difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))))
    outer = difference(mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))
    for cell in outer:
      if index(O, cell) == 0:
        if vline(obj):
          O = fill(O, SIX, {cell})
        else:
          O = fill(O, SEVEN, {cell})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as previous versions.
2. **Iterate and Modify:** Iterates through each object and directly modifies the grid `O`:
    * **Inner Boundary:** Calculates and paints the inner boundary with **8** using `paint`, `recolor`, `inbox`, and `difference`.
    * **Outer Boundary:**
        * **Calculate Potential Boundary:** Calculates potential outer boundary cells using `difference`, `mapply`, and `dneighbors`.
        * **Filter Boundary:** Iterates through potential boundary cells (`cell` in `outer`):
            * **Check for Empty Cell:** Uses `index(O, cell)` to ensure the cell is currently empty (value 0).
            * **Conditional Filling:** If the cell is empty:
                * Checks if the object is a vertical line using `vline`.
                * Fills the cell with **6** if a vertical line, otherwise fills with **7**.
3. **Return Output:** Returns the modified grid `O`.
