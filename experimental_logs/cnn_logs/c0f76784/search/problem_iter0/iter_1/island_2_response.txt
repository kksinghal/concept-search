## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the input grid and changing the color of certain cells within those objects based on their position relative to the object's boundaries. 

**Specifically:**

* Cells adjacent to the outer boundary of an object are colored '7'.
* Cells adjacent to the inner boundary of an object (one cell away from the outer boundary) are colored '8'.
* In cases where an object is a single line (horizontal or vertical), only the cells adjacent to the outer boundary are colored '7', leaving the inner cells unchanged.
* A special case exists where a single cell within an object is colored '6'. This occurs when the cell is positioned one cell away from a corner cell diagonally, towards the center of the object.

**Input-Output Pair Examples:**

**Input_0:** The transformation identifies two objects (groups of '5's). In the top object, cells directly below and to the right of the '0' are colored '8'. Cells directly adjacent to the object's boundary are colored '7'. The same logic applies to the bottom object.

**Input_1 and Input_2:** These examples further demonstrate the transformation logic on objects with different shapes and positions. The same rules for coloring boundary-adjacent cells apply.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated":

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve_e73095fd(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    O = fill(I, SEVEN, delta(obj))
    O = underfill(O, EIGHT, inbox(toindices(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, T, T)` extracts all objects (connected groups of non-background cells) from the input grid 'I'.
2. **Iterate Through Objects:** The code iterates through each identified object 'obj'.
3. **Color Outer Boundary:**  `fill(I, SEVEN, delta(obj))` colors the cells adjacent to the outer boundary of the current object 'obj' with the value '7'.
4. **Color Inner Boundary:** `underfill(O, EIGHT, inbox(toindices(obj)))` colors the cells adjacent to the inner boundary of the current object 'obj' with the value '8', only if the cell was originally background.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve_e73095fd(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = paint(O, recolor(SEVEN, delta(obj)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(EIGHT, inbox(toindices(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** `O = I` initializes the output grid 'O' with the input grid 'I'.
2. **Iterate Through Objects:** The code iterates through each object 'obj' found in the input.
3. **Color Outer Boundary:** `paint(O, recolor(SEVEN, delta(obj)))` recolors the 'delta' of the object (cells surrounding the object) to '7' and paints it onto the output grid.
4. **Color Inner Boundary:**  `paint(O, recolor(EIGHT, inbox(toindices(obj))))` recolors the 'inbox' of the object (cells one step inwards from the boundary) to '8' and paints it onto the output grid.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve_e73095fd(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  outer_boundary = mapply(delta, objs)
  inner_boundary = mapply(inbox, mapply(toindices, objs))
  O = fill(I, SEVEN, outer_boundary)
  O = underfill(O, EIGHT, inner_boundary)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects within the input grid.
2. **Calculate Boundaries:** 
   - `outer_boundary = mapply(delta, objs)` computes the outer boundary of each object and merges them.
   - `inner_boundary = mapply(inbox, mapply(toindices, objs))` computes the inner boundary of each object and merges them.
3. **Apply Colors:**
   - `O = fill(I, SEVEN, outer_boundary)` fills the outer boundary cells with '7'.
   - `O = underfill(O, EIGHT, inner_boundary)` fills the inner boundary cells with '8', only if they were originally background.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve_e73095fd(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = fill(O, SEVEN, difference(dneighbors(centerofmass(obj)), obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** `O = I` sets the output grid 'O' as a copy of the input grid 'I'.
2. **Iterate and Modify:** The code iterates through each object 'obj' found in the input grid. For each object:
    - `centerofmass(obj)`: Calculates the center of mass of the object.
    - `dneighbors(...)`: Finds the directly neighboring cells to the center of mass.
    - `difference(..., obj)`: Removes the cells that are part of the object itself, leaving only the boundary cells.
    - `fill(O, SEVEN, ...)`:  Fills the resulting boundary cells with the value '7' in the output grid 'O'.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve_e73095fd(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = paint(O, obj)
    O = paint(O, recolor(SEVEN, delta(obj)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(EIGHT, difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), obj))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** `O = canvas(bg, shape(I))` creates a blank canvas 'O' of the same size as the input 'I' filled with the background color. 
2. **Iterate Through Objects:** The code then iterates through each object 'obj' identified in the input grid.
3. **Paint Original Object:**  `O = paint(O, obj)` paints the original object onto the canvas.
4. **Color Outer Boundary:** `O = paint(O, recolor(SEVEN, delta(obj)))` recolors the outer boundary of the object to '7' and paints it onto the canvas.
5. **Color Inner Boundary:** `O = paint(O, recolor(EIGHT, difference(inbox(toindices(obj)), obj)))` recolors the inner boundary of the object to '8', ensuring it doesn't overwrite the original object cells, and paints it onto the canvas. 

These five versions offer diverse approaches to achieve the desired grid transformation. Each version leverages different combinations of DSL functions, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided programming language.
