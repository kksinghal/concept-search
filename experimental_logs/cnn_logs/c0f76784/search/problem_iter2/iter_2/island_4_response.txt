## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces specific digit occurrences within objects based on their relative position:

* **Target Digit:** The digit '7' is consistently targeted for replacement within objects.
* **Replacement Digit:** The replacement digit varies based on context:
    * **'8' Replacement:**  If the '7' is not at the center of an object, it's replaced by '8'.
    * **'6' Replacement:** If the '7' is at the center of an object, it's replaced by '6'.

**Illustrative Examples:**

* **Input_0:** The large '7' object has its central '7' replaced by '6', while the surrounding '7's are replaced by '8'. The small '2' objects remain unchanged.
* **Input_1, Input_2:**  Follow the same pattern, with central '7's becoming '6' and others becoming '8'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1 (Using `center` and conditional `recolor`)**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  transformed_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 7:
      center_index = center(obj)
      obj = frozenset(
          (8 if index in delta(frozenset({center_index})) else 6, index) 
          for _, index in obj
      )
    transformed_objs = transformed_objs.union(frozenset({obj}))
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(transformed_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Identifies objects in the input grid using `objects`.
2. **Iterate and Transform:** Iterates over each object:
   - **Color Check:** If the object's color is '7':
     - **Center Identification:**  Finds the center index of the object using `center`.
     - **Conditional Recoloring:**  Recolors the object. '8' is used for cells not at the center (`delta` is used to exclude the center), and '6' is used for the center cell.
3. **Paint Transformed Objects:** Paints the transformed objects onto a blank canvas of the same shape as the input grid.

**Version 2 (Using `ulcorner`, `shape` and nested loops for direct replacement)**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 7:
      start_i, start_j = ulcorner(obj)
      height, width = shape(obj)
      for i in range(height):
        for j in range(width):
          if (i, j) == (height // 2, width // 2):
            O = fill(O, 6, frozenset({(start_i + i, start_j + j)}))
          else:
            O = fill(O, 8, frozenset({(start_i + i, start_j + j)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Identifies objects in the input grid using `objects`.
2. **Iterate and Transform:** Iterates over each object:
   - **Color Check:** If the object's color is '7':
     - **Corner and Dimensions:** Gets the upper-left corner and dimensions of the object using `ulcorner` and `shape`.
     - **Nested Loop Replacement:**  Iterates through the object's bounding box:
        - **Center Check:** Replaces with '6' if the current cell is the center.
        - **Non-Center Replacement:** Replaces with '8' otherwise.

**Version 3 (Leveraging `asobject`, `apply` and `paint`)**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def transform_cell(cell, center_index):
    return (8, cell[1]) if cell[1] != center_index else (6, cell[1])

  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 7:
      center_index = center(obj)
      O = paint(O, frozenset(transform_cell(cell, center_index) for cell in asobject(subgrid(obj, I))))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `transform_cell`:**  Creates a helper function to apply the conditional color replacement at the cell level.
2. **Identify Objects:**  Identifies objects in the input grid using `objects`.
3. **Iterate and Transform:** Iterates over each object:
   - **Color Check:** If the object's color is '7':
      - **Get Center:**  Gets the center index of the object using `center`.
      - **Apply Transformation:** Uses `asobject` to iterate over the object's cells and applies `transform_cell` to each cell, painting the result back onto the grid.

**Version 4 (Using `index`, `asobject` and list comprehension)**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 7:
        obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: (i, j) in toindices(o))
        O = fill(O, 8 if (i, j) != center(obj) else 6, frozenset({(i, j)}))
      else:
        O = fill(O, val, frozenset({(i, j)}))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
2. **Check for '7':** If the cell value is '7':
   - **Find Object:** Finds the object containing the current cell.
   - **Center Check:**  Determines if the current cell is the object's center.
   - **Conditional Fill:** Fills the corresponding cell in the output grid with '8' (non-center) or '6' (center).
3. **Preserve Other Values:** If the cell value is not '7', it's directly copied to the output grid.


**Version 5 (Combining `objects`, `center` and list comprehension)**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    O = [[0 for _ in range(len(I[0]))] for _ in range(len(I))]
    for obj in objs:
        if color(obj) == 7:
            c = center(obj)
            for i, j in toindices(obj):
                O[i][j] = 6 if (i, j) == c else 8
        else:
            for v, (i, j) in obj:
                O[i][j] = v
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Identifies objects in the input grid using `objects`.
2. **Initialize Output:** Creates an empty grid `O` with the same dimensions as the input grid `I`.
3. **Iterate and Transform:** Iterates over each object:
   - **Color Check:** If the object's color is '7':
      - **Get Center:**  Gets the center index of the object using `center`.
      - **Fill with 8 or 6:** Fills the corresponding cell in the output grid `O` with '6' if it's the center, otherwise with '8'. 
   - **Preserve Other Colors:** If the object's color is not '7', it fills the corresponding cells in `O` with the original values from the object. 
4. **Return as Tuple:** Returns the output grid `O` as a tuple of tuples.
