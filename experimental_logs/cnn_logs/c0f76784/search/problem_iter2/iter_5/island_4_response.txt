## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on manipulating objects with colors "7" and "2" within the input grid.

**General Pattern:**

* **Color 7 Objects:**  All objects with color "7" are being recolored to "8". 
* **Color 2 Objects:** Specific objects with color "2" (single-cell objects fully surrounded by "5") are being recolored to "7".
* **Background:** The background color remains unchanged.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The "7" object at the top is recolored to "8". The single "2" cell within the "5" structure is recolored to "7".
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, the "7" objects are recolored to "8". The single "2" cell within the "5" structure is recolored to "7".
* **Input_2:**  Again, the "7" objects are recolored to "8".  The two "2" cells within the "5" structure are recolored to "7".


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract all objects
  recolor_7_to_8 = apply(rbind(recolor, 8), colorfilter(objs, 7))  # Recolor 7 to 8
  # Find single "2" objects surrounded by "5"
  recolor_2_to_7 = frozenset(recolor(7, obj) for obj in objs if color(obj) == 2 and size(obj) == 1 and all(index(I, n) == 5 for n in dneighbors(first(toindices(obj)))) )
  # Combine the recolored objects and paint on a blank canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(recolor_7_to_8, recolor_2_to_7))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify all distinct objects in the input grid.
2. **Recolor 7 to 8:**  Find all objects with color "7" and recolor them to "8".
3. **Recolor 2 to 7 (Conditional):** Locate single-cell objects of color "2" that are fully enclosed by cells with color "5" and recolor them to "7".
4. **Combine and Paint:** Merge the recolored objects and paint them onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  # Use a lambda function for recoloring 7 to 8
  recolor_7_to_8 = lambda obj: recolor(8, obj) if color(obj) == 7 else frozenset() 
  recolor_2_to_7 = lambda obj: recolor(7, obj) if color(obj) == 2 and size(obj) == 1 and all(index(I, n) == 5 for n in dneighbors(first(toindices(obj)))) else frozenset()
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(mapply(recolor_7_to_8, objs), mapply(recolor_2_to_7, objs)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Lambda Functions:** Utilize lambda functions for both recoloring operations, making the code more concise.
3. **Map and Merge:** Apply the lambda functions to each object and merge the results for painting.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Use nested list comprehensions for a different approach
  O = tuple(
      tuple(
          8 if I[i][j] == 7 else (
              7 if I[i][j] == 2 and all(I[i + di][j + dj] == 5 for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)])
              else I[i][j]
          )
          for j in range(len(I[0]))
      )
      for i in range(len(I))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Nested Comprehensions:**  This version iterates through each cell of the grid using nested list comprehensions, applying the recoloring logic directly.
2. **Conditional Recoloring:**  Recolors "7" to "8" directly. For "2", it checks if it's surrounded by "5" before recoloring to "7".

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  sevens = ofcolor(I, 7)  # Get indices of '7'
  twos_surrounded_by_fives = frozenset((i, j) for i in range(1, len(I) - 1) for j in range(1, len(I[0]) - 1) if I[i][j] == 2 and all(I[i + di][j + dj] == 5 for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]))
  O = paint(fill(canvas(0, shape(I)), 8, sevens), recolor(7, twos_surrounded_by_fives))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Cells:** Directly obtain indices of cells with "7" and those with "2" surrounded by "5".
2. **Fill and Paint:** Fill a blank canvas with "8" at the locations of "7" and then paint "7" at the locations of the surrounded "2"s.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  recolored = frozenset(
      recolor(8, obj) if color(obj) == 7 else 
      (recolor(7, obj) if color(obj) == 2 and size(obj) == 1 and all(index(I, n) == 5 for n in dneighbors(first(toindices(obj)))) 
       else obj)
       for obj in objs
  )
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(recolored))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Conditional Recoloring (Inline):**  Uses a single loop over the objects and applies conditional recoloring inline for both "7" and "2".

These five versions demonstrate diverse ways to achieve the desired transformation using the DSL, employing different combinations of functions and logic.
