## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently applies the following rules:

1. **Smallest Object Recoloring:**  The smallest object in the grid is always recolored to '6'.
2. **Second Largest Object Conditional Recoloring:**  The second largest object in the grid is recolored to '8', but *only* if it contains the color '7'.

**Input 0:**

* The single cell with '7' is the smallest object and recolored to '6'.
* The larger connected '7' object is the second largest and recolored to '8' due to containing '7'.

**Input 1:**

* The single cell with '7' is the smallest object and recolored to '6'.
* The larger connected '7' object is the second largest and recolored to '8' due to containing '7'.

**Input 2:**

* The two connected '2' objects are the smallest and recolored to '6'.
* The larger connected '7' object is the second largest and recolored to '8' due to containing '7'.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects, excluding background
  sizes = apply(size, objs)  # Get the size of each object
  smallest_obj = argmin(objs, size)  # Find the smallest object
  sorted_objs = order(objs, size) #Order the objects by their sizes
  second_largest_obj = sorted_objs[-2] # Pick the second largest object
  
  for obj in objs:
    if obj == smallest_obj:
      I = paint(I, recolor(SIX, toindices(obj)))  # Recolor smallest to 6
    elif obj == second_largest_obj and SEVEN in palette(obj):
      I = paint(I, recolor(EIGHT, toindices(obj))) # Recolor second largest to 8 if it contains 7
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Identify all distinct objects within the input grid.
2. **Find Smallest:** Determine the object with the fewest cells.
3. **Find Second Largest:**  Identify the object with the second highest cell count.
4. **Conditional Recoloring:**  Recolor the second largest object to '8' only if it contains the color '7'.
5. **Recolor Smallest:** Recolor the smallest object to '6'.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  sorted_objs = order(objs, size)
  smallest_obj = first(sorted_objs)
  second_largest_obj = sorted_objs[1] if size(sorted_objs) > 1 else None 

  I = paint(I, recolor(SIX, merge(apply(toindices, sizefilter(objs, size(smallest_obj))))))
  if second_largest_obj is not None and SEVEN in palette(second_largest_obj):
    I = paint(I, recolor(EIGHT, toindices(second_largest_obj)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract & Sort:**  Identify objects and sort them by size.
2. **Retrieve Objects:**  Get the smallest and second largest objects directly from the sorted list.
3. **Recolor Smallest:** Recolor all objects with the same size as the smallest one to '6'.
4. **Conditional Recoloring:** Apply the recoloring rule for the second largest object.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  size_objs = apply(lambda obj: (size(obj), obj), objs)
  smallest_size, smallest_obj = argmin(size_objs, lambda x: x[0]) 
  filtered_objs = sfilter(size_objs, lambda x: x[0] != smallest_size)
  second_largest_size, second_largest_obj = argmax(filtered_objs, lambda x: x[0]) if filtered_objs else (None, None)

  I = paint(I, recolor(SIX, toindices(smallest_obj)))
  if second_largest_obj is not None and SEVEN in palette(second_largest_obj):
    I = paint(I, recolor(EIGHT, toindices(second_largest_obj)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Pair Sizes:** Create tuples pairing each object with its size.
2. **Find Objects by Size:** Directly find the smallest and second largest objects and their sizes using `argmin` and `argmax` on the paired tuples.
3. **Recolor Based on Conditions:** Apply the recoloring rules based on the found objects.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  sorted_sizes = order(apply(size, objs), lambda x: x)
  smallest_size = first(sorted_sizes)
  second_largest_size = sorted_sizes[1] if size(sorted_sizes) > 1 else None

  I = paint(I, recolor(SIX, merge(apply(toindices, sizefilter(objs, smallest_size)))))
  if second_largest_size is not None:
    second_largest_obj = extract(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) == second_largest_size)
    if SEVEN in palette(second_largest_obj):
      I = paint(I, recolor(EIGHT, toindices(second_largest_obj)))
  return I 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Sort Sizes:** Obtain and sort a list of object sizes.
2. **Get Target Sizes:**  Get the smallest size and the second largest size from the sorted list.
3. **Find Objects by Size:** Find the objects corresponding to the target sizes.
4. **Recolor with Conditions:** Apply the recoloring rules based on the found objects and sizes.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  smallest_obj = argmin(objs, size)
  I = paint(I, recolor(SIX, merge(apply(toindices, sizefilter(objs, size(smallest_obj))))))
  
  remaining_objs = difference(objs, {smallest_obj}) 
  if remaining_objs:
    second_largest_obj = argmax(remaining_objs, size)
    if SEVEN in palette(second_largest_obj):
      I = paint(I, recolor(EIGHT, toindices(second_largest_obj)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find and Recolor Smallest:** Identify and recolor the smallest object to '6'.
2. **Remove Smallest:**  Create a new set of objects excluding the smallest.
3. **Find Second Largest and Recolor:** Within the remaining objects, find the largest and apply the conditional recoloring rule.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to solving the problem, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
