## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to all input grids involves three steps:

1. **Recolor Target:** Identify the color that's not the background color (7) and has the same count as the background color. Replace this color with 8.
2. **Recolor Smallest:** Find the smallest object in the grid and recolor it to 6.
3. **Switch Colors:** Swap the colors 2 and 7 in the grid.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = extract(palette(I), lambda v: v != SEVEN and colorcount(I, v) == colorcount(I, SEVEN))
  I = replace(I, target_color, EIGHT)
  smallest_obj = argmin(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(toindices(obj))) 
  I = paint(I, recolor(SIX, toindices(smallest_obj))) 
  return switch(I, TWO, SEVEN)  
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Recolor Target:** We use `extract` to find the target color based on the conditions and then `replace` it with 8.
2. **Find and Recolor Smallest:**  `objects` function with `T, F, T` parameters identifies all univalued, non-diagonally connected objects without considering background. `argmin` finds the smallest of these objects based on their size. Then, we use `paint` and `recolor` to recolor the smallest object to 6.
3. **Swap Colors:** Finally, `switch` is used to swap colors 2 and 7.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for v in palette(I):
    if v != SEVEN and colorcount(I, v) == colorcount(I, SEVEN):
      I = replace(I, v, EIGHT)
  smallest_obj = argmin(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj))
  return paint(switch(I, TWO, SEVEN), recolor(SIX, toindices(smallest_obj)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Recolor Target:** This version iterates through each color in the palette using a `for` loop and applies the recoloring logic using `replace` if the conditions are met.
2. **Find and Recolor Smallest:** Similar to Version 1, it finds the smallest object. However, it recolors the object after swapping colors 2 and 7. 
3. **Swap Colors:** This version uses `switch` before painting the smallest object.


**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_color = next((v for v in palette(I) if v != SEVEN and colorcount(I, v) == colorcount(I, SEVEN)), None)
  if target_color:
    I = replace(I, target_color, EIGHT)
  smallest_obj = min(objects(I, T, F, T), key=lambda obj: len(obj))
  return paint(I, recolor(SIX, toindices(smallest_obj))).transform(lambda v: {TWO:SEVEN, SEVEN:TWO}.get(v, v))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find and Recolor Target:** This version uses a generator expression with `next` to find the target color, providing `None` as a default if no color is found.
2. **Find and Recolor Smallest:** This version uses the `min` function with a `key` to find the smallest object based on the number of cells it occupies.
3. **Swap Colors:** It uses a lambda function with a dictionary lookup within `transform` for a more concise color swapping.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  I = apply(lambda row: tuple(EIGHT if cell != SEVEN and colorcount(I, cell) == colorcount(I, SEVEN) else cell for cell in row), I)
  smallest_obj = min(objects(I, T, F, T), key=size)
  I = paint(I, recolor(SIX, toindices(smallest_obj)))
  return tuple(tuple({TWO:SEVEN, SEVEN:TWO}.get(cell, cell) for cell in row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Recolor Target (Cell-wise):** This version uses nested loops with `apply` to iterate over each cell in the grid and applies the recoloring logic directly to each cell.
2. **Find and Recolor Smallest:** It finds the smallest object similarly to Version 3.
3. **Swap Colors (Cell-wise):** Similar to Version 3, it uses a dictionary lookup for color swapping, but applies it cell-wise.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  filtered_colors = sfilter(palette(I), lambda v: v != SEVEN and colorcount(I, v) == colorcount(I, SEVEN))
  if filtered_colors:
    I = replace(I, first(filtered_colors), EIGHT)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  I = paint(I, recolor(SIX, toindices(argmin(objs, lambda obj: len(toindices(obj))))))
  return tuple(tuple(SEVEN if cell == TWO else (TWO if cell == SEVEN else cell) for cell in row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Filter and Recolor Target:** This version uses `sfilter` to filter the palette for colors matching the condition and then uses `first` to pick the first match for replacement with 8.
2. **Find and Recolor Smallest:** It finds the smallest object similarly to previous versions but uses a more verbose lambda function within `argmin`.
3. **Swap Colors (Conditional Expression):** This version uses a nested conditional expression within a generator expression for color swapping.

These are just a few examples, and many other valid solutions might exist. The key is to break down the transformation into smaller steps and leverage the provided DSL functions effectively to achieve the desired outcome.
