## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation replaces specific digits within objects based on their shape and relative position. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- The transformation targets the object formed by digit '7'. 
- It replaces the '7's with '8's.
- The '7' in the smaller object remains unchanged.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- The transformation targets the object formed by digit '7'.
- It replaces the '7's with '8's.
- The '7' in the smaller object remains unchanged.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

- The transformation targets the objects formed by digits '7' and '2'.
- It swaps the digits in these objects, changing '7' to '8' and '2' to '7'. 


## Code Generation:

It seems that the provided Program_A and Program_B are not relevant to this specific transformation. They focus on manipulating objects based on the presence of specific colors and their bounding boxes. 

We need a program that identifies objects, analyzes their shape, and conditionally replaces digits. Unfortunately, without the two unprovided programs you mentioned, I can only offer a hypothetical solution using the given DSL. 

**Hypothetical Program (assuming unprovided programs dealt with object shape and replacement):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # 1. Identify objects (Potentially using 'objects' function from Program_B)
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  

    # 2.  Apply transformation to each object
    transformed_objs = frozenset()
    for obj in objs:
        # 3. Check object shape (Assuming 'is_rectangle' function from unprovided programs)
        if is_rectangle(obj): 
            # 4. Replace '7' with '8' (Assuming 'replace_color' function from unprovided programs)
            obj = replace_color(obj, 7, 8)
        # 5. Add transformed object to the set
        transformed_objs = transformed_objs.union(frozenset({obj}))

    # 6. Paint the transformed objects back onto the grid
    O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(transformed_objs))
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  This step likely uses the `objects` function (from Program_B) to identify individual objects in the input grid.
2. **Iterate & Transform:** The code iterates through each identified object for individual transformation.
3. **Check Shape:**  This step utilizes a hypothetical `is_rectangle` function (potentially from the unprovided programs) to determine if an object is rectangular.
4. **Replace Digits:** Another hypothetical function, `replace_color`, is used to replace the target digit ('7') with the desired digit ('8') within the identified rectangular object. 
5. **Combine Objects:** The transformed objects are collected in a new set.
6. **Paint Objects:** Finally, the transformed objects are painted onto a blank canvas (created using `canvas`) with the same dimensions as the input, effectively recreating the output grid.

**Please Note:** This program is hypothetical and relies on the existence of functions (`is_rectangle`, `replace_color`) that were presumably present in the unprovided programs. Without the actual code from those programs, it's impossible to offer a concrete and accurate solution. 

To get a precise solution, please provide the missing programs that were used as inspiration. I can then leverage their functionality to craft a working `Program_to_be_generated` using the DSL.
