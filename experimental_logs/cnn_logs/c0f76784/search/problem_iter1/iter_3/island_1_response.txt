## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to follow these rules:

1. **Recolor Objects:** Objects are recolored based on their size:
    * Objects with a size of 4 are recolored to 7.
    * Objects with a size greater than 4 are recolored to 8.

2. **Mark Squares:** For each object with a size greater than 4:
    * If the object is a square, the cell to the right of its upper-left corner is recolored to 6.

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* Two objects with size greater than 4 are recolored to 8.
* One of these objects is a square, so the cell to the right of its upper-left corner is recolored to 6.
* One object of size 4 is recolored to 7.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* Two objects with size greater than 4 are recolored to 8.
* One of these objects is a square, so the cell to the right of its upper-left corner is recolored to 6.
* One object of size 4 is recolored to 7.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* Two objects with size greater than 4 are recolored to 8.
* None of these objects are squares, so no additional recoloring to 6 happens.
* One object of size 4 is recolored to 7.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if size(obj) == 4:
      O = paint(O, recolor(7, obj))
    elif size(obj) > 4:
      O = paint(O, recolor(8, obj))
      if square(obj):
        corner = ulcorner(obj)
        O = fill(O, 6, {(corner[0], corner[1] + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects in the input grid `I` using `objects(I, T, F, F)`.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:** Iterate through each object (`obj`) in the identified objects:
    * If the `size(obj)` is 4, recolor the object to 7 using `recolor(7, obj)` and paint it onto the output grid `O` using `paint(O, recolor(7, obj))`.
    * If the `size(obj)` is greater than 4, recolor the object to 8 using `recolor(8, obj)` and paint it onto the output grid `O` using `paint(O, recolor(8, obj))`.
    * Within the `size(obj) > 4` condition, check if the object is a square using `square(obj)`. If it is, get the upper-left corner index using `ulcorner(obj)` and fill the cell to the right of the corner with color 6 using `fill(O, 6, {(corner[0], corner[1] + 1)})`.
3. **Return Output:** Return the modified output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    O = branch(
        size(obj) == 4,
        paint(O, recolor(7, obj)),  # True branch: recolor to 7
        branch(
            size(obj) > 4,
            paint(fill(O, 6, {(ulcorner(obj)[0], ulcorner(obj)[1] + 1)}) if square(obj) else O, recolor(8, obj)),  # True branch: recolor to 8 and potentially fill a cell with 6
            O  # False branch: do nothing
        )
    )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** Iterate through each identified object (`obj`) in the input grid `I` using `objects(I, T, F, F)`.

2. **Nested Branching:** For each object, use nested `branch` statements to decide the action based on its size:
    * **Outer Branch:**
        * **Condition:** `size(obj) == 4`
        * **True Branch:** Recolor the object to 7 and paint it onto the output grid: `paint(O, recolor(7, obj))`
        * **False Branch:** Move to the inner branch.
    * **Inner Branch:**
        * **Condition:** `size(obj) > 4`
        * **True Branch:** Recolor the object to 8 using `recolor(8, obj)`. Additionally, if the object is a square (`square(obj)`), fill the cell to the right of its upper-left corner with color 6 using `fill(O, 6, {(ulcorner(obj)[0], ulcorner(obj)[1] + 1)})`. Then paint the potentially modified grid onto the output grid using `paint()`.
        * **False Branch:** Do nothing and keep the output grid as is.

3. **Return Output:** Return the transformed output grid `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  small_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) == 4)
  large_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) > 4)
  O = paint(I, recolor(7, merge(small_objs)))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, merge(large_objs)))
  for obj in large_objs:
    if square(obj):
      corner = ulcorner(obj)
      O = fill(O, 6, {(corner[0], corner[1] + 1)}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Filter Objects:**
    * Identify all objects with size 4 and store them in `small_objs` using `mfilter` and a lambda function.
    * Identify all objects with size greater than 4 and store them in `large_objs` using `mfilter` and a lambda function.

2. **Recolor and Paint:**
    * Recolor all `small_objs` to 7 using `recolor` and `merge` and paint them onto the input grid `I` to create the initial output grid `O`.
    * Recolor all `large_objs` to 8 using `recolor` and `merge` and paint them onto the output grid `O`.

3. **Mark Squares:**
    * Iterate through each object in `large_objs`.
    * If the object is a square (`square(obj)`), get the upper-left corner using `ulcorner(obj)` and fill the cell to its right with color 6 using `fill`.

4. **Return Output:** Return the final output grid `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = branch(size(obj) == 4, paint(O, recolor(7, obj)), O)
    O = branch(size(obj) > 4, paint(O, recolor(8, obj)), O)
    if size(obj) > 4 and square(obj):
      O = fill(O, 6, {(ulcorner(obj)[0], ulcorner(obj)[1] + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify all objects in the input grid `I` using `objects(I, T, F, F)`.
2. **Iterate and Modify:** Iterate through each object (`obj`) in the identified objects and apply the following modifications to the output grid `O`:
    * Use a `branch` statement to recolor objects of size 4 to 7.
    * Use another `branch` statement to recolor objects larger than 4 to 8.
    * If an object is larger than 4 and a square, fill the cell to the right of its upper-left corner with color 6.
3. **Return Output:** Return the modified output grid `O`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  large_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) > 4)
  O = fill(I, 7, mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) == 4)) 
  for obj in large_objs:
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, obj))
    if square(obj):
      i, j = ulcorner(obj)
      O = fill(O, 6, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Filter Large Objects:** Identify and store objects larger than 4 in `large_objs`.
2. **Recolor Small Objects:** Recolor all objects of size 4 to 7 directly within the `fill` function, creating the initial output grid `O`.
3. **Process Large Objects:** Iterate through each object in `large_objs`:
    * Recolor the object to 8 and paint it onto the output grid.
    * If the object is a square, fill the cell to the right of its upper-left corner with color 6.
4. **Return Output:** Return the final output grid `O`.
