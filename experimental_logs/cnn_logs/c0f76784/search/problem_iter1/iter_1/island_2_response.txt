## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying objects (clusters of connected cells with the same value) within the grid and then modifying the cells bordering these objects. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The program identifies objects made of '5'.
* For each object, it colors the directly adjacent cells with '8' (inner border).
* Additionally, it colors the cells one step further out with '7' (outer border), but only if they were originally '0'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* Same logic as with Input_0, but the object shapes are different. 
* This highlights that the transformation is not specific to a particular object shape but rather a general rule applied to all objects in the grid.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* Again, the same logic applies. 
* This reinforces the idea that the transformation is consistent across different grid configurations.

## Code Generation:

Based on the analysis, we can propose several programs leveraging the DSL functions. The goal is to improve upon the provided Program_A and Program_B.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 1):**

```python
def solve_e73095fd(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects, excluding background
    outer = mapply(lambda obj: difference(outbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj)), objs) # Find outer border
    inner = mapply(lambda obj: difference(dneighbors(centerofmass(obj)), toindices(obj)), objs)  # Find inner border
    O = fill(I, SEVEN, outer)  # Fill outer border with 7
    O = fill(O, EIGHT, inner)  # Fill inner border with 8
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`**:  We first extract all objects from the input grid (`I`), excluding the background color.
2. **`outer = ...`**:  For each object, we calculate the outer border by finding the difference between its 'outbox' and its actual indices.
3. **`inner = ...`**:  Similarly, we find the inner border using 'dneighbors' of the object's center of mass, excluding the object itself.
4. **`O = fill(I, SEVEN, outer)`**:  We fill the outer border cells with '7'.
5. **`O = fill(O, EIGHT, inner)`**:  Finally, we fill the inner border cells with '8'.


**Program_to_be_generated (Version 2):**

```python
def solve_e73095fd(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  border_indices = mapply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), objs)
  inner_border = mapply(lambda obj: intersection(border_indices, dneighbors(centerofmass(obj))), objs)
  outer_border = difference(border_indices, inner_border)
  O = fill(I, SEVEN, outer_border)
  O = fill(O, EIGHT, inner_border)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Extract objects, excluding the background.
2. **`border_indices = ...`**:  Calculate indices bordering all objects using `delta`.
3. **`inner_border = ...`**: Determine the inner border by intersecting `border_indices` with direct neighbors of the object's center of mass.
4. **`outer_border = ...`**:  Find the outer border by taking the difference between `border_indices` and `inner_border`.
5. **`O = ...`**: Fill outer and inner borders with '7' and '8' respectively.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 3):**

```python
def solve_e73095fd(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  border = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(dneighbors(centerofmass(obj)), lambda ind: index(I, ind) != color(obj)), objs)
  outer = mapply(lambda obj: difference(outbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj)), objs)
  O = underfill(I, EIGHT, border)
  O = underfill(O, SEVEN, outer)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Extract objects excluding the background.
2. **`border = ...`**:  Identify direct neighbors of an object's center of mass that have a different color than the object itself. This determines the inner border.
3. **`outer = ...`**: Calculate the outer border as in previous versions.
4. **`O = underfill(...)`**:  Use `underfill` to paint '8' on the inner border and then '7' on the outer border, ensuring we only paint over the background color. 

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 4):**

```python
def solve_e73095fd(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  inner = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(dneighbors(centerofmass(obj)), lambda ind: index(I, ind) != color(obj)), objs)
  outer = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(outbox(toindices(obj)), lambda ind: index(I, ind) == mostcolor(I)), objs)
  O = fill(I, EIGHT, inner)
  O = fill(O, SEVEN, outer)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Extract objects excluding the background.
2. **`inner = ...`**: Same inner border calculation as in Version 3.
3. **`outer = ...`**:  Find outer border cells by filtering the object's outbox, keeping only indices where the grid color matches the background color. 
4. **`O = fill(...)`**: Fill inner and outer borders with '8' and '7' respectively.

**Program_to_be_generated (Version 5):**

```python
def solve_e73095fd(I):
    objs = fgpartition(I)  # partition grid without background
    inner = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(dneighbors(centerofmass(obj)), lambda ind: not contained(ind, toindices(obj))), objs)
    outer = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(outbox(toindices(obj)), lambda ind: index(I, ind) == mostcolor(I)), objs)
    O = fill(I, EIGHT, inner)
    O = fill(O, SEVEN, outer)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = fgpartition(I)`**:  Partition the grid into objects, this time directly excluding the background using `fgpartition`.
2. **`inner = ...`**: Calculate the inner border by filtering direct neighbors of the object's center of mass, keeping only indices not part of the object itself.
3. **`outer = ...`**:  Same outer border calculation as in Version 4.
4. **`O = fill(...)`**: Fill the inner and outer borders with '8' and '7', respectively. 

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches and logic within the DSL to achieve the desired transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided functions.
