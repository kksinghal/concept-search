## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation revolves around identifying objects of a specific color (5 in this case) and then modifying the colors of the cells within and around these objects.

**Input 0:**

- The transformation targets the two distinct '5' colored objects. 
- For each object, a border of color '8' is added around its perimeter.
- The cells directly within the perimeter (forming an "inner rectangle") are recolored to '7'.

**Input 1:**

-  Similar to Input 0, the transformation focuses on '5' colored objects.
-  Again, an '8' colored border is added.
-  The change is in the recoloring of the "inner rectangle". Here, only the top two rows of this inner rectangle are recolored to '7', while the remaining cells retain their original color (5).

**Input 2:**

- The pattern remains consistent. '5' colored objects are targeted.
- An '8' colored border is added.
- In this case, only the center two rows of the "inner rectangle" are recolored to '7'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  target_color = 5
  filtered_objs = colorfilter(objs, target_color)
  
  O = I
  for obj in filtered_objs:
    O = fill(O, 8, delta(obj))
    if size(obj) > 6:  
      O = fill(O, 7, difference(backdrop(obj), delta(obj)))
    else:
      inner_rect = crop(O, add(ulcorner(obj),(1,1)), subtract(shape(obj), (2,2)))
      inner_rect = fill(inner_rect, 7, ((0,0),(0,1))) if portrait(obj) else fill(inner_rect, 7, ((0,0),(1,0))) 
      O = paint(cover(O,obj),shift(asobject(inner_rect),add(ulcorner(obj),(1,1))))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:**  Similar to the provided programs, we first extract all objects from the input grid `I` and filter them based on the target color (5).
2. **Border Creation:**  We add a border of color '8' around each object using the `delta` function.
3. **Conditional Inner Rectangle Recoloring:**
   - **Large Objects:** If the object size is greater than 6 (indicating the larger objects in Input 0 and the bottom object in Input 1), we recolor the entire "inner rectangle" to '7'.
   - **Small Objects:**  For smaller objects (those in Input 2 and the top object in Input 1), we first crop the `inner_rect` from the output grid `O`. Depending on whether the object is taller than it is wide (portrait) or wider than it is tall, we fill the top two rows or the left two columns with '7', respectively. Finally, we paint this modified `inner_rect` back onto the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  target_color = 5
  filtered_objs = colorfilter(objs, target_color)

  O = I
  for obj in filtered_objs:
    O = fill(O, 8, delta(obj))
    if height(obj) > 4:
      O = fill(O, 7, inbox(obj))
    elif height(obj) == 3:
      O = fill(O, 7, shift(inbox(obj), (1, 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification and Bordering:**  Identical to version 1, we extract objects of color '5' and add an '8' border.
2. **Height-Based Recoloring:** 
   -  The `height` function is used to determine the object's height.
   -  If the height is greater than 4 (as in Input 0 and the lower object of Input 1), the entire `inbox` (the area within the '8' border) is filled with '7'.
   -  If the height is 3 (as in Input 2 and the upper object of Input 1), we shift the `inbox` one row downwards and then fill it with '7', effectively recoloring only the center two rows.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 5:
      O = fill(O, 8, delta(obj))
      if height(obj) > width(obj):
        O = fill(O, 7, crop(O, add(ulcorner(obj),(1,1)), (height(obj)-2, width(obj)-2)))
      else:
        center_row = height(obj) // 2
        O = fill(O, 7, crop(O, (uppermost(obj) + center_row, leftmost(obj) + 1), (2, width(obj) - 2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Processing and Bordering:** We iterate through all objects, add the '8' border if the object's color is '5'.
2. **Shape-Based Recoloring:**
   - **Tall Objects:** For objects taller than their width (`height(obj) > width(obj)`), we crop the inner area (excluding the border) and fill it with '7'.
   - **Wide Objects:** For objects wider than or equal to their height, we calculate the `center_row`. We then crop a 2-row high area centered on the `center_row` and fill it with '7'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 5:
      O = fill(O, 8, delta(obj))
      inner_indices = toindices(difference(backdrop(obj), delta(obj)))
      for i, j in inner_indices:
        if height(obj) > 6 or (height(obj) == 4 and i == uppermost(obj) + 1) or (height(obj) == 3 and i == uppermost(obj) + height(obj) // 2):
          O = fill(O, 7, ((i, j),))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Iteration and Bordering:** Similar to the previous versions, we iterate through objects, adding the '8' border to '5' colored ones.
2. **Cell-by-Cell Recoloring:**
    - We obtain the indices of the "inner rectangle" using `toindices` and `difference`.
    - For each cell within this area, we check the following conditions:
        - If the object's height is greater than 6, we recolor the cell to '7'.
        - If the object's height is 4 and the cell is in the second row, we recolor it.
        - If the object's height is 3 and the cell is in the middle row, we recolor it.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = replace(I, 5, 8) 
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 8:
      if height(obj) > 6:
        O = underfill(O, 7, obj)
      else:
        inner_rect = crop(O, add(ulcorner(obj),(1,1)), subtract(shape(obj), (2,2)))
        inner_rect = fill(inner_rect, 7, ((0,0),(0,1))) if portrait(obj) else fill(inner_rect, 7, ((0,0),(1,0))) 
        O = paint(O,shift(asobject(inner_rect),add(ulcorner(obj),(1,1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initial Recoloring:** Unlike other versions, we begin by replacing all occurrences of color '5' with '8' directly in the input grid `I` using `replace` function, effectively handling the border creation upfront.
2. **Conditional Inner Recoloring:** We then iterate through the objects, now identifying them by color '8'. 
    - **Large Objects:** If the object's height is greater than 6, we use `underfill` to fill the object's area with '7', only affecting cells that were originally '5' (and are now '8'). 
    - **Small Objects:** For smaller objects, we follow a logic similar to version 1, cropping the inner area, recoloring the top two rows or left two columns (depending on the object's shape), and then painting it back onto the output grid. 

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches using various DSL functions and logic to achieve the required transformation across all provided input-output pairs. Each version offers a different way of thinking about the problem and utilizes the DSL's capabilities effectively.
