## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify objects of different sizes and apply different modifications to them:

- **Large Objects:** Objects with both height and width greater than 2.
    - The cells surrounding the object (its "delta") are filled with the value 8.
    - The center cell of the object is filled with the value 6.
- **Medium Objects:** Objects with either height or width equal to 2 (but not both dimensions greater than 2).
    - All cells of the object are filled with the value 7.
- **Small Objects:** Objects with both height and width less than 2 are left unchanged.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  large_objects = sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: min(shape(o)) > 2)
  medium_objects = sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda o: min(shape(o)) == 2)
  I = fill(I, EIGHT, merge(apply(delta, large_objects)))
  I = fill(I, SIX, merge(apply(lambda o: frozenset({center(o)}), large_objects)))
  I = fill(I, SEVEN, merge(medium_objects))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We identify all objects in the input grid `I` using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Filter by Size:** We use `sfilter` and `lambda` functions to separate large and medium objects based on their minimum dimension using `shape(o)`.
3. **Modify Large Objects:**
    -  We apply the `delta` function to each large object to get the surrounding cells.
    -  We merge the delta cells from all large objects using `merge`.
    -  We fill these cells with the value 8 using `fill`.
    -  We find the center of each large object using `center(o)` and convert it to a frozenset for hashing.
    -  We merge the center cells and fill them with the value 6.
4. **Modify Medium Objects:**
    - We merge all medium objects using `merge`.
    - We fill these cells with the value 7.
5. **Return:** The modified grid `I` is returned.

This version leverages the existing functions effectively to achieve the transformation. It improves upon the failed attempts by correctly handling the merging of modified cells and ensuring hashable types for `fill` function.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modify_object(obj):
    return branch(min(shape(obj)) > 2,
                  fill(fill(I, EIGHT, delta(obj)), SIX, frozenset({center(obj)})),
                  branch(min(shape(obj)) == 2,
                        fill(I, SEVEN, obj),
                        I))
  return mapply(modify_object, objects(I, T, F, T))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `modify_object` Function:** This function takes an object as input and applies the modifications based on its size.
2. **Apply Modifications:**
    -  We use `branch` statements to differentiate between large, medium, and small objects.
    -  For large objects, we first fill the delta with 8 and then the center with 6 using nested `fill` calls.
    -  For medium objects, we fill the object cells with 7.
    -  Small objects are left untouched, returning the original grid `I`.
3. **Apply to All Objects:**  We use `mapply` to apply the `modify_object` function to all objects identified by `objects(I, T, F, T)`.

This version uses a functional approach with nested `branch` statements to handle different object sizes. It avoids explicit merging by directly modifying the grid within the `modify_object` function. 

## Program Version 3: 

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modify_large(obj):
    return fill(fill(I, EIGHT, delta(obj)), SIX, frozenset({center(obj)}))

  def modify_medium(obj):
    return fill(I, SEVEN, obj)

  return mapply(lambda o: branch(min(shape(o)) > 2, 
                                  modify_large(o),
                                  branch(min(shape(o)) == 2, 
                                        modify_medium(o), 
                                        I)), 
               objects(I, T, F, T))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Modification Functions:** Separate functions `modify_large` and `modify_medium` are defined to handle modifications for respective object sizes.
2. **Apply Modifications Based on Size:**
    - We use a `lambda` function within `mapply` to determine object size and apply appropriate modification function.
    -  `modify_large` fills delta with 8 and center with 6.
    -  `modify_medium` fills the object with 7.
    -  Small objects are handled by returning the original grid `I`.
3. **Apply to All Objects:** `mapply` applies the logic to all objects found in the grid.

This version improves readability by defining separate functions for each modification type. It also streamlines the conditional logic within the `mapply` call.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)

  def apply_mods(obj):
      if min(shape(obj)) < 2:
          return I
      elif min(shape(obj)) > 2:
          return fill(fill(I, EIGHT, delta(obj)), SIX, frozenset({center(obj)}))
      else:
          return fill(I, SEVEN, obj)

  return mapply(apply_mods, objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** All objects are identified using `objects` and stored in `objs`.
2. **Define `apply_mods` Function:** This function takes an object as input and applies modifications based on its size using an `if-elif-else` block.
3. **Apply Modifications:** 
    -  Large objects have their delta filled with 8 and center filled with 6.
    -  Medium objects are filled with 7.
    -  Small objects return the original grid `I`.
4. **Apply to All Objects:** `mapply` applies the `apply_mods` function to each object in `objs`.

This version focuses on readability by using a clear `if-elif-else` structure within the `apply_mods` function. It efficiently handles different object sizes and modifications.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def apply_modification(obj):
    s = min(shape(obj))
    return branch(s > 2,
                  fill(fill(I, EIGHT, delta(obj)), SIX, frozenset({center(obj)})),
                  branch(s == 2,
                        fill(I, SEVEN, obj),
                        I))
  return mapply(apply_modification, objects(I, T, F, T))

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `apply_modification` Function:** This function determines the minimum dimension of the object (`s`) and branches accordingly.
2. **Apply Modifications:**
    -  `s > 2`: Fills the delta with 8 and center with 6 for large objects.
    -  `s == 2`: Fills the object with 7 for medium objects.
    -  Otherwise: Returns the original grid `I` for small objects.
3. **Apply to All Objects:** `mapply` applies the `apply_modification` function to all identified objects in the grid.

This version prioritizes conciseness by calculating the minimum dimension (`s`) only once and using it in the subsequent `branch` statements. It efficiently applies the appropriate modifications based on object size.
