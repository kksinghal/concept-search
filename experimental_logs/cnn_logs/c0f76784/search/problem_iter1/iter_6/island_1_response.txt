## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring and marking objects based on their size and shape. 

* **Objects with size 4:** These objects are recolored to 7.
* **Objects with size greater than 4:** These objects are recolored to 8.
* **Square objects with size greater than 4:** An additional cell within these objects, diagonally adjacent to the upper-left corner, is recolored to 6. 

This logic applies consistently across all three input-output pairs.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = paint(I, recolor(7, merge(apply(toindices, sizefilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 4)))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, merge(apply(toindices, mfilter(objects(O, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) > 4)))))
  for obj in mfilter(objects(O, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) > 4 and square(obj)):
    i, j = ulcorner(obj)
    O = fill(O, 6, {(i + 1, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Recolor size 4 objects:** 
    - `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all connected objects in the input grid `I`.
    - `sizefilter(objects(...), 4)` filters for objects with size 4.
    - `apply(toindices, ...)` extracts the indices of these objects.
    - `merge(...)` combines all indices into a single set.
    - `recolor(7, ...)` recolors these indices to 7.
    - `paint(I, ...)` applies the recoloring to the input grid `I`, creating a new grid `O`.
2. **Recolor objects larger than size 4:**
    - The process is similar to step 1, but it filters for objects with `size(obj) > 4` and recolors them to 8. 
3. **Mark square objects:**
    - `mfilter(objects(O, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) > 4 and square(obj))` finds square objects larger than size 4 in the updated grid `O`.
    - For each such object:
        - `ulcorner(obj)` gets the upper-left corner index (i, j).
        - `fill(O, 6, {(i + 1, j + 1)})` fills the cell diagonally adjacent to the corner with color 6.

This code directly implements the transformation logic described earlier.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  small_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) == 4)
  large_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) > 4)
  O = paint(I, recolor(7, merge(apply(toindices, small_objs))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, merge(apply(toindices, large_objs))))
  for i, j in merge(apply(lambda obj: {(ulcorner(obj)[0] + 1, ulcorner(obj)[1] + 1)}, large_objs)):
    O = fill(O, 6, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify small and large objects:**
   - `small_objs` and `large_objs` are created by filtering objects based on size, similar to Version 1.
2. **Recolor objects:**
   - The recoloring logic for small and large objects is identical to Version 1.
3. **Mark square objects:**
   - This version directly calculates the indices to be marked within the loop:
     - `merge(apply(lambda obj: {(ulcorner(obj)[0] + 1, ulcorner(obj)[1] + 1)}, large_objs))` extracts the diagonal indices for all large objects.
     - It then iterates through these indices and fills them with color 6.

This version is similar to Version 1 but streamlines the marking of square objects by directly calculating the target indices.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if size(obj) == 4:
      O = paint(O, recolor(7, toindices(obj)))
    elif size(obj) > 4:
      O = paint(O, recolor(8, toindices(obj)))
      if square(obj):
        i, j = ulcorner(obj)
        O = fill(O, 6, {(i + 1, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through all objects:**
   - This version iterates through each object identified by `objects(I, T, F, F)`.
2. **Conditional recoloring and marking:**
   - Inside the loop, it applies the recoloring and marking logic based on object size and shape:
     - If `size(obj) == 4`, it recolors the object to 7.
     - If `size(obj) > 4`, it recolors the object to 8 and checks if it's a square. If it is, it marks the appropriate cell with color 6.

This version is more concise by directly handling the different object types within a single loop. 

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for s in [4, 5]:
    for obj in mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) == s if s == 4 else size(obj) >= s):
      O = paint(O, recolor(7 if s == 4 else 8, toindices(obj)))
      if s != 4 and square(obj):
        i, j = ulcorner(obj)
        O = fill(O, 6, {(i + 1, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is structurally similar to Version 3 but uses a loop to handle the different size thresholds (4 and 5) for recoloring. The logic within the loop remains consistent with the overall transformation requirements.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
    small_indices = merge(apply(toindices, sizefilter(objs, 4)))
    large_indices = merge(apply(toindices, mfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) > 4)))
    O = fill(I, 7, small_indices)
    O = fill(O, 8, large_indices)
    for obj in mfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) > 4 and square(obj)):
      i, j = ulcorner(obj)
      O = fill(O, 6, {(i + 1, j + 1)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version separates the recoloring and marking steps more explicitly:

1. **Identify objects and indices:**
    - `objs` stores all identified objects.
    - `small_indices` and `large_indices` are created by first filtering objects based on size and then extracting and merging their indices. 
2. **Recolor using `fill`:**
    - `fill(I, 7, small_indices)` and `fill(O, 8, large_indices)` directly recolor the grid based on the pre-calculated indices.
3. **Mark square objects:**
    - This step remains similar to previous versions, iterating through square objects larger than size 4 and marking the appropriate cell. 

This version showcases a different approach by pre-calculating the indices for recoloring and then using the `fill` function for a more direct modification of the grid.
