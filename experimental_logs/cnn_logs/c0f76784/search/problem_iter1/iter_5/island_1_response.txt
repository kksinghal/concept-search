## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all three examples follows a common pattern:

1. **Identify Objects:** The input grids consist of objects formed by connected cells with the same digit. 
2. **Categorize by Size:** These objects are categorized into two groups based on their size (number of cells):
    - Small objects:  Objects with a specific size (4 cells in these examples).
    - Large objects:  Objects larger than the specified size.
3. **Recolor:** The objects are recolored based on their size category:
    - Small objects are recolored to one specific digit (7 in these examples).
    - Large objects are recolored to another specific digit (8 in these examples).
4. **Mark Square Objects:** An additional transformation is applied to large objects that are square-shaped:
    - The cell diagonally adjacent to the upper-left corner of the square is filled with a distinct digit (6 in these examples).

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    small_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) == 4)
    large_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) > 4)
    O = paint(I, recolor(7, merge(apply(toindices, small_objs)))) 
    O = paint(O, recolor(8, merge(apply(toindices, large_objs))))
    for obj in large_objs:
        if square(obj):
            i, j = ulcorner(obj)
            O = fill(O, 6, {(i + 1, j + 1)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and categorize objects** based on size using `objects`, `mfilter`, and `size`.
2. **Recolor** small and large objects to 7 and 8 respectively using `paint`, `recolor`, `merge`, `apply`, and `toindices`.
3. **Mark squares:** Iterate through large objects, check for square shape using `square`, and fill the specific cell using `fill` and `ulcorner`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for threshold, color in [(4, 7), (5, 8)]:
    for obj in mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) == threshold if threshold != 5 else size(obj) >= threshold):
      O = paint(O, recolor(color, toindices(obj)))
      if color == 8 and square(obj):
        i, j = ulcorner(obj)
        O = fill(O, 6, {(i + 1, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through size thresholds and colors:** Uses a loop to handle both small and large object recoloring.
2. **Filter and recolor:** Filters objects based on size using `mfilter` and recolors them using `paint` and `recolor`.
3. **Mark squares:** Similar to Version 1, but within the loop for efficiency.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  small_indices = merge(apply(toindices, mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) == 4)))
  large_indices = merge(apply(toindices, mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) > 4)))
  O = fill(I, 7, small_indices)
  O = fill(O, 8, large_indices)
  for obj in mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) > 4 and square(obj)):
    i, j = ulcorner(obj)
    O = fill(O, 6, {(i + 1, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Pre-compute indices:** First, calculates indices of small and large objects separately using `merge`, `apply`, and `toindices`.
2. **Fill colors:** Directly fills colors at calculated indices using `fill`.
3. **Mark squares:** Similar to previous versions.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    color = 7 if size(obj) == 4 else 8 
    O = paint(O, recolor(color, obj))
    if color == 8 and square(obj):
      i, j = ulcorner(obj)
      O = fill(O, 6, {(i + 1, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Identifies all objects using `objects`.
2. **Iterate and recolor:** Iterates through each object, determines its color based on size, and recolors using `paint` and `recolor`.
3. **Mark squares:** Similar to previous versions.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = paint(I, recolor(7, merge(apply(toindices, sizefilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 4)))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, merge(apply(toindices, mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) > 4)))))
  for obj in mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) > 4 and square(obj)):
    corner = ulcorner(obj)
    O = fill(O, 6, {(corner[0] + 1, corner[1] + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Directly recolor:** Uses nested functions to identify, filter by size, and recolor small and large objects in a single line each.
2. **Mark squares:** Similar to previous versions.

These five programs demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility of the DSL. Each version leverages different function combinations and logic flow, showcasing various ways to manipulate the grid and objects within it.
