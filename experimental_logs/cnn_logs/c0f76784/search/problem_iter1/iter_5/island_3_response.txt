## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit excluding the background color '0') and applying the following changes:

- **Inbox Filling:** The area within the bounding box of each object, excluding the object itself, is filled with the digit '8'.
- **Conditional Corner Marking:** If the object's height is greater than 2, the cell one unit down and one unit right from the object's upper-left corner is replaced with the digit '6'. 
- **Vertical Edge Highlighting:** The two vertical edges of each object's bounding box (excluding the top and bottom rows) are highlighted with the digit '7'.

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 & Output_0:**

- The '5' objects are identified.
- Their bounding boxes are filled with '8' internally.
- Since the height of each object is greater than 2, a '6' is placed within each.
- The vertical edges of the bounding boxes are highlighted with '7'.

**Input_1 & Output_1:**

- Similar to Input_0, the same logic is applied to both '5' objects.

**Input_2 & Output_2:**

- The logic applies consistently to the horizontal '5' object.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" along with their explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = fill(O, EIGHT, inbox(toindices(obj))) # Fill the inbox with '8'
    if height(obj) > 2:
      corner = add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1)) # Calculate the corner position for '6'
      O = paint(O, recolor(SIX, {corner}))
    left_edge = connect(add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 0)), add(llcorner(obj), (-1, 0)))
    right_edge = connect(add(urcorner(obj), (1, 0)), add(lrcorner(obj), (-1, 0)))
    O = paint(O, recolor(SEVEN, left_edge | right_edge)) # Highlight vertical edges with '7'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:** Loops through each object in the input grid.
2. **Inbox Filling:** Fills the inbox of the object with '8'.
3. **Conditional Corner Marking:** If the object height is greater than 2, calculates the position one unit down and one unit right from the object's upper-left corner and places '6' there.
4. **Vertical Edge Calculation:** Calculates the indices for the left and right vertical edges of the object's bounding box.
5. **Vertical Edge Highlighting:** Highlights the calculated edges with '7'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = fill(I, EIGHT, mapply(inbox, objects(I, T, F, T))) # Fill all inboxes with '8' first
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if height(obj) > 2:
      O = paint(O, recolor(SIX, {(add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1)))})) # Place '6'
    for (i, j) in toindices(obj):
      if i != uppermost(obj) and i != lowermost(obj):
        O = paint(O, recolor(SEVEN, {(i, leftmost(obj)), (i, rightmost(obj))})) # Highlight edges
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initial Inbox Filling:** Fills all object inboxes with '8' in a single operation.
2. **Iterate and Mark Corners:** Iterates through objects and places '6' if the height condition is met.
3. **Iterate and Highlight Edges:** Iterates through each cell of an object and highlights the vertical edges with '7', excluding the top and bottom rows.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = paint(O, recolor(EIGHT, difference(backdrop(obj), toindices(obj)))) # '8' in backdrop excluding object
    if height(obj) > 2:
      O = paint(O, recolor(SIX, {add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1))})) # Place '6'
    O = paint(O, recolor(SEVEN, difference(box(obj), {(uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)), (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj))}))) # Highlight vertical edges with '7'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Backdrop Filling:** Utilizes the `backdrop` function to efficiently fill the area around the object with '8'.
2. **Conditional Corner Marking:**  Same as previous versions.
3. **Edge Highlighting with Difference:** Uses `box` and `difference` functions to calculate and highlight the vertical edges, excluding the corner points. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  inboxes = mapply(inbox, objs)
  edges = mapply(lambda obj: difference(box(obj), {(uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)), (lowermost(obj), rightmost(obj))}), objs)
  corners = mapply(lambda obj: {add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1))} if height(obj) > 2 else {}, objs)
  O = fill(I, EIGHT, inboxes)
  O = paint(O, recolor(SEVEN, edges))
  O = paint(O, recolor(SIX, corners))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Pre-calculate Transformations:** Calculates all inboxes, edges, and corners for all objects in advance.
2. **Apply Transformations:** Applies the pre-calculated transformations to the grid efficiently.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = underfill(O, EIGHT, backdrop(obj)) # Fill background within backdrop with '8'
    if height(obj) > 2:
      O = paint(O, recolor(SIX, {add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1))})) # Place '6'
    for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj)):
      for i in range(uppermost(obj) + 1, lowermost(obj)):
        if (i, j) not in toindices(obj):
          O = paint(O, recolor(SEVEN, {(i, j)})) # Highlight if not part of the object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Underfill for Inbox:**  Uses `underfill` to efficiently fill the inbox with '8' by targeting background cells within the backdrop.
2. **Conditional Corner Marking:**  Same as previous versions.
3. **Iterative Edge Highlighting:** Iterates within the bounding box and highlights cells that are not part of the object with '7'.

These five versions offer a diverse set of solutions using different function combinations and logic flow within the provided DSL.
