## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying objects within the grid and then modifying the cells surrounding those objects based on their shape and position. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The program identifies the horizontal lines of 5s.
* For each line, it replaces the cells directly above and below the line with 8s. 
* Additionally, it replaces the cells one cell above and below the center of the line with 7s. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:** 

*  Similar to Input_0, but this time it targets vertical lines of 5s.
*  The cells directly left and right of the lines are replaced with 7s.
*  The cells left and right of the center cell of each line are replaced with 8s.
*  Additionally, one specific cell within the object is changed to 6 (likely based on some positional logic).

**Input_2 to Output_2:** 

* Here, both horizontal and vertical lines of 5s are targeted.
*  Similar to previous examples, cells directly above/below horizontal lines and left/right of vertical lines are replaced with 8s. 
*  Center-adjacent cells are replaced with 7s for both types of lines. 

## Program Generation:

Since the actual programs you want to improve upon are not provided, I will present five distinct program versions based on the provided Program_A and Program_B and the transformation analysis.  These programs aim to solve the problem but may require further refinement based on your complete codebase.

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_e73095fd(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    indices = toindices(obj)
    if hline(obj):
      O = fill(I, EIGHT, difference(dneighbors(centerofmass(obj)), indices))
      O = fill(O, SEVEN, difference(dneighbors(center(indices)), indices))
    if vline(obj):
      O = fill(I, SEVEN, difference(dneighbors(centerofmass(obj)), indices))
      O = fill(O, EIGHT, difference(dneighbors(center(indices)), indices))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Identifies objects in the input grid (excluding background).
2. **Iterate and Check:** Iterates through each object, checking if it's a horizontal or vertical line.
3. **Apply Transformation:**
    * **Horizontal Line:** Fills cells above and below with 8s and cells above/below the center with 7s.
    * **Vertical Line:**  Fills cells left and right with 7s and cells left/right of the center with 8s.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_e73095fd(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    outer = mapply(lambda obj: difference(dneighbors(centerofmass(obj)), toindices(obj)) if hline(obj) or vline(obj) else {}, objs)
    inner = mapply(lambda obj: difference(dneighbors(center(toindices(obj))), toindices(obj)) if hline(obj) or vline(obj) else {}, objs)
    O = fill(I, EIGHT, outer)
    O = fill(O, SEVEN, inner)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Identifies objects, excluding the background.
2. **Calculate Outer & Inner:**  
    *  `outer`:  For each line object, it finds the directly neighboring cells that aren't part of the object itself. 
    *  `inner`:  Similar to `outer`, but it targets cells adjacent to the line's center.
3. **Apply Fill:** Fills the 'outer' cells with 8 and 'inner' cells with 7.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_e73095fd(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if hline(obj) or vline(obj):
      for i, j in difference(dneighbors(centerofmass(obj)), toindices(obj)):
        if 0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0]):
          O = fill(O, EIGHT, {(i, j)})
      for i, j in difference(dneighbors(center(toindices(obj))), toindices(obj)):
        if 0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0]):
          O = fill(O, SEVEN, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:**  Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate and Check:** Iterates through objects in the input grid, checking if they are horizontal or vertical lines.
3. **Apply Transformation:**  For each qualifying line object:
    *   **Outer Fill:**  Finds the direct neighbors of the object's center of mass that are not part of the object and fills them with 8s.
    *  **Inner Fill:**  Similarly, fills direct neighbors of the object's center with 7s.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_e73095fd(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  line_indices = mapply(lambda obj: toindices(obj) if hline(obj) or vline(obj) else {}, objs)
  outer = mfilter(lambda indices: difference(dneighbors(centerofmass(indices)), indices), line_indices)
  inner = mfilter(lambda indices: difference(dneighbors(center(indices)), indices), line_indices)
  O = fill(I, EIGHT, outer)
  O = fill(O, SEVEN, inner)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Identifies objects in the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Filter Line Indices:** Extracts the indices of all line objects.
3. **Calculate Outer & Inner:**  Applies `dneighbors` to compute outer and inner indices for filling.
4. **Apply Fill:** Fills the 'outer' cells with 8 and 'inner' cells with 7.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_e73095fd(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
        if hline(obj):
            O = fill(O, EIGHT, difference(shoot(centerofmass(obj), DOWN), toindices(obj)))
            O = fill(O, EIGHT, difference(shoot(centerofmass(obj), UP), toindices(obj)))
            O = fill(O, SEVEN, difference(shoot(center(toindices(obj)), DOWN), toindices(obj)))
            O = fill(O, SEVEN, difference(shoot(center(toindices(obj)), UP), toindices(obj)))
        if vline(obj):
            O = fill(O, SEVEN, difference(shoot(centerofmass(obj), RIGHT), toindices(obj)))
            O = fill(O, SEVEN, difference(shoot(centerofmass(obj), LEFT), toindices(obj)))
            O = fill(O, EIGHT, difference(shoot(center(toindices(obj)), RIGHT), toindices(obj)))
            O = fill(O, EIGHT, difference(shoot(center(toindices(obj)), LEFT), toindices(obj)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Creates a copy of the input grid (`O`) to store the modified output.
2. **Iterate and Check:**  Iterates through each object in the grid, excluding the background, and checks if it's a horizontal or vertical line.
3. **Apply Transformation:** For horizontal and vertical lines, it uses the `shoot` function (creating lines in specified directions) to identify the cells to be filled with 8s and 7s. This ensures that cells are filled beyond just the immediate neighbors. 

Remember to adapt and refine these programs based on your specific DSL and the full context of your codebase for optimal performance.
