## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects based on their size and shape, recoloring them with specific values, and adding a single cell of a distinct color within larger square objects.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Recolor Objects:** Objects with size 4 are recolored to 7, and objects with size greater than 4 are recolored to 8.
2. **Mark Square Objects:** Within each square object larger than size 4, the cell diagonally adjacent to the upper-left corner is filled with color 6.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

Same logic as Input_0 to Output_0.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

Same logic as Input_0 to Output_0.

## Program_to_be_generated:

### Program Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = paint(I, recolor(7, merge(apply(toindices, sizefilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 4)))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, merge(apply(toindices, mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) > 4)))))
  for obj in mfilter(objects(O, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) > 4 and square(obj)):
    i, j = ulcorner(obj)
    O = fill(O, 6, {(i + 1, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Recolor Small Objects:** Identify objects of size 4 and recolor them to 7.
2. **Recolor Large Objects:** Identify objects larger than size 4 and recolor them to 8.
3. **Mark Square Objects:**  Iterate over objects larger than size 4 and check if they are square. If so, fill the cell diagonally adjacent to the upper-left corner with color 6.

### Program Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  small_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) == 4)
  large_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) > 4)
  O = paint(I, recolor(7, merge(apply(toindices, small_objs))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, merge(apply(toindices, large_objs))))
  for obj in mfilter(large_objs, square):
    i, j = ulcorner(obj)
    O = fill(O, 6, {(i + 1, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Separate Objects by Size:**  First, identify and store objects of size 4 and objects larger than size 4 separately.
2. **Recolor Objects:** Recolor the identified small objects to 7 and large objects to 8.
3. **Mark Square Objects:** Similar to Version 1, iterate over the large objects and mark the appropriate cell in square objects.

### Program Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for s in [4, 5]:
    for obj in mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) == s if s == 4 else size(obj) >= s):
      O = paint(O, recolor(7 if s == 4 else 8, toindices(obj)))
      if s != 4 and square(obj):
        i, j = ulcorner(obj)
        O = fill(O, 6, {(i + 1, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Over Sizes:** Iterate over sizes 4 and 5 (representing objects of size 4 and larger).
2. **Recolor Objects:** For each size, recolor the objects accordingly (7 for size 4, 8 for larger).
3. **Mark Square Objects:** Within the size iteration, check for square objects larger than size 4 and mark the appropriate cell.

### Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  small_indices = merge(apply(lambda obj: toindices(obj) if size(obj) == 4 else frozenset(), objs))
  large_indices = merge(apply(lambda obj: toindices(obj) if size(obj) > 4 else frozenset(), objs))
  O = fill(I, 7, small_indices)
  O = fill(O, 8, large_indices)
  for obj in mfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) > 4 and square(obj)):
    i, j = ulcorner(obj)
    O = fill(O, 6, {(i + 1, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Indices:** First, extract indices belonging to objects of size 4 and indices belonging to larger objects.
2. **Recolor by Indices:**  Recolor the grid based on the extracted indices, filling with 7 for small object indices and 8 for large object indices.
3. **Mark Square Objects:**  Iterate over objects and mark the appropriate cell within square objects larger than size 4. 

### Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if size(obj) == 4:
      O = paint(O, recolor(7, obj))
    elif size(obj) > 4:
      O = paint(O, recolor(8, obj))
      if square(obj):
        i, j = ulcorner(obj)
        O = fill(O, 6, {(i + 1, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over Objects:** Iterate through all identified objects in the input grid.
2. **Conditional Recoloring:** Apply recoloring based on object size: 7 for size 4, 8 for larger.
3. **Mark Square Objects:** Within the object iteration, check for square objects larger than size 4 and mark the appropriate cell.
