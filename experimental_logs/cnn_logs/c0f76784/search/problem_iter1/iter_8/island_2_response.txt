## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the contours of objects formed by the digit '5' against a background of '0'. It identifies and modifies cells based on their position within these objects:

* **Inner Cells:**  Cells within the object that are completely surrounded by other '5' cells are replaced with '8'. 
* **Outer Contour:** Cells on the outer edge of the object, directly touching the background '0', are replaced with '7'.
* **Single Protrusions:** Cells that jut out from the object, connected to only one other '5' cell, are replaced with '6'.


## Program Version 1:

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  inner = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda c: sum(1 for n in dneighbors(c) if n in toindices(obj)) == 4), objs)
  outer = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda c: any(n not in toindices(obj) for n in dneighbors(c))), objs)
  single = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset(cell for cell in delta(toindices(obj)) if sum(1 for n in dneighbors(cell) if n in toindices(obj)) == 1), objs)
  return fill(fill(fill(I, 8, inner), 7, outer), 6, single)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Uses `objects(I, T, F, T)` to find objects formed by '5's (foreground) against a background of '0's.
2. **Inner Cells:** 
   - `mapply` iterates over each object.
   - `sfilter` keeps only those cell indices within an object (`toindices(obj)`)...
   - ... where all four direct neighbors (`dneighbors(c)`) are also part of the object. These are the "inner" cells, filled with '8'.
3. **Outer Contour:** 
   - Similar to the above, but `sfilter` keeps cells where at least one direct neighbor is *not* part of the object. These are the '7' cells.
4. **Single Protrusions:**
   - `mapply` and `sfilter` are used again.
   - `delta(toindices(obj))` gets the cells immediately surrounding the object.
   - The condition checks for cells in this surrounding area that have only one direct neighbor belonging to the object. These are the '6' cells.
5. **Fill the Grid:** The `fill` function is applied three times to modify the original grid (`I`) with the calculated indices for '8', '7', and '6' respectively.



## Program Version 2:

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  inner = mapply(lambda obj: intersection(toindices(obj), difference(asindices(I), mapply(dneighbors, delta(toindices(obj))))), objs)
  outer = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda c: len(intersection(dneighbors(c), toindices(obj))) < 4), objs)
  single = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(delta(toindices(obj)), lambda c: len(intersection(dneighbors(c), toindices(obj))) == 1), objs)
  return fill(fill(fill(I, 8, inner), 7, outer), 6, single)
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a slightly different approach to identify inner cells:

1. **Identify Objects:**  Same as Version 1.
2. **Inner Cells:**
   - `mapply` iterates over each object.
   - `delta(toindices(obj))` gets cells surrounding the object.
   - `mapply(dneighbors, ...)` gets neighbors of these surrounding cells.
   - `difference(asindices(I), ...)` removes these neighbors from all indices in the grid, essentially leaving only the inner cells.
   - `intersection(toindices(obj), ...)` ensures we only keep the inner cells that are part of the current object.
3. **Outer Contour:** 
   - `sfilter` keeps cells that have less than 4 neighbors belonging to the object, effectively identifying the outer edges.
4. **Single Protrusions:**
   - Similar to Version 1, but uses `intersection` and `len` for counting the connected neighbors.
5. **Fill the Grid:**  Same as Version 1.

**Note:** Versions 3, 4 and 5 will follow the same format, providing alternative implementations of the transformation logic using different DSL functions. I'll ensure they are distinct and not just minor variations.
