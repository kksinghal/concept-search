## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying connected components ("objects") within the input grid and then recoloring them based on their size and shape. 

* **Small Objects:** Objects with an area of 1 or forming a line (horizontal or vertical) retain their original color.
* **Medium Objects:** Objects with an area of 4 are recolored to 7.
* **Large Objects:** Objects with an area greater than 4 are recolored to 8.
* **Special Case:** If a large object is a square, the cell directly right of the top-left corner cell is recolored to 6.

**Example Breakdown (Input 0):**

* The top two 5-cell objects are large and get recolored to 8. The rightmost of these is a square, so its second cell becomes 6.
* The bottom two 5-cell objects are large and get recolored to 8.
* The two 3-cell objects are medium and get recolored to 7.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if size(obj) == 4:
      O = paint(O, recolor(7, obj))
    elif size(obj) > 4:
      O = paint(O, recolor(8, obj))
      if square(obj):
        corner = ulcorner(obj)
        O = fill(O, 6, (corner[0], corner[1] + 1))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all connected components in the grid `I`.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:**  The code iterates through each object:
   - **Medium Objects:** If `size(obj) == 4`, recolor the object to 7 using  `recolor(7, obj)` and paint it onto the output grid `O`.
   - **Large Objects:** If `size(obj) > 4`, recolor to 8 and paint. If the object is a square (`square(obj)`), find its upper-left corner (`ulcorner(obj)`) and recolor the cell to its right to 6.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  small_objs = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) == 1 or vline(obj) or hline(obj))
  medium_objs = sizefilter(objs, 4)
  large_objs = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: size(obj) > 4)
  O = I
  O = paint(O, recolor(7, merge(medium_objs)))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, merge(large_objs)))
  for obj in large_objs:
    if square(obj):
      corner = ulcorner(obj)
      O = fill(O, 6, (corner[0], corner[1] + 1))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Categorize Objects:** Identify all objects and categorize them into `small_objs`, `medium_objs`, and `large_objs` based on their size and shape.
2. **Recolor and Paint:** Recolor and paint medium and large objects onto the output grid `O`.
3. **Handle Square Objects:** Similar to Version 1, handle the special case of square objects within `large_objs`.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  large_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) > 4)
  O = fill(I, 7, mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) == 4))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, merge(large_objs)))
  for obj in large_objs:
    if square(obj):
      i, j = ulcorner(obj)
      O = fill(O, 6, (i, j + 1))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version combines some operations for conciseness:

1. **Identify Large Objects:** Directly identify `large_objs`.
2. **Recolor Medium Objects:** Find and recolor medium objects to 7 in a single line.
3. **Recolor and Paint Large Objects:** Similar to previous versions.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        s = size(obj)
        if s == 4:
            O = underpaint(O, recolor(7, obj))
        elif s > 4:
            O = underpaint(O, recolor(8, obj))
            if square(obj):
                c = ulcorner(obj)
                O = fill(O, 6, (c[0], c[1] + 1))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses `underpaint` instead of `paint` to avoid unnecessary painting over existing non-background cells.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  is_large = lambda obj: size(obj) > 4
  large_objs = mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), is_large)
  O = replace(I, 7, 4)  
  O = paint(O, recolor(7, mfilter(objects(O, T, F, F), lambda obj: size(obj) == 4)))
  O = paint(O, recolor(8, merge(large_objs)))
  for obj in large_objs:
    if square(obj):
      i, j = ulcorner(obj)
      O = fill(O, 6, (i, j + 1))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
This version recolors all existing 7s to 4s initially. Then, it identifies and recolors medium objects to 7. This ensures that any 7s in the final output originated from medium-sized objects and not from pre-existing 7s in the input.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation using the provided DSL. They showcase various function combinations and logic flow, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for solving spatial reasoning tasks.
