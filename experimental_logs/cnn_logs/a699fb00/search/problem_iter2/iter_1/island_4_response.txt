## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation shifts all instances of "1" in the input grid one position to the right, replacing the original "1" with a "2" and the value to the right of the "1" with a "0". If a "1" is on the rightmost edge of the grid, it is simply replaced by a "2" and no further changes are made. 

**Example Breakdown:**

Let's analyze Input_0 and Output_0:

**Input_0:**
```
1 0 1 5 1
0 0 1 0 1
0 0 1 0 1
0 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 0 1 
```

**Output_0:**
```
1 2 1 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 
0 1 2 1 0 
0 0 0 0 0 
```

1. **Top Row (1 0 1 5 1):**
   - The first "1" is shifted right, changing the sequence to "1 2 0 5 1". 
   - The second "1" is shifted right, changing the sequence to "1 2 1 0 0".
   - The last "1" is on the edge and simply replaced by a "2". 

2. **Other Rows:** This logic is applied consistently to each "1" in the remaining rows. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  shifted_right = mapply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), ones)
  O = fill(I, 2, ones)
  O = fill(O, 0, intersection(shifted_right, asindices(I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify "1"s:** `ones = ofcolor(I, 1)` locates all instances of "1" in the grid.
2. **Calculate Shifted Positions:** `shifted_right = mapply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), ones)` determines the target positions after shifting each "1" to the right.
3. **Replace "1"s with "2"s:**  `O = fill(I, 2, ones)` replaces all original "1"s with "2"s.
4. **Fill Shifted Positions with "0"s:** `O = fill(O, 0, intersection(shifted_right, asindices(I)))` replaces the values at the calculated shifted positions with "0"s, only if those positions are within the grid boundaries.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
    O = I
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if value == 1:
                O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})
                if j < len(row) - 1:
                    O = fill(O, 0, {(i, j + 1)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** The program iterates through each cell in the grid using nested loops.
2. **Check for "1":** If a cell contains a "1":
   - The original cell is replaced with a "2".
   - If the cell is not on the rightmost edge, the cell to its right is replaced with a "0".

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  ones = toindices(objects(I, True, False, False))
  shifted_right = mapply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), ones)
  O = fill(I, 2, ones)
  O = fill(O, 0, intersection(shifted_right, asindices(I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version is identical to Version 1, except it explicitly finds all objects in the grid using `objects(I, True, False, False)` and then extracts their indices. This might be slightly less efficient but highlights a different approach.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 1:
        O = paint(O, {(1, (i, j)), (2, (i, j + 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** `O = canvas(0, shape(I))` initializes an output grid filled with "0"s, having the same dimensions as the input.
2. **Iterate and Paint:** It iterates through the input grid, and for every "1", it paints a "1" at the current location and a "2" to its right on the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
    shifted = shift(recolor(2, ofcolor(I, 1)), (0, 1))
    O = paint(fill(I, 0, asindices(I)), shifted)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find and Recolor:** It identifies indices of "1"s (`ofcolor(I, 1)`), recolors them to "2"s (`recolor(2, ...)`), and shifts the resulting object one position to the right (`shift(..., (0, 1))`).
2. **Create Blank Canvas and Paint:** It creates a blank canvas filled with "0"s  (`fill(I, 0, asindices(I))`) and paints the shifted object onto it (`paint(..., shifted)`).

These five versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL. Each version utilizes various functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
