## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to isolate specific objects within the input grid and replace the surrounding digits with zeros. The specific objects targeted are those containing the digit '1', and the replacement digit is '2'. The relative positioning of the objects containing '1' is maintained.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The object formed by '1's maintains its shape and position.
* The '5' digit, not part of the object, is replaced by '0'.
* All other '0's remain unchanged.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* Same as above, the objects formed by '1's are preserved, and the surrounding digits are replaced by '0's.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

*  Again, the objects formed by '1's are preserved, and the surrounding digits are replaced by '0's. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find objects containing '1'
  objs = objects(I, False, False, False)
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, 1) 
  
  # Create a blank canvas
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) 
  
  # Paint the target objects onto the canvas
  for obj in target_objs:
    O = paint(O, recolor(2, obj))
  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify target objects:**  Find all connected components (objects) and filter for those containing the digit '1'.
2.  **Create a blank canvas:** Generate a grid filled with '0's, matching the input grid's dimensions.
3.  **Paint objects onto the canvas:**  Iterate through the target objects, recolor them to '2', and paint them onto the blank canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Replace all non-1 digits with 0
  O = replace(I, 5, 0)
  for digit in palette(I)-{1, 5, 0}:
    O = replace(O, digit, 0)
  
  # Replace 1s with 2s
  O = replace(O, 1, 2)
  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Replace non-target digits:** Replace all digits except '1' with '0'.
2. **Replace target digit:** Replace all remaining '1's with '2's.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Get indices of all '1's
  indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  
  # Create a blank canvas
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  
  # Fill the indices with '2'
  O = fill(O, 2, indices)
  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find target indices:** Locate all indices containing the digit '1'.
2. **Create blank canvas:** Similar to Version 1.
3. **Fill target indices:** Directly fill the target indices on the canvas with the digit '2'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    # Create a mask by replacing all digits except '1' with '0'
    mask = I
    for digit in palette(I) - {1}:
        mask = replace(mask, digit, 0)
    
    # Multiply the mask with the original grid (effectively keeping only the '1's)
    O = cellwise(I, mask, 0)
    
    # Replace the remaining '1's with '2's
    O = replace(O, 1, 2)
    
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a mask:** Generate a grid where only the positions of '1's are preserved, and all other digits are replaced with '0's.
2. **Apply the mask:**  Perform a cell-wise multiplication between the original grid and the mask. This retains the '1's and sets all other positions to '0'.
3. **Replace target digit:**  Similar to Version 2.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  # Find objects, recolor those containing 1 to 2, and paint on a blank canvas
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), 
              recolor(2, merge(
                        sfilter(objects(I, False, False, False), 
                                lambda obj: colorcount(obj, 1) > 0))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version compresses the logic into a single line for brevity.
2. It combines object identification, filtering, recoloring, and painting into a single statement. 


## Similarity:

Each version uses different DSL functions and logic to achieve the same result, showcasing diversity in solution approaches.
