## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to isolate and recolor specific patterns within the input grid, effectively "framing" them while clearing the surrounding area. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Pair 0:**

* **Input:** A "cross" shape formed by the digit '1' with '5' at its center.
* **Output:** The '5' is removed, and the '1's are "framed" with '2's, leaving the rest of the grid filled with '0's.

**Pair 1:**

* **Input:** Multiple scattered '1's with two '5's, one within a group of '1's and another isolated.
* **Output:**  The '5's are removed. Each group of '1's is individually "framed" with '2's, while the rest of the grid is filled with '0's.

**Pair 2:**

* **Input:** Similar to Pair 1 but with more scattered '1's and a '5' at the edge of a '1' cluster. 
* **Output:** Again, '5's are removed, and each cluster of '1's is "framed." The framing extends to include the position where the edge '5' was located.

**Transformation Logic:**

1. **Identify Clusters:** Locate connected groups of the digit '1'.
2. **Remove Markers:** Eliminate all instances of the digit '5'.
3. **Frame Clusters:**  Surround each identified cluster with a "frame" of '2's.
4. **Clear Background:** Fill all remaining cells in the grid with '0's.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" along with explanations:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # Identify connected objects
  no_five = replace(I, FIVE, ZERO) # Remove '5' markers
  framed = mapply(lambda o: fill(no_five, TWO, outbox(toindices(o))), colorfilter(objs, ONE)) # Frame '1' clusters
  O = merge(framed) if framed else no_five # Combine frames, default to no_five if no frames exist
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies connected components (clusters) of any digit.
2. **Remove '5's:** `replace(I, FIVE, ZERO)` replaces all '5's with '0's.
3. **Frame '1' Clusters:** 
   - `colorfilter(objs, ONE)` selects objects consisting of '1's.
   - `outbox(toindices(o))` finds the indices surrounding each '1' cluster.
   - `fill(no_five, TWO, ...)` fills these surrounding indices with '2's, creating the frame.
   - `mapply(...)` applies this framing to each '1' cluster.
4. **Merge and Return:** 
   - `merge(framed)` combines all the framed clusters.
   - The conditional ensures that if no '1' clusters exist, the grid with removed '5's (`no_five`) is returned.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  cleaned = replace(I, FIVE, ZERO) # Remove '5's
  ones = objects(cleaned, T, F, F) # Find '1' clusters
  expanded = mapply(lambda o: toindices(shift(toindices(o), (1, 1))) | toindices(shift(toindices(o), (-1, 1))) | toindices(shift(toindices(o), (1, -1))) | toindices(shift(toindices(o), (-1, -1))), ones) # Expand each cluster
  O = fill(cleaned, TWO, merge(expanded)) # Fill expanded areas with '2's
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Remove '5's:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Find '1' Clusters:** `objects(cleaned, T, F, F)` identifies clusters of '1's in the cleaned grid.
3. **Expand Clusters:**
   - For each cluster `o`:
     -  It gets shifted in all four diagonal directions.
     -  The indices of the shifted clusters are combined.
   - `mapply(...)` applies this expansion to each cluster.
4. **Fill Expanded Areas:**  `fill(cleaned, TWO, merge(expanded))` fills the expanded indices with '2's.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = replace(I, FIVE, ZERO) # Remove '5's
  for i in range(1, len(I) - 1):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == ONE or I[i+1][j] == ONE or I[i-1][j] == ONE or I[i][j+1] == ONE or I[i][j-1] == ONE:
        O = fill(O, TWO, {(i-1,j-1),(i-1,j),(i-1,j+1),(i,j-1),(i,j+1),(i+1,j-1),(i+1,j),(i+1,j+1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Remove '5's:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Iterate and Frame:**
   - It iterates through the grid (excluding borders).
   - If a cell or its neighbors are '1', it fills a 3x3 area centered at the current cell with '2's.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  no_fives = replace(I, FIVE, ZERO) # Remove '5's
  ones = objects(no_fives, T, F, F)  # Find clusters of '1's
  boxes = mapply(lambda o: box(toindices(o)), ones) # Find the bounding box of each cluster
  expanded_boxes = mapply(lambda b: b | set((i + di, j + dj) for i, j in b for di, dj in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]), boxes)  # Expand each box
  O = fill(no_fives, TWO, merge(expanded_boxes)) # Fill the expanded boxes with '2's
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Remove '5's:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Find '1' Clusters:** `objects(...)` identifies clusters of '1's.
3. **Create Bounding Boxes:**  `box(toindices(o))` finds the bounding box indices for each cluster.
4. **Expand Boxes:**  For each box, it adds indices one step outwards in all four directions.
5. **Fill Expanded Boxes:**  Similar to previous versions, it fills the expanded boxes with '2's.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = replace(I, FIVE, ZERO) # Remove '5's
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F): # Iterate over all connected objects
    if color(obj) == ONE: # Check if the object consists of '1's
      for (i, j) in toindices(obj):  # Iterate through the object's indices
        for di in range(-1, 2):  # Loop for neighbors in i-direction
          for dj in range(-1, 2): # Loop for neighbors in j-direction
            if 0 <= i + di < len(I) and 0 <= j + dj < len(I[0]): # Boundary check
              O = fill(O, TWO, {(i + di, j + dj)}) # Fill the neighbor cell with '2'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Remove '5's:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Iterate over Objects:**  It iterates through all connected objects in the grid.
3. **Filter '1' Clusters:** If an object consists of '1's (checked using `color(obj)`), it proceeds.
4. **Iterate and Fill Neighbors:** For each cell within a '1' cluster, it iterates over its 8 neighboring cells (including itself) and fills them with '2's, effectively creating the frame.

These five versions provide diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing different DSL function combinations and logic.
