## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify horizontal sequences of '1's in the input grid and replace them with a specific pattern in the output grid. The pattern consists of replacing the first '1' in the sequence with a '1', the second '1' with a '2', and the remaining '1's with '1's again. All other digits in the input grid are replaced with '0's in the output grid.

**Example:**

Input sequence:  `1 1 1 1`

Output sequence: `1 2 1 1` 


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))  # Initialize output grid with '0's
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if value == 1:
                if j > 0 and I[i][j - 1] == 1:  # Check if previous cell was a '1'
                    O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})
                else:
                    O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create an output grid `O` filled with '0's using `canvas(0, shape(I))`.
2. **Iteration:** Iterate through each cell `(i, j)` in the input grid `I`.
3. **Pattern Recognition:** 
   - If a cell contains '1', check if the previous cell in the same row `(i, j-1)` also contained a '1'.
   - If true, fill the current cell `(i, j)` in the output grid with '2'.
   - If false (meaning it's the beginning of a '1' sequence), fill the current cell `(i, j)` with '1'.
4. **Output:** Return the transformed grid `O`.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False) # Extract objects
  ones = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1) # Filter '1' objects
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Initialize output grid with '0's
  for obj in ones:
    indices = toindices(obj)
    for k, (i, j) in enumerate(sorted(indices, key=lambda x: x[1])): # Sort indices by column
      O = fill(O, 1 if k == 0 or k > 1 else 2, {(i, j)}) # Apply pattern
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** Extract objects from the input grid using `objects`.
2. **'1' Object Filtering:** Filter the extracted objects to keep only those consisting of '1's.
3. **Initialization:** Create an output grid `O` filled with '0's.
4. **Pattern Application:** Iterate through each '1' object:
    - Get the indices of the object.
    - Sort the indices by column to ensure correct pattern placement.
    - Iterate through the sorted indices and apply the 1-2-1-1... pattern using the index `k`.
5. **Output:** Return the transformed grid.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    start = -1
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 1 and start == -1:
        start = j
      elif value != 1 and start != -1:
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, start)})
        if j - start > 1:
          O = fill(O, 2, {(i, start + 1)})
          O = fill(O, 1, {(i, k) for k in range(start + 2, j)})
        elif j - start == 1:
          O = fill(O, 2, {(i, start + 1)})
        start = -1
    if start != -1:
      O = fill(O, 1, {(i, start)})
      if len(row) - start > 1:
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, start + 1)})
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, k) for k in range(start + 2, len(row))})
      elif len(row) - start == 1:
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, start + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This program iterates through rows, keeping track of '1' sequence start positions. Upon encountering a non-'1' or row end, it fills the output grid based on the sequence length, applying the 1-2-1-1... pattern accordingly.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j in range(len(row) - 1):
            if row[j] == 1 and row[j + 1] == 1:
                O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
                O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
                k = j + 2
                while k < len(row) and row[k] == 1:
                    O = fill(O, 1, {(i, k)})
                    k += 1
                break
            elif row[j] == 1:
                O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This program iterates through rows, looking for pairs of consecutive '1's. If found, it applies the pattern (1-2-1-1...) and breaks the inner loop to move to the next row. If a single '1' is found, it's directly copied to the output.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j in range(len(row) - 1):
            if row[j] == 1 and row[j+1] == 1:
                O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j+1)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

This program simplifies the approach by directly modifying the input grid. It iterates through each cell, and if it finds a '1' followed by another '1' in the same row, it replaces the second '1' with a '2'. This effectively applies the pattern without explicitly handling single '1's or sequences longer than two.
