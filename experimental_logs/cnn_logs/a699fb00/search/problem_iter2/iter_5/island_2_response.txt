## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all examples can be described as follows:

1. **Identify '1' objects:** The transformation focuses on groups of connected '1's in the input grid, treating each group as a distinct object.
2. **Create a surrounding border:** For each '1' object, the transformation identifies the immediately surrounding cells.
3. **Fill the border:**  These surrounding cells are then filled with the value '2', effectively creating a border around each '1' object.
4. **Clear the rest:** All other cells in the grid are set to '0'. 

**Key Observation:** The provided programs struggle with combining object detection with border filling. They either only recolor the '5's or fail to correctly identify and fill the surrounding cells.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL functions, along with explanations:


### Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # find all connected objects of 1s
  expanded = mapply(lambda o: delta(toindices(o)), objs) # expand each object by one layer
  O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, merge(expanded)) # fill the expanded layer with 2s
  return paint(O, toobject(merge(apply(toindices, objs)), I)) # paint the original objects back
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, F)`:**  Identifies all connected components of '1's in the input grid `I`. 
2. **`expanded = mapply(lambda o: delta(toindices(o)), objs)`:** For each object, it calculates the `delta`, which represents the surrounding cells. The `toindices` function is necessary to convert the object representation to indices. 
3. **`O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, merge(expanded))`:** Creates a canvas of the same size as the input, filled with '0's. It then fills the cells specified by the `expanded` indices (the surrounding border) with '2's.
4. **`return paint(O, toobject(merge(apply(toindices, objs)), I))`:**  Paints the original '1' objects back onto the canvas `O`. This ensures that the '1's are placed on top of the newly created '2' borders. 

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)  # Find all indices of '1's
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) # create a canvas of 0s with same shape as input
  for one in ones:
    O = fill(O, TWO, dneighbors(one)) # fill the neighbors with 2s
  return paint(O, toobject(ones, I)) # paint the original '1's back onto the canvas
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)`:**  Finds the indices of all cells containing '1' in the input grid.
2. **`O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`:**  Creates a blank canvas filled with '0's, having the same dimensions as the input grid.
3. **`for one in ones: ...`:**  Iterates over each index where a '1' is present.
4. **`O = fill(O, TWO, dneighbors(one))`:** For each '1', it fills its direct neighbors (dneighbors) on the canvas with '2'.
5. **`return paint(O, toobject(ones, I))`:** Paints the original '1's from their initial positions back onto the modified canvas.


### Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)  # Find all indices of '1's
  surrounding = mfilter(lambda loc: any(index(I, n) == ZERO for n in dneighbors(loc)), ones)
  O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, surrounding)
  return paint(O, toobject(ones, I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)`:**  Identifies the indices of all '1' cells in the grid.
2. **`surrounding = mfilter(lambda loc: any(index(I, n) == ZERO for n in dneighbors(loc)), ones)`:**  This line finds the "border" cells around the '1' objects. It iterates through each '1' cell and checks if any of its direct neighbors are '0'. If so, it includes that '1' cell's index in the `surrounding` set.
3. **`O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, surrounding)`:**  Creates a canvas of '0's with the same size as the input. It then fills the cells identified in the `surrounding` set with '2's, effectively drawing the border.
4. **`return paint(O, toobject(ones, I))`:** Overlays the original '1's back onto the canvas from their original positions in the input.


### Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # find objects made of 1s
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) # create a canvas of 0s
    for obj in objs:
        border = delta(toindices(obj)) # find border indices for each object
        O = fill(O, TWO, border)  # fill the border with 2s
    return paint(O,  toobject(merge(apply(toindices, objs)), I)) # paint the original objects back on top
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Detects all connected components of '1's and treats them as individual objects.
2. **`O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`:**  Creates a blank canvas of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with '0's.
3. **`for obj in objs: ...`:**  Iterates through each identified object of '1's.
4. **`border = delta(toindices(obj))`:** Calculates the `delta` for the object, which represents the surrounding cells.
5. **`O = fill(O, TWO, border)`:** Fills the cells represented by the `border` indices on the canvas with '2's, creating the border effect.
6. **`return paint(O, toobject(merge(apply(toindices, objs)), I))`:**  Finally, it paints the original '1's back onto the canvas `O` from their original positions. This ensures the '1's are placed over the '2' borders.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = replace(I, FIVE, ZERO)  # Replace '5's with '0's to avoid conflicts
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == ONE:  
        for di in [-1, 0, 1]: # loop through neighbor offsets
          for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj  # calculate neighbor indices
            if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] == ZERO: 
              O = fill(O, TWO, {(ni, nj)}) # fill if valid and empty in the original grid
  return O
```
**Explanation:**

1. **`O = replace(I, FIVE, ZERO)`:**  Start by replacing any '5's in the input grid with '0's. This is done to avoid potential conflicts later, assuming '5's are not relevant to the border creation.
2. **`for i in range(len(I)): ... for j in range(len(I[0])): ...`:**  Iterate over each cell in the input grid.
3. **`if I[i][j] == ONE: ...`:**  If a cell contains a '1', proceed to check its neighbors.
4. **`for di in [-1, 0, 1]: ... for dj in [-1, 0, 1]: ...`:**  This nested loop generates offsets to access the eight neighboring cells.
5. **`ni, nj = i + di, j + dj`:** Calculate the row and column indices of the neighbor.
6. **`if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] == ZERO: ...`:**  Check if the neighbor index is within the grid's bounds and if the neighbor cell is empty ('0') in the original input grid.
7. **`O = fill(O, TWO, {(ni, nj)})`:** If the conditions in the previous step are met, fill the corresponding cell on the output grid `O` with a '2'.

This version might be less efficient than those using `objects` and `delta`, but it showcases a different approach using direct neighbor checking.
