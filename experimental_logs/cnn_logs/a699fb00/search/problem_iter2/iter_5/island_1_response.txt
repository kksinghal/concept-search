## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to identify objects composed of the digit '1' and replaces the digit '5' adjacent (horizontally only) and to the right of these objects with the digit '2'.  The remaining '5' digits are replaced with '0'.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The '5' at (0,3) is to the right of a '1' object and is changed to '2'.  The '5' at (0,0) is not adjacent to a '1' object and is changed to '0'.
* **Input_1 & Input_2:** This pattern continues, highlighting the focus on '1' objects and their immediate right horizontal neighbors.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False) 
  to_replace = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 1:
      for _, (i, j) in obj:
        if j + 1 < width(I) and I[i][j+1] == 5:
          to_replace = to_replace.union(frozenset({(i, j+1)}))
  O = paint(replace(I, 5, 0), recolor(2, to_replace))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' objects:** `objects(I, True, False, False)` finds connected components of '1's.
2. **Find '5's to replace:**  Iterate through the objects, and if an object's color is '1', find its right neighbor with value '5' and mark its index for replacement.
3. **Replace and Paint:**  Replace all '5's with '0's using `replace(I, 5, 0)`. Paint the marked indices with '2' using `recolor(2, to_replace)`.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  fives = ofcolor(I, 5)
  to_replace = frozenset((i, j+1) for i,j in ones if (i, j+1) in fives)
  O = paint(replace(I, 5, 0), recolor(2, to_replace))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get indices of '1's and '5's:**  `ofcolor` retrieves indices of cells containing the specified value.
2. **Find '5's to replace:** Using set comprehension, identify indices of '5's that are right neighbors of '1's.
3. **Replace and Paint:** Similar to Version 1, replace all '5's with '0's and paint the marked indices with '2'.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    shifted_right = shift(asindices(I), (0,1))
    to_replace = frozenset(index for index in shifted_right if index[1] < width(I) and I[index[0]][index[1]] == 5 and (index[0], index[1]-1) in ofcolor(I, 1))
    O = paint(replace(I, 5, 0), recolor(2, to_replace))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift indices right:** `shift(asindices(I), (0,1))` shifts all grid indices one position to the right.
2. **Find '5's to replace:** Filter shifted indices to find those that are within grid bounds, contain '5', and have a left neighbor with '1'.
3. **Replace and Paint:** Similar to previous versions.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def check_neighbor(i, j):
    return j + 1 < width(I) and I[i][j+1] == 5
  
  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  to_replace = mfilter(ones_indices, rbind(check_neighbor, 1))
  O = paint(replace(I, 5, 0), recolor(2, to_replace))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define neighbor check:** `check_neighbor` function checks if a right neighbor exists and contains '5'.
2. **Filter '1' indices:** Apply `mfilter` with `check_neighbor` to find indices of '1's with a right '5' neighbor.
3. **Replace and Paint:**  Same as previous versions.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  to_replace = frozenset()
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 1 and j + 1 < len(row) and row[j+1] == 5:
        to_replace = to_replace.union(frozenset({(i, j+1)}))
  O = paint(replace(I, 5, 0), recolor(2, to_replace))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Find:** Manually iterate through each cell, if the cell is '1' and its right neighbor is '5', mark the neighbor's index.
2. **Replace and Paint:** Same as previous versions. 

All these versions achieve the desired transformation by identifying the relevant '5's based on their proximity to '1' objects and then performing the replacements. They illustrate different ways of achieving the same goal using the DSL functions.
