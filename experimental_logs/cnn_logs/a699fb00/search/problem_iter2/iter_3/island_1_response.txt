## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects with the color '1' and applies the following changes:

* **Background Removal:** All digits other than '1' and '5' are replaced with '0'.
* **Object Expansion:** Each '1' object expands horizontally, replacing adjacent '5's with '2's. 
* **'5' Removal:**  Finally, all remaining '5's are removed and replaced with '0's.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The single '1' object expands to include the adjacent '5', transforming it into a '2'. The remaining '5' is then removed.
* **Input_1:** The transformation is applied to three separate '1' objects, each expanding horizontally to consume adjacent '5's.
* **Input_2:**  Similar to previous examples, '1' objects expand horizontally, replacing adjacent '5's with '2's.  

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = objects(I, True, False, False)  # Identify connected '1' objects
  for o in obj:
    if color(o) == 1:  # Only process '1' objects
      right_neighbors = mfilter(dneighbors, rbind(contained, toindices(o)))  # Find right neighbors of each cell
      for n in right_neighbors:
        if index(I, n) == 5:  # Check if the neighbor is a '5'
          I = fill(I, 2, {n})  # Replace the '5' with a '2'
  O = replace(I, 5, 0)  # Remove remaining '5's
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identify '1' objects using `objects`.
2. For each cell in a '1' object, find its right neighbor.
3. If the neighbor is a '5', replace it with '2'.
4. Finally, remove any remaining '5's.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = objects(I, True, False, False) # Identify connected '1' objects
  recolored = set()
  for o in obj:
    if color(o) == 1:
      for x, (i, j) in o:
        if j+1 < width(I) and I[i][j+1] == 5:
          recolored.add((i,j+1))
  O = paint(replace(I, 5, 0), recolor(2, frozenset(recolored)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identify '1' objects using `objects`.
2. Iterate through each '1' object and its cells.
3. If a cell has a '5' immediately to its right, mark the '5's index for recoloring.
4. Replace all '5's with '0's.
5. Paint the previously marked indices with '2'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if O[i][j] == 1:
        if j+1 < width(I) and O[i][j+1] == 5:
          O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j+1))})
  O = replace(O, 5, 0)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterate through every cell in the grid.
2. If a cell is '1' and its right neighbor is '5', replace the neighbor with '2'.
3. Finally, replace any remaining '5's with '0's.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = replace(I, 5, 0)
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)-1):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j+1] == 5:
        O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j+1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. First, remove all '5's from the grid.
2. Iterate through each cell in the grid, except the last column.
3. If a cell is '1' and its right neighbor was originally '5' (now '0'), paint the neighbor cell with '2'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  expansion_indices = set()
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 1:
      for _, (i, j) in obj:
        if j + 1 < width(I) and I[i][j + 1] == 5:
          expansion_indices.add((i, j + 1))
  I = replace(I, 5, 0)
  I = paint(I, recolor(2, frozenset(expansion_indices)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identify '1' objects using the `objects` function.
2. Iterate through each cell of the '1' objects.
3. If a cell has a '5' to its right, store the index of that '5' in `expansion_indices`.
4. Replace all '5's in the grid with '0's.
5. Finally, paint the cells at the indices stored in `expansion_indices` with the color '2'. 


These five versions provide different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version leverages a unique combination of functions and logic to effectively identify '1' objects, expand them by replacing adjacent '5's, and clean up the grid by removing remaining '5's.
