## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by connected '1's (excluding diagonal connections) and drawing a '2' border around them. The '5' digit acts as a distractor and is ignored in the output. Let's break down the transformation for each example:

**Input_0:**
- There's one object formed by '1's.
- The output replaces the surrounding '0's with '2's to create a border.

**Input_1:**
- Again, one object formed by '1's.
- The output similarly draws a '2' border around it.

**Input_2:**
-  Three separate objects formed by '1's.
-  Each object gets a '2' border in the output.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Identify objects formed by connected '1's
  borders = mapply(lambda o: delta(toindices(o)), objs)  # Find the border cells
  O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, merge(borders))  # Fill border cells with '2'
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies objects formed by connected '1's, ignoring diagonal connections and the background.
2. **Find Borders:**  `mapply(lambda o: delta(toindices(o)), objs)` iterates over each object and finds the surrounding '0' cells (`delta` function) to define the border.
3. **Fill Borders:** `fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, merge(borders))` creates a canvas of '0's with the input shape and fills the border cells with '2'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  no_fives = replace(I, FIVE, ZERO)  # Replace distracting '5's with background '0's
  ones = objects(no_fives, T, F, F)  # Identify objects of '1's 
  expanded = mapply(lambda o: outbox(toindices(o)), ones) # Calculate outer box for each object
  O = fill(no_fives, TWO, merge(expanded))  # Fill the outer boxes with '2's
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Remove Distractors:** `replace(I, FIVE, ZERO)` replaces all '5's with '0's to simplify object identification.
2. **Identify Objects:** `objects(no_fives, T, F, F)` identifies objects formed by connected '1's.
3. **Calculate Outer Boxes:** `mapply(lambda o: outbox(toindices(o)), ones)` finds the outer boundary ('outbox') of each object.
4. **Fill Outer Boxes:**  `fill(no_fives, TWO, merge(expanded))` fills the identified outer boundary cells with '2's.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)  # Find all indices of '1's
  border_indices = mfilter(lambda loc: any(n not in ones_indices for n in dneighbors(loc)), ones_indices)  # Find '1's bordering '0's
  O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, border_indices)  # Create canvas and fill border indices with '2'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1's:** `ofcolor(I, ONE)` finds the indices of all '1' cells in the input.
2. **Identify Border '1's:** `mfilter(lambda loc: any(n not in ones_indices for n in dneighbors(loc)), ones_indices)`  filters the '1' indices to keep only those directly adjacent to a '0' (border cells).
3. **Fill Border Cells:** `fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, border_indices)` creates a canvas of '0's and fills the identified border cells with '2's.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # Extract objects formed by connected '1's
    padded_objs = mapply(lambda o: toindices(o) | delta(toindices(o)), objs)  # Combine object indices with their surrounding cells
    O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, merge(padded_objs))  # Fill the combined cells with '2'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies objects formed by '1's.
2. **Combine with Surrounding Cells:** `mapply(lambda o: toindices(o) | delta(toindices(o)), objs)` combines the indices of each object with the indices of its surrounding cells.
3. **Fill Combined Cells:** `fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, merge(padded_objs))` fills all the combined cells with '2', effectively creating the border. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    shifted_grids = (shift(I, (1, 0)), shift(I, (-1, 0)), shift(I, (0, 1)), shift(I, (0, -1)))  # Create four shifted copies of the grid
    border_cells = set()
    for grid in shifted_grids:
        for i, row in enumerate(grid):
            for j, val in enumerate(row):
                if val == ONE and I[i][j] == ZERO:
                    border_cells.add((i, j))
    O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, frozenset(border_cells))  # Fill border cells with '2'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Shifted Grids:** Generate four copies of the input grid, each shifted one cell in a cardinal direction.
2. **Identify Border Cells:**  Compare each shifted grid with the original. If a '1' in a shifted grid corresponds to a '0' in the original, mark that cell as a border cell.
3. **Fill Border Cells:** Create a canvas of '0's and fill the identified border cells with '2's. 


These five program versions offer distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and power of the provided DSL.
