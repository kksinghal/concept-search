## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (groups of connected '1' digits) within the input grid and shifting them one cell to the right. The '5' digit seems to be irrelevant to the transformation and is preserved in its original location. Any '1' digits that would be shifted off the grid are removed. 

Let's break down each example:

**Input_0:**

* The object consisting of '1' digits at (0,0), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2) is shifted one cell to the right.
* The '1' digit at (0,4) is removed as it would be shifted off the grid.

**Input_1:**

* The two separate objects formed by '1' digits are both shifted one cell to the right.
*  Similar to Input_0, any '1' digits that would be shifted off the grid are removed.

**Input_2:**

* Similar to previous examples, the objects formed by '1' digits are shifted right by one cell.
*  Again, any '1' digit that would be shifted off the grid is removed. 


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:


### **Program Version 1:**

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  shifted_objs = frozenset({shift(obj, (0,1)) for obj in objs if color(obj) == 1})
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(shifted_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, False)` identifies objects in the input grid `I`.  We set `univalued` to `True` to group only connected '1's,  `diagonal` to `False` to consider only direct neighbors, and `without_bg` to `False` to include all objects.
2. **Shift Right:** `shifted_objs` shifts each object in `objs` one cell to the right using `shift(obj, (0,1))` only if the object's color is 1 (`color(obj) == 1`). 
3. **Create Output Grid:** `canvas(0, shape(I))` creates an empty grid (`O`) of the same size as the input, filled with '0's.
4. **Paint Objects:** `paint(O, merge(shifted_objs))` paints the shifted objects onto the output grid `O`.

### **Program Version 2:**

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if value == 1 and j < len(row) - 1:
                O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Output Grid:** An empty output grid `O` is initialized with the same dimensions as the input grid `I`, filled with '0's using `canvas(0, shape(I))`.
2. **Iterate and Shift:** The program iterates through each cell of the input grid. If a cell contains '1' and is not on the rightmost edge of the grid (`j < len(row) - 1`), the cell to its right in the output grid `O` is filled with '2' using `fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})`.

### **Program Version 3:**

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
    ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
    right_shifted = mapply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), ones)
    valid_indices = intersection(right_shifted, asindices(I))
    O = fill(I, 0, asindices(I))
    O = fill(O, 2, valid_indices)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1's:**  `ofcolor(I, 1)` identifies the indices of all cells containing '1' in the input grid `I`.
2. **Shift Right:** `right_shifted` calculates the indices resulting from shifting each '1' index one cell to the right using  `mapply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), ones)`.
3. **Validate Indices:**  `intersection(right_shifted, asindices(I))` filters out any indices in `right_shifted` that would fall outside the grid boundaries. 
4. **Fill Output:**  An output grid `O` is created as a copy of the input `I` but filled with '0's using  `fill(I, 0, asindices(I))`. Then, the '2's are placed at their shifted locations within the output grid using `fill(O, 2, valid_indices)`.

### **Program Version 4:**

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
        if color(obj) == 1:
            shifted_obj = shift(obj, (0, 1))
            O = paint(cover(O, obj), shifted_obj)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** The output grid `O` is initialized as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** The program iterates through each object in the input grid identified by `objects(I, True, False, False)`. 
3. **Conditional Shift and Paint:** If the object's color is 1 (`color(obj) == 1`), the object is shifted one cell to the right using  `shift(obj, (0, 1))`.  The original object is then removed from the output grid using `cover(O, obj)`, and the shifted object is painted onto the output grid using `paint()`.

### **Program Version 5:**

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  shifted =  tuple(tuple(0 if j==0 else I[i][j-1] for j in range(len(I[0]))) for i in range(len(I)))
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
        if shifted[i][j] == 1:
            O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Values:** A new grid, `shifted`, is created. This grid represents the input grid with all values shifted one position to the right. If a value is in the leftmost column of the input grid, its corresponding position in `shifted` is set to 0.
2. **Create Output Grid:** An empty output grid `O` is initialized with the same dimensions as the input grid `I`, filled with '0's using `canvas(0, shape(I))`.
3. **Iterate and Fill:** The program iterates through each cell of the `shifted` grid. If a cell in `shifted` contains a '1', the corresponding cell in the output grid `O` is filled with a '2'.


These program versions offer diverse approaches to accomplish the grid transformation using different combinations of DSL functions.
