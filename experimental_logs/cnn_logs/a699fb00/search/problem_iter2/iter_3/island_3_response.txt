## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects formed by the digit '1' in the input grid, applying the following rules:

* **Outer Boundary:**  The outermost cells of each '1'-object are replaced with '2'. 
* **Clear Interior:** All non-boundary cells within a '1'-object are replaced with '0'.
* **Other Digits:** All other digits in the input grid remain unchanged.

Let's illustrate with an example:

**Input:**
```
1 0 1 5 1 
0 0 1 0 1 
0 0 1 0 1 
0 1 1 1 1 
0 0 1 0 1 
```

**Output:**
```
1 2 1 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 
0 1 2 1 0 
0 0 0 0 0
```

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions utilizing the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  new_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == ONE:
      boundary = box(obj)
      interior = difference(toindices(obj), boundary)
      new_obj = recolor(TWO, boundary) | recolor(ZERO, interior)
      new_objs = insert(new_obj, new_objs)
    else:
      new_objs = insert(obj, new_objs)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), new_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, False)` identifies connected components of '1's.
2. **Iterate & Transform:**  For each '1'-object:
   - `box(obj)` identifies the boundary indices.
   - `difference(toindices(obj), boundary)` gets the interior indices.
   - `recolor(TWO, boundary)` creates a new object with '2' on the boundary.
   - `recolor(ZERO, interior)` creates an object with '0' in the interior.
   - These are combined using the union operator (`|`).
3. **Paint to Canvas:**  A blank canvas is created and the transformed objects are painted onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  new_objs = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: recolor(TWO, box(obj)) if color(obj) == ONE else obj)
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), new_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Filter & Transform:** `mfilter` is used for a more concise approach:
   - For each object, if it's a '1'-object, it replaces its boundary with '2' using `recolor(TWO, box(obj))`. 
   - Otherwise, the object is returned unchanged.
3. **Paint to Canvas:** Same as Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, j in asindices(I):
    if I[i][j] == ONE and any(I[k][l] != ONE for k, l in dneighbors((i,j))):
      O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j)})
    elif I[i][j] == ONE:
      O = fill(O, ZERO, {(i, j)})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over Cells:**  Iterates over every cell in the input grid.
2. **Check for Boundary:**  If a cell is '1' and any of its direct neighbors is not '1', it's a boundary cell and replaced with '2'.
3. **Fill Interior:**  If a cell is '1' and not a boundary cell, it's filled with '0'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)
  for i, j in one_indices:
    if any((k,l) not in one_indices for k, l in dneighbors((i, j))):
      O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j)}) 
  O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, one_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Creates a blank canvas.
2. **Find '1' Indices:** Identifies all indices containing '1'.
3. **Mark Boundaries:**  Iterates over '1' indices and checks if any direct neighbor is not a '1', marking it with '2'.
4. **Paint Remaining '1's:**  Paints the remaining '1' indices onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  boundary = mapply(box, objects(I, True, False, False))
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), recolor(TWO, boundary))
  return paint(O, recolor(ONE, difference(ofcolor(I, ONE), boundary)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Boundaries:** Finds boundaries of all '1'-objects using `mapply` and `box`.
2. **Paint Boundaries:** Creates a blank canvas and paints all boundaries with '2'.
3. **Paint Remaining '1's:** Identifies the indices of '1's that are not part of any boundary and paints them with '1' onto the canvas. 

These are just a few possible approaches. The optimal solution might depend on the specific constraints and performance requirements of the system running this DSL.
