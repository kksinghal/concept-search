## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to identify horizontal sequences of '1's in the input grid and apply the following:

* **Shift Right:** The entire sequence of '1's is shifted one position to the right.
* **Replace:** 
    * The original positions of '1's are replaced with '2's.
    * The shifted positions that overlap with the original '1's are replaced with '0's.

Let's analyze this with each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

```
1 0 1 5 1  ->  1 2 1 0 0
0 0 1 0 1  ->  0 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 1  ->  0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1  ->  0 1 2 1 0
0 0 1 0 1  ->  0 0 0 0 0 
```
* The sequence "1111" is shifted to " 1111", overlapping at the second and third positions.
* Original positions of '1' become '2':  "1 2 1", " 1 2 1"
* Overlapping shifted positions become '0': "1 2 1 0 0", " 0 1 2 1 0"

**Input_1 & Input_2:**  Follow the same pattern, with longer sequences and varying positions. 


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted = hconcat(((0,) * height(I),), trim(hconcat(I, ((0,) * height(I),))))
  O = cellwise(I, shifted, 0)
  O = replace(O, 1, 2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`shifted = hconcat(((0,) * height(I),), trim(hconcat(I, ((0,) * height(I),))))`**: This line shifts the grid one position to the right, padding with zeros. 
2. **`O = cellwise(I, shifted, 0)`**:  Compares the original grid (I) and the shifted grid. Where they match (both have '1'), it keeps the value ('1'). Where they don't, it fills with '0'. 
3. **`O = replace(O, 1, 2)`**: Finally, all remaining '1's (which were the original positions of '1's) are replaced with '2's. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))  # Initialize output grid with all 0's
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        O[i][j] = 2  # Replace original '1' with '2'
        if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 1:
          O[i][j + 1] = 1  # Keep '1' if followed by another '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(0, shape(I))`**: Creates an output grid of the same size as the input, filled with '0's.
2. **Nested loops:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
3. **`if I[i][j] == 1:`**: Checks if the current cell contains a '1'.
4.   **`O[i][j] = 2`**:  Replaces the current '1' in the output grid with a '2'.
5.   **`if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 1:`**: Checks if it's not the last column and if the next cell also contains a '1'.
6.     **`O[i][j + 1] = 1`**:  If the next cell also has a '1', keeps it as '1' in the output grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False) # Get connected components of 1s.
  shifted_objs = frozenset({shift(obj, (0,1)) for obj in objs if color(obj) == 1}) # Shift each component by 1
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(shifted_objs)) # Paint the shifted components onto a blank canvas
  O = cellwise(I, O, 2) # Use cellwise to replace the original 1s with 2s
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, True, False, False)`**: Extracts connected components (objects) from the input grid where cells with the value '1' are considered connected if they are directly adjacent (not diagonally). 
2. **`shifted_objs = frozenset({shift(obj, (0,1)) for obj in objs if color(obj) == 1})`**:  Shifts each connected component one position to the right.
3. **`O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(shifted_objs))`**: Creates a blank canvas (filled with '0's) and paints the shifted connected components onto it. 
4. **`O = cellwise(I, O, 2)`**: Compares the input grid with the canvas containing shifted components. If a cell in the input grid has '1', it replaces the corresponding cell in the output grid with '2'. Otherwise, it keeps the value from the shifted components canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 1:
        O[i] = O[i][:j] + (2,) + O[i][j+1:] # Place a 2 at the current position
        if j < len(row) - 1 and row[j+1] == 1:
          O[i] = O[i][:j+1] + (1,) + O[i][j+2:] # If the next element is also 1, keep it as 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(0, shape(I))`**:  Creates an empty output grid of the same size as the input grid, filled with '0's.
2. **Nested loops:**  Iterates over each cell of the input grid.
3. **`if val == 1:`**:  Checks if the current cell value is '1'.
4.    **`O[i] = O[i][:j] + (2,) + O[i][j+1:]`**: Replaces the current cell in the output grid with '2'.
5.    **`if j < len(row) - 1 and row[j+1] == 1:`**:  Checks if it's not the last column and if the next cell in the row is also '1'.
6.       **`O[i] = O[i][:j+1] + (1,) + O[i][j+2:]`**: If the next cell is also '1', it keeps the '1' in the output grid at the shifted position.

**Program Version 5:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted = hconcat(trim(hconcat(I, ((0,) * height(I),))), ((0,) * height(I),))  # Shift left and pad
  O = cellwise(I, shifted, 0) # Compare with original and set to 0 where different
  O = replace(O, 1, 2) # Replace remaining 1s with 2s
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted = hconcat(trim(hconcat(I, ((0,) * height(I),))), ((0,) * height(I),))`**:  This line first shifts the entire grid to the left by one position and then pads the right side with zeros, effectively simulating a right shift without overlapping.
2. **`O = cellwise(I, shifted, 0)`**: This line compares each cell of the original grid (`I`) with the corresponding cell of the shifted grid. If the values are different, it sets the cell in the output grid (`O`) to '0'. If they are the same (both '1'), it keeps the value ('1').
3. **`O = replace(O, 1, 2)`**: Finally, this line replaces all remaining '1's in the output grid (`O`) with '2's. These remaining '1's represent the original positions of '1's in the input grid.

These programs offer different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL.
