## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions) of a specific value (likely '1') in the input grid and then highlighting the cells surrounding these objects with a different value (likely '2') in the output grid. The original objects themselves are either removed or painted over with the background color.

**Example:**

* **Input:** A grid with '1's forming various shapes.
* **Output:** A grid where the '1's are replaced with the background color, and cells directly surrounding those '1's are now '2's. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:


### **Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects formed by connected 1s
  expanded = mapply(lambda o: delta(toindices(o)), objs) # Find cells surrounding each object
  return fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, merge(expanded)) # Fill surrounding cells with 2
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies connected components of '1's in the input grid (`I`), excluding the background.
2. **`mapply(lambda o: delta(toindices(o)), objs)`:** For each object, finds the surrounding cells (delta) by first getting their indices (toindices).
3. **`fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, merge(expanded))`:** Creates a canvas of the same size as the input, filled with '0's, and then fills the identified surrounding cells with '2's.


### **Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, fill(I, TWO, merge(mapply(lambda o: delta(toindices(o)), objects(I, T, F, T)))), ZERO) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies connected components of '1's, excluding the background.
2. **`mapply(lambda o: delta(toindices(o)), objs)`:**  For each object, finds the surrounding cells.
3. **`fill(I, TWO, ...)`:** Fills the surrounding cells in a copy of the input grid with '2's.
4. **`cellwise(I, ..., ZERO)`:** Compares the original input with the modified grid. If cells match, it keeps the original value; otherwise, it uses '0'.


### **Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) # Initialize output canvas
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    O = fill(O, TWO, delta(toindices(obj))) # Fill surrounding cells for each object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`:** Creates an empty canvas of '0's.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):`:** Iterates through each connected object of '1's.
3. **`O = fill(O, TWO, delta(toindices(obj)))`:**  Calculates the surrounding cells of the object and fills them with '2's in the output canvas.


### **Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  surrounding = set()
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == ONE: # If cell is part of an object
        for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]: # Check direct neighbors
          ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
          if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] != ONE:
            surrounding.add((ni, nj))
  return fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, frozenset(surrounding))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`surrounding = set()`:** Initializes an empty set to store surrounding cell indices.
2. **Iterate through each cell:**  Loops through every cell in the grid.
3. **`if I[i][j] == ONE:`:** If a cell is '1' (part of an object), it checks its direct neighbors.
4. **Check direct neighbors:**  If a neighbor is not '1' (not part of the object), its index is added to the `surrounding` set.
5. **`return fill(...)`:** Finally, it creates a canvas of '0's and fills the `surrounding` cells with '2's.

### **Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(fill(I, TWO,  merge(mapply(lambda o: outbox(toindices(o)), objects(I, T, F, T)))), ZERO, toobject(asindices(I), I))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`**: This identifies the connected components of '1's in the input grid (`I`), excluding the background.
2. **`mapply(lambda o: outbox(toindices(o)), objects(I, T, F, T))`**: For each identified object ('1' component):
    * **`toindices(o)`**: Gets the indices of the cells belonging to that object.
    * **`outbox(...)`**: Calculates the indices of the cells forming the outer boundary (one cell away in all directions) of that object.
3. **`merge(...)`**: Combines the outer boundary indices of all objects into a single set.
4. **`fill(I, TWO, ...)`**:  Creates a copy of the input grid (`I`) and fills the cells at the combined outer boundary indices with the value '2'.
5. **`toobject(asindices(I), I)`**: Converts the entire input grid into an "object" representation, essentially a set of (value, (row, col)) tuples.
6. **`paint(..., ZERO, ...)`**:  Takes the grid with the filled outer boundaries and "paints" the original input grid's values onto it, using '0' as the background value. This effectively keeps the '2's at the boundaries and reverts the other cells back to their original values from `I`.


These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the same transformation, each utilizing different combinations of DSL functions and logic.
