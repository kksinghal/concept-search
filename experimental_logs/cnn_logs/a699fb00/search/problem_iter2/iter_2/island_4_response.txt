## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by adjacent '1's in the input grid (excluding diagonal adjacency) and replacing them in the output grid with '0's, except for the rightmost '1' of each object which is replaced by '2'.  All other digits in the input grid are kept unchanged in the output grid.

**Example:**

Input:
```
1 1 0
1 0 0
```

Output:
```
1 2 0
1 0 0 
``` 

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1) # Identify indices of all '1's
  shifted_left = mapply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] - 1), ones) # Shift indices one position to the left
  O = fill(I, 2, intersection(shifted_left, ones)) # Fill '2' at intersection, indicating rightmost '1's
  O = fill(O, 0, ones) # Fill '0' at all original '1' positions
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1's:** `ones = ofcolor(I, 1)` identifies all indices in the grid containing the value '1'.
2. **Shift Left:** `shifted_left = mapply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] - 1), ones)` shifts all identified indices one position to the left.
3. **Mark Rightmost '1's:** `O = fill(I, 2, intersection(shifted_left, ones))` finds the intersection of the original '1' indices and the left-shifted indices. This intersection represents the rightmost '1' of each object and is filled with '2'.
4. **Fill Remaining '1's:** `O = fill(O, 0, ones)` fills all original '1' indices with '0'.

**Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False) # Identify objects formed by adjacent '1's
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    rightmost_cell = argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1]) # Find the rightmost cell within each object
    O = fill(O, 2, {rightmost_cell[1]}) # Replace the rightmost cell with '2'
    O = fill(O, 0, toindices(obj)) # Replace all cells within the object with '0'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, True, False, False)` identifies objects formed by horizontally and vertically adjacent '1's.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** The code iterates through each identified object.
3. **Find Rightmost Cell:** `rightmost_cell = argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1])` finds the cell with the maximum column index (rightmost) within each object.
4. **Replace Rightmost Cell:** `O = fill(O, 2, {rightmost_cell[1]})` replaces the rightmost cell with '2'.
5. **Replace Remaining Cells:** `O = fill(O, 0, toindices(obj))` replaces all cells within the object with '0'.

**Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 1:
        if j == len(row) - 1 or I[i][j + 1] != 1: # Check if it's the rightmost '1'
          O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)}) # Replace with '2' if it's the rightmost '1'
        else:
          O = fill(O, 0, {(i, j)}) # Replace with '0' otherwise
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Cells:** The code iterates through each cell in the input grid.
2. **Check for '1':** If a cell contains '1', it checks if it's the rightmost '1' of an object.
3. **Rightmost '1' Check:** It checks if the current cell is the last in the row (`j == len(row) - 1`) or if the cell to its right is not '1' (`I[i][j + 1] != 1`).
4. **Replace with '2' or '0':** If it's the rightmost '1', it replaces the cell with '2'. Otherwise, it replaces it with '0'.

**Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)  # Identify objects
  O = fill(I, 0, toindices(merge(objs)))  # Fill all object cells with 0 initially
  for obj in objs:
    rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)  # Find the rightmost column index
    rightmost_cells = sfilter(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1] == rightmost_j)  # Get cells in that column
    O = fill(O, 2, toindices(rightmost_cells))  # Fill those cells with 2
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as in Version 2.
2. **Fill with '0':**  `O = fill(I, 0, toindices(merge(objs)))` fills all cells belonging to identified objects with '0' initially. 
3. **Iterate and Find Rightmost Column:** The code iterates through each object and identifies its rightmost column index using  `rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)`.
4. **Extract Rightmost Cells:** `rightmost_cells = sfilter(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1] == rightmost_j)`  filters the object cells to keep only those residing in the rightmost column. 
5. **Fill with '2':**  `O = fill(O, 2, toindices(rightmost_cells))` replaces the cells in the rightmost column with '2'.

**Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Initialize output grid with all '0's
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    current_object = []
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 1:
        current_object.append((i,j)) # Add '1' coordinates to current object
      if (value != 1 or j == len(row) - 1) and current_object: # Object ended or row ended
        O = fill(O, 2, {current_object[-1]}) # Fill last cell of object with '2'
        current_object = [] # Reset object
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize with '0's:** `O = canvas(0, shape(I))` creates an output grid with the same dimensions as the input but filled entirely with '0's.
2. **Iterate and Track Objects:** The code iterates through each cell, storing coordinates of consecutive '1's in `current_object`.
3. **Object End Detection:** When a cell is not '1' or it's the last cell in a row, it signifies the end of the current object. 
4. **Fill Last Cell with '2':** `O = fill(O, 2, {current_object[-1]})` replaces the last cell of the `current_object` (which represents the rightmost '1') with '2' in the output grid.
5. **Reset Object:**  `current_object = []` clears the list to track the next potential object.

These versions provide a range of approaches to solve the transformation problem, each employing different DSL functions and logic.
