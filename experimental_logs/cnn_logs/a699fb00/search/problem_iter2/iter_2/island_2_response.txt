## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation identifies objects formed by adjacent '1's in the input grid. Then, it creates a frame around each object using '2's, leaving the original '1's intact. Finally, it replaces all other digits with '0's, essentially highlighting the framed objects against a blank background. 

**Here's a breakdown:**

1. **Object Identification:** Clusters of connected '1's are identified as distinct objects.
2. **Framing:** A one-cell thick frame of '2's is drawn around each object.
3. **Background Clearing:**  All digits other than the framed objects ('1's and their surrounding '2's) are replaced with '0's.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) 
  framed = mapply(lambda o: fill(I, TWO, outbox(toindices(o))), colorfilter(objs, ONE))
  O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, merge(framed)) if framed else canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, F)`**:  Identifies connected objects formed by adjacent '1's in the input grid `I`.
2. **`framed = mapply(lambda o: fill(I, TWO, outbox(toindices(o))), colorfilter(objs, ONE))`**: 
    - `colorfilter(objs, ONE)`: Filters the identified objects to select only those containing '1's.
    - `mapply(lambda o: fill(I, TWO, outbox(toindices(o))), ...)`: For each object with '1', it draws a '2' frame around its outer boundary using `outbox` and `fill`.
3. **`O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, merge(framed)) if framed else canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`**: 
    - Creates a canvas of '0's with the same dimensions as the input.
    - If `framed` is not empty (meaning frames were drawn), it fills the canvas with '2's at the positions specified by the merged frames.
    - If no frames were drawn, it returns the canvas of '0's. 
4. **`return O`**: Returns the transformed grid.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  no_fives = replace(I, FIVE, ZERO)
  ones = objects(no_fives, T, F, F)
  expanded = mapply(lambda o: delta(shift(toindices(o), (1, 1))) | 
                    delta(shift(toindices(o), (-1, 1))) | 
                    delta(shift(toindices(o), (1, -1))) | 
                    delta(shift(toindices(o), (-1, -1))), ones)
  O = fill(no_fives, TWO, merge(expanded)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`no_fives = replace(I, FIVE, ZERO)`**: Removes '5' markers by replacing them with zeros.
2. **`ones = objects(no_fives, T, F, F)`**: Finds clusters of '1's in the cleaned grid.
3. **`expanded = ...`**: This part calculates the frame for each object:
    - For each object in `ones`, it shifts the object in all four diagonal directions.
    - It then uses `delta` to get the difference between the shifted object's bounding box and the shifted object itself, effectively getting the diagonal neighbors. 
    - It combines the neighbors from all four shifts using the union operation (`|`) to get the complete frame.
4. **`O = fill(no_fives, TWO, merge(expanded))`**: Fills the cleaned grid (`no_fives`) with '2's at the positions specified by the merged frames (`expanded`).
5. **`return O`**: Returns the final grid.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  filtered_objs = colorfilter(objs, ONE)
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda o: shift(toindices(o), (1, 0)) | shift(toindices(o), (-1, 0)) | 
                        shift(toindices(o), (0, 1)) | shift(toindices(o), (0, -1)), filtered_objs)
  O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, merge(shifted_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, F)`**:  Identifies connected objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`filtered_objs = colorfilter(objs, ONE)`**: Filters the identified objects to select only those containing '1's.
3. **`shifted_objs = ...`**:  Calculates the frame by shifting each object in four directions:
   - For each object in `filtered_objs`, it shifts its indices up, down, left, and right by one unit.
   - It uses `|` to combine the shifted indices, creating a one-cell thick frame around the object.
4. **`O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, merge(shifted_objs))`**: Creates a blank canvas and fills it with '2' at the positions specified by the merged frames.
5. **`return O`**: Returns the transformed grid.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  no_fives = replace(I, FIVE, ZERO)  # Remove '5' markers
  ones = objects(no_fives, T, F, F)  # Find '1' clusters
  frames = mapply(lambda o: box(shift(toindices(o),(1,1))) | 
                   box(shift(toindices(o),(-1,1))) |
                   box(shift(toindices(o), (1,-1))) |
                   box(shift(toindices(o), (-1,-1))), ones) # Generate frames
  O = fill(no_fives, TWO, merge(frames)) # Fill the frames with '2'
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`no_fives = replace(I, FIVE, ZERO)`**:  Removes any '5's from the input grid.
2. **`ones = objects(no_fives, T, F, F)`**: Finds all clusters of '1's in the grid.
3. **`frames = ...`**: This is where the frame generation happens:
    - For each '1' cluster (`o`):
       - It shifts the cluster diagonally in all four directions.
       - For each shifted cluster, it uses `box` to get the bounding box, which acts as a diagonal frame element.
       - It combines the bounding boxes from all four shifts using `|` to create the complete frame for that cluster.
4. **`O = fill(no_fives, TWO, merge(frames))`**: It fills the initial cleaned grid (`no_fives`) with '2's at the positions defined by the combined frames. 
5. **`return O`**:  Returns the final grid with frames around '1' clusters.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  no_fives = replace(I, FIVE, ZERO) 
  ones_indices = ofcolor(no_fives, ONE) 
  frame_indices = mfilter(lambda loc: any(n in ones_indices for n in ineighbors(loc)), asindices(no_fives)) 
  O = fill(no_fives, TWO, frame_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`no_fives = replace(I, FIVE, ZERO)`**: Removes '5' markers, replacing them with '0's.
2. **`ones_indices = ofcolor(no_fives, ONE)`**:  Finds all indices of '1's in the cleaned grid.
3. **`frame_indices = ...`**: This is the core logic for finding frame indices:
   - `asindices(no_fives)`: Gets all possible indices in the grid.
   - `mfilter(lambda loc: ..., asindices(no_fives))`: Filters these indices based on the condition within the lambda function.
   - `lambda loc: any(n in ones_indices for n in ineighbors(loc))`:  This lambda function checks if any diagonal neighbor of the current index `loc` is a '1'. If yes, this index is part of the frame.
4. **`O = fill(no_fives, TWO, frame_indices)`**:  Fills the cleaned grid (`no_fives`) with '2's at the identified frame indices.
5. **`return O`**: Returns the final grid with '2' frames around the '1' clusters.
