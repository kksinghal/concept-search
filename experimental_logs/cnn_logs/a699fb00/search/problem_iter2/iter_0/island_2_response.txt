## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all three examples follows a consistent pattern:

1. **Identify target objects:** The objects with the value '5' in the input grid are identified.
2. **Create a border:**  A border of '2's is drawn around each target object. The border extends one cell outwards from the object's boundaries.
3. **Clear background:**  All other values in the grid are replaced with '0'. 

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The '5' at (0,3) is selected.
- A border of '2's is drawn around it, resulting in the pattern seen in Output_0.
- All other cells become '0'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The '5' at (0,8) is selected.
- A border of '2's is drawn around it.
- All other cells become '0'.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
- The two '5's at (0,7) and (9,9) are selected.
- Borders of '2's are drawn around them.
- All other cells become '0'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), FIVE)
  borders = mapply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), objs)
  O = fill(I, ZERO, asindices(I)) 
  O = fill(O, TWO, borders)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objs = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), FIVE)`: Identifies all objects with color '5'.
2. `borders = mapply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), objs)`:  For each '5' object, creates a set of indices representing the border by finding the difference between the object's bounding box (`backdrop`) and the object itself.
3. `O = fill(I, ZERO, asindices(I))`:  Fills the entire grid with '0's, effectively clearing the background.
4. `O = fill(O, TWO, borders)`:  Fills the previously identified border indices with '2's.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  target_indices = ofcolor(I, FIVE)
  border_indices = mapply(dneighbors, target_indices) - target_indices
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  O = fill(O, TWO, border_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `target_indices = ofcolor(I, FIVE)`: Retrieves the indices of all cells with the value '5'.
2. `border_indices = mapply(dneighbors, target_indices) - target_indices`:  Determines border indices by finding all direct neighbors of target cells and then removing the target cells themselves.
3. `O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`: Creates a new grid filled with '0's, having the same dimensions as the input.
4. `O = fill(O, TWO, border_indices)`:  Fills the border indices in the new grid with '2's. 


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  target_objs = colorfilter(objs, FIVE)
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: toindices(shift(obj, (1, 1))) | toindices(shift(obj, (-1, 1))) | toindices(shift(obj, (1, -1))) | toindices(shift(obj, (-1, -1))), target_objs)
  border_indices = expanded_objs - mapply(toindices, target_objs)
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  O = fill(O, TWO, border_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objs = objects(I, T, F, F)`:  Identifies all objects in the input grid.
2. `target_objs = colorfilter(objs, FIVE)`: Filters out objects that are not of color '5'.
3. `expanded_objs = ...`:  This line expands each target object by one cell in all directions and merges the results.
4. `border_indices = ...`: The border indices are found by subtracting the original object indices from the expanded object indices.
5. `O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`:  A new grid of '0's is created with the input's dimensions.
6. `O = fill(O, TWO, border_indices)`:  '2's are placed on the border indices in the new grid. 


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = replace(I, FIVE, ZERO)
  for i in range(1, len(I) - 1):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == FIVE or I[i+1][j] == FIVE or I[i-1][j] == FIVE or I[i][j+1] == FIVE or I[i][j-1] == FIVE:
        O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `O = replace(I, FIVE, ZERO)`: Replaces all occurrences of '5' with '0' in a copy of the input grid.
2.  The nested loops iterate through each cell of the grid (excluding the outer edges).
3. `if I[i][j] == FIVE or ...`: This condition checks if the current cell or any of its direct neighbors in the original input grid was a '5'. 
4. `O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j)})`: If the condition is met, the corresponding cell in the output grid is filled with a '2'. 


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  target_cells = {(i, j) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0])) if I[i][j] == FIVE}
  shifted_cells = mapply(lambda cell: dneighbors(cell), target_cells)
  border_cells = shifted_cells - target_cells
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for i, j in border_cells:
    if 0 <= i < len(O) and 0 <= j < len(O[0]):
      O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `target_cells = ...`:  Finds all cell locations containing '5' in the input grid.
2. `shifted_cells = ...`: Generates a set of cells by shifting each '5' cell in all four direct directions.
3. `border_cells = ...`: Determines border cells by removing the original '5' cells from the shifted cells set.
4. `O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`:  Creates a canvas of '0's matching the input grid's size.
5.  The loop iterates through each border cell, ensuring it's within the grid boundaries.
6. `O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j)})`:  Fills valid border cells on the canvas with '2's.


Each of these program versions uses different combinations of DSL functions and logic to achieve the same outcome, demonstrating diverse solution approaches within the constraints of the DSL.
