## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the object formed by the digit '1' and aims to:

1. **Isolate the object:** Remove all other digits from the grid, essentially treating them as background.
2. **Create a 'border' effect:**  Add the digit '2' to the cells directly surrounding the '1' object, effectively creating an outline. 
3. **Maintain object location:**  The '1' object and its new '2' border should retain the same position relative to the original grid dimensions.

**Illustrative Example:**

Let's break down the transformation for Input_0:

```
Input_0:          Output_0:
1 0 1 5 1       1 2 1 0 0 
0 0 1 0 1       0 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 1       0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 1  --->  0 1 2 1 0
0 0 1 0 1       0 0 0 0 0
```

Notice how the '1's remain in place, and the '2's form a border.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions utilizing the provided DSL to achieve the desired transformation.

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I) # Identify the '1' object
    bordered = delta(toindices(obj)) # Find indices surrounding the object
    O = paint(fill(I, 0, asindices(I)), obj) # Clear the grid and paint the '1' object
    O = fill(O, 2, bordered) # Fill the border with '2's
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** We locate all cells containing '1' and convert them into an object representation using `toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I)`.
2. **Find border indices:** Using `delta(toindices(obj))`, we get the indices directly surrounding the '1' object.
3. **Clear and paint:** We clear the grid (`fill(I, 0, asindices(I))`) and then paint the '1' object onto the cleared grid using `paint`.
4. **Fill the border:** Finally, we fill the identified border indices with the digit '2'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  surrounding = mapply(neighbors, ones)
  border = difference(surrounding, ones)
  O = fill(I, 0, asindices(I))
  O = fill(O, 2, border)
  O = fill(O, 1, ones)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1' cells:** Similar to Version 1, we identify the indices of cells containing '1'.
2. **Find surrounding cells:**  We find all neighbors of each '1' cell using `mapply(neighbors, ones)`.
3. **Isolate border cells:**  By taking the difference between surrounding cells and the original '1' cells, we obtain the border indices.
4. **Clear, fill border, fill object:** We clear the grid, fill the border with '2', and then fill the original '1' locations.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    obj_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
    shifted_up = shift(obj_indices, UP)
    shifted_down = shift(obj_indices, DOWN)
    shifted_left = shift(obj_indices, LEFT)
    shifted_right = shift(obj_indices, RIGHT)
    border = merge((shifted_up, shifted_down, shifted_left, shifted_right))
    O = fill(I, 0, asindices(I))
    O = fill(O, 2, border)
    O = fill(O, 1, obj_indices)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1' cells:** Get indices of cells with '1'.
2. **Shift indices:** Create four shifted sets of indices, each representing a direction (up, down, left, right) relative to the original '1' object.
3. **Merge for border:** Combine the shifted indices to form the border.
4. **Clear, fill, and return:** Clear grid, fill the border with '2', fill the '1' object, and return the result.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I)
  border =  difference(box(obj), toindices(obj))
  O = paint(fill(I, 0, asindices(I)), obj)
  O = fill(O, 2, border)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' object:** Locate the '1' object.
2. **Determine bounding box and border:** Find the outline (box) of the object and subtract the object's indices to get the border.
3. **Clear, paint, and fill:** Clear the grid, paint the '1' object, fill the border with '2', and return.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I)
  border = mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj)) 
  border = difference(border, toindices(obj))
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), obj) 
  O = fill(O, 2, border)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify object:** Locate the '1' object.
2. **Find potential border cells:** Find all directly adjacent neighbors of each cell in the object using `mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj))`.
3. **Remove object cells from border:**  Subtract the object's indices from the potential border cells to get the actual border.
4. **Create canvas, paint, and fill:** Create a blank canvas of the same size as the input, paint the '1' object onto it, fill the border with '2', and return the result.
