## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation replaces specific occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid with the digit '2' in the output grid, effectively "highlighting" a specific object. The object being highlighted is always the one that contains the digit '5'. All other digits in the grid remain unchanged.

**Input 0:**
* The object containing '5' is identified. 
* All occurrences of '1' within this object are replaced by '2'.
* The rest of the grid remains the same.

**Input 1 & 2:**
* The same logic applies as in Input 0, consistently highlighting the object containing the digit '5'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: contained(FIVE, palette(obj)))
  O = paint(fill(I, ZERO, toindices(obj)), recolor(TWO, intersection(toindices(obj), ofcolor(I, ONE))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify the target object:** `extract(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: contained(FIVE, palette(obj)))` finds the object containing the digit '5'.
2. **Create a blank canvas:** `fill(I, ZERO, toindices(obj))` creates a copy of the input grid with the target object replaced by zeros.
3. **Highlight the '1's:** `recolor(TWO, intersection(toindices(obj), ofcolor(I, ONE)))` creates an object with '2's at the locations where the target object and the digit '1' overlap.
4. **Paint onto the canvas:** `paint()` combines the blank canvas with the highlighted object to produce the final output.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = extract(partition(I), lambda obj: contained(FIVE, palette(obj)))
  indices = toindices(obj)
  O = tuple(tuple(TWO if (i,j) in indices and v==ONE else v for j,v in enumerate(row)) for i,row in enumerate(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Partition and find the object:** `extract(partition(I), lambda obj: contained(FIVE, palette(obj)))` partitions the grid and finds the object containing '5'.
2. **Get object indices:** `toindices(obj)` extracts the indices of the target object.
3. **Iterate and replace:** The code iterates through each cell of the grid, replacing '1's within the target object with '2's while keeping other cells unchanged.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if contained(FIVE, palette(obj)):
      O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, intersection(toindices(obj), ofcolor(I, ONE))))
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Create a blank canvas:**  `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))` generates a grid filled with zeros of the same size as the input.
2. **Iterate through objects:** The code iterates over each object in the input grid.
3. **Highlight or preserve:** If the object contains '5', its '1's are replaced by '2's and painted onto the canvas. Otherwise, the object is directly painted without modification. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  target_color = FIVE
  replacement_color = TWO
  O = tuple(
      tuple(
          replacement_color if v == ONE and any(index(I, (i+di, j+dj)) == target_color for di, dj in [(0, 0), (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]) else v
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Define target and replacement:**  The target color ('5') and replacement color ('2') are explicitly defined.
2. **Iterate and replace:** The code iterates through each cell. If a cell is '1' and has a neighboring cell (including itself) with the target color ('5'), it's replaced with the replacement color ('2'). 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  target_obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda o: colorcount(o, FIVE) > 0)
  O = tuple(
      tuple(
          TWO if (i, j) in toindices(target_obj) and v == ONE else v
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Find the target object:** `extract(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda o: colorcount(o, FIVE) > 0)` finds the object containing '5'.
2. **Iterate and replace:** The code iterates through the grid, replacing '1's within the target object with '2's while keeping other cells unchanged.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same grid transformation. They showcase the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for solving this image processing task.
