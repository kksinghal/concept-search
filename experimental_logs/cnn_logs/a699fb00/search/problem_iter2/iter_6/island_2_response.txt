## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify objects formed by connected '1's (excluding diagonal connections) on a background of '0's. The output grid then highlights the cells directly surrounding these objects with '2's while keeping the original objects intact. All other cells are set to '0'. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

* **Input_0:** The '1's form two objects - a small one in the top left and a larger one at the bottom. The output replaces the '0's directly surrounding these objects with '2's.
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, but with more spread-out objects. The output consistently highlights the cells surrounding each object with '2's.
* **Input_2:** Reinforces the pattern observed in the previous examples. Notice how the '5's are treated as part of the background and don't influence the '2' placement.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects formed by connected 1s (excluding background)
  expanded = mapply(lambda o: delta(toindices(o)), objs) # Find cells surrounding each object
  O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, merge(expanded)) # Create canvas and fill surrounding cells with 2
  return paint(O, toobject(merge(apply(toindices, objs)), I)) # Paint original objects back onto the canvas

```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, T, F, T)`: Identifies objects formed by connected '1's, treating everything else as background.
2. `mapply(lambda o: delta(toindices(o)), objs)`: For each object, it finds the indices of cells surrounding it (its 'delta').
3. `fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, merge(expanded))`: Creates a canvas of the same size as the input, filled with '0's, and then fills the cells identified in the previous step with '2's.
4. `paint(O, toobject(merge(apply(toindices, objs)), I))`:  Paints the original '1' objects back onto the canvas, ensuring they overwrite any '2's that might have been placed on them.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, ONE) # Get indices of all '1's
  surrounding = frozenset({n for loc in ones for n in dneighbors(loc) if index(I, n) == ZERO}) # Find surrounding '0's
  return fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, surrounding) # Fill surrounding cells with '2's on a blank canvas

```

**Explanation:**

1. `ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)`: Identifies the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. `surrounding = frozenset({n for loc in ones for n in dneighbors(loc) if index(I, n) == ZERO})`: Iterates through each '1' cell and finds its directly adjacent neighbors. It only includes neighbors that are '0's.
3. `fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, surrounding)`: Creates a new grid filled with '0's and then fills the identified surrounding cells with '2's.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) # Create a blank canvas
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] == ONE: # If cell is part of an object
                for di, dj in [(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)]: # Check direct neighbors
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] == ZERO: # If neighbor is within bounds and is a '0'
                        O = fill(O, TWO, {(ni, nj)}) # Fill that neighbor with '2'
    return paint(O, toobject(ofcolor(I, ONE), I)) # Paint original '1's onto the canvas

```

**Explanation:**

1. `O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`: Creates a canvas of '0's with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2. The nested loop iterates through every cell in the input grid.
3. If a cell contains a '1', it iterates through its four direct neighbors (up, down, left, right).
4. For each neighbor, it checks if it's within the grid's boundaries and if it's a '0'.
5. If both conditions are met, it fills that neighbor cell on the canvas with a '2'.
6. Finally, it paints the original '1' objects from the input grid onto the canvas, ensuring they overwrite any '2's.


**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Identify objects of '1's
  return paint(fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, merge(apply(lambda o: outbox(toindices(o)), objs))), toobject(merge(apply(toindices, objs)), I)) # Fill outbox of each object with '2's and paint original objects back

```

**Explanation:**

1. `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`: Extracts objects from the input, treating '1's as connected and everything else as background.
2. `outbox(toindices(o))`: For each object, it determines the indices of its outer boundary cells. 
3. `fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, ...)`: Creates a canvas of '0's and fills the identified outer boundary cells with '2's.
4. `paint(..., toobject(merge(apply(toindices, objs)), I))`: Overlays the original objects from the input grid onto the canvas, preserving their original positions and values. 

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, fill(I, TWO,  merge(mapply(lambda o: delta(toindices(o)), objects(I, T, F, T)))), ZERO) # Perform cellwise comparison and fill with '2' or '0'

```

**Explanation:**
1. `objects(I, T, F, T)`: Extracts connected objects from the input grid, where '1's represent the objects and everything else is background.
2. `delta(toindices(o))`:  Computes the surrounding cells (the 'delta') for each object.
3. `fill(I, TWO, ...)`: Creates a copy of the input grid and fills the identified surrounding cells with '2's.
4. `cellwise(I, ..., ZERO)`: Compares the original input grid with the modified grid (filled with '2's). 
   * If a cell in the original input is a '1', the corresponding cell in the output grid retains its value. 
   * If a cell in the modified grid is a '2', the corresponding cell in the output grid also becomes a '2'.
   * All other cells are set to '0'.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation using different combinations of DSL functions, showcasing the flexibility and power of the provided DSL for solving this image processing task.
