## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify connected components of '1's in the input grid and then highlight the cells immediately surrounding these components with the digit '2'.  The original '1' components remain unchanged, while all other cells are set to '0'.

**Example:**

Input:
```
1 1 0 0 
1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0
```

Output: 
```
1 1 2 0
1 1 1 2
2 1 2 0
```

## Program Version 1

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Identify connected components of '1's
  expanded = mapply(lambda o: delta(toindices(o)), objs)  # Get the surrounding cells
  O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, merge(expanded))  # Fill surrounding cells with '2'
  return paint(O, merge(objs))  # Paint the original '1' components back onto the grid 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Components:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` finds all connected components of '1's in the input grid `I`.
2. **Find Surrounding Cells:** `mapply(lambda o: delta(toindices(o)), objs)` iterates through each component and uses `delta` to find the indices of cells immediately surrounding it.
3. **Create Base Canvas:** `fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, merge(expanded))` creates a canvas of the same size as the input, fills the surrounding cells found in the previous step with '2', and sets all other cells to '0'.
4. **Restore Original Components:** `paint(O, merge(objs))` paints the original '1' components back onto the canvas, preserving their positions and values.

## Program Version 2

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    ones = ofcolor(I, ONE)  # Find all indices of '1's
    border = mfilter(lambda loc: any(index(I, n) != ONE for n in dneighbors(loc)), ones)  # Find border '1's
    surrounding = mfilter(lambda loc: any(index(I, n) == ZERO for n in dneighbors(loc)), delta(ones)) # Find cells adjacent to border '1's
    O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, surrounding)  # Create canvas, fill surroundings with '2'
    return paint(O, toobject(ones, I))  # Paint original '1' components back 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1' Cells:** `ofcolor(I, ONE)` identifies all indices in the grid `I` containing the value '1'.
2. **Identify Border '1's:** `mfilter(lambda loc: any(index(I, n) != ONE for n in dneighbors(loc)), ones)` finds '1' cells that have at least one non-'1' neighbor, representing the border of the components.
3. **Find Surrounding Cells:** `mfilter(lambda loc: any(index(I, n) == ZERO for n in dneighbors(loc)), delta(ones))` identifies cells adjacent to the '1' components by checking for '0' neighbors within the `delta` (surrounding cells) of the component.
4. **Construct Canvas and Fill:** `fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, surrounding)` creates a blank canvas, fills the identified surrounding cells with '2', and sets all other cells to '0'.
5. **Reinstate Original '1's:** `paint(O, toobject(ones, I))` paints the original '1' components back onto the grid, completing the transformation.

## Program Version 3

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    components = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Find connected components of '1's
    border_cells = set()
    for component in components:
        for cell in toindices(component):
            for neighbor in dneighbors(cell): 
                if 0 <= neighbor[0] < len(I) and 0 <= neighbor[1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, neighbor) != ONE:
                    border_cells.add(neighbor)
    O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, frozenset(border_cells)) # Create canvas and fill border cells
    return paint(O, merge(components))  # Paint original '1' components back 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Components:** `components = objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all connected components of '1's.
2. **Iterate and Check Neighbors:** The code iterates through each component and its constituent cells. For each cell, it examines its direct neighbors (`dneighbors`). If a neighbor falls within the grid boundaries and doesn't contain a '1', it's added to the `border_cells` set.
3. **Fill Border Cells:** `O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, frozenset(border_cells))` creates a new grid, fills the identified `border_cells` with '2', and sets the remaining cells to '0'.
4. **Restore Original Components:**  `return paint(O, merge(components))` paints the original '1' components back onto the new grid.

## Program Version 4

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) # Extract objects formed by connected '1's
  shifted_grids = (shift(toindices(merge(objs)), (1, 0)), 
                   shift(toindices(merge(objs)), (-1, 0)), 
                   shift(toindices(merge(objs)), (0, 1)), 
                   shift(toindices(merge(objs)), (0, -1)))  # Create four shifted copies of the object indices
  border_cells = set()
  for grid in shifted_grids:
    border_cells = border_cells | (grid - toindices(merge(objs)))
  O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, frozenset(border_cells))  # Fill border cells with '2'
  return paint(O, merge(objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Components:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies connected components of '1's.
2. **Shift and Find Differences:** The code shifts the indices of all '1' cells (using `shift`) in four directions (up, down, left, right) and finds the difference between the shifted indices and the original indices. This difference represents the border cells. 
3. **Create and Fill Canvas:** `O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, frozenset(border_cells))` creates a blank canvas, fills the identified border cells with '2', and sets the rest to '0'.
4. **Restore Components:** `return paint(O, merge(objs))` paints the original '1' components back onto the canvas, finalizing the transformation. 

## Program Version 5

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)  # Find all '1' indices
  border_indices = set()
  for i, j in one_indices:
    for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:  # Check four directions
        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
        if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]):  # Within grid bounds
          if (ni, nj) not in one_indices:
            border_indices.add((ni, nj))
  canvas_grid = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas
  O = fill(canvas_grid, TWO, frozenset(border_indices))  # Fill the border indices with '2'
  return paint(O, toobject(one_indices, I))  # Paint the original '1's back onto the canvas
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1' Cells:** `one_indices = ofcolor(I, ONE)` finds the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **Directional Border Check:** It iterates through each '1' index and checks its four neighboring cells (up, down, left, right). If a neighbor is within the grid boundaries and doesn't contain a '1', it's marked as a border cell.
3. **Prepare and Fill Canvas:**  `canvas_grid = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))` creates a new grid filled with '0's. Then,  `O = fill(canvas_grid, TWO, frozenset(border_indices))` fills the identified border cells in this canvas with '2'.
4. **Restore '1' Components:** `return paint(O, toobject(one_indices, I))` paints the original '1' components back onto the modified canvas, completing the transformation.
