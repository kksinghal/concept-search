## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to involve identifying objects made up of the digit '1' in the input grid and then shifting these objects one cell to the right.  The shifted objects are then represented by the digit '2' in the output grid, while the original positions of the '1' objects are replaced with '0'. The remaining grid cells maintain their original values.

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**

* Two '1' objects are identified: one in the top left corner and another spanning the bottom row.
* Both objects are shifted one cell to the right.
* The shifted objects are now represented by '2'.
* The original '1' positions are replaced with '0'.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**

* Three '1' objects are identified.
* Each object is shifted one cell to the right.
* The shifted objects are now represented by '2'.
* The original '1' positions are replaced with '0'.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**

* Three '1' objects are identified.
* Each object is shifted one cell to the right.
* The shifted objects are now represented by '2'.
* The original '1' positions are replaced with '0'.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Identify '1' objects
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
    ones = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
    # Shift objects right
    shifted = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), ones)
    # Paint shifted objects with '2'
    O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(shifted))
    O = fill(O, 2, toindices(asobject(O)))
    # Combine with original grid, prioritizing existing values
    O = cellwise(I, O, fallback=first(I))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' Objects:** We use `objects` to find connected components of '1's and filter for those objects.
2. **Shift Objects Right:**  Each object is shifted one cell to the right using `shift` and `RIGHT`.
3. **Paint Shifted Objects:** A canvas of '0's is created, and the shifted objects are painted onto it using '2'.
4. **Combine with Original Grid:** The shifted objects are combined with the original grid, prioritizing values from the original grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find indices of '1's
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  # Shift indices right
  shifted_right = mapply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), ones)
  # Create output grid with '2's at shifted indices
  O = fill(canvas(0, shape(I)), 2, intersection(shifted_right, asindices(I)))
  # Overlay original grid, preserving '1's
  O = cellwise(I, O, fallback=0)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Indices of '1's:** Use `ofcolor` to get the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **Shift Indices Right:** Shift each index one position to the right.
3. **Create Output Grid:** Create a blank canvas and fill the shifted indices with '2'.
4. **Overlay Original Grid:** Combine the output grid with the original, keeping the original value unless it's '0'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Create a copy of the input grid
  O = [list(row) for row in I]
  # Iterate through the grid
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])-1):
      # If a cell contains a '1'
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        # Shift the '1' to the right
        O[i][j] = 0
        if j+1 < len(I[0]):
            O[i][j+1] = 2
  # Convert the modified grid back to a tuple of tuples
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a Copy:** Make a mutable copy of the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Shift:** Loop through the grid, and if a cell contains '1', set it to '0' and its right neighbor (if it exists) to '2'.
3. **Convert to Tuple:** Convert the modified grid back to the original immutable format.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Identify ones
    ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
    # Create a blank canvas
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    # Iterate through ones
    for i, j in ones:
        # Shift right, handle boundary condition
        new_j = min(j + 1, len(I[0]) - 1)
        # Paint on the canvas
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, new_j)})
    # Overlay the original grid 
    O = cellwise(I, O, fallback=0)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1's:** Find the indices of cells with '1'.
2. **Create Blank Canvas:** Generate a canvas filled with '0's.
3. **Iterate and Shift:** Loop through the identified '1' indices and calculate their shifted positions, handling boundary conditions.
4. **Paint on Canvas:** Fill the shifted positions on the canvas with '2'.
5. **Overlay Original Grid:** Combine the canvas with the original grid, preserving original values unless '0'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            2 if (i, j - 1) in ofcolor(I, 1) else v
            for j, v in enumerate(row)
        )
        for i, row in enumerate(I)
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Nested Iteration:** Iterate over each cell in the input grid using nested loops.
2. **Conditional Replacement:** For each cell, check if the cell to its left contains a '1' in the input. If so, replace the current cell's value with '2'. Otherwise, retain the original value.
3. **Tuple Reconstruction:** Reconstruct the grid as a tuple of tuples after applying the transformation to each cell.

Each program version offers a distinct approach to achieve the same transformation. Some leverage object recognition, while others directly manipulate indices or iterate through the grid. Choose the version that best suits your preference or adapt them further to suit specific needs.
