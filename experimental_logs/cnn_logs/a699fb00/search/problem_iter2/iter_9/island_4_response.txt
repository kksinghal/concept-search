## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying horizontal sequences of the digit '1' in the input grid and replacing them with the sequence '1 2 1' in the output grid, effectively extending the objects to the right by one cell. All other digits are replaced with '0'. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:**  The sequence '1 1 1' in the fourth row becomes '1 2 1' in the output. The lone '1' in the first row becomes '1 2', with the final '2' cut off as it would extend beyond the grid.
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, horizontal sequences of '1' are extended to the right. Isolated '1's are treated as sequences of length one.
* **Input_2:**  The transformation is applied consistently, handling different object configurations.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)  
  shifted_right = mapply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), ones)
  extended = ones | shifted_right 
  filtered = sfilter(extended, lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] - 1) in ones or (loc[0], loc[1] + 1) in ones)
  O = fill(canvas(0, shape(I)), 1, filtered)
  O = replace(O, 1, 2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1's:** `ones = ofcolor(I, 1)` gets the indices of all '1' cells.
2. **Shift Right:** `shifted_right` creates a set of indices shifted one cell to the right.
3. **Extend:** `extended` combines the original and shifted indices.
4. **Filter:** `filtered` keeps only those indices part of a horizontal sequence (have a '1' to the left or right).
5. **Fill Canvas:**  Creates a canvas of '0's with the input grid's shape and fills '1's at the `filtered` indices.
6. **Replace:** Replaces all '1's with '2's to achieve the desired output pattern. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  extended = mapply(lambda obj: obj | shift(obj, (0, 1)), objs)
  filtered = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(obj, lambda cell: cell[1] in toindices(objs)), extended)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(filtered))
  O = replace(O, 1, 2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(...)` extracts objects (connected components of '1's).
2. **Extend Objects:**  `extended` shifts each object one cell to the right and merges it with the original.
3. **Filter Cells:** `filtered` keeps only those cells within the extended objects that were originally part of an object.
4. **Paint and Replace:** Similar to version 1, paint the filtered cells onto a blank canvas and replace '1's with '2's.

**Program Version 3:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w - 1): 
      if I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 1:
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j), (i, j + 1)})
  return replace(O, 1, 2)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** Iterates through the grid, checking for consecutive '1's in each row.
2. **Fill:** If found, fills the corresponding cells in the output grid with '1'.
3. **Replace:** Replaces all '1's in the output with '2's.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted = hconcat(((0,) * height(I),), trim(hconcat(I, ((0,) * height(I),))))
  O = cellwise(I, shifted, 0)
  O = replace(O, 1, 2)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift and Trim:**  Creates a shifted version of the input grid, moving everything one cell to the right.
2. **Cellwise Comparison:** Compares the original and shifted grids cell by cell. Where both have a '1', the output is set to '1'.
3. **Replace:**  Replaces all '1's with '2's in the output grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  extended = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(toindices(obj) | shift(toindices(obj), (0, 1)), lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < width(I)), objs)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda indices: recolor(1, indices), extended)))
  return replace(O, 1, 2)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  Extract connected components of '1's as objects.
2. **Extend and Filter:**  Shift each object's indices one cell to the right and filter out indices that fall outside the grid boundaries.
3. **Paint and Replace:** Paint the filtered indices onto a blank canvas with color '1' and then replace all '1's with '2's.
