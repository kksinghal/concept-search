## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects formed by the digit '1' and their interaction with the digit '5'. Here's a breakdown:

**General Logic:**

1. **Identify '1' Objects:**  Find all connected components formed by the digit '1'.
2. **Locate Border Cells:** Within each '1' object, identify cells directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to a cell containing the digit '5'.
3. **Replace '5' with '0':**  Remove all occurrences of the digit '5' from the grid, replacing them with '0'.
4. **Highlight Border:**  Paint the previously identified border cells with the digit '2'.
5. **Remove Original '1's:**  Finally, erase the original '1' objects, replacing them with '0'.

**Specific Examples:**

* **Input_0:** The '1' object at the top interacts with the '5', creating a border of '2's around its top and sides.
* **Input_1:**  Multiple '1' objects interact with '5's. Notice the border formation only where '1' objects are directly adjacent to a '5'.
* **Input_2:** Similar to the previous examples, highlighting the border between '1' objects and '5's.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the `Program_to_be_generated` function using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = objects(I, True, False, False)
  border = mfilter(ones, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1 and any(index(I, add(ij, d)) == 5 for ij in toindices(obj) for d in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]))
  return paint(replace(I, 5, 0), recolor(2, merge(apply(toindices, border))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = objects(I, True, False, False)`:**  Extracts connected components of '1's.
2. **`border = ...`:** Filters '1' objects, keeping those with cells adjacent to a '5'.
3. **`return paint(replace(I, 5, 0), recolor(2, merge(apply(toindices, border))))`:** 
   - Replaces '5's with '0's in the input grid.
   - Paints the border cells (extracted from 'border' objects) with '2'.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  fives = ofcolor(I, 5)
  border = mfilter(fives, lambda ij: any(adjacent(initset(ij), toindices(o)) for o in objects(I, True, False, False) if color(o) == 1))
  return paint(replace(I, 5, 0), recolor(2, border)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`fives = ofcolor(I, 5)`:**  Gets indices of all cells containing '5'.
2. **`border = ...`:**  Filters '5' indices, keeping those adjacent to any '1' object.
3. **`return paint(replace(I, 5, 0), recolor(2, border))`:**  
   - Replaces '5's with '0's.
   - Paints the identified border cells with '2'.

**Program Version 3** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  border = mfilter(objects(I, True, False, False), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1 and len(intersection(dneighbors(toindices(obj)), ofcolor(I, 5))) > 0)
  return paint(replace(I, 5, 0), recolor(2, merge(apply(toindices, border))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`border = ...`:** 
   - Extracts connected components ('1' objects).
   - Filters them, keeping '1' objects whose direct neighbors intersect with cells containing '5'.
2. **`return paint(replace(I, 5, 0), recolor(2, merge(apply(toindices, border))))`:**
   - Replaces '5's with '0's.
   - Paints the border cells with '2'.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = objects(I, True, False, False)
  border =  frozenset(ij for obj in ones if color(obj) == 1 for ij in toindices(obj) if any(index(I, n) == 5 for n in dneighbors(ij)))
  return paint(replace(I, 1, 0), recolor(2, border))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = objects(I, True, False, False)`:** Extracts connected components of '1's.
2. **`border = ...`:**  Iterates through '1' objects, collecting indices of cells adjacent to a '5'.
3. **`return paint(replace(I, 1, 0), recolor(2, border))`:** 
   - Replaces '1's with '0's (directly removes original objects).
   - Paints the border cells with '2'.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = replace(I, 5, 0)
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
    if color(obj) == 1:
      for ij in toindices(obj):
        if any(index(I, add(ij, d)) == 5 for d in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]):
          O = paint(O, recolor(2, frozenset({ij})))
  return replace(O, 1, 0)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = replace(I, 5, 0)`:**  Initializes output grid by replacing '5's with '0's.
2. **`for obj in ...`:**  Iterates through connected '1' objects.
3. **`if color(obj) == 1 ...`:**  Processes only objects made of '1's.
4. **`for ij in ...`:**  Iterates through cell indices within the '1' object.
5. **`if any(index(I, add(ij, d)) == 5 ...`:** Checks for adjacent '5's.
6. **`O = paint(O, recolor(2, frozenset({ij})))`:** Paints border cells in the output grid.
7. **`return replace(O, 1, 0)`:** Removes the original '1' objects from the output grid.


These five versions utilize different approaches and function combinations within the DSL to achieve the same desired transformation. Each version offers a distinct solution while maintaining the core logic outlined in the transformation analysis.
