## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation adds a '2' to the right of each '1' in the input grid. 

**Example:**

Input:

```
1 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

Output:

```
1 2 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 2 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  right_of_ones = mapply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), ones)
  O = fill(I, 2, intersection(right_of_ones, asindices(I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' positions:** `ones = ofcolor(I, 1)` finds all indices of cells containing '1'.
2. **Calculate positions to the right:**  `right_of_ones = mapply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), ones)` shifts each index in `ones` one position to the right.
3. **Filter out invalid positions:** `intersection(right_of_ones, asindices(I))` ensures only valid indices within the grid's boundaries are kept.
4. **Fill with '2':** `O = fill(I, 2, ...)` fills the calculated valid positions with the digit '2'.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = asobject(I)
  shifted_obj = frozenset((2 if (v == 1 and (i, j+1) in toindices(obj) and next((c for c, (x, y) in obj if x == i and y == j+1), 0) == 0) else v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shifted_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Convert to object:** `obj = asobject(I)` transforms the grid into an object representation.
2. **Conditional replacement:** `shifted_obj` iterates through the object and replaces values based on these conditions:
    - The current value is '1'.
    - The position to its right exists within the object.
    - The position to its right is not already occupied by another digit.
    - If all conditions are met, replace with '2'; otherwise, keep the original value.
3. **Paint onto a blank canvas:** `O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shifted_obj)` creates a blank grid and paints the transformed object onto it.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  shifted = rot270(hconcat(rot90(I), rot90(canvas(0, shape(I)))))
  merged = cellwise(I, shifted, 0)
  O = replace(merged, 1, 2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a shifted copy:**
    - `rot90(I)` rotates the grid 90 degrees.
    - `hconcat(..., rot90(canvas(0, shape(I))))` adds a blank column to the right of the rotated grid.
    - `rot270(...)` rotates the result back 270 degrees, effectively shifting the original content one position to the right. 
2. **Merge with original:** `merged = cellwise(I, shifted, 0)` combines the original and shifted grids, prioritizing the original's values except for empty cells (filled with '0').
3. **Replace '1' with '2':** `O = replace(merged, 1, 2)` changes all occurrences of '1' in the merged grid to '2'.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  right_shifted = shift(ones, (0, 1))
  valid_positions = intersection(right_shifted, asindices(I))
  combined = ones | valid_positions
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(2, combined))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get positions of '1':** `ones = ofcolor(I, 1)` retrieves all indices of cells with '1'.
2. **Shift right:** `right_shifted = shift(ones, (0, 1))` moves each index one position to the right.
3. **Find valid shifted positions:** `valid_positions = intersection(right_shifted, asindices(I))` identifies which shifted positions are within the grid.
4. **Combine original and valid shifted positions:** `combined = ones | valid_positions` creates a set containing both the original '1' positions and the valid shifted positions.
5. **Paint onto a blank canvas:** `O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(2, combined))` creates an empty grid and paints '2' at all positions within the `combined` set.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    def process_row(row):
        new_row = []
        for j, v in enumerate(row):
            if v == 1 and j < len(row) - 1 and row[j + 1] == 0:
                new_row.extend([1, 2])
            else:
                new_row.append(v)
        return new_row

    new_grid = tuple(tuple(process_row(row)) for row in I)
    return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:**  The code iterates through each row in the input grid.
2. **Process each row:**  For every row, it checks each cell and its right neighbor:
    - If the current cell is '1' and the right neighbor is '0', it appends '1' and '2' to the `new_row`.
    - Otherwise, it appends the current cell's value to the `new_row`.
3. **Construct the output grid:** After processing all rows, it constructs the final output grid `new_grid`.
