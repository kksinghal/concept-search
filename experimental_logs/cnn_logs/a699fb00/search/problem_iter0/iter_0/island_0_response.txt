## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (groups of connected '1' digits) within the input grid and adding a '2' digit to the right of each '1' digit within these objects. 

Let's break down the transformation for each example:

**Input_0:**

* **Input:** A single object shaped like a plus sign formed by '1' digits.
* **Output:** The same plus sign object, but now each '1' has a '2' to its right.

**Input_1:**

* **Input:** Three separate horizontal line objects formed by '1' digits.
* **Output:** The same three line objects, with each '1' now accompanied by a '2' on its right.

**Input_2:**

* **Input:**  Three separate horizontal line objects formed by '1' digits.
* **Output:** The same three line objects, with each '1' now accompanied by a '2' on its right.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions for the "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    for value, (i, j) in obj:
      if value == 1:
        I = fill(I, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects formed by connected '1's (excluding background) within the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through Objects and Cells:** The code iterates through each object and then each cell within the object.
3. **Add '2' to the Right:** If the cell value is '1', it fills the cell to the right (i, j+1) with '2'.
4. **Output:** The modified grid `I` is assigned to `O` and returned.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  indices_one = ofcolor(I, 1)
  shifted_indices = shift(indices_one, RIGHT)
  O = fill(I, 2, shifted_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' Indices:**  `indices_one = ofcolor(I, 1)`  finds the indices of all cells containing '1' in grid `I`.
2. **Shift Right:** `shifted_indices = shift(indices_one, RIGHT)` shifts these indices one position to the right.
3. **Fill with '2':** `O = fill(I, 2, shifted_indices)` fills the cells at the shifted indices with the value '2' in the original grid `I`.
4. **Output:** Returns the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** Iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`.
2. **Check for '1' and Fill Right:** If a cell contains '1', it fills the cell to its right in the output grid `O` with '2'.
3. **Output:** Returns the modified grid `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  shifted_grid = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)
  O = cellwise(asobject(I), shifted_grid, 0)
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, ofcolor(O, 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Grid:**  Converts the input grid to an object, shifts it one position to the right, and stores it in `shifted_grid`.
2. **Cellwise Comparison:** Compares the original grid object with the shifted one using `cellwise`. Cells that match remain unchanged, and mismatches are replaced with '0'.
3. **Replace '1's with '2's:** Identifies the indices of remaining '1's and uses `recolor` and `paint` to replace them with '2's.
4. **Output:** Returns the modified grid `O`.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    indices = toindices(obj)
    right_shifted = shift(indices, RIGHT)
    intersection = right_shifted & asindices(I)
    O = fill(O, 2, intersection)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Objects:** Identifies objects formed by '1's in the grid.
2. **Iterate Through Objects:**  For each object:
    * Extracts its indices.
    * Shifts the indices one position to the right.
    * Finds the intersection of the shifted indices with valid grid indices.
    * Fills the intersection indices in the output grid with '2'.
3. **Output:** Returns the modified grid.


Each version utilizes different DSL functions and approaches the transformation from a different perspective, showcasing diverse ways to achieve the desired outcome.
