## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected components of the same digit) within the input grid and inserting the digit '2' to the right of every '1' within these objects. The background (digit '0') remains unchanged.

**Example:**

Input:
```
1 0 1
0 1 0
```

Output:
```
1 2 1
0 1 2
```

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, True, False)
  new_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    new_obj = set()
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      new_obj.add((v, (i, j)))
      if v == 1:
        new_obj.add((2, (i, j + 1)))
    new_objs.add(frozenset(new_obj))
  O = paint(I, merge(new_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, True, False)` identifies all objects in the grid, allowing for diagonal connections and including background objects.
2. **Iterate and Modify:** The code iterates through each object and its cells. If a cell contains '1', it adds a new cell with value '2' to the right of it.
3. **Reconstruct Grid:** The modified objects are merged, and then painted onto the original grid to generate the output.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  indices_1 = ofcolor(I, 1)
  shifted_indices = shift(indices_1, RIGHT)
  O = I
  for i, j in shifted_indices:
    if 0 <= j < width(I):
      O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1' Cells:** `ofcolor(I, 1)` identifies all indices containing the digit '1'.
2. **Shift Right:** `shift(indices_1, RIGHT)` shifts these indices one position to the right.
3. **Fill with '2':**  The code iterates through the shifted indices and fills the corresponding cells in the grid with '2', ensuring it stays within grid boundaries.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = partition(I)
  modified_grid = I
  for obj in objs:
    for value, (i, j) in obj:
      if value == 1 and j < width(I) - 1:
        modified_grid = fill(modified_grid, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
  return modified_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition by Value:** `partition(I)` divides the grid into objects based on identical values.
2. **Iterate and Modify:** The code iterates through each object and its cells. If a cell contains '1' and is not on the right edge, it fills the cell to its right with '2'.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  def modify_object(obj):
    return frozenset({(v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj} | {(2, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if v == 1 and j < width(I) - 1})
  
  objs = objects(I, True, True, False)
  modified_objs = apply(modify_object, objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(modified_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Modification Function:** `modify_object(obj)` takes an object and returns a modified version with '2's added to the right of '1's.
2. **Apply to Objects:** The `apply` function applies this modification to all objects identified in the grid.
3. **Reconstruct Output:** The modified objects are merged and painted back onto the grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  def process_row(row, j):
    return tuple(2 if (j > 0 and row[j-1] == 1) or (j < len(row)-1 and row[j+1] == 1) else v for j, v in enumerate(row))

  modified_grid = tuple(process_row(row, j) for j, row in enumerate(I))
  return modified_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Row Processing:** `process_row(row, j)` takes a row and its index. It places a '2' at index `j` if the preceding or succeeding element in the row is a '1'.
2. **Apply to Rows:**  The code applies this row processing function to every row in the grid, effectively inserting '2's to the right of '1's in horizontally connected objects.
