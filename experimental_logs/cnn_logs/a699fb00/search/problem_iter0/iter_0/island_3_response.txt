## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid and inserting a new digit (2) to the right of each original digit within the object, effectively stretching the object horizontally. The background (digit 0) remains unchanged.

**Example:**

Input:

```
1 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

Output:

```
1 2 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 2 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

Here, each '1' in the input grid is part of an object. In the output, a '2' is inserted to the right of each '1', expanding the object horizontally.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  new_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    new_obj = set()
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      new_obj.add((v, (i, j)))
      new_obj.add((2, (i, j + 1)))
    new_objs.add(frozenset(new_obj))
  O = paint(I, merge(new_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `fgpartition(I)` identifies all objects (excluding the background) in the input grid `I`.
2. **Stretch Objects:** For each object:
    -  Iterate through its cells `(v, (i, j))`.
    - Add the original cell and a new cell with value '2' to its right `(2, (i, j + 1))` to `new_obj`.
3. **Paint to Output:**
    - Merge all the `new_objs` using `merge`.
    - Paint the merged object onto the original grid `I` using `paint`.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objs)
  recolored_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(2, obj), shifted_objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(objs | recolored_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1, `objects` function is used to identify objects.
2. **Shift and Recolor:**
    - `shifted_objs`: Each object is shifted one cell to the right using `shift(obj, RIGHT)`.
    - `recolored_objs`: Each shifted object is recolored to have the value '2' using `recolor(2, obj)`.
3. **Paint to Output:**
    -  The original objects and the recolored, shifted objects are merged using `merge(objs | recolored_objs)`.
    -  The merged object is painted onto the input grid `I` using `paint`.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] != 0 and I[i][j + 1] == 0:
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Fill:** This version iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`.
2. **Conditional Fill:** If a cell contains a non-zero value and its right neighbor is zero, it fills the right neighbor with '2' using `fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})`.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  indices = asindices(I)
  right_indices = mapply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), indices)
  filtered_indices = sfilter(right_indices, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 0 and index(I, subtract(loc, RIGHT)) != 0)
  O = fill(I, 2, filtered_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Indices:** `asindices(I)` retrieves all cell indices of the input grid.
2. **Calculate Right Indices:** `right_indices` calculates the indices of cells immediately to the right of each cell in the grid.
3. **Filter Indices:**  `filtered_indices` keeps only the right indices that satisfy the following:
    - They are within the grid bounds (`0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0])`).
    - The cell at the right index contains a zero (`I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 0`).
    - The cell to the left of the right index contains a non-zero value (`index(I, subtract(loc, RIGHT)) != 0`).
4. **Fill Grid:**  Finally, it fills the cells at the `filtered_indices` with the value '2' using `fill`.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  new_objs = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((v, add((i, j), (0, v))) for v, (i, j) in obj), objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(new_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions, `fgpartition(I)` identifies objects in the grid.
2. **Shift Based on Value:** For each object:
    - Iterate through its cells `(v, (i, j))`.
    - Calculate the new index by adding the object's value `v` to the column index `j`: `add((i, j), (0, v))`.
    -  Create a new object with the original value `v` at the new index.
3. **Paint to Output:**
    - Merge the new objects using `merge(new_objs)`.
    -  Paint the merged object onto the input grid `I` using `paint`.

Each version utilizes different DSL functions and logic to achieve the same transformation. Choose the version that you find most readable and efficient for your use case.
