## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid and extending them to the right by one cell. The new cell takes the value '2' as long as the original object is not on the rightmost edge of the grid and the expansion doesn't collide with another existing object.

**Example:**

In Input_0, the top-left '1' object gets extended to the right with a '2'.  Similarly, the bottom-left '1' object also extends.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expanded_objs = frozenset({
      (2, (i, j + 1))
      for obj in objs
      for i, j in toindices(obj)
      if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and (i, j + 1) not in toindices(merge(objs))
  })
  O = paint(I, merge(objs | expanded_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identify all objects in the grid.
2. **`expanded_objs = ...`:** Generate a set of new cells representing the expansion.  For each object, iterate over its cells. If a cell is not on the rightmost edge (`j < len(I[0]) - 1`) and the cell to its right is not part of any object (`(i, j + 1) not in toindices(merge(objs))`), add a new cell with value '2' to the `expanded_objs` set.
3. **`O = paint(I, merge(objs | expanded_objs))`:** Paint both the original objects and the expanded cells onto the input grid to get the final output.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  shifted_right = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, 1)), objs)
  valid_expansion = frozenset({
      loc 
      for obj, shifted in zip(objs, shifted_right)
      for loc in toindices(shifted) 
      if loc[1] < len(I[0]) and (loc[0], loc[1] - 1) in toindices(obj) and loc not in toindices(merge(objs))
  })
  expanded_objs = frozenset({
      (2, loc) for loc in valid_expansion
  })
  O = paint(I, merge(objs | expanded_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identify all objects in the grid.
2. **`shifted_right = ...`:** Calculate the shifted version of each object one cell to the right.
3. **`valid_expansion = ...`:** For each original object and its shifted counterpart, find the cells in the shifted object that are valid expansions: within the grid, connected to the original object, and not overlapping with any existing object.
4. **`expanded_objs = ...`:** Create a new object representation from the valid expansion locations, assigning the value '2'.
5. **`O = paint(I, merge(objs | expanded_objs))`:**  Paint the original objects and the expanded objects onto the input grid to create the output.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and (i, j + 1) not in toindices(merge(objs)):
        O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j + 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identify all objects in the input grid.
2. **`O = I`:** Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
3. **Iterate through objects:** For each object in the `objs` set:
   - **Iterate through object cells:**  For each cell `(i, j)` within the object:
     - **Check for valid expansion:** If the cell is not on the rightmost edge (`j < len(I[0]) - 1`) and the cell to its right is not part of any object (`(i, j + 1) not in toindices(merge(objs))`):
       - **Paint expansion:**  Paint a new cell with value '2' at the expansion location `(i, j + 1)` on the output grid `O`.
4. **`return O`:** Return the modified output grid.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expansion_area = difference(
      merge(apply(lambda obj: backdrop(shift(obj, (0, 1))), objs)),
      merge(apply(backdrop, objs))
  )
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: obj | recolor(2, intersection(expansion_area, toindices(shift(obj, (0, 1))))), objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identify all objects in the grid.
2. **`expansion_area = ...`:**  Calculate the valid expansion area. It's the difference between the backdrop of all objects shifted right and the backdrop of the original objects.
3. **`expanded_objs = ...`:**  For each object, find the intersection of its shifted backdrop with the valid expansion area. Recolor these intersected cells with '2' and merge them with the original object.
4. **`O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))`:** Paint the expanded objects onto the input grid to get the final output.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expanded_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if j < len(I[0]) - 1:
        new_cell = (i, j + 1)
        if new_cell not in toindices(merge(objs)):
          expanded_objs.add((2, new_cell))
  O = paint(I, objs | frozenset(expanded_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identify all objects in the input grid.
2. **`expanded_objs = set()`:** Initialize an empty set to store the expanded cells.
3. **Iterate through objects:** Loop through each object in the `objs` set:
   - **Iterate through object cells:** Loop through each cell `(i, j)` in the current object:
     - **Check if within bounds:** If the cell's column index `j` is less than the grid's width minus 1 (`j < len(I[0]) - 1`):
        - **Calculate new cell location:**  Determine the location of the potential expanded cell `(i, j + 1)`.
        - **Check if new cell is empty:**  If the new cell's location is not part of any existing object (`new_cell not in toindices(merge(objs))`):
            - **Add new cell to expanded_objs:** Add a tuple `(2, new_cell)` representing the expanded cell with value '2' to the `expanded_objs` set.
4. **`O = paint(I, objs | frozenset(expanded_objs))`:**  Paint both the original objects and the expanded cells (converted to a frozenset) onto the input grid to obtain the final output grid.
5. **`return O`:** Return the modified output grid.
