## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying all occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid and placing a '2' immediately to the right of each '1'. If a '1' is located at the right edge of the grid, no '2' is placed.

**Example:**

Input:

```
1 0 1
0 1 0
```

Output:

```
1 2 1
0 1 2
```

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:** (Inspired by shifting indices and painting objects)

```python
def solve(I):
  shifted_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: loc[1]+1 < len(I[0]))
  shifted_obj = frozenset((2, (i, j+1)) for i, j in shifted_indices if I[i][j] == 1)
  O = paint(I, shifted_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_indices`**:  Identifies valid indices where a '2' can be placed, excluding the rightmost column.
2. **`shifted_obj`**: Creates an object containing the value '2' at the indices to the right of every '1' in the input grid.
3. **`paint(I, shifted_obj)`**: Paints the `shifted_obj` onto the original grid `I`, effectively placing the '2's.

**Version 2:** (Inspired by horizontal concatenation and splitting)

```python
def solve(I):
  h = height(I)
  split_grid = hsplit(I, width(I))
  modified_grid = []
  for row in split_grid:
    modified_row = []
    for i, v in enumerate(row[0]):
      modified_row.append(v)
      if v == 1 and i < len(row[0]) - 1:
        modified_row.append(2)
    modified_grid.append(tuple(modified_row))
  O = tuple(tuple(0 for _ in range(width(I))) for _ in range(h - len(modified_grid))) + tuple(modified_grid)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`hsplit(I, width(I))`**: Splits the grid into individual columns.
2. **Loop:** Iterates through each column, appending a '2' after each '1' unless it's the last element of the column.
3. **Concatenation**:  Reconstructs the grid by concatenating the modified columns.

**Version 3:** (Inspired by using `apply` and lambda functions)

```python
def solve(I):
  O = apply(lambda row: tuple(v if j == len(row) or v != 1 else (v, 2)[j < len(row) - 1] for j, v in enumerate(row)), I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`apply(lambda... , I)`**: Applies a lambda function to each row of the input grid.
2. **Lambda Function**: For each element in the row, checks if it's a '1' and not the last element. If true, it replaces the element with a tuple (1, 2), effectively inserting a '2'. Otherwise, it keeps the original element.

**Version 4:** (Inspired by using `product` and direct index manipulation)

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = tuple(tuple(2 if (i, j-1) in product(range(h), range(w)) and I[i][j-1] == 1 and j > 0 else I[i][j] for j in range(w)) for i in range(h))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`product(range(h), range(w))`**: Creates all possible index pairs for the grid.
2. **Nested Loop**: Iterates through each cell of the grid.
3. **Conditional**: If the cell is not in the first column and the cell to its left contains a '1', it places a '2' in the current cell. Otherwise, it keeps the original cell value.

**Version 5:** (Inspired by creating a separate object for '2's)

```python
def solve(I):
  two_indices = frozenset((i, j+1) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, v in enumerate(row) if v == 1 and j < len(row) - 1)
  twos = frozenset((2, (i, j)) for i, j in two_indices)
  O = paint(I, twos)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`two_indices`**:  Identifies all indices where a '2' needs to be placed.
2. **`twos`**: Creates an object containing the value '2' and the `two_indices`.
3. **`paint(I, twos)`**: Paints the `twos` object onto the original grid. 

These are five distinct versions of the program that accomplish the required transformation. They showcase different approaches using the provided DSL, highlighting the flexibility and expressive power of the language.
