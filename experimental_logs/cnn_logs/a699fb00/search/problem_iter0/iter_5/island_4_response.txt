## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently involves adding a '2' digit adjacent to every '1' digit in the input grid. The position of the '2' relative to the '1' appears to be based on the overall shape formed by the '1' digits:

* **Horizontal lines of '1's:** The '2's are added to the right and left ends of the line.
* **Vertical lines of '1's:**  The '2's are added above and below the line.
* **Single '1's:** The '2's are added both horizontally and vertically, effectively creating a plus sign shape.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  horizontal_neighbors = mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + 1), (loc[0], loc[1] - 1)}, ones)
  vertical_neighbors = mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0] + 1, loc[1]), (loc[0] - 1, loc[1])}, ones)
  O = fill(fill(I, 2, horizontal_neighbors), 2, vertical_neighbors)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' locations:**  `ones = ofcolor(I, 1)` gets all indices of '1's in the grid.
2. **Generate neighbor locations:**  
    * `horizontal_neighbors` finds indices to the left and right of each '1'.
    * `vertical_neighbors` finds indices above and below each '1'.
3. **Fill neighbors with '2':** The `fill` function is applied twice: first to add '2's at horizontal neighbors, then at vertical neighbors, effectively handling all cases.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    twos =  mapply(lambda obj:  
                        (mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + 1), (loc[0], loc[1] - 1)}, toindices(obj))
                        if hline(obj) else
                        mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0] + 1, loc[1]), (loc[0] - 1, loc[1])}, toindices(obj)))
                        if vline(obj) else
                        mapply(lambda loc: dneighbors(loc), toindices(obj)), objs)
    O = fill(I, 2, twos)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objs = objects(I, True, False, True)` extracts objects formed by connected '1's.
2. **Apply transformation based on shape:** For each object:
    * **Horizontal Line:** Add '2's to the left and right.
    * **Vertical Line:** Add '2's to the top and bottom.
    * **Single '1':** Add '2's to all directly adjacent cells.
3. **Fill grid:** Combine the generated '2' locations (`twos`) with the original grid.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  shifted_right = shift(ones, (0, 1))
  shifted_left = shift(ones, (0, -1))
  shifted_up = shift(ones, (-1, 0))
  shifted_down = shift(ones, (1, 0))
  twos =  shifted_right | shifted_left | shifted_up | shifted_down 
  O = fill(I, 2, twos)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1's:** Find the indices of all '1' digits in the input grid.
2. **Shift indices:** Create four new sets of indices by shifting the original '1' indices one position to the right, left, up, and down.
3. **Combine shifted indices:** Merge all shifted indices into a single set, representing the locations where '2's should be placed.
4. **Fill with '2's:**  Fill the input grid with '2's at the specified locations.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
  padded_grid = canvas(0, (height(I) + 2, width(I) + 2))
  padded_grid = paint(padded_grid, shift(asobject(I), (1, 1)))
  ones = ofcolor(padded_grid, 1)
  neighbors = mapply(dneighbors, ones)
  twos = neighbors - ones
  O = crop(paint(padded_grid, recolor(2, twos)), (1, 1), shape(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Pad the grid:** Create a larger grid with a border of '0's around the input grid.
2. **Shift and paint input:** Place the input grid into the center of the padded grid.
3. **Find '1' neighbors:** Identify all direct neighbors of '1' digits within the padded grid.
4. **Remove overlapping '1's:**  Subtract the original '1' locations from the neighbor set, leaving only locations for '2's. 
5. **Fill and crop:** Paint the '2's onto the padded grid, then crop the grid back to the original size.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
    def apply_pattern(grid, loc):
        grid = branch(index(grid, add(loc, UP)) == 0, fill(grid, 2, add(loc, UP)), grid)
        grid = branch(index(grid, add(loc, DOWN)) == 0, fill(grid, 2, add(loc, DOWN)), grid)
        grid = branch(index(grid, add(loc, LEFT)) == 0, fill(grid, 2, add(loc, LEFT)), grid)
        grid = branch(index(grid, add(loc, RIGHT)) == 0, fill(grid, 2, add(loc, RIGHT)), grid)
        return grid

    O = I
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I)):
            if index(I, (i, j)) == 1:
                O = apply_pattern(O, (i, j))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through grid:** Loop through each cell of the input grid.
2. **Check for '1':** If a cell contains a '1', proceed to apply the transformation.
3. **Apply pattern:** For each direction (up, down, left, right), check if the neighboring cell is empty ('0'). If so, fill it with a '2'. 
4. **Update grid:**  Modify the grid within the loop, ensuring each '1' gets its surrounding '2's.

These five program versions provide diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformation using the DSL.  Each leverages different functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL for solving spatial reasoning tasks.
