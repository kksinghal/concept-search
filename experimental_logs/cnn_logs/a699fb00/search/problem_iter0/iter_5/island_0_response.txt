## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids involves placing the digit '2' to the right of every occurrence of the digit '1'. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**

- The '1' at (0,0) results in a '2' at (0,1)
- The '1' at (0,2) results in a '2' at (0,3)
- The '1' at (3,1) results in a '2' at (3,2)
- The '1' at (3,3) results in a '2' at (3,4)

**Input_1 - Output_1:**

- The pattern repeats with '2's placed to the right of all '1's in the grid.

**Input_2 - Output_2:**

- Similarly, '2's are placed to the right of all '1's in the grid.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_indices = mapply(lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT), asindices(I))
  valid_indices = sfilter(shifted_indices, lambda loc: contained(subtract(loc, RIGHT), asindices(I)))
  filtered_indices = sfilter(valid_indices, lambda loc: index(I, subtract(loc, RIGHT)) == 1)
  O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, filtered_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **shifted_indices:**  Calculates all indices shifted one position to the right.
2. **valid_indices:** Filters out indices that would fall outside the grid boundaries when shifted right.
3. **filtered_indices:** Further filters the valid indices to keep only those where the original index (before the shift) contained a '1'.
4. **O:** Paints the value '2' onto the input grid at the filtered indices, effectively placing a '2' to the right of every '1'.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  right_neighbor_indices = apply(lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT), ones_indices)
  valid_indices = sfilter(right_neighbor_indices, lambda loc: contained(loc, asindices(I)))
  O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, valid_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **ones_indices:**  Extracts the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **right_neighbor_indices:**  Calculates the indices to the right of each '1'.
3. **valid_indices:** Filters out indices that fall outside the grid boundaries.
4. **O:**  Paints the value '2' onto the input grid at the valid indices.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        O = paint(asobject(O), recolor(2, {(i, j + 1)})) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterative Approach:** This version iterates through each cell of the grid.
2. **Conditional Painting:** If a cell contains '1', it paints a '2' to its right neighbor, effectively achieving the desired transformation.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones_obj = objects(I, True, False, True)
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), ones_obj) 
  valid_indices = sfilter(toindices(merge(shifted_objs)), lambda loc: contained(loc, asindices(I)))
  O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, valid_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **ones_obj:** Extracts objects composed of '1's.
2. **shifted_objs:**  Shifts each object one position to the right.
3. **valid_indices:** Extracts the indices from the shifted objects and filters out any that fall outside the grid boundaries.
4. **O:** Paints the value '2' onto the input grid at the valid indices.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_neighbor_is_valid(loc):
    i, j = loc
    return j + 1 < width(I)

  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  filtered_indices = sfilter(ones_indices, right_neighbor_is_valid)
  shifted_indices = apply(lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT), filtered_indices) 
  O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, shifted_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **right_neighbor_is_valid:**  Defines a function to check if an index has a valid right neighbor within the grid.
2. **ones_indices:**  Extracts the indices of cells containing '1'.
3. **filtered_indices:**  Keeps only the '1' indices that have a valid right neighbor.
4. **shifted_indices:**  Calculates the indices to the right of the filtered indices.
5. **O:**  Paints the value '2' onto the input grid at the shifted indices.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches and function combinations from the DSL to achieve the same transformation, ensuring diversity in the proposed solutions.
