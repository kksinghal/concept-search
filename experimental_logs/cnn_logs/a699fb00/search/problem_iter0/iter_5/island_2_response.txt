## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending all horizontal sequences of '1's in the input grid by adding a '2' to their right end, unless the '1' is already at the right edge of the grid. 

* **Input_0:** The '1's at (0,0) and (0,2) are extended to the right with a '2'. The other '1's are either not part of a horizontal sequence or at the edge. 
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, horizontal '1' sequences are extended. Notice the '1' at (6,6) is not extended as it's at the edge.
* **Input_2:**  The pattern continues, demonstrating the rule consistently applies across different inputs.


## Program_to_be_generated:

### Program Version 1: 

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_if_not_at_edge(v, loc):
    i, j = loc
    return (2, (i, j + 1)) if j + 1 < len(I[0]) and v == 1 else None
  return paint(I, asobject(I) | mfilter(prapply(extend_if_not_at_edge, I, asindices(I)), identity))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_if_not_at_edge(v, loc)`:** This helper function checks if a cell `(v, loc)` should be extended. It returns `(2, (i, j + 1))` (the extension cell) if the cell's value `v` is 1 and it's not on the right edge of the grid. Otherwise, it returns `None`.
2. **`prapply(extend_if_not_at_edge, I, asindices(I))`:** Applies the `extend_if_not_at_edge` function to each cell of the grid `I`, generating a set of potential extension cells (some will be `None`).
3. **`mfilter(..., identity)`:** Filters out the `None` values from the previous step, leaving only the valid extension cells.
4. **`asobject(I) | ...`:** Combines the original object representation of the grid `I` with the set of extension cells.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the combined set of cells onto the original grid `I`, effectively adding the '2' extensions.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_right(row):
    extended_row = list(row)
    for j in range(len(row) - 1):
      if row[j] == 1:
        extended_row[j+1] = 2
    return tuple(extended_row)
  return tuple(extend_right(row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_right(row)`:** This function takes a single row of the grid as input. It iterates through the row and if it encounters a '1', it sets the value of the cell to the right to '2'. 
2. The main function then applies `extend_right` to each row of the input grid `I` and returns the transformed grid. 

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(2 if j > 0 and row[j-1] == 1 else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested list comprehensions for a more compact solution. It iterates through each cell `v` at index `j` in each row. If the cell to the left (`j > 0`) is a '1', it replaces the current cell value with '2'. Otherwise, it keeps the original value.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def extend_sequence(grid, i, j):
        if j + 1 < len(grid[0]) and grid[i][j] == 1:
            grid[i][j+1] = 2
        return grid
    new_grid = [list(row) for row in I]  # Make a mutable copy
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            new_grid = extend_sequence(new_grid, i, j)
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_sequence(grid, i, j)`:**  This helper function takes the grid and the current cell indices as input. It checks if the current cell contains a '1' and if it's not on the right edge. If so, it changes the value of the cell to the right to '2'.
2. The main function iterates through every cell in the grid and applies the `extend_sequence` function.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_row(row):
    return tuple(v if (j == len(row) - 1 or v != 1) else (v, 2) for j, v in enumerate(row))
  return tuple(tuple(v for v in r if v != 2) for r in apply(process_row, I)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`process_row(row)`:** This function takes a row as input and iterates over its elements. If an element is '1' and not the last element in the row, it replaces it with a tuple `(1, 2)`, effectively inserting a '2' after the '1'. Otherwise, it keeps the original element.
2. The main function applies `process_row` to each row in the grid. Then it flattens the resulting tuples by removing the inserted '2's if they were not preceded by a '1', achieving the desired output. 

These five versions showcase distinct approaches to solve the given problem using the provided DSL, demonstrating the flexibility and diverse problem-solving capabilities.
