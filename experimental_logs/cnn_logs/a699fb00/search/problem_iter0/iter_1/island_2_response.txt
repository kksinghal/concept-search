## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (clusters of the same digit) and adding a '2' to the right of each '1' within those objects. 

**Let's analyze each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 to Output_0:** 
    * The '1's at (0,0) and (0,2) both get a '2' added to their right.
    * The '1's at (3,1) and (3,3) get a '2' added to their right.

* **Input_1 to Output_1:**
    * All horizontal sequences of '1 0 1' are transformed to '1 2 1'.

* **Input_2 to Output_2:** 
    * Similar to previous examples, '1 0 1' sequences become '1 2 1'.
    * Note how the transformation only affects digits within the same object. Isolated '1's remain unchanged.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions, drawing inspiration from the provided examples but aiming for perfect accuracy:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, True, False) # Find all objects in the input grid
  new_objs = set() # Initialize a set to store modified objects
  for obj in objs: # Loop through each object
    new_obj = set(obj) # Initialize the modified object as a copy of the original
    for v, (i, j) in obj:  # Loop through each cell in the object
      if v == 1:  # If the cell value is 1
        h, w = len(I), len(I[0]) # Get the height and width of the grid
        if j + 1 < w and (1, (i, j + 1)) in obj: # Check if the cell to the right exists and is part of the same object
          new_obj.add((2, (i, j + 1))) # Add a 2 to the right of the current cell
    new_objs.add(frozenset(new_obj)) # Add the modified object to the set of new objects
  O = paint(I, merge(new_objs)) # Paint the modified objects onto a copy of the input grid
  return O # Return the modified grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, True, False)` identifies connected components (objects) in the grid. 
2. **Iterate & Modify:** For each object, the code adds a '2' to the right of each '1' if that right cell is part of the same object.
3. **Reconstruct:** Finally, it paints the modified objects onto a copy of the input grid, resulting in the desired output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices = ofcolor(I, 1) # Get indices of all cells with value 1
  shifted_indices = shift(indices, RIGHT) # Shift the indices one step to the right
  common_indices = intersection(indices, shifted_indices) # Find the intersection of the original and shifted indices
  new_cells = recolor(2, common_indices) # Create new cells with value 2 at the common indices
  O = paint(I, new_cells) # Paint the new cells onto the input grid
  return O # Return the modified grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1's:** `ofcolor(I, 1)` identifies all indices containing '1'.
2. **Shift and Intersect:** The indices are shifted right, and the intersection with the original indices is found. This identifies '1's with another '1' immediately to their right.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** These identified indices are recolored to '2' and painted onto the input grid to produce the output.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, shift(I, RIGHT), 0) # Perform cellwise comparison and replacement
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages the `cellwise` function for a concise solution:

1. **Shift and Compare:** It shifts the entire grid to the right and compares it cell-by-cell with the original.
2. **Replace:** If both the original and shifted cells contain '1', `cellwise` places a '2' in the corresponding output cell. Otherwise, it defaults to '0'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Create an empty canvas with the same shape as the input
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v == 1 and j + 1 < len(row) and I[i][j+1] == 1:
        O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j+1))})
      else:
        O = paint(O, {(v, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through the grid and constructs the output grid cell by cell:

1. **Empty Canvas:** It starts with an empty canvas of the same size as the input.
2. **Iterate and Paint:** It iterates through each cell, copying the original value unless it encounters a '1' followed by another '1'. In that case, it paints a '2' at the position of the second '1' and continues.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0]) # Get the height and width of the input grid
  O = [list(row) for row in I] # Create a mutable copy of the input grid
  for i in range(h): # Iterate over rows
    for j in range(w - 1): # Iterate over columns, excluding the last one
      if O[i][j] == 1 and O[i][j + 1] == 1: # If two consecutive '1's are found
        O[i][j + 1] = 2 # Replace the second '1' with a '2'
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O) # Return the modified grid as a tuple of tuples
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly modifies a mutable copy of the input grid for a more efficient approach:

1. **Mutable Copy:** It creates a mutable copy of the input grid using nested lists.
2. **Direct Modification:** It iterates through the grid and directly replaces the second '1' in each '1 1' sequence with a '2'.
3. **Return as Tuple:** Finally, it converts the modified nested lists back to a tuple of tuples to maintain data consistency.


These five versions showcase different approaches to achieve the desired transformation, each with its strengths and weaknesses in terms of code complexity, readability, and computational efficiency.
