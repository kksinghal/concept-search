## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves highlighting the cells to the right of cells with value '1' with value '2'.  Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

- The '1' cells at (0,0), (0,2), (3,1), and (3,3) remain unchanged.
- New '2' cells are added to the right of these '1' cells, at positions (0,1), (0,3), (3,2), and (3,4).

**Input_1:**

- This input has multiple horizontally aligned pairs of '1' cells.
- The transformation consistently adds a '2' to the right of each '1', creating sequences like "1 2 1".

**Input_2:**

- This input demonstrates the transformation applies even when '1' cells are scattered.
- Each '1' cell consistently gets a '2' added to its right.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" utilizing the DSL functions:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grid = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)
  O = cellwise(asobject(I), shifted_grid, 0)
  O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, ofcolor(O, 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_grid = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)`:** Creates an object representation of the grid shifted one cell to the right.
2. **`O = cellwise(asobject(I), shifted_grid, 0)`:** Performs a cell-by-cell comparison between the original and shifted grids. If both cells have the same value, that value is kept; otherwise, it's replaced by '0'. This effectively identifies positions where a value is followed by the same value to its right.
3. **`O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, ofcolor(O, 1)))`:** Overlays the original grid onto the result from step 2. Then, it recolors all cells with value '1' in the intermediate result to '2'. This highlights the desired cells.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == 1)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == 1)`:** Identifies indices where the cell to the right contains a '1'.
2. **`recolor(2, ...)`:** Recolors the identified indices to '2'.
3. **`paint(asobject(I), ...)`:** Overlays the recolored indices onto the original grid. 

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = objects(I, True, False, True)
  twos = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), ones)
  O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, merge(toindices(twos))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Extracts objects from the grid, treating each '1' cell as a separate object.
2. **`twos = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), ones)`:** Shifts each '1' object one cell to the right.
3. **`O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, merge(toindices(twos))))`:** Merges the indices of the shifted objects, recolors them to '2', and paints them onto the original grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid as a copy of the input.
2. **Iterate through the grid:** The nested loops traverse each cell of the grid.
3. **`if I[i][j] == 1:`:**  If a cell contains '1', the code proceeds to highlight the cell to its right.
4. **`O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})`:** Fills the cell to the right (i, j+1) with the value '2' in the output grid.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  right_shifted = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for v, (i, j) in right_shifted:
    if index(I, (i, j-1)) == 1:
      O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})
    else:
      O = fill(O, v, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`right_shifted = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)`:** Creates an object representation of the grid shifted one cell to the right.
2. **`O = canvas(0, shape(I))`:** Initializes an empty canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3. **Iterate through shifted grid:** The code iterates through each cell of the right-shifted grid.
4. **`if index(I, (i, j-1)) == 1:`:**  If the cell to the left in the original grid contains '1', the current cell is filled with '2'.
5. **`else:`:** Otherwise, the current cell is filled with its corresponding value from the shifted grid.
