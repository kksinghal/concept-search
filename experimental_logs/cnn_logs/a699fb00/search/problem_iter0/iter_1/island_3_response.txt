## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected components of the same digit) on the input grid and then painting the cell to the right of each object's cell with the value '2'. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**
- Two objects are identified: one at the top and one at the bottom. 
- In both objects, the cells to the right are painted with '2'.

**Input_1:**
- Several objects are identified across the grid.
- For each object, the cell to the right is painted with '2'.

**Input_2:**
- Similar to previous examples, objects are identified, and their right-side cells are painted with '2'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objs)
  filtered_indices = mfilter(shifted_objs, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]))
  O = fill(I, 2, filtered_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies all the objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Shift Right:** `shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objs)` shifts each object one cell to the right.
3. **Filter Valid Indices:** `filtered_indices = mfilter(shifted_objs, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]))` keeps only the shifted indices that fall within the grid boundaries.
4. **Fill with '2':** `O = fill(I, 2, filtered_indices)` fills the cells at the filtered indices (right of the original objects) with the value '2'.
5. **Return Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices = asindices(I)
  right_indices = apply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), indices)
  valid_indices = sfilter(right_indices, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]))
  object_indices = mfilter(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), toindices)
  filtered_indices = sfilter(valid_indices, lambda loc: subtract(loc, RIGHT) in object_indices)
  O = fill(I, 2, filtered_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get All Indices:**  `indices = asindices(I)` gets all cell indices of the input grid.
2. **Calculate Right Indices:**  `right_indices = apply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), indices)` calculates the index of the right cell for every cell in the grid.
3. **Filter Valid Right Indices:**  `valid_indices = sfilter(right_indices, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]))` removes indices that fall outside the grid after shifting right.
4. **Get Object Indices:**  `object_indices = mfilter(objects(...), toindices)`  combines finding objects with extracting their indices.
5. **Filter for Right of Object:**  `filtered_indices = sfilter(valid_indices, lambda loc: subtract(loc, RIGHT) in object_indices)` keeps only those valid right indices where the original (left) cell is part of an object.
6. **Fill with '2':**  `O = fill(I, 2, filtered_indices)` fills the cells at the final filtered indices with '2'.
7. **Return Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)
  new_objs = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((2, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j + 1 < len(I[0])), objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(new_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition into Objects:**  `objs = fgpartition(I)` partitions the grid into objects (excluding background).
2. **Create Shifted Objects with '2':**  `new_objs = mapply(...)` creates new objects where each cell is shifted right and assigned the value '2'. It also ensures the shifted cell is within the grid boundary (`j + 1 < len(I[0])`).
3. **Paint on Grid:** `O = paint(I, merge(new_objs))` merges all the new objects and paints them onto the original grid `I`, overwriting any existing values at those positions.
4. **Return Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned.


**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grid = rot90(I)
  shifted_grid = tuple(tuple(2 if c != 0 else 0 for c in row) for row in shifted_grid)
  shifted_grid = rot270(shifted_grid)
  O = cellwise(I, shifted_grid, 0)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Rotate Grid:** `shifted_grid = rot90(I)` rotates the grid 90 degrees clockwise.
2. **Replace Non-Zero with 2:** `shifted_grid = tuple(tuple(2 if c != 0 else 0 for c in row) for row in shifted_grid)` iterates through the rotated grid and replaces any non-zero value with '2', while keeping '0' as is.
3. **Rotate Back:** `shifted_grid = rot270(shifted_grid)` rotates the grid back to its original orientation.
4. **Cellwise Combination:** `O = cellwise(I, shifted_grid, 0)` combines the original grid `I` and the `shifted_grid` using `cellwise`. If both grids have the same value at a cell, that value is kept; otherwise, '0' is used. This effectively places '2' to the right of original object cells.
5. **Return Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != 0 and j + 1 < len(row):
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** `O = canvas(0, shape(I))` creates an empty grid `O` with the same dimensions as input grid `I`, filled with '0'.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** The code then iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`. If a cell has a non-zero value and its right neighbor is within the grid bounds, it fills the corresponding cell in the output grid `O` with '2'.
3. **Return Output:**  Finally, the modified grid `O` is returned. 


These five versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility of the DSL and providing diverse solutions.
