## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected components) of the same color in the input grid and inserting a new color (2) to the right of each cell within the object, except for the rightmost cell.  

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

* The input contains two objects of '1's. 
* For both objects, a '2' is inserted to the right of each '1', expanding the object horizontally.

**Input_1:**

* The input contains multiple '1' objects of different sizes and positions.
* The same horizontal expansion with '2' is applied to all '1' objects.

**Input_2:**

* Similar to Input_1, the transformation consistently expands all '1' objects horizontally with '2's.


## Code Improvement:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" in the DSL, each with an explanation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Identify all objects in the grid
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((color(obj), (i, j + 1)) if j < rightmost(obj) else (color(obj), (i, j)) for i, j in toindices(obj)), objs) # Expand each object horizontally with '2's
  O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs)) # Paint the expanded objects onto the input grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Identifies all objects in the input grid (`I`).
2. **`expanded_objs = ...`**: This line iterates through each object (`obj`) and generates a new object where a '2' is inserted to the right of each cell, except for the rightmost cell.
3. **`O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))`**: Merges all expanded objects and paints them onto the input grid, effectively applying the transformation.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Identify all objects
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, 1)), objs) # Shift each object one position to the right
  combined_objs = mapply(lambda obj: combine(obj, shift(obj, (0, 1))), objs) # Combine each object with its shifted version
  filtered_objs = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((color(obj), (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if (i, j) in toindices(combined_objs)), objs) # Remove cells that were not originally part of the object
  O = paint(I, merge(filtered_objs)) # Paint the combined objects onto the input grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`**:  Identifies objects in the grid.
2. **`shifted_objs = ...`**: Shifts each object one position to the right.
3. **`combined_objs = ...`**: Combines each original object with its right-shifted version.
4. **`filtered_objs = ...`**:  Removes cells from the combined objects that weren't part of the original objects, ensuring only the desired '2's remain.
5. **`O = paint(I, merge(filtered_objs))`**: Paints the transformed objects onto the input. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Identify objects
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(2, difference(backdrop(shift(obj, (0, 1))), backdrop(obj))), objs) # Calculate the difference between the bounding boxes of the original object and the shifted object, then recolor these cells to '2'
  O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs)) # Paint the expanded objects onto the input grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Identifies objects in the grid.
2. **`expanded_objs = ...`**:  For each object, it calculates the difference between the bounding boxes of the original object and its right-shifted version. This difference represents the new cells to be filled with '2's.
3. **`O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))`**:  Combines all expanded objects and paints them onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Identify objects
  right_edges = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((i, rightmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)), objs) # Find the rightmost edge of each object
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(2, difference(right_edges, toindices(obj))), objs) # For each object, find the difference between its right edge and its original indices, then recolor those cells to '2'
  O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs)) # Paint the expanded objects onto the input grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Identifies objects in the input grid.
2. **`right_edges = ...`**:  Calculates the indices of the rightmost cells for each object.
3. **`expanded_objs = ...`**: For each object, it finds the difference between its right edge indices and its original indices. These difference indices are then recolored to '2'. 
4. **`O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))`**:  Combines the expanded objects and paints them onto the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Identify all objects in the grid
  expansion_area = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((i, j + 1) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j < rightmost(obj)), objs) # Find all indices immediately to the right of each cell in each object, excluding the rightmost cells
  O = fill(I, 2, merge(expansion_area)) # Fill the identified expansion area with '2's
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`**:  Finds all the objects in the grid.
2. **`expansion_area = ...`**:  For every object, this line identifies the indices of the cells immediately to the right of each object's cell, excluding the rightmost cells.
3. **`O = fill(I, 2, merge(expansion_area))`**: Merges all the expansion areas and fills them with the color '2' in the input grid. 


These five versions utilize different DSL functions and approaches to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL.
