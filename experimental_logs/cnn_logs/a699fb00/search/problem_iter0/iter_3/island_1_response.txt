## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending every object in the input grid one cell to the right by adding a '2' cell. However, the extension only occurs if there is available space. If the object is already touching the right edge of the grid, it doesn't extend.

**Example:**

**Input:**
```
1 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

**Output:**
```
1 2 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 2 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

Here, the '1' objects are extended to the right with a '2', but not beyond the grid boundary.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: obj | frozenset(
      (2, (i, j + 1))
      for i, j in toindices(obj)
      if j < rightmost(obj) and (i, j + 1) not in toindices(objs)
  ), objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(objs | expanded_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`expanded_objs = mapply(...)`:** This is the core logic:
   - It iterates through each object (`obj`) in `objs`.
   - For each object, it creates a new set of cells representing the extension:
     - `(2, (i, j + 1))`:  A cell with value '2' located one position to the right of the current cell `(i, j)`.
     - The condition `j < rightmost(obj)` ensures the extension only happens if the current cell is not already on the rightmost edge of the object.
     - The condition `(i, j + 1) not in toindices(objs)` ensures we are not extending into another existing object.
   - The `|` operator combines the original object with its extension.
3. **`O = paint(I, merge(objs | expanded_objs))`:** This part paints the original objects (`objs`) and the expanded objects (`expanded_objs`) onto the input grid (`I`) to generate the output grid (`O`).

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: obj | recolor(2, sfilter(shift(toindices(obj), (0, 1)), lambda loc: loc[1] < len(I[0]) and loc not in toindices(objs))), objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies all objects.
2. **`expanded_objs = mapply(...)`:**
   - It iterates through `objs`.
   - For each `obj`:
     - `shift(toindices(obj), (0, 1))`: Shifts the object's indices one position to the right.
     - `sfilter(...)`: Filters the shifted indices, keeping only those within the grid boundaries (`loc[1] < len(I[0])`) and not overlapping with other objects (`loc not in toindices(objs)`).
     - `recolor(2, ...)`:  Recolors the filtered indices to '2'.
     - `obj | ...`:  Combines the original object with the recoloured extension.
3. **`O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))`:**  Paints the combined objects onto the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    expansion_area = difference(
        mapply(lambda obj: backdrop(shift(obj, (0, 1))), objs),
        mapply(backdrop, objs)
    )
    expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: obj | recolor(2, intersection(expansion_area, toindices(shift(obj, (0, 1))))), objs)
    O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies objects.
2. **`expansion_area = ...`:**  Calculates the valid expansion area:
   - `mapply(lambda obj: backdrop(shift(obj, (0, 1))), objs)`: Finds the backdrop of each object shifted one position to the right.
   - `mapply(backdrop, objs)`: Finds the backdrop of the original objects.
   - `difference(...)`: Subtracts the original backdrops from the shifted backdrops, resulting in the area where expansion is allowed.
3. **`expanded_objs = mapply(...)`:**
   - Iterates through `objs`.
   - For each `obj`:
     - `intersection(...)`: Finds the intersection between the allowed `expansion_area` and the shifted object's indices.
     - `recolor(2, ...)`: Recolors the intersection to '2'.
     - `obj | ...`:  Combines the original object with the recoloured expansion.
4. **`O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))`:**  Paints the combined objects.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expanded_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    expanded_obj = set(obj)
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if j < rightmost(obj) and (i, j + 1) not in toindices(objs):
        expanded_obj.add((2, (i, j + 1)))
    expanded_objs.add(frozenset(expanded_obj))
  O = paint(I, merge(objs | expanded_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses explicit loops for clarity:

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies objects.
2. **`expanded_objs = set()`:**  Initializes an empty set for expanded objects.
3. **Loop through `objs`:**
   - For each `obj`:
     - `expanded_obj = set(obj)`:  Creates a copy of the current object.
     - Loop through the indices `(i, j)` of the `obj`:
       - If `j` is not at the rightmost edge and the cell to the right is empty (`(i, j + 1) not in toindices(objs)`):
         - Add a new cell `(2, (i, j + 1))` to `expanded_obj`.
     - Add the `expanded_obj` to `expanded_objs`.
4. **`O = paint(I, merge(objs | expanded_objs))`:**  Paints the combined objects.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  shifted_right = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, 1)), objs)
  valid_expansion = mapply(lambda obj, shifted: sfilter(shifted, lambda loc: loc[1] < len(I[0]) and loc not in toindices(objs - {obj})), objs, shifted_right)
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj, valid: obj | recolor(2, valid), objs, valid_expansion)
  O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies objects.
2. **`shifted_right = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, 1)), objs)`:**  Shifts all objects one position to the right.
3. **`valid_expansion = mapply(...)`:**  Determines valid expansion cells:
   - It iterates through `objs` and their corresponding `shifted` counterparts.
   - For each `obj`:
     - `sfilter(...)`:  Filters the `shifted` object's indices, keeping those within grid boundaries (`loc[1] < len(I[0])`) and not overlapping with other objects (`loc not in toindices(objs - {obj})`). Notice that we exclude the current `obj` from `objs` when checking for overlap to allow expansion within the object itself.
4. **`expanded_objs = mapply(...)`:**
   - Iterates through `objs` and their corresponding `valid` expansion cells.
   - Combines the original `obj` with the `recolor`ed valid expansion cells.
5. **`O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))`:**  Paints the final objects.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic flow. They showcase the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for image manipulation tasks.
