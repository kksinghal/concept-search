## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding a '2' to the right of every '1' in the input grid, but only if there is space available (i.e., not on the right edge of the grid). 

**Let's break it down with examples:**

* **Input_0:**
    * The '1's at (0,0) and (0,2) both get a '2' added to their right.
    * The '1' at (3,1) gets a '2' added to its right.
    * The '1' at (3,3) doesn't get a '2' added because it's on the right edge.

* **Input_1 & Input_2:** 
    * Follow the same logic. Notice how '1's at the right edge of objects don't get a '2' added.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_right(loc):
    i, j = loc
    return (i, j + 1) if j + 1 < len(I[0]) else None
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  extensions = mfilter(ones, extend_right)
  return paint(I, asobject(I) | recolor(2, extensions))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_right(loc)` Function:** This function takes a cell location `(i, j)` and returns the location one cell to the right, `(i, j+1)`, only if it's within the grid bounds. If it's on the right edge, it returns `None`.
2. **`ones = ofcolor(I, 1)`:** This gets the indices of all cells containing the value '1'.
3. **`extensions = mfilter(ones, extend_right)`:** This applies the `extend_right` function to each '1' location and merges the results, effectively getting the locations where '2' needs to be added.
4. **`paint(I, asobject(I) | recolor(2, extensions))`:** This combines the original grid object with the '2' recolorings and paints the result onto the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if j + 1 < len(row) and row[j + 1] == 1 else v 
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    ) for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested loops and a conditional expression for a more direct approach:

1. **Outer Loop:** Iterates through each row of the input grid.
2. **Inner Loop:** Iterates through each value `v` and its index `j` in the current row.
3. **Conditional Expression:**
    * `j + 1 < len(row) and row[j + 1] == 1`: Checks if the current value is not at the right edge and the next value is '1'.
    * If true, it replaces the current value with '2'.
    * If false, it keeps the original value `v`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def shift_right_if_one(v, loc):
    i, j = loc
    return frozenset({(v, loc), (2, (i, j+1))}) if j + 1 < len(I[0]) and v == 1 else {(v, loc)}
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(mapply(shift_right_if_one, asobject(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a functional approach with `mapply`:

1. **`shift_right_if_one(v, loc)` Function:** Takes a value `v` and location `loc`. If `v` is 1 and not on the right edge, it returns a set with the original cell and a '2' at the right; otherwise, it returns a set with just the original cell.
2. **`asobject(I)`:** Converts the input grid to an object representation.
3. **`mapply(shift_right_if_one, asobject(I))`:** Applies `shift_right_if_one` to each cell in the object representation and merges the results.
4. **`paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), ...)`:**  Paints the merged result onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return hconcat(
    I, 
    tuple(
      (2,) + tuple(0 for _ in range(len(row) - 1)) if row[0] == 1 else tuple(0 for _ in range(len(row))) 
      for row in I
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages horizontal concatenation (`hconcat`):

1. **Creates a new grid:** Iterates through each row of the input, creating a new row in the new grid based on these conditions:
    * If the first element of the row is '1', it creates a row starting with '2' followed by zeros.
    * Otherwise, it creates a row of all zeros.
2. **`hconcat(I, ...)`:** Concatenates the input grid with the newly created grid horizontally. This effectively adds the '2' to the right of '1's where applicable.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted = shift(recolor(1, ofcolor(I, 1)), (0, 1))
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if (i, j) in shifted else v
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    ) for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a combination of shifting and conditional replacement:

1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`:** Gets the indices of all '1's.
2. **`recolor(1, ...)`:** Creates a temporary object where all '1' locations are marked. 
3. **`shift(..., (0, 1))`:** Shifts this temporary object one cell to the right.
4. **Nested Loops:** Iterates through the original grid, replacing the value with '2' if the current index is present in the shifted object.
