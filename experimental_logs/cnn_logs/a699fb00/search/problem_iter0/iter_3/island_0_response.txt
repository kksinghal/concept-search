## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (groups of connected '1's) and painting a '2' to the right of each '1' within these objects. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The '1's at (0,0) and (0,2) form a single object.  The transformation adds a '2' to the right of each of these '1's, resulting in '2's at (0,1) and (0,3). Similarly, for the object formed by '1's at (3,1) and (3,3).
* **Input_1 & Input_2:** The same logic applies.  Each object of '1's is identified, and a '2' is painted to the right of each '1' within the object.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Extract objects of 1s
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objs) # Shift each object to the right
  O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, merge(toindices(shifted_objs)))) # Paint 2s at shifted locations
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Extracts objects (connected components) of '1's from the input grid `I`. 
2. **`shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objs)`:**  Shifts each extracted object one position to the right.
3. **`O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, merge(toindices(shifted_objs))))`:** 
   - `merge(toindices(shifted_objs))`:  Merges the indices of all shifted objects into a single set.
   - `recolor(2, ...)`:  Creates a new object with the color '2' at the merged indices.
   - `paint(asobject(I), ...)`:  Paints the new '2' object onto the original grid `I`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grid = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)  # Shift the entire grid right
  O = cellwise(asobject(I), shifted_grid, 0)  # Find matching cells after shifting
  O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, ofcolor(O, 1))) # Recolor matching '1's to '2's 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_grid = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)`:** Shifts the entire input grid one position to the right.
2. **`O = cellwise(asobject(I), shifted_grid, 0)`:** Performs a cell-wise comparison between the original and shifted grids.  If the values in the corresponding cells match, the original value is kept; otherwise, it's replaced with '0'. This effectively identifies the locations where a '1' was present both in the original position and the shifted position.
3. **`O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, ofcolor(O, 1)))`:** Recolors the cells with value '1' in the intermediate grid `O` to '2'. This paints a '2' to the right of each '1' in the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == 1 and index(I, loc) == 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: ...)`:** This part filters the indices of the input grid `I`.
    - `asindices(I)`: Gets all indices of the grid.
    - `lambda loc: index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == 1 and index(I, loc) == 1`: This lambda function checks if the cell at the current index `loc` contains a '1' and if the cell to its right also contains a '1'. 
2. **`recolor(2, ...)`:** Creates a new object with the color '2' at the filtered indices (those that were to the left of a '1').
3. **`paint(asobject(I), ...)`:**  Paints this new '2' object onto the original grid. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_of_one(loc):
    i, j = loc
    return j+1 < width(I) and I[i][j+1] == 1 and I[i][j] == 1

  O = asobject(I) 
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, mfilter(asindices(I), right_of_one)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version is very similar to version 3 but uses a named function `right_of_one` to improve readability. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = objects(I, True, False, True) # Extract objects of 1s
  O = asobject(I) 
  for obj in ones:
    for value, (i, j) in obj:
      if j+1 < width(I):
        O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j+1))}) # Paint a '2' to the right of each '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = objects(I, True, False, True)`:**  Extracts connected components of '1's from the grid.
2. **`O = asobject(I)`:**  Converts the input grid to an object representation.
3. **`for obj in ones: ...`:** Iterates through each extracted object.
4. **`for value, (i, j) in obj: ...`:** Iterates through each cell in the current object.
5. **`if j+1 < width(I): O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j+1))})`:** Checks if there is a cell to the right within the grid boundaries. If yes, it paints a '2' at that location.

These are five distinct program versions that achieve the desired transformation using different approaches and combinations of functions from the provided DSL. Each version effectively identifies objects of '1's and paints a '2' to the right of each '1' within those objects.
