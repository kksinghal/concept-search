## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all input-output pairs follows a consistent rule:

**For each object (connected component of same-valued cells) in the input grid, extend the object one cell to the right by changing the color of that cell to '2' if the cell is currently '0' (empty).**

Let's break it down for each example:

**Input_0:**

* There are two objects, both formed by '1's.
* The top object is extended one cell to the right, changing the '0' to '2'.
* The bottom object is also extended, changing the '0' to '2'.

**Input_1:**

* This input has more objects, all formed by '1's.
* Each object is individually extended one cell to the right, changing any bordering '0' to '2'.

**Input_2:**

* Similar to Input_1, all objects (formed by '1's) are extended one cell to the right.
* Again, only '0' cells are changed to '2' during this extension. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code using the provided DSL, each with an explanation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Find all objects in the input grid
  expansion_area = frozenset((i, j + 1) for obj in objs for i, j in toindices(obj) if j < width(I) - 1) 
  valid_expansion = intersection(expansion_area, ofcolor(I, 0)) # Identify empty cells eligible for expansion
  expanded_objs = recolor(2, valid_expansion) # Recolor the expansion area
  O = paint(I, expanded_objs | apply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), obj), objs)) # Combine original and expanded objects
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` finds all connected components (objects) in the grid.
2.  **Define Expansion Area:** Calculate the indices of cells immediately to the right of each object.
3. **Filter Valid Expansion:** Keep only the expansion cells that have a value of '0' (empty).
4. **Recolor Expansion:** Change the color of the valid expansion cells to '2'.
5.  **Combine and Paint:** Merge the original objects with the newly expanded areas and paint them onto the original grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(2, sfilter(toindices(shift(obj, RIGHT)), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0)), objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), obj), objs) | expanded_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Expand and Recolor:**  For each object: 
    - Shift the object one cell to the right. 
    - Filter the shifted indices to keep only those corresponding to '0' cells in the original grid.
    - Recolor these filtered indices to '2', effectively extending the object.
3. **Combine and Paint:** Same as Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Start with the input grid
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):  # Iterate over each object
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 0:  # Check for rightward expansion possibility
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})  # Fill the cell with '2' if it's empty
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Iterate and Modify:** This version iterates directly through the objects and their cells.
2.  **Check and Fill:** For each cell, it checks if it can be expanded rightward (empty cell). If so, it fills that cell with '2'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def expand_right(obj):
    return recolor(2, frozenset((i, j + 1) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 0))
  expanded_objs = mapply(expand_right, objects(I, T, F, T))
  O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs) | apply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), obj), objects(I, T, F, T)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `expand_right` Function:** This function encapsulates the logic of finding expandable cells to the right and recoloring them.
2.  **Apply and Combine:** Similar to previous versions, it applies the function to each object, merges the results, and paints them.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_expandable(i, j):
    return j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 0
  
  expanded_cells = frozenset((i, j + 1) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, val in enumerate(row) if is_expandable(i, j) and val != 0)
  O = paint(I, recolor(2, expanded_cells))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `is_expandable` Function:** Checks if a cell can be expanded rightward.
2. **Find Expandable Cells:** Directly iterates through the grid and identifies expandable cells.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** Recolors the expandable cells and paints the result onto the input grid. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and power of the DSL.
