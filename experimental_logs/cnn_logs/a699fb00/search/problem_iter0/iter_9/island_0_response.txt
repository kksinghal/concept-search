## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation identifies cells with the value '1' that have a '0' immediately to their right. These '0' cells are then changed to '2'.

**Example:**

Input:

```
1 0 1
0 1 0
```

Output:

```
1 2 1
0 1 0
```

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1 (Inspired by iterating over grid and checking neighbors):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 0:
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over the grid:** Loop through each row (`i`) and column (`j`) of the input grid (`I`).
2. **Check for the pattern:** If a cell contains '1' and its right neighbor contains '0', proceed.
3. **Fill with '2':**  Use the `fill` function to replace the '0' at the right neighbor's position with '2' in the output grid (`O`).

**Version 2 (Inspired by using `ofcolor` and shifting indices):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  right_neighbors = apply(lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT), ones_indices)
  valid_neighbors = sfilter(right_neighbors, lambda loc: contained(loc, asindices(I)))
  zero_neighbors = sfilter(valid_neighbors, lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0)
  O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, zero_neighbors))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' indices:** Get the indices of all '1' cells using `ofcolor`.
2. **Calculate right neighbors:** Shift each '1' index one position to the right.
3. **Filter valid neighbors:** Keep only the shifted indices that fall within the grid boundaries.
4. **Filter '0' neighbors:** Further filter the valid neighbors to keep only those with a '0' value in the input grid.
5. **Paint '2's:**  Use `paint` and `recolor` to change the '0's at the filtered indices to '2' in the output grid.

**Version 3 (Inspired by cellwise comparison and shifting):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grid = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)
  O = cellwise(I, shifted_grid, 0)
  O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, ofcolor(O, 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift the grid:** Shift the entire input grid one position to the right.
2. **Cellwise comparison:** Compare the original and shifted grids using `cellwise`. If the values match, keep the original value; otherwise, replace with '0'.
3. **Paint '2's:** Find the indices of the remaining '1's (representing the '0's to be changed) and replace them with '2's using `paint` and `recolor`.

**Version 4 (Inspired by finding common indices):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  right_neighbors = apply(lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT), ones_indices)
  valid_neighbors = sfilter(right_neighbors, lambda loc: contained(loc, asindices(I)))
  common_indices = intersection(valid_neighbors, ofcolor(I, 0))
  O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, common_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '1' and '0' indices:** Get indices of all '1's and '0's using `ofcolor`.
2. **Shift '1' indices:** Shift each '1' index one position to the right.
3. **Filter valid neighbors:** Keep only the shifted indices that fall within the grid boundaries.
4. **Find common indices:** Identify indices present in both valid neighbors and '0' indices.
5. **Paint '2's:** Change the '0's at the common indices to '2's using `paint` and `recolor`.


**Version 5 (Inspired by using lambda function for neighbor check):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_neighbor_is_zero(loc):
    i, j = loc
    return j + 1 < width(I) and I[i][j + 1] == 0

  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  valid_indices = sfilter(ones_indices, right_neighbor_is_zero)
  shifted_indices = apply(lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT), valid_indices)
  O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, shifted_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define neighbor check:** Define a lambda function `right_neighbor_is_zero` to check if the right neighbor of a given index is '0' within grid bounds.
2. **Find '1' indices:** Get the indices of all '1' cells using `ofcolor`.
3. **Filter valid indices:** Use the `right_neighbor_is_zero` function with `sfilter` to keep only '1' indices whose right neighbor is '0'.
4. **Shift valid indices:** Shift the filtered indices one position to the right.
5. **Paint '2's:** Change the values at the shifted indices to '2' using `paint` and `recolor`.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation, demonstrating diverse use of the provided DSL functions.
