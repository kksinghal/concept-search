## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending all horizontal sequences of the digit '1' to the right by one cell, filling that cell with the digit '2'. 

**Examples:**

* **Input_0:** The top-left and bottom-left '1' sequences are extended to the right.
* **Input_1:** All horizontal '1' sequences, even single '1's, are extended.
* **Input_2:** The transformation affects all input grids consistently.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if j > 0 and row[j-1] == 1 and v == 0 else v
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each row and cell. If a cell contains '0' and the cell to its left contains '1', it replaces the '0' with '2', effectively extending the '1' sequence.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = objects(I, True, False, True)
  extensions = mfilter(ones, lambda obj: {(2, (i, j+1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j+1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (i, j+1)) == 0})
  return paint(I, merge(extensions))
```

**Explanation:**

This version identifies '1' objects, finds their rightmost '0' neighbors, and paints them as '2'. It leverages object recognition for a more abstract approach.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if any(row[j-k] == 1 for k in range(1, j+1)) and v == 0 else v 
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version checks for any '1' to the left of a '0' cell within the same row. If a '1' is found, it replaces the '0' with '2', extending the sequence even with gaps.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted = tuple(tuple(0) + row for row in I)
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if shifted[i][j-1] == 1 and v == 0 else v
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version creates a shifted copy of the grid with a prepended column of '0's. It then compares each cell with the cell to its left in the shifted grid, replacing '0's with '2's where appropriate.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      branch(j == 0, v, 2 if row[j-1] == 1 and v == 0 else v)
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version explicitly handles the first cell in each row using the `branch` function. For other cells, it applies the same logic as previous versions, replacing '0's with '2's if preceded by a '1'.

These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the same grid transformation. Each version uses different logic or DSL function combinations, showcasing the flexibility and expressive power of the provided DSL.
