## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending all objects composed of "1"s to the right by one cell, filling the new cell with the value "2". 

**Detailed Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The "1" at (0,0) is extended to (0,1) with a "2". Similarly, the "1"s at (3,1) and (3,3) are extended to (3,2) and (3,4) respectively. 
* **Input_1:**  All occurrences of "1"s have an adjacent "2" to their right. Notice how the extension only occurs within the boundaries of the existing "1" object.
* **Input_2:**  The pattern remains consistent, with all extensions respecting object boundaries and not extending beyond the grid's edge.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1) # Find indices of all '1's
  valid_extension = lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1) if loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0]) else None  # Check for valid right extension
  extensions = mfilter(one_indices, valid_extension) # Filter indices with valid right shifts
  extension_cells = frozenset((2, ext) for ext in extensions if ext is not None) # Create extension objects
  O = paint(I, extension_cells) # Paint extensions onto the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify "1" cells:** `one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)` finds the indices of all cells containing the value "1".
2. **Define valid extension:** `valid_extension` checks if a rightward extension is possible (within grid bounds).
3. **Filter valid extensions:**  `extensions = mfilter(one_indices, valid_extension)` keeps only the indices where a rightward extension is valid.
4. **Create extension cells:** `extension_cells` creates a set of new cells with value "2" at the extended positions.
5. **Paint extensions:** `O = paint(I, extension_cells)` adds the extensions to the original grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    ones = toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I)  # Get the object containing all '1' cells
    shifted_right = shift(ones, (0, 1))  # Shift the entire object one cell to the right
    extensions = intersection(shifted_right, asobject(canvas(0, shape(I)))) # Find the new cells created by the shift within grid bounds
    recolored_extensions = recolor(2, extensions) # Recolor the new cells to '2'
    O = paint(I, recolored_extensions) # Paint the extensions onto the original grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get the "1" object:**  `ones = toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I)` creates an object representing all "1" cells.
2. **Shift right:** `shifted_right = shift(ones, (0, 1))` moves the entire object one cell to the right.
3. **Identify new cells:** `extensions = intersection(shifted_right, asobject(canvas(0, shape(I))))` finds the cells that are part of the shifted object but not in the original (representing the extensions).
4. **Recolor extensions:** `recolored_extensions = recolor(2, extensions)` sets the value of the new cells to "2".
5. **Paint extensions:** `O = paint(I, recolored_extensions)` applies the extensions to the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_right(obj):
    rightmost_col = rightmost(obj) 
    return frozenset((v, (i, j + 1)) if j == rightmost_col and j + 1 < len(I[0]) else (v, (i, j))
                       for v, (i, j) in obj)
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False) # Extract objects 
  extended_objs = frozenset(extend_right(obj) for obj in objs) # Extend each object to the right 
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(extended_objs)) # Paint the extended objects onto a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `extend_right`:** This helper function takes an object and extends it one cell to the right if the rightmost cell of the object allows for extension within the grid.
2. **Extract objects:** `objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)` identifies all objects in the grid.
3. **Extend objects:** `extended_objs = frozenset(extend_right(obj) for obj in objs)` applies the `extend_right` function to each object.
4. **Paint on canvas:** `O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(extended_objs))`  paints the extended objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_if_one(cell):
    v, (i, j) = cell
    return (2, (i, j + 1)) if v == 1 and j + 1 < len(I[0]) else cell 
  flattened = ((I[i][j], (i, j)) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0])))
  extended = frozenset(extend_if_one(cell) for cell in flattened)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), extended) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `extend_if_one`:** This function takes a cell and its location, extending it rightward with "2" if the cell value is "1" and it's within the grid's bounds.
2. **Flatten the grid:** `flattened = ((I[i][j], (i, j)) for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0])))`  converts the grid into a set of (value, location) tuples. 
3. **Apply extension:** `extended = frozenset(extend_if_one(cell) for cell in flattened)`  uses `extend_if_one` on each cell of the flattened grid.
4. **Paint on canvas:** `O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), extended)`  paints the extended cells onto a new canvas. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted =  hconcat(I, canvas(0, (len(I), 1))) # Concatenate a zero-filled column to the right
  extended = cellwise(shifted, hconcat(canvas(0, (len(I), 1)), I), 2) # Overlap and fill with "2" where differences occur
  O = crop(extended, (0, 0), shape(I)) # Crop to original size
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create shifted grid:** `shifted =  hconcat(I, canvas(0, (len(I), 1)))` adds a column of zeros to the right of the grid.
2. **Find extensions:** `extended = cellwise(shifted, hconcat(canvas(0, (len(I), 1)), I), 2)` compares the shifted grid with a version where zeros are added to the left. Where they differ (indicating an extension), it fills with "2".
3. **Crop to original size:** `O = crop(extended, (0, 0), shape(I))` removes the extra column to match the input dimensions.


These five programs provide a diverse set of solutions utilizing different DSL functions and logic to achieve the same desired transformation.
