## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by connected '1's in the input grid and extending these objects to the right by adding a '2' to the rightmost cell of each row in the object. 

**Let's break it down with examples:**

* **Input_0:** There are two objects formed by '1's. The top object has only one row, and the bottom object has only one row.  We add a '2' to the right of the rightmost '1' in each object.
* **Input_1:** Again, two objects. This time, both objects span multiple rows. We apply the same logic â€“ adding a '2' to the rightmost '1' of each row in each object. 
* **Input_2:**  This input also features two objects, demonstrating that the transformation works consistently regardless of the object's position or the number of rows it spans.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def bddgfaaggfbjedffbiicceafjjfigdch(I):
  def process_row(row):
    return tuple(v if (j == len(row) - 1 or v != 1) else (v, 2) for j, v in enumerate(row))
  return tuple(tuple(v for v in r if v != 2) for r in apply(process_row, I)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **process_row(row):** This helper function iterates through each cell in a row. If the cell contains a '1' and is not the last element of the row, it replaces the cell with a tuple (1, 2), effectively adding a '2' to its right. Otherwise, it keeps the original cell value.
2. **apply(process_row, I):** This applies the `process_row` function to each row in the input grid `I`.
3. **tuple(tuple(v for v in r if v != 2) for r in ...):** This part iterates through the processed grid and flattens the tuples created by `process_row`, effectively inserting the '2's into the grid while maintaining the correct structure.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          2 if (j > 0 and row[j-1] == 1 and v != 1) else v 
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      ) 
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a more compact approach with nested list comprehensions:

1. **for row in I:** Iterates through each row of the input grid.
2. **for j, v in enumerate(row):** Iterates through each cell (and its index) within the row.
3. **2 if (j > 0 and row[j-1] == 1 and v != 1) else v:** This conditional statement checks if the current cell is not a '1', the previous cell is a '1', and the current cell is not the first cell in the row. If true, it replaces the current cell with a '2'; otherwise, it keeps the original cell value. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, True, False)
  shifted_objs = apply(rbind(shift, RIGHT), objs)
  colored_shifted_objs = apply(rbind(recolor, 2), shifted_objs)
  return paint(I, merge(objs | colored_shifted_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **objects(I, True, True, False):**  Identifies all objects in the grid formed by connected '1's.
2. **apply(rbind(shift, RIGHT), objs):** Shifts each identified object one position to the right.
3. **apply(rbind(recolor, 2), shifted_objs):** Recolors the shifted objects to have a value of '2'.
4. **paint(I, merge(objs | colored_shifted_objs)):** Merges the original objects and the recolored, shifted objects and paints them onto the original grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_object(obj):
    return obj | recolor(2, shift(toindices(obj), RIGHT))
  return paint(I, merge(apply(extend_object, objects(I, True, True, False))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **extend_object(obj):** This helper function takes an object as input, shifts its indices to the right, recolors the shifted indices to '2', and merges the original and recoloured indices.
2. **objects(I, True, True, False):** Extracts all objects (connected '1's) from the grid.
3. **apply(extend_object, ...):** Applies the `extend_object` function to each extracted object.
4. **paint(I, merge(...)):** Merges all extended objects and paints them onto the input grid. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_cell(i, j):
    return (I[i][j], 2) if (j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j] == 1) else (I[i][j],)
  return tuple(
      tuple(v for v, _ in apply(process_cell, (i, j))) 
      for i in range(len(I)) for j in range(len(I[0]))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **process_cell(i, j):** This function checks if a cell at coordinates (i, j) is a '1' and not the last cell in the row. If true, it returns a tuple (1, 2); otherwise, it returns a tuple containing the original cell value.
2. **apply(process_cell, (i, j)):** Applies the `process_cell` function to all cell coordinates in the grid. 
3. **tuple(tuple(v for v, _ in ...) ...):**  This part restructures the output by flattening the tuples generated by `process_cell`, effectively inserting the '2's into the grid. 

These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the same grid transformation using the provided DSL. Each version offers different advantages in terms of code compactness, readability, and modularity.
