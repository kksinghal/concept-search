## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by adjacent cells with the value '1' and then extending these objects one cell to the right by changing the cell's value to '2'. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

* There are two objects formed by '1' valued cells. 
* The top-left object is extended one cell to the right, changing the '0' at (0,1) to '2'.
* The bottom-left object is similarly extended, changing the '0' at (3,2) to '2'.

**Input_1:**

* This input has four distinct objects formed by '1' valued cells.
* Each object is extended one cell to the right, replacing the '0' with '2' at their respective positions.

**Input_2:**

* This input demonstrates that the transformation correctly handles objects at various positions and orientations.
* Like previous examples, each object is extended to the right by one cell, changing the adjacent '0' to '2'.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code along with explanations:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: loc[1]+1 < len(I[0]))
  shifted_obj = frozenset((2, (i, j+1)) for i, j in shifted_indices if I[i][j] == 1)
  O = paint(I, shifted_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **shifted_indices:** Identifies indices of cells that are not on the rightmost edge of the grid.
2. **shifted_obj:** Creates an object containing cells directly to the right of cells with value '1' in the input grid. These new cells are assigned the value '2'.
3. **paint:**  Paints the 'shifted_obj' onto the original input grid 'I', effectively extending the objects. 


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  extended_objs = frozenset(frozenset((2, add((i,j), RIGHT))) for obj in objs for _, (i, j) in obj if j + 1 < len(I[0]))
  O = paint(I, merge(extended_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **objects:** Extracts objects from the input grid 'I', considering only directly adjacent cells with the same value ('1').
2. **extended_objs:** Generates a new set of objects where each cell of the original objects is extended one position to the right with the value '2'.
3. **paint:** Paints the merged set of 'extended_objs' onto the original grid 'I'.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])-1):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j+1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterative Approach:** This version iterates through the grid cell by cell.
2. **Conditional Filling:** If a cell contains '1', the cell to its right is filled with '2' using the 'fill' function.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)
  right_shifted_indices = mfilter(one_indices, lambda loc: loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0]))
  extension = frozenset((2, (i, j + 1)) for i, j in right_shifted_indices)
  O = paint(I, extension)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **one_indices:** Finds the indices of all cells with the value '1'.
2. **right_shifted_indices:** Filters 'one_indices' to keep only those with a valid right neighbor.
3. **extension:**  Creates an object representing the extension, placing '2' in cells to the right of the '1's.
4. **paint:** Applies the 'extension' onto the input grid.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  extended_grid = tuple(
      tuple(
          2 if j + 1 < len(row) and row[j] == 1 else v 
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in I
  )
  return extended_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **List Comprehension:** This version utilizes nested list comprehensions for a concise solution.
2. **Conditional Value Assignment:** It iterates through each cell, checking if it's a '1' with a valid right neighbor. If true, it assigns '2' to the right neighbor; otherwise, it retains the original value. 


These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation while adhering to the provided DSL functions.
