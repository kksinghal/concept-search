## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (groups of connected '1's) and painting the cell immediately to the right of each '1' with a '2'.  This applies only if the right neighbor cell exists within the grid boundaries.

**Example:**

Input:
```
1 0 1
0 1 0 
```

Output:
```
1 2 1
0 1 2
```

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1 (Inspired by Program_B, but uses `ofcolor` and `asindices`):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)  # Get indices of all '1's
  shifted_indices = apply(lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT), ones_indices)  # Shift each index to the right
  valid_indices = sfilter(shifted_indices, lambda loc: contained(loc, asindices(I)))  # Keep only valid indices within the grid
  O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, valid_indices))  # Paint '2' at valid shifted indices
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1's:**  Find all indices of cells containing '1' using `ofcolor`.
2. **Shift Right:** Shift each identified index one cell to the right using `apply` and `add`.
3. **Validate Indices:** Filter out shifted indices that fall outside the grid boundaries using `sfilter` and `contained`.
4. **Paint '2's:**  Paint the valid shifted indices with '2' using `paint` and `recolor`.

**Version 2 (Inspired by Program_B, uses nested loops and conditional painting):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):  # Iterate only till second last column
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        O = paint(asobject(O), recolor(2, {(i, j + 1)}))  # Paint right neighbor as '2' 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** Loop through each cell in the grid, excluding the last column.
2. **Check for '1':** If the current cell contains '1', proceed.
3. **Paint Right Neighbor:** Paint the cell to the right of the current cell with '2' using `paint` and `recolor`.

**Version 3 (Inspired by Program_A, utilizes object detection and manipulation):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Get objects of '1's 
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objs) # Shift each object right
  valid_indices = sfilter(toindices(merge(shifted_objs)), lambda loc: contained(loc, asindices(I))) # Get valid shifted indices
  O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, valid_indices)) # Paint '2's at valid indices
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Detect Objects:** Identify objects (connected groups of '1's) in the grid using `objects`.
2. **Shift Objects:** Shift each detected object one cell to the right using `mapply` and `shift`.
3. **Extract and Validate Indices:** Extract all indices from shifted objects and filter for valid grid positions using `sfilter` and `contained`.
4. **Paint '2's:**  Paint '2' at the valid shifted indices on the original grid using `paint` and `recolor`.

**Version 4 (Inspired by Program_B, combines `ofcolor`, `apply`, and conditional painting):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_neighbor_is_valid(loc):
    i, j = loc
    return j + 1 < width(I)

  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, 1) # Get indices of '1's
  filtered_indices = sfilter(ones_indices, right_neighbor_is_valid) # Filter indices with valid right neighbors
  shifted_indices = apply(lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT), filtered_indices) # Shift filtered indices to the right
  O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, shifted_indices)) # Paint '2' at shifted indices
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Validity Function:** Define a helper function to check if a cell has a valid right neighbor within the grid.
2. **Identify '1's:** Find all indices of cells containing '1' using `ofcolor`.
3. **Filter Valid Neighbors:** Filter the identified indices to keep only those with valid right neighbors using the helper function and `sfilter`.
4. **Shift Right:** Shift each valid index one cell to the right using `apply` and `add`.
5. **Paint '2's:** Paint the shifted indices with '2' using `paint` and `recolor`.

**Version 5 (Inspired by Program_A, employs a more functional approach with `papply`):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_indices = mapply(lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT), asindices(I)) # Shift all indices right
  valid_indices = sfilter(shifted_indices, lambda loc: contained(subtract(loc, RIGHT), asindices(I))) # Filter for valid indices
  filtered_indices = sfilter(valid_indices, lambda loc: index(I, subtract(loc, RIGHT)) == 1) # Filter for indices whose left neighbor is '1'
  O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, filtered_indices)) # Paint '2' at filtered indices
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift All Indices:**  Shift all indices in the grid one cell to the right using `mapply` and `add`.
2. **Initial Validity Check:** Filter the shifted indices to retain only those whose original (unshifted) position is within the grid boundaries using `sfilter` and `contained`.
3. **Check Left Neighbor:**  From the valid shifted indices, further filter to keep only those whose left neighbor in the original grid contains a '1' using `sfilter` and `index`.
4. **Paint '2's:**  Paint '2' at these final filtered indices on the original grid using `paint` and `recolor`.
