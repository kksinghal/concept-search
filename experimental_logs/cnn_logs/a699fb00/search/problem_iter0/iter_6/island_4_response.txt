## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation adds a '2' to the right of every '1' in the input grid, but only if the cell to the right is a '0' (empty). 

**Let's analyze each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0:** The '1's at (0,0) and (3,1) get a '2' added to their right because the cell to their right is a '0'.
* **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, only '1's with a '0' immediately to their right are affected.
* **Input_2:**  The pattern holds consistently. 


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)  # Get indices of all '1's
  right_neighbors = shift(ones, (0, 1))  # Shift indices one position to the right
  valid_positions = intersection(right_neighbors, ofcolor(I, 0))  # Find valid positions within grid that are '0'
  twos = recolor(2, valid_positions)  # Recolor valid positions to '2'
  O = paint(I, twos)  # Paint the '2's onto the original grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1's:** Find the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **Calculate Right Neighbors:** Shift the indices of '1's one position to the right.
3. **Find Valid Positions:** Intersect the right neighbor indices with indices of cells containing '0' to ensure we only modify empty cells.
4. **Recolor:**  Recolor the valid positions to '2'.
5. **Paint:**  Combine the recolored positions with the original grid.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def add_two_if_zero_right(loc):
    return {(loc[0], loc[1] + 1)} if index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0 else {}
  
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  twos = mapply(add_two_if_zero_right, ones)
  O = fill(I, 2, twos)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Helper Function:** Create a function `add_two_if_zero_right` to check if the right neighbor is '0' and return the index if true, otherwise an empty set.
2. **Identify '1's:** Get the indices of all '1's.
3. **Apply and Merge:** Use `mapply` to apply the helper function to each '1' index and merge the results.
4. **Fill:** Fill the grid with '2's at the collected indices. 


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):  # Iterate until the second last column
      if index(I, (i, j)) == 1 and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0:
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Grid:** Loop through each cell in the grid, stopping at the second last column.
2. **Check Condition:** If a cell contains '1' and its right neighbor is '0', proceed.
3. **Fill:** Fill the right neighbor cell with '2'.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
    right_check = lambda loc: index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == 0
    valid_ones = sfilter(ones, right_check)
    twos = shift(valid_ones, RIGHT) 
    O = fill(I, 2, twos)
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get '1' Indices:** Find indices of all '1's in the grid.
2. **Define Right Check:** Create a lambda function `right_check` to verify if the cell to the right of a given index is '0'.
3. **Filter Valid '1's:**  Use `sfilter` with `right_check` to keep only the '1' indices whose right neighbor is '0'.
4. **Shift to Right:** Shift the filtered indices one position to the right.
5. **Fill with '2's:** Fill the grid with '2's at the shifted indices.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_row(row):
    new_row = list(row)  
    for j in range(len(row) - 1):
      if row[j] == 1 and row[j + 1] == 0:
        new_row[j + 1] = 2
    return tuple(new_row)

  O = tuple(process_row(row) for row in I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Row Processing:** Create a function `process_row` to iterate through each row and apply the transformation.
2. **Iterate and Modify:** Loop through each cell in the row, if a cell is '1' and its right neighbor is '0', change the right neighbor to '2'.
3. **Apply to Each Row:** Apply `process_row` to each row in the input grid using a generator expression.
