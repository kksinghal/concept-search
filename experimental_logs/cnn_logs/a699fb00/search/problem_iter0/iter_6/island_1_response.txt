## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to expand each object (connected group of same-valued digits excluding the background color) to the right by one cell. Here's a breakdown:

**Input_0:**
- The '1' objects are expanded to the right by one cell, filling with the value '2'.

**Input_1:**
- Similar to Input_0, all '1' objects are expanded rightward, filling with '2'.

**Input_2:**
- Same logic applied, demonstrating the consistency of the transformation across different input configurations.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" to achieve the desired transformation, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:** (Inspired by identifying expansion candidates and recoloring)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects
  expansion_candidates = frozenset({
      (i, j + 1)  # Candidate location to the right
      for obj in objs
      for i, j in toindices(obj)  # For each cell in each object
      if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and (i, j + 1) not in toindices(merge(objs))  # Check for right edge and existing objects
  })
  expanded_objs = recolor(2, expansion_candidates)  # Recolor the candidates
  O = paint(I, merge(objs | expanded_objs))  # Combine original and expanded objects
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify distinct objects in the input grid using `objects`.
2. **Find Expansion Candidates:** For each object, locate cells immediately to their right that are within the grid boundaries and not part of any existing object.
3. **Recolor Candidates:** Assign the value '2' to all identified expansion candidate locations.
4. **Combine and Paint:** Merge the original objects with the recolored expansion candidates and paint them onto the input grid to generate the output.

**Program Version 2:** (Inspired by shifting and finding valid expansion areas)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  shifted_right = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, 1)), objs)  # Shift objects right
  valid_expansion = frozenset({
      loc
      for obj, shifted in zip(objs, shifted_right)
      for loc in toindices(shifted)
      if loc[1] < len(I[0]) and (loc[0], loc[1] - 1) in toindices(obj) and loc not in toindices(merge(objs))  # Check valid locations
  })
  expanded_objs = recolor(2, valid_expansion)  # Recolor valid expansion areas
  O = paint(I, merge(objs | expanded_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects and Shift:** Identify objects and create a set of right-shifted objects.
2. **Determine Valid Expansion:** Find locations that are within the shifted objects, within grid bounds, have a corresponding cell to the left within the original object, and are not already part of any object.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** Assign '2' to valid expansion locations and combine them with the original objects to generate the output.

**Program Version 3:** (Inspired by calculating the difference between original and expanded backdrops)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expanded_backdrops = apply(lambda obj: backdrop(shift(obj, (0, 1))), objs)  # Calculate backdrops of shifted objects
  expansion_area = difference(merge(expanded_backdrops), merge(apply(backdrop, objs)))  # Find the difference in backdrop areas
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: obj | recolor(2, intersection(expansion_area, toindices(shift(obj, (0, 1))))), objs)  # Expand objects within the difference area
  O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Objects and Backdrops:** Extract objects and compute the backdrops of the original and right-shifted objects.
2. **Difference Area:** Determine the difference between the merged backdrops of shifted objects and the merged backdrops of original objects; this difference represents the expansion area.
3. **Expand and Paint:**  For each object, combine it with the '2'-recolored portion of the expansion area that intersects with the object's rightward shift. Finally, paint the combined objects to generate the output.

**Program Version 4:** (Iterative approach for clarity)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expanded_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if j < len(I[0]) - 1:  # Check right edge
        new_cell = (i, j + 1)
        if new_cell not in toindices(merge(objs)):  # Check if location is free
          expanded_objs.add((2, new_cell))  # Add expanded cell with value '2'
  O = paint(I, objs | frozenset(expanded_objs))  # Combine and paint
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** This version iterates through each cell of each object. It checks if a rightward expansion is possible (within grid bounds and not overlapping other objects).
2. **Add Expanded Cell:** If an expansion is valid, the corresponding cell location and value ('2') are added to the `expanded_objs` set.
3. **Combine and Paint:** Finally, the original objects and the `expanded_objs` are combined and painted onto the input grid to generate the output.

**Program Version 5:** (Leveraging 'hconcat' for a different approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expansion_column = canvas(0, (len(I), 1)) # Create a blank column for expansion
  expanded_grid = hconcat(I, expansion_column) # Concatenate the grid with the blank column
  expanded_objs = objects(expanded_grid, T, F, T) # Find objects in the expanded grid
  filtered_objs = frozenset({obj for obj in expanded_objs if len(intersection(toindices(obj), asindices(I))) > 0}) # Keep only the objects that overlap with the original grid
  recolored_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(2, difference(toindices(obj), asindices(I))), filtered_objs) # Recolor the expanded part of each object to 2
  O = paint(I, merge(recolored_objs)) # Paint the recolored objects onto the original grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Expanded Grid:** Concatenate the input grid with a blank column to accommodate the expansion.
2. **Find Objects:** Identify objects in this expanded grid.
3. **Filter Objects:** Keep only the objects that overlap with the original input grid.
4. **Recolor and Paint:** For each filtered object, recolor the portion that lies within the expanded column to '2', and paint these recolored objects onto the original grid to produce the output.

These five program versions provide diverse approaches to achieve the same output, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL. Each version utilizes different functions and logic, showcasing a variety of problem-solving strategies within the given constraints.
