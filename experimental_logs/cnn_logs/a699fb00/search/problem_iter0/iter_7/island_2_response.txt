## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding a '2' to the right of each '1' in the input grid, but only if that '1' is not at the rightmost edge of the grid. 

Let's analyze this for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
- The '1's at (0,0) and (0,2) get a '2' added to their right.
- The '1' at (3,1) and (3,3) get a '2' added to their right.
- The '1's at the right edge of the grid remain unchanged.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- Similar to Input_0, all '1's not on the right edge gain a '2' to their right.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
- Same pattern as above.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_row(row):
    return [(v, 2) if (j < len(row) - 1 and v == 1) else (v,) for j, v in enumerate(row)]
  return tuple(tuple(v for cell in process_row(row) for v in cell) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **process_row(row):** This function iterates through each cell in a row.
   - If the cell value is '1' and it's not the last element of the row, it returns a tuple `(1, 2)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns a tuple containing only the original cell value.
2. The main function applies `process_row` to each row of the input grid `I`.
3. It then flattens the resulting list of lists of tuples into a single list of tuples for each row.
4. Finally, it converts the list of rows back into a tuple of tuples, representing the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
        2 if k == 1 and j < len(row) - 1 else v 
        for j, (v, k) in enumerate(zip(row, (0,) + row[:-1]))
      )
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Innermost loop:** Iterates through each cell (`v`) and its predecessor (`k`, using `zip` with a shifted version of the row) in the row.
2. **Conditional:** If `k` is 1 (meaning `v` was preceded by a 1) and it's not the last element in the row, replace with '2'; otherwise, keep the original value (`v`).
3. **Outer loop:** Applies this logic to each row in the grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(tuple(1 if (j > 0 and row[j-1] == 2) else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for row in I) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Inner loop:** For each cell in a row, if the cell is not the first one (`j > 0`) and the previous cell is '2', it means the current cell should be '1' (as it was originally a '1' before a '2' was added in its place).
2. **Otherwise:**  The original value is kept.
3. **Outer loop:**  Applies this logic to each row.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          branch(j == len(row) - 1, v, branch(v == 1, (1, 2), (v,)))[0] 
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      ) 
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Nested `branch` statements:** This uses nested conditional statements (`branch` function). 
   - The outer `branch` checks if it's the last element in the row. If it is, it keeps the original value (`v`).
   - Otherwise, the inner `branch` checks if the value is '1'. If it is, it replaces it with `(1, 2)`, which will be flattened to `1 2` in the output. 
     - If the value is not '1', it keeps the original value.
2. **List comprehension:** The code uses list comprehension for concise representation.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, True, False)
  new_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    new_obj = set()
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      new_obj.add((v, (i, j)))
      if v == 1 and j < len(I[0]) - 1:
        new_obj.add((2, (i, j + 1)))
    new_objs.add(frozenset(new_obj))
  return paint(I, merge(new_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Uses `objects` function to find connected components ('objects') of the same color in the grid.
2. **Iterate objects:** Loops through each identified object.
3. **Modify object:** For each cell in the object:
   - If the cell value is '1' and it's not at the right edge of the grid, adds a '2' to its right.
4. **Paint back:**  Finally, it paints all the modified objects back onto the original grid, effectively applying the transformation.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to solve the problem using the DSL, showcasing its flexibility and your ability to generate diverse solutions.
