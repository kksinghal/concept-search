## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '1' in the input grid and extending them to the right by one cell, filling the new cell with the digit '2'. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- Each '1' in the input grid has a '2' added to its right in the output grid. 
- This is visible with the '1's at (0, 0), (0, 2), (3, 1), and (3, 3).

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- The same pattern applies here. All '1's are extended rightward with a '2'.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

- Again, the same logic is applied, extending '1' objects to the right with a '2'.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1 (Inspired by identifying '1's and shifting):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)  # Get indices of all '1's
  right_shifted_indices = mfilter(one_indices, lambda loc: loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0]))  # Filter for valid right shifts
  extension = frozenset((2, (i, j + 1)) for i, j in right_shifted_indices)  # Create extension objects
  O = paint(I, extension)  # Paint the extensions onto the input grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' positions:** `one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)` finds all indices where '1' is present.
2. **Filter valid right shifts:** `right_shifted_indices` ensures we only extend within grid boundaries.
3. **Create extension objects:** `extension` creates new objects with '2' at the shifted positions.
4. **Paint extensions:** `O = paint(I, extension)` adds the extensions to the original grid.


**Version 2 (Inspired by object manipulation):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)  # Extract objects from the grid
  extended_objs = frozenset(frozenset((2, add((i,j), RIGHT))) for obj in objs for _, (i, j) in obj if j + 1 < len(I[0]))  # Extend each object to the right
  O = paint(I, merge(extended_objs))  # Paint the extended objects onto the original grid
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** `objs = objects(...)` identifies individual objects formed by '1's.
2. **Extend objects:** `extended_objs` iterates through each object and adds a '2' to the right if possible.
3. **Merge and paint:** The extended objects are merged and then painted onto the original grid.

**Version 3 (Direct index manipulation):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: loc[1]+1 < len(I[0]))  # Get indices with valid right shifts
  shifted_obj = frozenset((2, (i, j+1)) for i, j in shifted_indices if I[i][j] == 1)  # Create extensions for '1's
  O = paint(I, shifted_obj)  # Paint extensions onto the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find valid shift indices:** `shifted_indices` identifies indices where a right shift is possible.
2. **Create extensions:** `shifted_obj` creates new objects with '2' at right-shifted positions of '1's.
3. **Paint extensions:**  The extensions are then painted onto the original grid.

**Version 4 (Using map and conditional logic):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = tuple(
        tuple(
            2 if j + 1 < len(row) and row[j + 1] == 1 else v 
            for j, v in enumerate(row)
        ) 
        for row in I
    )
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows and cells:** The code uses nested loops to iterate over each cell in the grid.
2. **Conditional replacement:**  If a cell contains a '1' and its right neighbor exists and is also a '1', the current cell is replaced with a '2'. 
3. **Construct output grid:** The modified cells are used to construct the output grid. 

**Version 5 (Leveraging horizontal scaling and replacement):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  upscaled = hupscale(I, 2)  # Horizontally upscale the grid
  O = replace(upscaled, (1, 1), (1, 2))  # Replace occurrences of (1, 1) with (1, 2)
  return downscale(O, 2)  # Downscale the grid back to its original size
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Upscale the grid:**  `hupscale(I, 2)` doubles the width of the grid, duplicating each cell.
2. **Replace cell pairs:**  `replace(upscaled, (1, 1), (1, 2))` finds instances where two '1's are now adjacent due to upscaling and replaces them with '1' and '2'.
3. **Downscale to original:** `downscale(O, 2)` brings the grid back to its original size, achieving the desired extension effect.


These five versions demonstrate various approaches to accomplish the transformation, utilizing different function combinations and logic within the provided DSL. Each version offers a unique way to achieve the same output, highlighting the flexibility of the DSL in solving spatial reasoning tasks.
