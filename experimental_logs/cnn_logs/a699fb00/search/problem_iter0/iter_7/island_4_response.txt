## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (clusters of the same digit) consisting of '1's in the input grid and adding a '2' to the right of each '1' if that position is currently a '0'.

**Input 0:**

* The '1's at (0,0), (0,2), (3,1), and (3,3) each get a '2' added to their right because those positions are initially '0'.

**Input 1:**

* Same logic as Input 0, applied to all '1's in the grid.

**Input 2:**

* Same logic as Input 0, applied to all '1's in the grid.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  right_neighbors = apply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), ones)
  valid_neighbors = intersection(right_neighbors, asindices(I))
  zeros_to_fill = intersection(valid_neighbors, ofcolor(I, 0))
  O = fill(I, 2, zeros_to_fill)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1's:** Find the indices of all '1's in the input grid `I` using `ofcolor(I, 1)`.
2. **Get Right Neighbors:** Calculate the indices of the cells immediately to the right of each '1' using `apply` with a lambda function to shift each index one position to the right.
3. **Filter Valid Neighbors:** Keep only the right neighbors that fall within the bounds of the input grid using `intersection` with `asindices(I)`.
4. **Identify '0's to Fill:**  Find the intersection between the valid right neighbors and the indices of all '0's in the grid using `intersection` with `ofcolor(I, 0)`.
5. **Fill with '2's:** Fill the identified '0' positions with '2's using `fill(I, 2, zeros_to_fill)`.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_fill(loc):
    i, j = loc
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    return (i, j + 1) if 0 <= j + 1 < w and I[i][j + 1] == 0 else None

  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  twos = mfilter(ones, right_fill)
  O = fill(I, 2, twos)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `right_fill` Function:** This function takes a location and returns the location to its right if it's within the grid bounds and contains a '0', otherwise it returns `None`.
2. **Identify '1's:** Find the indices of all '1's in the input grid `I`.
3. **Filter and Map with `mfilter`:** Apply the `right_fill` function to each '1' location and use `mfilter` to keep only the valid locations to fill.
4. **Fill with '2's:** Fill the identified locations with '2's using `fill`.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and j + 1 < w and I[i][j + 1] == 0:
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Grid:** Loop through each cell in the input grid.
2. **Check for Condition:** If a cell contains a '1' and its right neighbor is within the grid bounds and contains a '0', proceed.
3. **Fill with '2':** Fill the right neighbor cell with '2'.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def check_and_fill(row):
    new_row = list(row)
    for j in range(len(row) - 1):
      if row[j] == 1 and row[j + 1] == 0:
        new_row[j + 1] = 2
    return tuple(new_row)

  O = tuple(check_and_fill(row) for row in I)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `check_and_fill` Function:** This function takes a row and iterates through it, filling '0's with '2's if their left neighbor is a '1'.
2. **Apply to Each Row:** Apply the `check_and_fill` function to each row in the input grid.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  shifted_right = shift(ones, (0, 1))
  to_fill = sfilter(shifted_right, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, loc) == 0)
  O = fill(I, 2, to_fill)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1's:**  Find the indices of all '1's in the input grid.
2. **Shift Right:** Shift all '1' indices one position to the right.
3. **Filter Valid and Empty:** Keep only the shifted indices that are within the grid bounds and correspond to '0's in the original grid using `sfilter`.
4. **Fill with '2's:**  Fill the identified '0' positions with '2's. 

Each of these program versions successfully implements the desired transformation for all given input-output pairs.
