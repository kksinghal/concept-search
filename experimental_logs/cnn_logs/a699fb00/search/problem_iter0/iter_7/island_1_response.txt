## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all input-output pairs follows a consistent pattern:

**For each object in the input grid, add a cell with value '2' to the right of each of its cells, provided the new cell location is empty and within the grid boundaries.**

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The object formed by '1's has a new '2' added to the right of each '1'. 

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* The pattern repeats for each of the four objects formed by '1's.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

*  Again, each '1' in all five objects gets a '2' added to its right if possible.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" in the provided DSL to achieve this transformation:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expansion_candidates = frozenset({
      (i, j + 1) 
      for obj in objs
      for i, j in toindices(obj) 
      if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and (i, j + 1) not in toindices(merge(objs)) 
  })
  expanded_objs = recolor(2, expansion_candidates)
  O = paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), obj), objs) | expanded_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts all objects from the input grid `I`.
2. **Identify Expansion Candidates:** The code iterates through each object and its cell indices. It identifies candidate cells for expansion by checking if a cell exists to the right (`j < len(I[0]) - 1`) and if that cell is not already part of any object (`(i, j + 1) not in toindices(merge(objs))`).
3. **Create Expanded Objects:** `expanded_objs = recolor(2, expansion_candidates)` creates new objects from the identified candidates, coloring them with the value '2'.
4. **Paint the Grid:** `O = paint(I, merge(objs | expanded_objs))` paints the original objects and the newly created expanded objects onto the input grid `I` to generate the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  shifted_right = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, 1)), objs) 
  valid_expansion = frozenset({
      loc
      for obj, shifted in zip(objs, shifted_right)
      for loc in toindices(shifted)
      if loc[1] < len(I[0]) and (loc[0], loc[1] - 1) in toindices(obj) and loc not in toindices(merge(objs))
  })
  expanded_objs = recolor(2, valid_expansion)
  O = paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), obj), objs) | expanded_objs)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects and Shift:** It extracts objects and creates `shifted_right` by shifting each object one cell to the right.
2. **Identify Valid Expansion:** It iterates through original and shifted objects, finding cells in `shifted_right` that are within grid bounds, have a corresponding cell to their left in the original object, and are not occupied by other objects.
3. **Create Expanded Objects:** It recolors the valid expansion cells with '2'.
4. **Paint the Grid:** Similar to Version 1, it paints original and expanded objects onto the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expanded_backdrops = apply(lambda obj: backdrop(shift(obj, (0, 1))), objs)
  expansion_area = difference(merge(expanded_backdrops), merge(apply(backdrop, objs))) 
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: obj | recolor(2, intersection(expansion_area, toindices(shift(obj, (0, 1))))), objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects and Calculate Backdrops:** It calculates backdrops of original and right-shifted objects.
2. **Determine Expansion Area:** It finds the difference between the merged backdrops of shifted and original objects, representing potential expansion areas.
3. **Expand Objects:** For each object, it combines the original object with a recoloring of the intersection between the expansion area and the shifted object's indices.
4. **Paint the Grid:** It paints the expanded objects onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expanded_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if j < len(I[0]) - 1: 
        new_cell = (i, j + 1)
        if new_cell not in toindices(merge(objs)):
          expanded_objs.add((color(obj), new_cell))
  O = paint(I, objs | frozenset(expanded_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects and Initialize:** It extracts objects and initializes an empty set `expanded_objs` to store expanded cells.
2. **Iterate and Expand:** It iterates through each object and its cells. For each cell, it checks if a cell to the right is free and within bounds. If so, it adds this new cell with the object's original color to `expanded_objs`.
3. **Paint the Grid:** It combines the original objects and the expanded cells and paints them onto the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j+1] == mostcommon(I):
        O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i,j+1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects and Initialize:**  Extract objects and initialize output `O` as input `I`.
2. **Iterate and Paint:** Iterate through each object and its cells. For each cell, if a cell to the right is the background color and within bounds, paint it with the object's color in the output `O`. 


These five programs demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility of the DSL. Each version uses a distinct combination of DSL functions and logic, offering diverse solutions for the given task.
