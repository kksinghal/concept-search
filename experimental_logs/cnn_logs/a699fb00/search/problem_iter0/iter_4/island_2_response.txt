## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending each contiguous horizontal sequence of '1's in the input grid with a '2' to the right. However, unlike Program_A and Program_B which extend every '1', this transformation only extends the last '1' in each sequence.

**Example:**

Input:
```
1 1 0 1 1 1
```

Output:
```
1 1 0 1 1 2
```

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  def extend_right_last_one(obj):
    rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
    return frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj) | {(2, (uppermost(obj), rightmost_j + 1))}
  objs = objects(I, True, True, False)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(extend_right_last_one, objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, True, False)`:**  Identifies contiguous objects of '1's in the input grid (`I`).
2. **`extend_right_last_one(obj)`:**  For each object, it creates a new object with all original cells and adds a '2' cell to the right of the rightmost '1' cell.
3. **`apply(extend_right_last_one, objs)`:** Applies the `extend_right_last_one` function to each object.
4. **`merge(...)`:**  Combines all the extended objects.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the extended objects onto the original input grid, resulting in the final output.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  def is_right_edge_one(loc):
    i, j = loc
    return index(I, (i, j)) == 1 and (j + 1 == len(I[0]) or index(I, (i, j + 1)) != 1)
  right_edge_ones = sfilter(asindices(I), is_right_edge_one)
  return paint(I, asobject(I) | recolor(2, shift(right_edge_ones, RIGHT)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_right_edge_one(loc)`:**  Checks if a location is a '1' and its right neighbor is either the grid edge or not a '1'.
2. **`sfilter(asindices(I), is_right_edge_one)`:**  Filters all grid indices to get the locations of rightmost '1's in each sequence.
3. **`shift(right_edge_ones, RIGHT)`:**  Shifts the obtained locations one cell to the right.
4. **`recolor(2, ...)`:**  Recolors the shifted locations to '2'.
5. **`paint(I, asobject(I) | ...)`:** Combines the original grid with the '2' extensions and paints them, generating the output grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  def extend_if_last_one(v, loc):
    i, j = loc
    return (v, (i, j)) if j + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j + 1] == 1 else (2 if v == 1 else v, (i, j))
  return astuple(*apply(compose(tuple, rbind(papply, extend_if_last_one)), pair(I, I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_if_last_one(v, loc)`:**  Checks if a cell is a '1' and its right neighbor is also a '1'. If so, it keeps the cell as is. If not, and the cell is a '1', it changes its value to '2'.
2. **`pair(I, I)`:**  Creates pairs of rows from the input grid.
3. **`papply(..., extend_if_last_one)`:**  Applies the `extend_if_last_one` function to each cell of each row.
4. **`compose(tuple, rbind(papply, extend_if_last_one))`:**  Creates a function that applies `papply` with `extend_if_last_one` and converts the result to a tuple.
5. **`apply(..., pair(I, I))`:** Applies the created function to each row pair.
6. **`astuple(* ...)`:**  Converts the result back into a tuple of tuples, creating the output grid.


**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
    def extend_right_conditional(v, loc):
        i, j = loc
        if j + 1 < len(I[0]):
            return (v, (i, j)) if I[i][j + 1] == 1 else (2, (i, j)) if v == 1 else (v, (i, j))
        else:
            return (2, (i, j)) if v == 1 else (v, (i, j))

    new_objects = set()
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, v in enumerate(row):
            new_objects.add(extend_right_conditional(v, (i, j)))
    return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), frozenset(new_objects))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`extend_right_conditional(v, loc)`:** Checks if a cell needs extension based on its value and the value of its right neighbor. 
    - If the current cell is a '1' and it's not the last element in the row, it checks if the next element is also a '1'. If yes, it keeps the current cell as it is. If not, it extends the cell by changing its value to '2'.
    - If the current cell is the last element of the row and its value is '1', it extends the cell by changing its value to '2'.
    - Otherwise, it keeps the cell unchanged.
2. The program then iterates through each cell of the input grid and applies the `extend_right_conditional` function.
3. Finally, it paints the resulting cells onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid to produce the output.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  def is_one_to_extend(i, j):
    return I[i][j] == 1 and (j + 1 == len(I[0]) or I[i][j + 1] != 1)
  new_grid = [[v for v in row] for row in I]
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if is_one_to_extend(i, j):
        if j + 1 < len(I[0]):
          new_grid[i][j + 1] = 2
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_one_to_extend(i, j)`:** This function checks if a cell with value '1' needs to be extended. A '1' needs extension if it's the last element in the row or if its right neighbor is not a '1'.
2. The program creates a new grid (`new_grid`) as a copy of the input grid (`I`).
3. It then iterates through each cell in the input grid and uses the `is_one_to_extend` function to determine if the current cell needs extension.
4. If the current cell needs extension, it changes the value of the cell to the right in the `new_grid` to '2'.
5. Finally, it returns the `new_grid` as the output.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, using various DSL functions and logic. Each version offers a unique perspective on how to solve the problem within the constraints of the DSL.
