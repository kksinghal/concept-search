## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects composed of the digit '1' and placing a '2' to the right of each '1', effectively extending the object horizontally to the right. 

**Example:**

Input:
```
1 0 1
0 1 0
```

Output:
```
1 2 1
0 1 2 
```

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_indices = mapply(lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT), asindices(I)) # Shift all indices right
  filtered_indices = sfilter(shifted_indices, lambda loc: index(I, subtract(loc, RIGHT)) == 1) # Filter for indices right of a '1'
  O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, filtered_indices)) # Paint '2' at filtered indices
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift all indices:** Calculate the indices shifted one position to the right.
2. **Filter indices:** Keep only the shifted indices where the original index (one position left) contains a '1'.
3. **Paint '2's:** Paint the value '2' onto the input grid at the filtered indices.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, 1) # Get indices of all '1's
  right_indices = sfilter(mapply(lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT), ones_indices), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0) # Get indices to the right of '1's that are '0'
  O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, right_indices)) # Paint '2's at the filtered indices
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get '1' indices:** Extract the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **Find right indices:** For each '1' index, calculate the index to its right and filter for those containing '0'.
3. **Paint '2's:** Paint the value '2' at the filtered indices on the input grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == 1:
        O = paint(asobject(O), {(2, (i, j + 1))}) # Paint '2' to the right if current cell is '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through grid:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
2. **Check for '1' and paint:** If the current cell contains a '1', paint a '2' to its right on the output grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones_obj = objects(I, True, False, True) # Extract objects of '1's
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), ones_obj) # Shift each object to the right
  O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, toindices(merge(shifted_objs)))) # Paint '2's at shifted object locations
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '1' objects:** Identify and extract objects consisting of '1's.
2. **Shift objects:** Shift each extracted object one position to the right.
3. **Paint '2's at shifted locations:** Paint '2's at the indices occupied by the shifted objects on the input grid.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_neighbor_is_zero(loc):
    i, j = loc
    return j + 1 < width(I) and I[i][j + 1] == 0

  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, 1) # Get indices of all '1's
  filtered_indices = sfilter(ones_indices, right_neighbor_is_zero) # Filter for '1's with a '0' on the right
  shifted_indices = apply(lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT), filtered_indices) # Shift the filtered indices to the right
  O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, shifted_indices)) # Paint '2's at the shifted indices
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get '1' indices:** Extract indices of cells containing '1'.
2. **Filter for right '0':** Filter the '1' indices, keeping only those with a '0' to their right.
3. **Shift indices:** Shift the filtered indices one position to the right.
4. **Paint '2's:** Paint '2's at the shifted indices on the input grid.

These five versions utilize different approaches and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same outcome, demonstrating diverse code-generation capabilities.
