## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding a '2' to the right of every '1' in the input grid, but only if the '2' remains within the grid boundaries.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The '1's at (0,0), (3,1), and (3,3) each get a '2' added to their right, resulting in (0,1), (3,2), and (3,4) respectively.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* Similar to Input_0, all '1's get a '2' to their right, except for the '1's at the rightmost column, which remain unchanged.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The same logic applies, demonstrating the consistency of the transformation across different input grids.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1]+1 < len(I[0])) # Find valid indices for '2' placement
  shifted_obj = frozenset((2, (i, j+1)) for i, j in shifted_indices if I[i][j] == 1) # Create object with '2' at shifted indices
  O = paint(I, shifted_obj) # Paint the new object onto the input grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `shifted_indices`: Identifies all grid indices where placing a '2' to the right would still be within the grid boundaries.
2. `shifted_obj`: Creates a new object containing only '2's. These '2's are placed at the `shifted_indices` if the corresponding cell in the input grid `I` contains a '1'.
3. `paint(I, shifted_obj)`: Overlays the `shifted_obj` onto the input grid `I`, effectively adding the '2's to the right of existing '1's.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 1 and j+1 < len(row): # Check for '1' and valid right index
        O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j+1))}) # Paint a '2' on the right
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterates through each cell in the input grid `I`.
2. If a cell contains a '1' and there's a valid index to its right:
   -  It directly paints a '2' at the cell to the right.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1) # Get indices of all '1's
  valid_ones = sfilter(ones, lambda loc: loc[1]+1 < len(I[0])) # Filter for '1's with valid right neighbors
  twos = shift(valid_ones, RIGHT) # Shift the valid '1' indices to the right
  O = fill(I, 2, twos) # Fill the shifted indices with '2's
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `ones`: Identifies the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2.  `valid_ones`: Filters out the indices of '1's that are on the rightmost column.
3.  `twos`: Shifts the valid '1' indices one position to the right.
4.  `fill(I, 2, twos)`: Fills the cells at the `twos` indices with '2's.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Create an empty canvas
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True): # Iterate through objects (assumed to be single-colored)
    O = paint(O, obj) # Paint the object onto the canvas
    if rightmost(obj) + 1 < len(I[0]): # If there's space on the right
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, RIGHT)) # Paint a copy of the object shifted to the right
      O = fill(O, 2, intersection(toindices(shift(obj, RIGHT)), asindices(I))) # Fill the overlapping area with '2's
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  Creates an empty canvas of the same size and background color as the input.
2.  Iterates over each object in the input (assuming objects are single-colored).
3.  Paints the object onto the canvas.
4.  If there's space to the right of the object, paints a copy of the object shifted one position to the right. 
5.  Fills the overlapping area between the original object and its shifted copy with '2's, achieving the desired effect.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_one = asobject(I) # Convert grid to object
  shifted_obj = shift(obj_one, RIGHT) # Shift the entire object to the right
  valid_indices = toindices(shifted_obj) & asindices(I) # Find indices valid in both original and shifted positions
  filtered_obj = frozenset((2, index) for value, index in shifted_obj if index in valid_indices) # Create new object with '2' at valid indices
  O = paint(I, filtered_obj) # Paint the new object onto the input grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Converts the entire input grid into a single object.
2. Shifts the object one position to the right.
3. Finds the indices that are valid in both the original object and the shifted object.
4. Creates a new object containing only '2's placed at the valid, overlapping indices.
5. Paints this new object onto the input grid, achieving the '2' placement.

These five versions showcase different approaches to solving the problem, utilizing various DSL functions and logic. Each version achieves the same desired transformation while remaining distinct in their implementation.
