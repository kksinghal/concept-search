## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying cells with the value '1' and placing a '2' to the right of them. The original '1' remains unchanged.  

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

* The '1' at (0,0) results in a '2' at (0,1)
* The '1' at (3,1) results in a '2' at (3,2)
* The '1' at (3,3) results in a '2' at (3,4)

**Input_1 & Input_2:**

* The same logic applies to Input_1 and Input_2. Every '1' gets a '2' placed immediately to its right.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(2, shift(ofcolor(I, 1), (0, 1)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`:**  Identifies the indices of all cells in the input grid (I) that contain the value '1'.
2. **`shift(..., (0, 1))`:** Shifts these indices one position to the right.
3. **`recolor(2, ...)`:** Creates a new object with the value '2' at the shifted indices.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the new object onto the original input grid, effectively placing the '2's.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  shifted_ones = apply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), ones)
  return fill(I, 2, shifted_ones)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = ofcolor(I, 1)`:**  Finds indices of all '1's in the input.
2. **`shifted_ones = ...`:**  Applies a lambda function to shift each index one position to the right.
3. **`fill(I, 2, ...)`:** Fills the grid 'I' with '2' at the shifted indices.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_canvas = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 1 and j < len(row) - 1:
        shifted_canvas = fill(shifted_canvas, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
  return cellwise(I, shifted_canvas, 0)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_canvas = ...`:** Creates an empty canvas of the same size as the input.
2. **`for i, row...`:** Iterates through the input grid.
3. **`if val == 1 ...`:**  If a '1' is found, and it's not on the right edge, a '2' is placed in the corresponding cell on the shifted canvas.
4. **`return cellwise(I, shifted_canvas, 0)`:**  Combines the original grid and shifted canvas, keeping values from the original grid where they differ.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  right_shifted_I = shift(asobject(I), (0,1))
  filtered_right_shifted_I = sfilter(right_shifted_I, lambda cell: index(I, subtract(cell[1], (0,1))) == 1)
  return paint(I, recolor(2, toindices(filtered_right_shifted_I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`right_shifted_I = ...`:**  Shifts the entire input grid one position to the right.
2. **`filtered_right_shifted_I = ...`:** Filters the shifted grid, keeping only the cells whose left neighbor in the original grid is '1'.
3. **`return paint(I, recolor(2, ...))`:** Paints '2' onto the original grid at the indices of the filtered cells. 

**Program Version 5:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  new_grid = canvas(0, (h,w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and j < w - 1:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
  return cellwise(I, new_grid, 0)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h, w = shape(I)`:**  Gets the height and width of the input grid.
2. **`new_grid = ...`:**  Creates an empty canvas of the same size as the input.
3. **`for i in range(h):`:** Iterates through rows.
4. **`for j in range(w):`:**  Iterates through columns.
5. **`if I[i][j] == 1 and j < w - 1:`:** If a '1' is found, and it's not on the right edge, a '2' is placed in the corresponding cell on the new grid.
6. **`return cellwise(I, new_grid, 0)`:** Combines the original grid and the new grid.

These five versions showcase different approaches to solving the transformation using the DSL. Each utilizes distinct logic and function combinations to achieve the desired output.
