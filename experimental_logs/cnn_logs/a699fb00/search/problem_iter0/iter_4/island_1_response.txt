## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves expanding objects to the right by one cell, but only if the cell is empty and within the grid boundaries. The newly added cells are filled with the value '2'.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- The '1' objects at (0,0) and (3,1) are expanded to the right, filling (0,1) and (3,2) with '2' respectively.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- All '1' objects are expanded to the right, adding a '2' to their immediate right if the space is empty.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

- Similar to the previous examples, '1' objects are expanded rightwards, filling the adjacent empty cell with '2'.

## Program to be Generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: obj | frozenset(
      (2, (i, j + 1))
      for i, j in toindices(obj)
      if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and (i, j + 1) not in toindices(objs)
  ), objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(objs | expanded_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all distinct objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Expand each object:** `mapply` applies a lambda function to each object. The function calculates potential right expansions using `(i, j + 1)` and adds them to the object as a new cell with value '2' if the following conditions are met:
    - The current cell is not on the right edge of the grid (`j < len(I[0]) - 1`).
    - The expansion cell is not already occupied by any other object (`(i, j + 1) not in toindices(objs)`).
3. **Combine and paint:**  The original objects and their expansions are combined using `merge`. This combined set of cells is then painted onto the original grid using `paint` to generate the output grid `O`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and (i, j + 1) not in toindices(objs):
        O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j + 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Iterate and paint:** This version iterates through each object and its cell indices. If an expansion to the right is possible (same conditions as version 1), it directly paints a new cell with value '2' onto the output grid `O`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_right = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, 1)), objects(I, T, F, T))
  valid_expansion = mapply(
      lambda obj, shifted: sfilter(
          toindices(shifted), lambda loc: loc[1] < len(I[0]) and (loc[0], loc[1] - 1) in toindices(obj) and loc not in toindices(objects(I, T, F, T))
      ),
      objects(I, T, F, T),
      shifted_right
  )
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj, valid: obj | recolor(2, valid), objects(I, T, F, T), valid_expansion)
  O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift right:** It shifts all objects one cell to the right using `shift`.
2. **Filter valid expansions:**  For each original object and its shifted counterpart, it filters the indices of the shifted object. An index is valid if:
    - It's within the grid boundary.
    - The cell to its left belongs to the original object (ensuring it's a direct expansion).
    - The cell is not occupied by any other object.
3. **Recolor and combine:** The valid expansion indices are then recolored to '2' and combined with their respective original objects.
4. **Paint:** Similar to version 1.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expansion_area = difference(
        mapply(lambda obj: backdrop(shift(obj, (0, 1))), objs),
        mapply(backdrop, objs)
    )
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: obj | recolor(2, intersection(expansion_area, toindices(shift(obj, (0, 1))))), objs)
  O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate potential expansion area:** This version calculates the difference between the backdrops of the original objects and their right-shifted versions. This difference represents the potential expansion area.
2. **Find valid expansions within the area:** For each object, it finds the intersection between the potential expansion area and the object's right-shifted indices. These intersections represent the valid expansion cells.
3. **Recolor, combine, and paint:** Similar to version 3.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1):
      for i in range(len(I)):
        if I[i][j] != 0 and I[i][j + 1] == 0:
          O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j + 1))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through grid:** This version iterates through each cell in the input grid except for the last column.
2. **Check for expansion:**  For each cell, it checks if it's part of an object (non-zero value) and if the cell to its right is empty.
3. **Paint expansion:** If both conditions are met, it paints the right cell with the value '2'. This direct iteration approach eliminates the need for explicitly identifying and manipulating objects.
