## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected components) of the same color in the input grid and extending them one cell to the right. The extension only happens if the cell to the right is empty (background color). 

**Here's a breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The '1' objects are extended to the right, filling the empty '0' cells.
* **Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0, the '1' objects are extended to the right where possible.
* **Input_2:**  The pattern continues; '1' objects are extended to the right into empty cells. 

The newly filled cells are assigned the value '2', differentiating them from the original object cells.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using different logic and DSL functions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  right_indices = frozenset({(i, j + 1) for obj in objs for i, j in toindices(obj) if j < len(I[0]) - 1})
  valid_expansion = intersection(right_indices, ofcolor(I, 0))
  expanded_objs = recolor(2, valid_expansion) 
  O = paint(I, expanded_objs | apply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), obj), objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects (connected components of the same color) in the input grid `I`.
2. **Potential Expansion:** `right_indices` calculates the indices of cells directly to the right of each object cell, only if they are within the grid bounds.
3. **Valid Expansion:** `valid_expansion` finds the intersection of potential expansion cells (`right_indices`) and cells containing the background color '0' (`ofcolor(I, 0)`).
4. **Expand Objects:** `expanded_objs` recolors the `valid_expansion` cells to '2'.
5. **Combine and Paint:** The original objects (recolored to their original colors) and the `expanded_objs` are combined and painted onto the input grid `I` to create the output `O`. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  shifted_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, 1)), objs)
  expansion_area = difference(merge(apply(backdrop, shifted_objs)), merge(apply(backdrop, objs)))
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: obj | recolor(2, intersection(expansion_area, toindices(obj))), shifted_objs)
  O = paint(I, expanded_objs)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Shift:**  Identify objects and create `shifted_objs` by shifting each object one cell to the right.
2. **Expansion Area:** Calculate the difference between the bounding boxes of the shifted objects and original objects. This `expansion_area` represents the new cells added by shifting.
3. **Expand Objects:** For each shifted object, combine it with the recolor(2, ...) of the intersection of the `expansion_area` and the object itself. 
4. **Paint:** Paint the `expanded_objs` onto the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expansion_candidates = frozenset({(i, j + 1) for obj in objs for i, j in toindices(obj) if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 0})
  expanded_objs = recolor(2, expansion_candidates)
  O = paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), obj), objs) | expanded_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Expansion Candidates:** Directly identify potential expansion cells by checking if a cell to the right exists, is within the grid bounds, and has a value of 0.
3. **Expand Objects:** Recolor the `expansion_candidates` to '2'.
4. **Combine and Paint:** Similar to Version 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expanded_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if j < len(I[0]) - 1 and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0:
        expanded_objs.add(((i, j + 1), 2))
  O = paint(I, objs | frozenset({(color(obj), idx) for obj in objs for idx in obj} | expanded_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Iterative Expansion:** Iterate through objects and their cells. If a cell can be expanded to the right, add the new cell index and color '2' to `expanded_objs`.
3. **Combine and Paint:** Combine the original objects, reformatted with color and index, with the `expanded_objs`, and paint them onto the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grid = hconcat(I, ((0,) * len(I[0]),))
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: obj | recolor(2, intersection(toindices(obj), ofcolor(shifted_grid, 0))), apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, 1)), objs))
  O = paint(I, expanded_objs) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Grid:**  Create a `shifted_grid` by concatenating the input grid with a column of zeros on the right.
2. **Identify Objects and Shift:** Similar to previous versions.
3. **Expansion using Shifted Grid:**  For each shifted object, find the intersection between its indices and the indices of zeros in the `shifted_grid`. These intersections represent valid expansion points. Recolor these intersections to '2' and combine them with the original object.
4. **Paint:** Paint the `expanded_objs` onto the input grid.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic.
