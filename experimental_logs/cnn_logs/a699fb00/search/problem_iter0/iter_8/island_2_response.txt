## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects comprised of '1's to the right with a trail of '2's. However, the trail only extends within the bounds of the original object. In other words, if another object or the edge of the grid is encountered, the trail stops.

**Input 0:**
- The single '1' objects in the top row are extended by one '2'.
- The '1' objects in the bottom row are also extended by one '2'.

**Input 1:**
- The longer horizontal '1' objects are extended by two '2's.
- Single '1' objects are extended by one '2'.

**Input 2:**
- Similar to Input 1, the trail length depends on the object's horizontal size.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct programs using the provided DSL to achieve the desired transformation:


**Program Version 1:** (Inspired by Program_B's use of `ofcolor` and object manipulation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1) # Find all '1' indices
  extensions = mfilter(ones, lambda ij: (ij[0], ij[1] + 1) not in ones and index(I, (ij[0], ij[1] + 1)) == 0) # Identify valid extension points
  return paint(I, asobject(I) | recolor(2, extensions)) # Paint extensions as '2'

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' cells:**  `ones = ofcolor(I, 1)` gets the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **Find valid extension points:** `extensions` uses `mfilter` to select indices from `ones` that meet the criteria for extension:
    - The cell to the right is not part of the same '1' object (`(ij[0], ij[1] + 1) not in ones`).
    - The cell to the right is empty (`index(I, (ij[0], ij[1] + 1)) == 0`).
3. **Paint extensions:**  `paint` combines the original grid (`asobject(I)`) with the `extensions` after recoloring them to '2' (`recolor(2, extensions)`).



**Program Version 2:** (Focuses on row-by-row processing, similar to the initial error-causing programs)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_row(row):
    new_row = list(row) # Create a mutable copy for modification
    for j in range(len(row) - 1):
      if row[j] == 1 and row[j + 1] == 0:
        new_row[j + 1] = 2 # Extend with '2' if conditions are met
    return tuple(new_row)
  return tuple(process_row(row) for row in I)

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:** The code processes each row of the input grid `I`.
2. **Process each row:** `process_row` iterates through each cell in the row.
3. **Extend with '2':** If a cell contains '1' and the cell to its right is '0', the '0' is replaced with '2'.
4. **Return modified grid:** The modified rows are combined into a new grid and returned.



**Program Version 3:** (Utilizes `hconcat` for a split-and-combine approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(hconcat(left, ((2,) + right[1:]) if left[-1] == 1 and right[0] == 0 else right) for left, right in pair(I, ((0,) * len(I[0]),) + I))

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Prepare for pairwise comparison:**  Pairs each row with the row to its right after prepending a row of zeros to handle edge cases.
2. **Concatenate with extension:**  For each pair:
    - If the last element of the left row is '1' and the first element of the right row is '0', concatenate the left row with a modified right row where the first element ('0') is replaced with '2'.
    - Otherwise, concatenate the rows without modification.
3. **Return modified grid:** The concatenated rows form the output grid.




**Program Version 4:** (Employs a recursive approach to extend the trail)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def extend_right(grid, i, j):
        if j + 1 < len(grid[0]) and grid[i][j + 1] == 0:
            grid = fill(grid, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
            return extend_right(grid, i, j + 1)
        return grid

    new_grid = I
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val == 1:
                new_grid = extend_right(new_grid, i, j)
    return new_grid

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Extend:** Iterates through the grid, and for each '1', calls the `extend_right` function.
2. **Recursive Extension:** `extend_right` recursively checks if the cell to the right is within the grid bounds and has a value of '0'. If so, it fills it with '2' and calls itself again for the next cell to the right.
3. **Return Modified Grid:** Returns the modified grid with the extended trails.


**Program Version 5:** (Leverages object detection and manipulation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, False)  # Get all objects
    new_objs = set()
    for obj in objs:
        if color(obj) == 1:
            rightmost_cells = argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1])  # Find rightmost cells in the object
            for cell in rightmost_cells:
                i, j = cell[1]
                if j + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0:
                    obj = obj | {(2, (i, j + 1))}  # Extend the object with a '2'
        new_objs.add(obj)
    return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(new_objs)) # Paint modified objects onto an empty canvas

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Detect Objects:** Identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Process '1' Objects:** For each object, if it's composed of '1's:
    - Find the rightmost cells of the object.
    - For each rightmost cell, check if it can be extended to the right (within bounds and with an empty cell).
    - If so, extend the object by adding a cell with value '2' to the right.
3. **Paint Modified Objects:**  Paint the modified objects onto a blank canvas to create the output grid.

These five program versions provide diverse implementations for achieving the target transformation in the input-output examples. Each utilizes different combinations of DSL functions, offering varied approaches to the problem.
