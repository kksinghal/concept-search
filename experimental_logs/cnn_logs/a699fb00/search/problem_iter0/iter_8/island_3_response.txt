## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects formed by the digit '1' to the right by one cell, coloring the extension with the digit '2'. 

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0:** The single '1' objects at (0,0) and (0,2) are extended to the right by one cell with a '2'. The object at (3,1) is extended similarly.
* **Input_1:**  The same pattern applies. Each '1' object is extended to the right with a '2', but only if there's space within the grid boundary.
* **Input_2:** This input reinforces the pattern. Objects are extended with '2's only within the grid boundaries. 

## Code Improvement:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated", inspired by the given (unprovided) programs and optimized for the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1) # Find indices of all '1's
  right_shift = lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1) # Define right shift function
  extended_indices = mfilter(one_indices, lambda loc: right_shift(loc)[1] < len(I[0])) # Filter indices with valid right shifts
  extension = frozenset((2, right_shift(loc)) for loc in extended_indices) # Create extension objects
  O = paint(I, extension) # Paint extensions onto the grid
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1's:** `one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)` finds the locations of all '1's in the grid.
2. **Right Shift Function:** `right_shift = lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)` defines a function to shift a location one cell to the right.
3. **Valid Shifts:** `extended_indices = mfilter(one_indices, lambda loc: right_shift(loc)[1] < len(I[0]))` filters the '1' locations, keeping only those that can be shifted right without exceeding the grid boundary.
4. **Create Extension:** `extension = frozenset((2, right_shift(loc)) for loc in extended_indices)` creates a set of tuples representing the extended cells, with value '2' and shifted locations. 
5. **Paint Extension:** `O = paint(I, extension)` paints the extension onto the input grid, creating the output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1):
            if I[i][j] == 1:
                O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j + 1))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Paint:** This version iterates through the grid cell by cell.
2. **Check for '1':** If a cell contains a '1', it paints a '2' in the cell immediately to the right, effectively extending the object.
3. **Grid Boundary Check:** The loop iterates only until the second-to-last column, preventing out-of-bounds errors.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False) # Extract objects from the grid
  extended_objs = frozenset(frozenset((v, (i, j)) if j == rightmost(obj_indices) else (2, (i, j))) 
                          for obj in objs 
                          for obj_indices in [toindices(obj)] 
                          for v, (i, j) in obj if j + 1 <= len(I[0])) 
  O = paint(I, merge(extended_objs)) # Paint the extended objects onto the original grid
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** `objs = objects(...)` identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Rightmost Extension:** It iterates through each object, finding its rightmost cell (`rightmost(obj_indices)`). 
3. **Conditional Painting:** It then paints all cells of the object, but if a cell is the rightmost one and within the grid boundary, it paints a '2' one cell to the right. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted = shift(recolor(2, ofcolor(I, 1)), RIGHT) # Shift the '1's to the right and recolor them to '2'
  O = underpaint(I, shifted) # Paint the shifted '2's onto the original grid only where the original grid has the background color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift and Recolor:**  Finds all '1's, recolors them to '2', and shifts the resulting object one cell to the right.
2. **Underpaint:** `underpaint` cleverly paints the shifted '2's onto the original grid, but only where the original grid has the background color (most common color), ensuring the original '1's remain.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_cells = toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I)  # Get object containing all '1' cells
  extensions = mfilter(one_cells, lambda cell: cell[1][1] + 1 < len(I[0])) # Get '1' cells with valid right shifts
  extensions = apply(lambda cell: (2, (cell[1][0], cell[1][1] + 1)), extensions) # Create extensions
  O = paint(I, extensions)  # Paint the extensions onto the original grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract '1' Cells:** `one_cells = toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I)` extracts an object containing all cells with the value '1'.
2. **Filter for Valid Shifts:** `extensions = mfilter(one_cells, lambda cell: cell[1][1] + 1 < len(I[0]))` filters the '1' cells, keeping only those where a right shift is possible within the grid boundary.
3. **Create Extensions:**  `extensions = apply(lambda cell: (2, (cell[1][0], cell[1][1] + 1)), extensions)` creates the extension objects by adding '1' to the column index and setting the value to '2'.
4. **Paint Extensions:** `O = paint(I, extensions)` paints the extensions onto the original grid.

These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressive power of the provided DSL.
