## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected components) within the input grid and extending them to the right by one cell, filling the new cell with the value '2'. The original structure of the objects remains unchanged. 

**Example:**

Input: 
```
0 1 0 
1 1 1 
0 1 0 
```
Output:
```
0 1 2 
1 1 1 
0 1 2 
```

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL:


### Version 1:

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify all objects
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((color(obj), (i, j + 1)) if j < rightmost(obj) else (color(obj), (i, j)) for i, j in toindices(obj)), objs)  # Expand each object to the right with '2's
  O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))  # Paint the expanded objects onto the input grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We use `objects(I, T, F, T)` to identify all connected components (objects) within the input grid `I`. 
2. **Expand Objects:** For each object, we iterate through its indices `(i, j)`. If `j` is less than the rightmost column of the object (`j < rightmost(obj)`), we create a new cell to the right `(i, j + 1)` with the object's color and the value '2'. Otherwise, we keep the original cell.
3. **Paint Objects:** Finally, we merge all expanded objects and paint them onto the input grid `I` using `paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))`.


### Version 2:

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  shifted_indices = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((i, j + 1) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j < rightmost(obj)), objs) # Find indices to the right of each object
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj, indices: obj | recolor(2, indices), objs, shifted_indices) # Combine original object with recoloured shifted indices
  O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** We identify objects using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Find Shifted Indices:** For each object, we calculate the indices one position to the right, only if the original index is not on the rightmost edge of the object.
3. **Expand and Recolor:** We combine the original object with the shifted indices, recoloring the shifted indices to '2' using `recolor(2, indices)`.
4. **Paint Objects:** Finally, we paint the merged expanded objects onto the input grid. 


### Version 3:

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: obj | recolor(2, difference(backdrop(shift(obj, (0, 1))), backdrop(obj))), objs) # Add right-shifted backdrop difference, recolored to '2'
  O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify objects using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Expand Objects:** For each object, we calculate the difference between the backdrop of the object shifted one position to the right and the backdrop of the original object. This difference represents the newly added cells on the right. We then recolor these cells to '2' and add them to the original object.
3. **Paint Objects:** Paint the merged expanded objects onto the input grid.


### Version 4:

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  right_edges = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((i, rightmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)), objs) # Get right edge indices of each object
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj, edge: obj | recolor(2, shift(edge, (0, 1))), objs, right_edges) # Shift right edge and recolor to '2', then add to original object
  O = paint(I, merge(expanded_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identify objects using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Get Right Edges:** For each object, we extract the indices of its rightmost edge.
3. **Expand and Recolor:** We shift the right edge indices one position to the right and recolor these shifted indices to '2'. Then, we combine the original object with the shifted and recolored edge.
4. **Paint Objects:** Paint the merged expanded objects onto the input grid.

### Version 5:

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset((color(obj), (i, j + 1)) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j + 1 not in {j for _, (x, j) in obj}), objs) # Find empty cells to the right and fill with '2'
  O = paint(I, merge(objs | expanded_objs)) # Combine original and expanded objects before painting
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Identify objects using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Find Empty Cells and Fill:** For each object, we iterate through its indices. If the cell to the right of the current index is empty (not in the object), we create a new cell with the object's color and value '2'.
3. **Paint Objects:** We combine the original objects with the expanded cells and then paint them onto the input grid.

These are five distinct program versions that achieve the desired transformation. Each version uses a different approach, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
