## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions) of the digit '1' in the input grid and adding a '2' to the right of each '1' if that cell is empty (contains a '0').

**Input 0:**

- Two objects of '1' are present.
- For both objects, a '2' is added to the right of each '1'.

**Input 1:**

- Six objects of '1' are present.
-  A '2' is added to the right of each '1' in all objects.

**Input 2:**

- Seven objects of '1' are present.
-  A '2' is added to the right of each '1' in all objects.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grid = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)
  O = cellwise(asobject(I), shifted_grid, 0)
  O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, ofcolor(O, 1)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift the grid:** `shifted_grid = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)` creates an object representation of the input grid shifted one cell to the right.
2. **Find cells right of '1':**  `O = cellwise(asobject(I), shifted_grid, 0)` compares the original and shifted grids. If a cell contains '1' and its right neighbor is also '1', the corresponding cell in `O` is marked as '1'. Otherwise, it's marked as '0'.
3. **Recolor '1' to '2':** `O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, ofcolor(O, 1)))` recolors the cells marked as '1' in `O` (which represent cells to the right of '1' in the original grid) to '2'.
4. **Return the modified grid:** `return O` returns the transformed grid.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = objects(I, True, False, True)
  twos = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), ones)
  O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, merge(toindices(twos))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' objects:** `ones = objects(I, True, False, True)` finds all connected regions of '1's.
2. **Shift objects right:** `twos = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), ones)` shifts each '1' object one position to the right.
3. **Recolor shifted cells:** `O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, merge(toindices(twos))))` recolors the cells corresponding to the shifted objects to '2' in the original grid.
4. **Return modified grid:** `return O` returns the final grid.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
        for v, (i, j) in obj:
            if j+1 < width(I) and I[i][j+1] == 0:
                O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j+1)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through '1' objects:** The code iterates through each object found in the input grid using `objects(I, True, False, True)`.
2. **Iterate through object cells:** For each cell within an object, it checks if the cell to the right is within the grid boundaries and contains a '0'.
3. **Fill with '2':** If the conditions are met, the cell to the right is filled with '2' using `fill(O, 2, {(i, j+1)})`.
4. **Return modified grid:** `return O` returns the modified grid. 

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = paint(asobject(I), recolor(2, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == 1 and index(I, loc) == 0)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find cells right of '1' with '0':** `mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == 1 and index(I, loc) == 0)` identifies indices in the grid where the cell contains '0' and the cell to its right contains '1'.
2. **Recolor identified cells:** `recolor(2, ...)` recolors the identified cells to '2'.
3. **Paint on the original grid:** `paint(asobject(I), ...)` applies the recoloring to the original grid.
4. **Return the transformed grid:** `return O` returns the transformed grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_of_one(loc):
    i, j = loc
    return j+1 < width(I) and I[i][j+1] == 1 and I[i][j] == 0
  
  O = asobject(I)
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, mfilter(asindices(I), right_of_one)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define helper function:** `right_of_one(loc)` checks if a given location is '0' and has a '1' to its right.
2. **Find target cells:** `mfilter(asindices(I), right_of_one)` identifies the cells that need recoloring.
3. **Recolor and paint:** `paint(O, recolor(2, ...))` applies the recoloring to the grid.
4. **Return modified grid:** `return O` returns the transformed grid. 

These are five different versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation. Each version uses different combinations of functions and logic, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
