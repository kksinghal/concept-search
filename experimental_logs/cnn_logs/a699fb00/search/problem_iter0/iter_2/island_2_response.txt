## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected components of the same value) in the input grid and extending them to the right by one cell with the value '2' if the object's value is '1'. 

**Input 0:**

- Two objects with value '1' are present.
- Both objects are extended to the right by one cell with the value '2'.

**Input 1:**

- Five objects with value '1' are present.
- Each object is extended to the right by one cell with the value '2'.

**Input 2:**

- Six objects with value '1' are present.
- Each object is extended to the right by one cell with the value '2'.

## Program to be generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, True, False) # Identify objects in the grid
  new_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    new_obj = set(obj)  # Create a copy of the object
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if v == 1:
        new_obj.add((2, (i, j + 1))) # Add the extension to the right
    new_objs.add(frozenset(new_obj))
  O = paint(I, merge(new_objs)) # Paint the modified objects back onto the grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, True, False)` identifies connected components (objects) with the same value in the grid.
2. **Iterate and Extend:** The code iterates through each object. If an object's value (`v`) is '1', it adds a new cell with value '2' to the right of each cell in the object.
3. **Paint Modified Objects:** Finally, it paints the modified objects back onto the original grid, resulting in the desired output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, mapply(lambda obj: obj | frozenset({(2, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if v == 1}), objects(I, True, True, False)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a more functional approach:

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, True, False)` identifies objects as before.
2. **Extend Using `mapply`:** `mapply` applies a lambda function to each object. The lambda function adds a cell with value '2' to the right of each '1'-valued cell within the object.
3. **Paint Directly:** `paint` directly paints the result of the `mapply` operation (extended objects) onto the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)  # Get indices of all '1' cells
  extensions = shift(ones, RIGHT) # Calculate indices of extension cells
  return paint(I, asobject(I) | recolor(2, extensions)) # Paint extensions with value '2'
```

**Explanation:**

This version focuses on cell indices:

1. **Locate '1' Cells:** `ofcolor(I, 1)` finds indices of all cells containing the value '1'.
2. **Calculate Extension Indices:** `shift(ones, RIGHT)` shifts the indices to the right, obtaining the locations for extensions.
3. **Paint Extensions:** `recolor(2, extensions)` creates an object with value '2' at the extension indices. This object is then combined with the original grid object using `asobject(I)` and painted onto the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, shift(I, RIGHT), lambda x, y: 2 if x == 1 else x)
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages the `cellwise` function:

1. **Shift Grid:** `shift(I, RIGHT)` shifts the entire grid to the right.
2. **Cellwise Comparison and Replacement:** `cellwise` compares the original and shifted grids. If a cell in the original grid has value '1', the corresponding cell in the output grid is set to '2'. Otherwise, the original cell value is retained.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def extend_right(grid, i, j):
    if 0 <= j + 1 < len(grid[0]) and grid[i][j] == 1:
      grid[i][j + 1] = 2
    return grid

  return tuple(tuple(v for v in r) for i, r in enumerate(apply(lambda row: apply(rbind(extend_right, i), enumerate(row)), I)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through rows and cells, modifying the grid directly:

1. **Define `extend_right`:** This helper function takes the grid, row index (`i`), and column index (`j`) as input. If the current cell is '1' and within bounds, it sets the cell to the right to '2'.
2. **Iterate and Apply:** The code iterates through rows and cells, applying `extend_right` to each cell. The `apply` function helps with iterating and modifying the grid structure.
3. **Return Modified Grid:** Finally, it returns the modified grid as a tuple of tuples.


Each of these programs achieves the desired transformation by identifying objects or specific cell locations and then extending them to the right with the value '2' if the original value is '1'.
