## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding a '2' to the right of any '1' that has a '0' to its immediate right. Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* (0,0): '1' remains unchanged as there's no '0' to its right.
* (0,1): A '2' is added after the '1' as it's followed by a '0'.
* (0,2): '1' remains unchanged.
* (3,1): A '2' is added after the '1'. 
* Other positions remain unchanged.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* This input has multiple horizontal sequences of '1 0 1 0...'. The same rule is applied to each sequence. 
* Notice that '2' is not added after the last '1' in a sequence if it doesn't have a '0' following it.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The transformation is applied consistently, regardless of the arrangement of '1's and '0's, targeting only '1 0' sequences.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          2 if j > 0 and row[j - 1] == 1 and v == 0 else v
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This program iterates through each cell in the grid. If a cell contains '0' and the cell to its left contains '1', it replaces the '0' with a '2'. Otherwise, it keeps the original cell value. This effectively implements the desired transformation.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          branch(j > 0 and row[j-1] == 1 and v == 0, 2, v) 
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses the `branch` function for a more explicit conditional approach. For each cell, it checks if it's a '0' preceded by a '1'. If true, it returns '2'; otherwise, it returns the original cell value.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_right = ((0,) * len(I[0]),) + I
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          branch(left[-1] == 1 and right[0] == 0, (2,) + right[1:], right)
          for left, right in pair(I, shifted_right)
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a slightly different approach by creating a shifted copy of the input grid. It then iterates through pairs of rows from the original and shifted grids. If the last element of the left row is '1' and the first element of the right row is '0', it prepends '2' to the right row. Otherwise, it keeps the right row unchanged. This achieves the same result with a focus on row comparisons.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
        branch(index(I, (i, j - 1)) == 1 and v == 0, 2, v)
        for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages the `index` function to directly access the value of the cell to the left. For each cell, it checks if the cell to its left has a value of '1' and the current cell has a value of '0'. If both conditions are met, it replaces the current cell value with a '2'. Otherwise, it retains the original cell value.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      papply(
          lambda left, right: 2 if left == 1 and right == 0 else right,
          (0,) + row[:-1],
          row
      )
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the `papply` function to process pairs of adjacent elements within each row. It creates a shifted version of each row, prepending a '0' to account for the boundary condition. Then, `papply` applies a lambda function that checks if the left element is '1' and the right element is '0'. If true, it returns '2'; otherwise, it returns the right element. This concisely implements the transformation with a focus on pairwise element processing.


Each of these program versions utilizes different DSL functions and logic to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
