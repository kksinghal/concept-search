## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

**For each object (connected group of the same digit excluding the background digit which is the most frequent) in the input grid, recolor the rightmost pixel of that object to the value '2'.**

**Detailed Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:**
    * Two objects are present: one at the top and one at the bottom.
    * The rightmost pixel of each object is recolored to '2'.
* **Input_1:**
    * Multiple objects are present.
    * The rightmost pixel of each object is recolored to '2'.
* **Input_2:**
    * Similar to Input_1, multiple objects are present.
    * The rightmost pixel of each object is recolored to '2'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_rightmost(obj):
    j_max = rightmost(obj)
    return frozenset(((2 if j == j_max else v), (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj)
  return paint(I, frozenset(recolor_rightmost(obj) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`recolor_rightmost(obj)` Function:** 
   - Takes an object as input.
   - `j_max = rightmost(obj)`: Finds the column index (`j`) of the rightmost pixel in the object.
   - `return frozenset(...)`: Iterates through each pixel `(v, (i, j))` in the object:
      - If `j == j_max` (pixel is in the rightmost column), it changes the value (`v`) to '2'.
      - Otherwise, keeps the original value.
      - Returns a new object with the modified pixel.

2. **Main Program:**
   - `objects(I, T, F, T)`: Extracts all objects from the input grid (`I`) considering connected pixels with the same value, excluding the background (most frequent color).
   - `frozenset(recolor_rightmost(obj) for obj in ...)`: Applies the `recolor_rightmost` function to each extracted object and creates a new set of modified objects.
   - `paint(I, ...)`: Paints the modified objects onto the original input grid (`I`), effectively recoloring the rightmost pixels of each object.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_rightmost(obj):
    rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
    return frozenset((2 if j == rightmost_j else v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj)
  return paint(I, frozenset(recolor_rightmost(obj) for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`recolor_rightmost(obj)` Function:**
   - Takes an object as input.
   - `rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)`: Calculates the column index of the rightmost pixel in the object.
   - `return frozenset(...)`: Iterates through all pixels in the object and recolors the rightmost pixel of each object to '2'.

2. **Main Program:**
   - `objects(I, True, False, True)`: Identifies all objects within the input grid, treating connected pixels with the same color as a single object, and excluding the background color.
   - `frozenset(recolor_rightmost(obj) for obj in ...)`: Applies the `recolor_rightmost` function to modify each object.
   - `paint(I, ...)`: Overlays the modified objects onto the original input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def rightmost_pixel(obj):
    return max(obj, key=lambda x: x[1][1])
  def recolor_obj(obj):
    v, (i, j) = rightmost_pixel(obj)
    return frozenset({(2, (i, j))}).union(obj - {(v, (i, j))})
  return paint(I, frozenset(recolor_obj(obj) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`rightmost_pixel(obj)` Function:**
   - Takes an object as input.
   - `return max(obj, key=lambda x: x[1][1])`: Determines the rightmost pixel within the object by comparing the column indices (`x[1][1]`) of the pixels.

2. **`recolor_obj(obj)` Function:**
   - Takes an object as input.
   - `v, (i, j) = rightmost_pixel(obj)`: Extracts the value and coordinates of the rightmost pixel.
   - `return frozenset({(2, (i, j))}).union(obj - {(v, (i, j))})` :  Creates a new object where the rightmost pixel is replaced with the desired color ('2').

3. **Main Program:**
   - `objects(I, T, F, T)`: Extracts distinct objects from the input grid.
   - `frozenset(recolor_obj(obj) for obj in ...)`: Applies the `recolor_obj` function to each object.
   - `paint(I, ...)`: Paints the modified objects back onto the input grid, effectively recoloring the rightmost pixels.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modify_object(obj):
    max_j = max(j for _, (i, j) in obj)
    return frozenset((2 if j == max_j else c, (i, j)) for c, (i, j) in obj)
  return paint(I, frozenset(modify_object(obj) for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`modify_object(obj)` Function:**
   - Takes an object as input.
   - `max_j = max(j for _, (i, j) in obj)`: Finds the maximum column index (j) within the object.
   - `return frozenset(...)`: Iterates through each pixel in the object:
     - If a pixel's column index matches `max_j` (rightmost column), its color is set to '2'.
     - Otherwise, the pixel's color remains unchanged.
   - Returns a modified object with the rightmost pixel recolored.

2. **Main Program:**
   - `objects(I, True, False, True)`: Extracts all objects from the input grid, considering connected pixels of the same color while excluding the background color.
   - `frozenset(modify_object(obj) for obj in ...)`: Applies the `modify_object` function to each extracted object.
   - `paint(I, ...)`: Overlays the modified objects back onto the original input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_pixel(obj):
    max_j = max(j for _, (i, j) in obj)
    rightmost_pixels = ((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j == max_j)
    rightmost_pixel = max(rightmost_pixels, key=lambda x: x[1][0])
    return frozenset((2 if (i, j) == rightmost_pixel[1] else v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj)
  return paint(I, frozenset(recolor_pixel(obj) for obj in objects(I, True, False, True)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`recolor_pixel(obj)` Function:**
   - `max_j = max(j for _, (i, j) in obj)`: Identifies the maximum column index (`j`) within the object, representing the rightmost column.
   - `rightmost_pixels = ((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j == max_j)`:  Collects all pixels located in the rightmost column of the object.
   - `rightmost_pixel = max(rightmost_pixels, key=lambda x: x[1][0])`: Determines the bottommost pixel among the rightmost pixels by comparing their row indices (`x[1][0]`).
   - `return frozenset(...)`: Iterates through each pixel in the object and recolors the bottommost pixel in the rightmost column to '2'.

2. **Main Program:**
   - `objects(I, True, False, True)`: Extracts all objects from the input grid, treating connected pixels of the same color as a single object, excluding the background color.
   - `frozenset(recolor_pixel(obj) for obj in ...)`:  Applies the `recolor_pixel` function to each extracted object.
   - `paint(I, ...)`: Overlays the modified objects back onto the original input grid.

These five versions offer distinct approaches to solve the given transformation task. While they all achieve the same outcome, they utilize different DSL functions and strategies, showcasing the versatility of the DSL in expressing the same logic through various means.
