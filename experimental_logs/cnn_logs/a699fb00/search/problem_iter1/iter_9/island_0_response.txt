## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to extend horizontal lines formed by the digit '1' to the right by one cell, filling the new cell with the digit '2'. This extension only occurs if the new cell is initially empty (contains a '0').

**Example:**

```
Input:         Output:
1 1 0          1 2 1 
0 1 1          0 1 2 1
```

Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

- The top and bottom '1's are extended to the right with a '2' as the neighboring cell is empty.

**Input_1:**

- All horizontal '1' sequences are extended to the right with a '2', again only when the adjacent cell is empty. 

**Input_2:**

- Similar to the previous examples, horizontal '1' sequences are extended rightward with a '2' if the adjacent cell is empty.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               asobject(I) | 
               recolor(2, 
                       mfilter(
                           asindices(I), 
                           lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 1 and 0 <= loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0
                       )
               )
           )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asindices(I)`:** Creates a set of all cell indices in the grid.
2. **`lambda loc: ...`:** Defines a function to check if a cell at location `loc` should be extended:
   - `index(I, loc) == 1`: Checks if the cell contains a '1'.
   - `0 <= loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0])`: Checks if a right neighbor exists within the grid bounds.
   - `index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0`: Checks if the right neighbor is empty (contains a '0').
3. **`mfilter(..., lambda loc: ...)`:** Filters the indices, keeping only those that satisfy the extension condition.
4. **`recolor(2, ...)`:**  Recolors the filtered indices to '2', representing the extensions.
5. **`asobject(I) | ...`:** Combines the original grid object with the re-colored extensions.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the combined object back onto the input grid, creating the output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return fill(I, 2,
                mfilter(
                    asindices(I),
                    lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, loc) == 1 and index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0
                )
            ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asindices(I)`:**  Gets indices of all cells.
2. **`lambda loc: ...`:** Defines the condition for filling: cell contains '1', has a right neighbor, and the neighbor is '0'.
3. **`mfilter(..., lambda loc: ...)`:** Filters indices based on the condition.
4. **`fill(I, 2, ...)`:** Fills the filtered indices with '2'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    shifted_ones = shift(ofcolor(I, 1), RIGHT)
    return paint(I, asobject(I) | recolor(2,  
                    mfilter(shifted_ones, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, loc) == 0)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`:**  Gets indices of cells with '1'.
2. **`shift(..., RIGHT)`:** Shifts these indices one cell to the right.
3. **`lambda loc: ...`:** Defines a condition: cell is within grid bounds and contains '0'.
4. **`mfilter(..., lambda loc: ...)`:** Filters shifted indices based on the condition.
5. **`recolor(2, ...)`:**  Recolors the filtered indices to '2'.
6. **`asobject(I) | ...`:** Combines the original grid object with recolored extensions.
7. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the combined object onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               asobject(I) | 
               frozenset(
                 (2, (i, j + 1))
                 for i, row in enumerate(I)
                 for j, value in enumerate(row)
                 if value == 1 and j + 1 < len(row) and row[j + 1] == 0
               )
           ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`for i, row in enumerate(I)`:** Iterates over each row with its index.
2. **`for j, value in enumerate(row)`:** Iterates over each cell value in the row with its index.
3. **`if value == 1 and ...`:** Checks if the cell is '1' and has a right neighbor that's '0'.
4. **`frozenset((2, (i, j + 1)) ...)`:**  Creates a new object with '2' at the right neighbor's position.
5. **`asobject(I) | ...`:** Combines the original grid object with the new '2' cells.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the combined object back onto the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_grid = [list(row) for row in I] # Create a mutable copy of the grid
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 1 and j + 1 < len(row) and row[j + 1] == 0:
        new_grid[i][j + 1] = 2  # Directly modify the new grid
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid) # Convert back to immutable tuples
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`new_grid = [list(row) for row in I]`:** Creates a mutable copy of the input grid.
2. **`for i, row in enumerate(I)`:** Iterates over each row with its index.
3. **`for j, value in enumerate(row)`:** Iterates over each cell value in the row with its index.
4. **`if value == 1 and ...`:**  Checks for '1' cells with an empty right neighbor.
5. **`new_grid[i][j + 1] = 2`:** Directly modifies the mutable grid copy, placing a '2' in the right neighbor's location.
6. **`return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)`:** Converts the modified mutable grid back to an immutable tuple format for output.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches and combinations of DSL functions while achieving the same transformation. Each version offers a unique perspective on how to solve the problem within the constraints of the DSL.
