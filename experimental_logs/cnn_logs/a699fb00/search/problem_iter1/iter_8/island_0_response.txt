## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying all occurrences of the digit '1' in the input grid and extending them to the right by one cell with the digit '2', but only if the right cell is empty (contains a '0').

**Example:**

```
Input:    Output:
1 0 1      1 2 1 
0 0 0      0 0 0
           
Input:      Output:
1 1 0      1 1 0  (No extension because the cell to the right of the second '1' is not empty)
```

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               asobject(I) | 
               recolor(2, 
                       mfilter(
                           asindices(I), 
                           lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 1 and 0 <= loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0
                       )
               )
           )
```

**Explanation:**

1. `asindices(I)`: Creates a set of all cell indices in the grid.
2. `lambda loc: ...`: Defines a function that checks if a given location should be extended:
   - `index(I, loc) == 1`: Checks if the cell at the location contains a '1'.
   - `0 <= loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0])`: Ensures the cell to the right is within the grid boundaries.
   - `index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0`: Checks if the cell to the right is empty (contains a '0').
3. `mfilter(..., ...)`: Filters the indices, keeping only those that satisfy the lambda function.
4. `recolor(2, ...)`: Creates a new object by recoloring the filtered indices to '2'.
5. `asobject(I) | ...`: Merges the original grid object with the newly created object of extensions.
6. `paint(I, ...)`: Paints the merged object onto the original grid, producing the output.

**Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, 2,
             mfilter(
                 asindices(I),
                 lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, loc) == 1 and index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0
             )
         )
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version uses `fill` instead of painting objects. It directly fills the grid with '2' at specific locations.
2. The logic for finding the locations to fill is the same as in version 1 using `asindices`, `lambda` function and `mfilter`.

**Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    shifted_ones = shift(ofcolor(I, 1), RIGHT)
    return paint(I, asobject(I) | recolor(2,  
                   mfilter(shifted_ones, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, loc) == 0)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `ofcolor(I, 1)`: Gets indices of all '1' cells.
2. `shift(..., RIGHT)`: Shifts the indices one position to the right.
3. The rest of the logic is similar to Version 1, filtering the shifted indices to only include empty cells and recoloring them to '2'.

**Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               asobject(I) | 
               frozenset((2, (i, j + 1)) 
                        for i, row in enumerate(I) 
                        for j, value in enumerate(row) 
                        if value == 1 and j + 1 < len(row) and row[j + 1] == 0)
           )
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version uses nested loops and a set comprehension for a more direct approach.
2. It iterates through each cell of the grid and adds a new cell with value '2' to the right if the current cell contains '1' and the cell to the right is within the grid boundaries and contains '0'.

**Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_grid = [list(row) for row in I] # Create a mutable copy of the input grid
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 1 and j + 1 < len(row) and row[j + 1] == 0:
        new_grid[i][j + 1] = 2 # Modify the copy directly
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid) # Convert back to immutable tuple
```

**Explanation:**

1. This version creates a mutable copy of the grid for easier modification.
2. It then iterates through each cell and directly modifies the copy to add '2' to the right of '1's if the conditions are met.
3. Finally, it converts the modified copy back to an immutable tuple before returning.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
