## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (clusters of the same digit) within the input grid, then adding a "border" of '2's around each object, but only to the right of or below the object. 

Let's illustrate with Input_0:

**Input_0:**

```
1 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

**Output_0:**

```
1 2 1 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 2 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 
```

Notice how the '2's are placed only to the right of the top-left '1' and below the bottom-left '1'.  No '2' is added to the right of the top-right '1' because there's no space.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving this transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  shifted_down = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, DOWN), objs)
  shifted_right = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objs)
  combined_shifts = merge((shifted_down, shifted_right))
  filtered_shifts = toindices(mfilter(lambda cell: index(I, cell[1]) == 0, combined_shifts))
  return paint(I, recolor(2, filtered_shifts))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objs = objects(I, True, False, True)` extracts objects (clusters of the same digit) from the input grid `I`.
2. **Shift objects:** We create two sets of shifted objects: one shifted down (`shifted_down`) and one shifted right (`shifted_right`).
3. **Combine and filter:** We combine the shifted objects (`combined_shifts`) and filter for cells that are '0' in the original grid (`filtered_shifts`). 
4. **Paint the border:** We recolor the filtered cells to '2' and paint them onto the original grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(2, toindices(mfilter(lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0 and (index(I, add(loc, DOWN)) != 0 or index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) != 0), asindices(I)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through indices:**  We iterate through each location (`loc`) in the grid using `asindices(I)`.
2. **Check for border condition:** For each location, we check if it's a '0' and if its down or right neighbor is not a '0'.
3. **Recolor and paint:**  If the conditions are met, we recolor the cell to '2' and paint it onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def add_border(obj):
    return recolor(2, difference(merge((shift(obj, DOWN), shift(obj, RIGHT))), obj))
  return paint(I, merge(apply(add_border, objects(I, True, False, True)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `add_border` function:**  This function takes an object and calculates the border cells by shifting the object down and right, merging the results, and removing the original object cells. It then recolors these border cells to '2'.
2. **Apply to objects:** We apply `add_border` to each object extracted from the input grid.
3. **Paint the border:** We merge the resulting borders and paint them onto the original grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    I = underfill(I, 2, shift(toindices(obj), DOWN))
    I = underfill(I, 2, shift(toindices(obj), RIGHT))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through objects:**  We iterate through each object in the input grid.
2. **Underfill down and right:** For each object, we underfill '2's to the right and below the object. Underfilling ensures we only modify cells that were originally '0'.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def border_indices(obj):
    return toindices(mfilter(lambda cell: index(I, cell) == 0, merge((shift(obj, RIGHT), shift(obj, DOWN)))))
  return paint(I, recolor(2, merge(apply(border_indices, objects(I, True, False, True)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define `border_indices` function:** This function finds the border indices for a given object by shifting it down and right, merging the results, and filtering for cells that are '0' in the original grid.
2. **Apply to objects and merge:** We apply `border_indices` to each object and merge the resulting border indices.
3. **Paint the border:**  We recolor the identified border cells to '2' and paint them onto the original grid.
