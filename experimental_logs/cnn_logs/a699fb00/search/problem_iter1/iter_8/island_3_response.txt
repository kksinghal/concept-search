## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects consisting of the digit '1' and adds a '2' to the right of each '1' if the cell to the right is empty (contains the background color). 

**Example:**

* **Input:** `1 0`
* **Output:** `1 2`

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

* The '1's at (0,0) and (0,2) both get a '2' added to their right because the cells to their right are empty.
* The '1's at (3,1) and (3,3) also get a '2' added for the same reason.

**Input_1:**

* Similar to Input_0, all the '1's with an empty cell to their right get a '2' added.

**Input_2:**

* The pattern repeats â€“ '1's with a right empty neighbor get a '2' added.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               recolor(2, 
                       mfilter(lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0 and index(I, subtract(loc, RIGHT)) == 1, 
                               asindices(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asindices(I)`:** Get all indices of the input grid `I`.
2. **`mfilter(...)`:** Filter the indices to keep only those where:
    * **`index(I, loc) == 0`:** The current cell is empty (background color).
    * **`index(I, subtract(loc, RIGHT)) == 1`:** The cell to the left contains a '1'.
3. **`recolor(2, ...)`:**  Recolor the filtered indices (the empty cells to the right of '1's) with the value '2'.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paint the recolored indices onto the original input grid `I`, effectively adding the '2's.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_right = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)
  return paint(I, recolor(2, 
                           mfilter(lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0 and index(shifted_right, loc) == 1,
                                   asindices(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asobject(I)`:** Convert the input grid `I` to an object representation.
2. **`shift(..., RIGHT)`:** Shift the object representation one cell to the right.
3. **`asindices(I)`:** Get all indices of the original input grid `I`.
4. **`mfilter(...)`:** Filter the indices to keep only those where:
    * **`index(I, loc) == 0`:** The current cell in the original grid is empty.
    * **`index(shifted_right, loc) == 1`:** The corresponding cell in the shifted grid contains a '1' (meaning the original grid had a '1' to its left).
5. **`recolor(2, ...)`:**  Recolor the filtered indices with the value '2'.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paint the recolored indices onto the original input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  right_neighbors = mfilter(lambda loc: index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == 0, ones)
  return fill(I, 2, mapply(lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT), right_neighbors)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`:** Find all indices of cells containing the value '1'.
2. **`mfilter(...)`:** Filter the '1' indices to keep only those where:
    * **`index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == 0`:** The cell to the right of the '1' is empty.
3. **`mapply(...)`:** Apply a function to each of the filtered indices:
    * **`lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT)`:**  Calculate the index of the cell to the right.
4. **`fill(I, 2, ...)`:**  Fill the calculated indices (the cells to the right of the filtered '1's) with the value '2'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    right_cells = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(lambda loc: index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == 0, toindices(obj)), objs)
    return paint(I, recolor(2, mapply(lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT), merge(right_cells))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Identify all objects in the grid consisting of connected '1's, excluding the background.
2. **`mapply(...)`:** Apply a function to each identified object:
    * **`lambda obj: sfilter(...)`:**  For each object, filter its indices to keep only those where the cell to the right is empty.
3. **`merge(right_cells)`:** Combine the filtered indices from all objects.
4. **`mapply(...)`:** Calculate the indices of the cells to the right of the filtered indices.
5. **`recolor(2, ...)`:** Recolor the calculated indices with the value '2'.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paint the recolored indices onto the original input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  padded_grid = hconcat(I, ((0,) * len(I[0]),)) 
  shifted_indices = mapply(lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT), asindices(I)) 
  filtered_indices = sfilter(lambda loc: index(I, subtract(loc, RIGHT)) == 1 and index(padded_grid, loc) == 0, shifted_indices)
  return fill(I, 2, filtered_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`hconcat(I, ((0,) * len(I[0]),))`:** Create a padded grid by adding a column of zeros to the right of the input grid.
2. **`asindices(I)`:** Get all indices of the original input grid.
3. **`mapply(...)`:** Calculate the indices of the cells to the right of each index in the original grid.
4. **`sfilter(...)`:** Filter the calculated indices to keep only those where:
    * **`index(I, subtract(loc, RIGHT)) == 1`:** The original grid has a '1' to the left of the calculated index.
    * **`index(padded_grid, loc) == 0`:** The padded grid has a '0' at the calculated index (meaning the original grid had an empty cell there).
5. **`fill(I, 2, ...)`:** Fill the filtered indices in the original grid with the value '2'.


These five program versions offer distinct approaches using different DSL functions and logic to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
