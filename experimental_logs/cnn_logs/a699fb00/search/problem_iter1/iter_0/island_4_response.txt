## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be **inserting a digit '2' to the right of each '1' digit in the input grid, only if there is space available**. Let's analyze each input-output pair to confirm:

**Input_0:**
-  The '1' digits at (0,0), (3,1), and (3,3) all have a '2' inserted to their right.

**Input_1:**
-  Similar to Input_0, '2' is inserted to the right of every '1' if there's an empty space.

**Input_2:**
-  The pattern holds, '2' is inserted to the right of '1' digits where possible. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_8eb1be9a(I):
  O = tuple(
      tuple(
          2 if j > 0 and row[j-1] == 1 and v == 0 else v 
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      ) 
      for row in I
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This program iterates through each row and each cell in the input grid 'I'.
- For every cell, it checks if the cell to its left contains '1' and if the current cell is '0'.
- If both conditions are true, it replaces the current cell value with '2'.
- Otherwise, it keeps the original cell value.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_8eb1be9a(I):
  O = tuple(
      tuple(
          branch(
              both(j < len(row)-1, index(I, (i, j+1)) == 0),
              branch(v == 1, 2, v), 
              v
          )
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates through each cell and uses branching logic.
- It checks if the current cell is not the last in the row and the cell to its right is '0'.
- If true, it further checks if the current cell is '1'. If so, it replaces it with '2', else keeps it unchanged. 
- If the initial condition is false, it retains the original cell value.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_8eb1be9a(I):
  indices_to_change = frozenset(
      (i, j+1)
      for i, row in enumerate(I)
      for j, v in enumerate(row[:-1])
      if v == 1 and row[j+1] == 0
  )
  O = paint(
      I,
      recolor(2, indices_to_change)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This program identifies the indices where a '2' needs to be inserted.
- It iterates through the grid, finding cells with '1' where the cell to the right is '0'.
- It collects these target indices and then uses the `paint` function to modify the original grid with the '2' value at those locations.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_8eb1be9a(I):
  shifted = tuple(
      (0,) + row[:-1]
      for row in I
  )
  O = tuple(
      tuple(
          branch(
              both(a == 1, b == 0), 
              2, 
              b
          )
          for a, b in zip(row_a, row_b) 
      )
      for row_a, row_b in zip(shifted, I)
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This program creates a shifted version of the input grid where each row is shifted one position to the left. 
- It then iterates through both the original and shifted grids simultaneously. 
- If a cell in the shifted grid is '1' and the corresponding cell in the original grid is '0', it replaces the cell in the original grid with '2'.
- Otherwise, the original cell value is retained.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_8eb1be9a(I):
  ones = objects(replace(I, 0, mostcolor(I)), T, F, T)
  twos = mapply(
      lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT),
      ones
  )
  O = paint(
      I,
      recolor(2, merge(apply(toindices, twos)))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This program first identifies all objects (contiguous areas) of '1's in the grid.
- For each '1' object, it shifts it one position to the right.
- Finally, it paints the value '2' at the indices of these shifted objects onto the original grid.
