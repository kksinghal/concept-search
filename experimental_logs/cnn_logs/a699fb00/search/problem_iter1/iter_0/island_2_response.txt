## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all input-output pairs follows this pattern:

**For every object (group of connected '1's):**

1. **Identify every other cell within the object.**
2. **Change the value of those identified cells to '2'.**

Let's illustrate with Input_0:

- There are two objects, each consisting of two '1's. 
- In each object, one of the '1's gets replaced by a '2'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    new_objs = set()
    for obj in objs:
        indices = toindices(obj)
        ordered_indices = order(indices, lambda x: x[0] * 1000 + x[1])
        for i in range(1, len(ordered_indices), 2):
            indices = remove(ordered_indices[i], indices)
        new_objs.add(recolor(2, indices))
    O = paint(I, merge(new_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Extracts objects (connected '1's) from the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through each object (`obj`) in `objs`**:
   - **`indices = toindices(obj)`**: Gets the indices of the cells within the object.
   - **`ordered_indices = order(indices, lambda x: x[0] * 1000 + x[1])`**: Orders the indices linearly to ensure consistent selection of every other cell.
   - **Iterate through `ordered_indices` with a step of 2**: Removes every other index from `indices`.
   - **`new_objs.add(recolor(2, indices))`**: Creates a new object with '2' at the remaining indices and adds it to `new_objs`.
3. **`O = paint(I, merge(new_objs))`**: Paints all new objects onto the original grid `I` to generate the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    new_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(2, sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda idx: even(idx[0] + idx[1]))), objs)
    O = paint(I, new_objs)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Extracts objects from the input grid.
2. **`new_objs = mapply(...)`**:  Applies a function to each object and merges the results.
   - **`lambda obj: ...`**: Defines an anonymous function for each object.
   - **`recolor(2, ...)`**:  Recolors the result of the inner function with '2'.
   - **`sfilter(toindices(obj), ...)`**: Filters the indices of the object.
   - **`lambda idx: even(idx[0] + idx[1])`**:  Keeps indices where the sum of row and column index is even.
3. **`O = paint(I, new_objs)`**: Paints the recolored objects onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and even(i + j):
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through every cell in the grid and replaces the '1's with '2's if the sum of their row and column indices is even.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    checkered = prapply(lambda i, j: even(i + j), range(len(I)), range(len(I[0])))
    new_objs = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(2, intersection(toindices(obj), checkered)), objs)
    O = paint(I, new_objs)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Extracts objects from the input grid.
2. **`checkered = prapply(...)`**: Creates a set of indices that form a checkerboard pattern on the grid.
3. **`new_objs = mapply(...)`**:  Applies a function to each object and merges the results.
   - **`lambda obj: ...`**: Defines an anonymous function for each object.
   - **`recolor(2, ...)`**:  Recolors the result of the inner function with '2'.
   - **`intersection(toindices(obj), checkered)`**:  Finds the intersection between the object's indices and the checkerboard indices.
4. **`O = paint(I, new_objs)`**: Paints the recolored objects onto the original grid.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    for i, (v, (row, col)) in enumerate(sorted(obj)):
      if even(i):
        O = fill(O, 2, {(row, col)})
      else:
        O = fill(O, v, {(row, col)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each object, sorts its cells, and then alternates between filling the output grid with the original value and '2'.

Each of these versions utilizes different functions and logic from the DSL to achieve the same result, showcasing the diversity of solutions possible.
