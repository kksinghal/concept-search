## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on pairs of '1' digits within each row of the grid. 

* **Rule:** For each pair of '1' digits on the same row, change the right '1' of the pair to a '2'. 
* **Single '1's:** Rows with a single '1' digit remain unchanged.
* **Other Digits:** The transformation doesn't affect digits other than '1'.

**Examples:**

* **Input_0:** In the first and fourth rows, the rightmost '1' of each pair becomes a '2'.
* **Input_1 & Input_2:** Similar logic is applied, with the transformation affecting only pairs of '1' digits within the same row.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_73251a56(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            2 if v == 1 and row[j+1:].count(1) > 0 else v
            for j, v in enumerate(row)
        )
        for row in I
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Rows:** The code iterates through each row of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through Cells:** For each cell in a row, it checks if the value `v` is '1'.
3. **Check for Pair:** If the value is '1', it checks if another '1' exists to its right in the same row using `row[j+1:].count(1) > 0`.
4. **Replace Right '1':** If a pair is found, the current '1' is replaced with '2'.
5. **Unchanged Otherwise:**  If the value is not '1' or no other '1' exists to the right, the value remains unchanged.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_73251a56(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            branch(
                both(v == 1, any(x == 1 for x in row[j+1:])),
                2,
                v
            )
            for j, v in enumerate(row)
        )
        for row in I
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Rows & Cells:** Similar to Version 1, it iterates through rows and cells.
2. **Check Pair with 'any' & 'both':** Uses `both` to check if the current value is '1' and `any` to see if there's another '1' in the remaining part of the row.
3. **Conditional Replacement:**  Employs the `branch` function to replace with '2' only if both conditions are true.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_73251a56(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            branch(
                contained(1, row[j+1:]),
                2,
                v
            )
            if v == 1 else v
            for j, v in enumerate(row)
        )
        for row in I
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:**  Similar iteration process as previous versions.
2. **'contained' for Pair:** Uses `contained` to efficiently check if '1' is present in the rest of the row.
3. **Nested Conditional:**  Employs nested conditionals for clarity - the outer one checks for '1', the inner one uses `branch` for replacement.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_73251a56(I):
    def process_row(row):
        new_row = list(row)
        one_indices = [i for i, v in enumerate(row) if v == 1]
        for i in range(len(one_indices)-1):
            new_row[one_indices[i+1]] = 2
        return tuple(new_row)
    return tuple(process_row(row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **'process_row' Function:** Defines a helper function to process each row individually.
2. **Find '1' Indices:** Identifies all indices of '1's in a row and stores them.
3. **Iterate and Replace:** Iterates through the indices and replaces the '1's (except the first one) with '2's.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_73251a56(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          branch(
              equality(v, 1) and i < len(row) - 1 and row[i+1:].count(1) >= 1,
              2,
              v
          )
          for i, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Similar Iteration:** Like other versions, it iterates through each row and each cell.
2. **Combined Condition:** Uses a single condition within the `branch` function. This condition combines multiple checks using `and`:
    * `equality(v, 1)`: Checks if the current value is '1'.
    * `i < len(row) - 1`: Ensures that the current element is not the last element of the row.
    * `row[i+1:].count(1) >= 1`: Checks if there is at least one '1' after the current element in the row.
3. **Replace or Keep:** If all conditions are true, it replaces the '1' with '2'; otherwise, it keeps the original value.

These five versions provide distinct ways to achieve the desired transformation using the given DSL. They showcase the flexibility and diverse approaches possible within the constraints of the provided functions.
