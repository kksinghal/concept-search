## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions) of the digit '1' and extending them to the right by one cell with the digit '2'. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

- There are two objects formed by the digit '1'.
- The top-left object is extended to the right by one cell, adding a '2'.
- The bottom-left object is extended to the right by one cell, adding a '2'.

**Input_1:**

- There are four objects formed by the digit '1'.
- Each object is extended to the right by one cell, adding a '2' to each extension.

**Input_2:**

-  Similar to Input_1, all objects formed by the digit '1' are extended to the right by one cell with a '2'.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL provided in `dsl.py`:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find all occurrences of the digit '1'
  ones_indices = ofcolor(I, 1) 
  # Shift the indices one position to the right
  right_extensions = shift(ones_indices, RIGHT)
  # Combine original indices and extensions 
  all_indices = ones_indices | right_extensions
  # Create an object with '2' at the extension indices
  extensions_obj = recolor(2, right_extensions)
  # Create an object from all relevant indices with their values
  combined_obj = asobject(I) | extensions_obj
  # Paint the combined object onto the input grid
  return paint(I, combined_obj)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' locations:**  `ofcolor(I, 1)` finds the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **Calculate extension locations:** `shift(ones_indices, RIGHT)` shifts the found indices one position to the right.
3. **Combine locations:** `ones_indices | right_extensions` merges the original and shifted indices.
4. **Create extension object:** `recolor(2, right_extensions)` creates an object with '2' at the extension indices.
5. **Combine with original grid:** `asobject(I) | extensions_obj` merges the original grid object with the extension object.
6. **Paint onto grid:** `paint(I, combined_obj)` paints the combined object onto the input grid, effectively extending the '1' objects with '2's.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               merge(
                   # Iterate over objects formed by '1'
                   sfilter(
                       lambda obj: color(obj) == 1, 
                       objects(I, True, True, False) 
                   ) 
               ) | asobject(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1' objects:** `objects(I, True, True, False)` extracts all connected objects from the grid. `sfilter(lambda obj: color(obj) == 1, ...)` keeps only those objects formed by the digit '1'.
2. **Extend objects:** For each '1' object,  it implicitly extends it to the right during the merging process by including its original cells and the implied right extensions.
3. **Combine with original grid:**  `... | asobject(I)` merges the extended objects with the original grid object.
4. **Paint onto grid:** `paint(I, ...)` paints the combined object onto the input grid, achieving the desired extension.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Find locations of '1's
    ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
    # Generate extensions to the right
    extensions = mfilter(ones, lambda loc: astuple(loc[0], loc[1] + 1))
    # Fill extensions with '2'
    return fill(I, 2, extensions)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate '1's:** Similar to previous versions, `ofcolor(I, 1)` identifies the indices of cells containing '1'.
2. **Compute extension indices:** `mfilter(ones, lambda loc: astuple(loc[0], loc[1] + 1))` generates a set of indices shifted one position to the right from the original '1' locations.
3. **Fill with '2':**  `fill(I, 2, extensions)` directly fills the calculated extension indices with the digit '2' on the input grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Extract objects, keeping only those with color '1'
  objs = sfilter(lambda o: color(o) == 1, objects(I, True, True, False))
  # Create a set of extended objects
  extended_objs = mapply(
      lambda obj: obj | recolor(2, shift(toindices(obj), RIGHT)),
      objs
  )
  # Paint the extended objects onto the input grid
  return paint(I, merge(extended_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Isolate '1' objects:** Similar to version 2, it identifies and filters objects to keep only those containing the digit '1'.
2. **Extend each object:** `mapply(...)` applies a lambda function to each '1' object. This function extends the object to the right by:
   - `shift(toindices(obj), RIGHT)`: Shifting the object's indices one position to the right.
   - `recolor(2, ...)`: Assigning the digit '2' to these shifted indices.
   - `obj | ...`: Merging the original object with its extension.
3. **Paint onto grid:** Similar to previous versions, it merges the extended objects and paints them onto the input grid. 

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    # Iterate through rows and columns
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            2 if (j > 0 and row[j-1] == 1) else row[j]
            for j in range(len(row))
        ) 
        for row in I
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through grid:** This version iterates directly through each cell in the grid using nested loops.
2. **Check for left neighbor:**  `2 if (j > 0 and row[j-1] == 1) else row[j]` checks if the cell has a left neighbor ('j > 0') and if that neighbor is '1'. If so, it replaces the current cell with '2'; otherwise, it keeps the original cell value. 


Each of these program versions achieves the desired transformation by employing different strategies and function combinations from the provided DSL.
