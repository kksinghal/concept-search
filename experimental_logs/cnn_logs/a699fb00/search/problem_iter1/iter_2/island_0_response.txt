## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects of value '1' horizontally to the right by one cell with a value of '2', but only if the extension cell is currently empty (value '0'). 

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

* The top-left and bottom-left '1' objects are extended to the right with a '2' because the cells to their right are empty.
* The rightmost '1's in each of those objects are not extended because they are on the edge of the grid.

**Input_1:**

* This example showcases the conditional extension: only '1's with an empty cell to their right are extended. 
* Notice the '1' objects in the second row are extended to create a continuous line of '2's.

**Input_2:**

*  Similar to Input_1, this example emphasizes that only '1's with an empty cell immediately to the right are extended. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the DSL from `dsl.py`:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               merge(
                   apply(
                       lambda obj: obj | recolor(2, sfilter(lambda ind: 0 <= ind[1] < len(I[0]), {astuple(ind[0], ind[1] + 1) for ind in toindices(obj)})), 
                       sfilter(
                           lambda obj: color(obj) == 1,
                           objects(I, True, True, False)
                       )
                   )
               )
           )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, True, False)`:**  Identifies all connected objects in the input grid (`I`).
2. **`sfilter(lambda obj: color(obj) == 1, ...)`:** Filters the objects to keep only those with color '1'.
3. **`apply(lambda obj: ..., ...)`:**  Applies a function to each object that remains.
4. **`{astuple(ind[0], ind[1] + 1) for ind in toindices(obj)}`:**  Creates a set of indices shifted one position to the right for each cell in the object.
5. **`sfilter(lambda ind: 0 <= ind[1] < len(I[0]), ...)`:** Further filters these indices to ensure they are within the grid's bounds.
6. **`recolor(2, ...)`:** Recolors the filtered indices (the valid extension cells) to value '2'.
7. **`obj | ...`:** Combines the original object with the recoloured extension cells.
8. **`merge(...)`:** Merges all the modified objects back together.
9. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged objects onto the input grid, effectively extending the '1' objects. 


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               asobject(I) | 
               recolor(2, 
                       mfilter(
                           asindices(I), 
                           lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 1 and 0 <= loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0
                       )
               )
           ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asindices(I)`:** Gets all cell indices of the input grid.
2. **`mfilter(..., lambda loc: ...)`:** Filters the indices and keeps those that meet specific criteria:
    *  **`index(I, loc) == 1`:**  The cell at the current index must have value '1'.
    * **`0 <= loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0])`:** Checks if extending to the right stays within the grid bounds.
    *  **`index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0`:** Ensures the cell to the right is empty (value '0').
3. **`recolor(2, ...)`:** Recolors the filtered indices (valid extension cells) to '2'.
4. **`asobject(I) | ...`:** Combines the original grid represented as an object with the recoloured cells. 
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the result onto the input grid, extending the '1' objects. 


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, 2, 
              mfilter(
                  ofcolor(I, 1), 
                  lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0
              ) |
              ofcolor(I, 1)
          ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`:** Gets indices of all cells with value '1'.
2. **`mfilter(..., lambda loc: ...)`:**  Filters these indices:
    * **`0 <= loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0])`:**  Boundary check for the rightward extension.
    * **`index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0`:** Ensures the right cell is empty.
3. **`... | ofcolor(I, 1)`:** Combines the filtered indices (extension cells) with the original indices of '1's.
4. **`fill(I, 2, ...)`:** Fills all the combined indices with the value '2', effectively extending the '1' objects. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I,
               merge(
                   apply(
                       lambda obj: obj | recolor(2, {(i, j + 1) for (i, j) in toindices(obj) if 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0}), 
                       sfilter(
                           lambda obj: color(obj) == 1,
                           objects(I, True, True, False)
                       )
                   )
               )
           )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, True, False)`:** Finds all connected objects in the input grid.
2. **`sfilter(lambda obj: color(obj) == 1, ...)`:** Keeps only the objects with color '1'.
3. **`apply(lambda obj: ..., ...)`:** Applies a function to each remaining object.
4. **`{(i, j + 1) for (i, j) in toindices(obj) ... }`:** Generates indices shifted one position to the right for each object cell.
5. **`... if 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0`:**  Conditionally includes indices only if they are within the grid's bounds and the corresponding cell is empty ('0').
6. **`recolor(2, ...)`:**  Recolors the filtered extension cell indices to '2'.
7. **`obj | ...`:**  Combines the original object with the recoloured extension cells.
8. **`merge(...)`:**  Merges all modified objects.
9. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the merged objects onto the input grid, performing the extension.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_indices = mfilter(
      asindices(I),
      lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 1 and 0 <= loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0
  )
  return paint(I, asobject(I) | recolor(2, shifted_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_indices = mfilter(...)`:**  Calculates the indices to be filled with '2':
    * **`asindices(I)`:**  Gets all cell indices in the grid. 
    *  **`lambda loc: ...`:** Defines the filtering criteria:
        *  The cell at the current index must contain '1'.
        *  The rightward extension must stay within the grid boundaries.
        *  The cell to the right must be empty ('0').
2. **`recolor(2, shifted_indices)`:**  Recolors the filtered indices to '2'.
3. **`asobject(I) | ...`:** Combines the original grid represented as an object with the recoloured cells.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the result onto the input grid. 

These are just five examples, and many other variations are possible using the DSL. The key is to break down the transformation logic and then use the DSL functions to express that logic.
