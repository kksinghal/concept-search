## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify horizontal pairs of the digit '1' and replace the right '1' of each pair with the digit '2'. 

**Input_0:**

* Two horizontal '1' pairs are present. 
* The right '1' of each pair is replaced by '2'.

**Input_1:**

* Five horizontal '1' pairs are present.
* Similar to Input_0, the right '1' of each pair is replaced by '2'.

**Input_2:**

* Five horizontal '1' pairs are present.
* The transformation remains consistent with the previous examples.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if v == 1 and j > 0 and row[j-1] == 1 else v
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each row and cell. It checks if the current cell value is '1' and if the previous cell value in the same row is also '1'. If both conditions are true, it replaces the current cell value with '2', otherwise, it keeps the original value.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
        2 if v == 1 and (j + 1) < len(row) and row[j + 1] == 1 else v
        for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 1, but instead of checking the previous cell, it checks if the next cell value in the same row is '1'.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(grid):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if index(grid, (i, j)) == 1 and index(grid, (i, j + 1)) == 1 else index(grid, (i, j)) 
      for j in range(len(grid[0]))
    )
    for i in range(len(grid))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses the `index` function to check the values of the current and next cells in each row. If both are '1', it replaces the current cell value with '2'. 

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  for obj in objs:
    if len(obj) == 2 and hline(obj):
      i, j = ulcorner(obj)
      grid = fill(grid, 2, (i, j + 1))
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version identifies horizontal lines of length two ('1' pairs) using the `objects` and `hline` functions. It then uses `ulcorner` to get the upper-left corner of the line and fills the cell to the right with '2'.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(grid):
  painted = canvas(0, shape(grid))
  for i in range(len(grid)):
    for j in range(len(grid[0]) - 1):
      if grid[i][j] == 1 and grid[i][j+1] == 1:
        painted = fill(painted, 2, (i, j + 1))
  return cellwise(grid, painted, 0)
```

**Explanation:**

This version creates an empty canvas and iterates through the input grid. When a horizontal '1' pair is detected, it marks the corresponding cell on the canvas with '2'. Finally, it merges the original grid with the canvas using the `cellwise` function, keeping the original values where no '2' was painted.

These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation, leveraging various DSL functions and logic.
