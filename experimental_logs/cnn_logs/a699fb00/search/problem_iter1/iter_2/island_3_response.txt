## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '1' and adding the digit '2' to the right of each '1' if the cell to the right is empty ('0'). 

**Input 0:**

* Two objects are formed by '1's.
* For each '1', a '2' is placed in the cell to its right.

**Input 1:**

* Four objects are formed by '1's.
* The transformation is applied to each object independently.

**Input 2:**

* Five objects are formed by '1's.
*  Notice how '2's are only placed if the cell to the right is empty.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)  # Get indices of all '1's
  right_of_ones = apply(lambda x: add(x, RIGHT), ones) # Calculate indices one cell to the right
  valid_cells = sfilter(right_of_ones, lambda x: index(I, x) == 0) # Keep only indices with '0' in the input grid
  O = fill(I, 2, valid_cells) # Fill the valid cells with '2'
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '1's:** `ones = ofcolor(I, 1)` extracts indices of all '1' cells.
2. **Calculate Right Indices:** `right_of_ones = apply(lambda x: add(x, RIGHT), ones)` calculates indices one cell to the right of each '1'.
3. **Filter Valid Cells:**  `valid_cells = sfilter(right_of_ones, lambda x: index(I, x) == 0)` keeps only the indices where the corresponding cell in the input grid contains '0'.
4. **Fill with '2's:** `O = fill(I, 2, valid_cells)` fills the valid cells with '2'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)  # Shift the entire grid right
  twos = frozenset((2, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in shifted if v == 1 and index(I, (i, j)) == 0) # Find shifted '1's with '0' to their left
  O = paint(I, twos)  # Paint the '2's onto the original grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Grid:** `shifted = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)` shifts the entire input grid one cell to the right.
2. **Find Valid '2's:** `twos = frozenset((2, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in shifted if v == 1 and index(I, (i, j)) == 0)` creates a set of cells with value '2' at the shifted positions of '1's that had a '0' to their left in the original grid. 
3. **Paint '2's:** `O = paint(I, twos)` paints the '2's onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True) # Extract objects made of '1's
  shifted_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objs) # Shift each object to the right
  twos = mfilter(shifted_objs, lambda cell: index(I, cell[1]) == 0 and cell[0] == 1) # Filter out shifted cells that don't have a '0' to their left in the original grid
  O = paint(I, recolor(2, twos))  # Paint the filtered cells with '2'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objs = objects(I, True, False, True)` extracts objects made of '1's from the input grid.
2. **Shift Objects:** `shifted_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objs)` shifts each extracted object one cell to the right.
3. **Filter Valid Cells:** `twos = mfilter(shifted_objs, lambda cell: index(I, cell[1]) == 0 and cell[0] == 1)` filters out shifted cells that don't have a '0' to their left in the original grid and keeps only the shifted '1's.
4. **Paint '2's:** `O = paint(I, recolor(2, twos))`  recolors the filtered '1's to '2' and paints them onto the original grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, frozenset((2, add(loc, RIGHT)) for loc in ofcolor(I, 1) if index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == 0)) # One-liner combining steps
```

**Explanation:**

This version combines all steps into a single line for conciseness. It iterates over locations of '1's, checks if the cell to the right is '0', and if so, adds a '2' at the right location to a new set of cells, which is then painted onto the original grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def shift_and_check(obj):
    shifted = shift(obj, RIGHT)
    return frozenset((2, loc) for v, loc in shifted if v == 1 and index(I, loc) == 0)
  
  shifted_twos = mapply(shift_and_check, objects(I, True, False, True))
  return paint(I, shifted_twos)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Helper Function:** A helper function `shift_and_check` shifts an object right and returns only the valid '2' locations.
2. **Apply and Paint:** The main function extracts objects, applies the helper function to each object using `mapply`, and paints the resulting '2' cells onto the input grid.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL, showcasing a range of logical thinking and function combinations.
