## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit, excluding the background color 0) and coloring the cell to the right of each '1' within these objects with the color '2'.

**Input 0:**

* **Objects:** Two objects formed by the digit '1'.
* **Transformation:** The cell to the right of each '1' is colored '2', resulting in two '2's being added to the grid.

**Input 1:**

* **Objects:** Several horizontally aligned objects formed by '1'. 
* **Transformation:**  Again, the cell to the right of each '1' within the objects is colored '2'.

**Input 2:**

* **Objects:** Objects formed by '1's are scattered across the grid.
* **Transformation:** Consistent application of the rule - coloring the cell to the right of '1' within each object with '2'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if (j > 0 and row[j-1] == 1 and v == 0 and any(I[k][l] == 1 for k in range(max(0, i-1), min(len(I), i+2)) for l in range(max(0, j-1), min(len(row), j+2)))) else v
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each cell in the grid. For each cell, it checks if the cell to the left contains a '1', the current cell is a '0', and if there's a '1' in the 3x3 neighborhood around the cell. If all conditions are met, it colors the current cell '2'.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  return paint(I, recolor(2, mfilter(
    lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0 and index(I, add(loc, LEFT)) == 1,
    mapply(toindices, objs)
  )))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Finds objects (connected regions of '1's) in the input grid using `objects(I, True, False, True)`.
2. **Find Target Cells:** Identifies cells that are '0', have a '1' to their left, and are part of an object using `mfilter`, `index`, and `add`.
3. **Color and Paint:** Colors the identified target cells '2' using `recolor` and paints them onto the original grid using `paint`.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)
  intersection = toindices(intersection(asobject(I), shifted))
  return paint(I, recolor(2, sfilter(
    lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0 and index(I, add(loc, LEFT)) == 1,
    intersection
  )))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift and Intersect:** Shifts the grid one cell to the right and finds the intersection with the original grid to identify pairs of cells where the left one might be '1' and the right one '0'.
2. **Filter Target Cells:** Filters the intersected indices to ensure the left cell is '1' and the right cell is '0'.
3. **Color and Paint:** Colors the filtered cells '2' and paints them onto the original grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            2 if j < len(row)-1 and row[j] == 1 and row[j + 1] == 0 and any(I[k][l] == 1 for k in range(max(0, i-1), min(len(I), i+2)) for l in range(max(0, j), min(len(row), j+3))) else v
            for j, v in enumerate(row)
        )
        for i, row in enumerate(I)
    )
```

**Explanation:**

Similar to Version 1, this version iterates through the grid and colors a cell '2' if it's '0', the cell to its left is '1', and there's a '1' in its 3x3 neighborhood (including the cell itself and the two cells to its right).

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if (j < len(row) - 1 and row[j] == 1 and row[j + 1] == 0 and any(v == 1 for v in row[max(0, j - 1):min(len(row), j + 3)])) else v
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates over the grid and colors a cell '2' if it's a '0', the cell to its left is '1', and there's another '1' within a 3-cell window centered on the current cell within the same row. This version doesn't check for '1's in neighboring rows.


All five versions leverage different combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same goal. They highlight the flexibility of the DSL in expressing the desired transformation through various approaches.
