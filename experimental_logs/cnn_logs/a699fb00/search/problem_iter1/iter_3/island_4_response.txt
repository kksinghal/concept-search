## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (groups of connected '1's) in the input grid and inserting a '2' to the right of each '1' within these objects, effectively extending the objects to the right.

**Example:**

Input:
```
1 1 0
0 1 0
```

Output:
```
1 2 1 0
0 1 2 0 
```

## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  shifted_right = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objs)
  intersection = mapply(lambda obj: toindices(intersection(toindices(obj[0]), toindices(obj[1]))), pair(objs, shifted_right))
  return paint(I, recolor(2, intersection))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies connected '1's as separate objects.
2. **Shift right:** `shifted_right` shifts each object one cell to the right.
3. **Find intersection:** `intersection` finds the overlapping cells between the original objects and their right-shifted counterparts. These overlapping cells represent the locations where '2' needs to be inserted.
4. **Paint the grid:** `paint(I, recolor(2, intersection))` paints the original grid, replacing the values at the intersection indices with '2'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)
  intersection = toindices(intersection(asobject(I), shifted))
  return paint(I, recolor(2, sfilter(lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0 and contained(subtract(loc, RIGHT), intersection), asindices(I)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift the grid:** `shifted` shifts the entire input grid one cell to the right.
2. **Find intersection:** `intersection` finds the overlapping cells between the original grid and its shifted version, marking potential '2' insertion points.
3. **Filter for valid locations:** `sfilter(...)` iterates over all indices, checking two conditions:
    - The current cell must be '0' (`index(I, loc) == 0`).
    - The cell to the left must be part of the intersection (`contained(subtract(loc, RIGHT), intersection)`), ensuring '2' is only inserted to the right of existing '1's.
4. **Paint the grid:** `paint(...)` updates the grid, inserting '2' at the filtered locations.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(2 if j > 0 and row[j-1] == 1 and col[i] == 1 else col[i] for j, col in enumerate(zip(*I))) for i, row in enumerate(I))
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly manipulates the grid without using DSL functions for object identification:

1. **Iterate through grid:** The code iterates through rows and columns using nested loops.
2. **Check for condition:**  For each cell, it checks if:
    - It's not the first column (`j > 0`).
    - The cell to the left is '1' (`row[j-1] == 1`).
    - The corresponding cell in the original grid is '1' (`col[i] == 1`).
3. **Insert '2':** If all conditions are met, it inserts a '2'; otherwise, it retains the original value.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  return paint(I, merge({recolor(2, shift(sfilter(lambda cell: cell[1][1] != width(toindices(obj)) - 1, obj), RIGHT)) for obj in objs}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(...)` identifies the connected '1's.
2. **Filter rightmost cells:** For each object, `sfilter(...)` removes cells located at the rightmost edge of the object.
3. **Shift and recolor:**  The remaining cells are shifted right and recolored to '2'.
4. **Merge and paint:** All shifted and recolored cells are merged and painted onto the original grid. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(branch(j > 0 and r[j-1] == 1 and v == 1, 2, v) for j, v in enumerate(r)) for r in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through grid:** The code iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Apply conditional logic:** `branch(...)` checks for three conditions:
    - The cell is not in the first column (`j > 0`).
    - The cell to the left is '1' (`r[j-1] == 1`).
    - The current cell value is '1' (`v == 1`).
3. **Insert '2':**  If all conditions are met, it replaces the cell value with '2'; otherwise, it retains the original value.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and diversity of the provided DSL.
