## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects with the value '1' and extending them to the right by one cell with the value '2', but only if the extension cell is currently empty (has value '0'). 

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0 to Output_0:**  Each '1' object gets extended to the right with a '2'.  Notice that the rightmost '1' in the first row is not extended because it's at the edge of the grid.
* **Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to Input_0, all '1' objects are extended with '2' to the right, except when they are at the edge of the grid or blocked by another object.
* **Input_2 to Output_2:** The same logic applies here as well, demonstrating consistency across various inputs.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions for achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               asobject(I) | 
               recolor(2, 
                       mfilter(
                           asindices(I), 
                           lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 1 and 0 <= loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0
                       )
               )
           )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asindices(I)`:** Creates a set of all cell indices in the grid.
2. **`lambda loc: ...`:**  Defines a lambda function to check if a cell should be extended. It verifies:
    * The current cell has value '1': `index(I, loc) == 1`.
    * The cell to the right is within the grid bounds: `0 <= loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0])`.
    * The cell to the right is empty (has value '0'): `index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0`.
3. **`mfilter(..., ...)`:** Filters the indices based on the lambda function and merges the results.
4. **`recolor(2, ...)`:** Recolors the filtered indices (the extension cells) with the value '2'.
5. **`asobject(I) | ...`:** Combines the original grid object with the re-colored extension cells.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the combined object onto the original grid, creating the output grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, 2,
              mfilter(
                  asindices(I),
                  lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, loc) == 1 and index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0
              )
          )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asindices(I)`:**  Generates all cell indices of the grid.
2. **`lambda loc: ...`:** Defines a lambda function with the same conditions as in Version 1 to identify extension cells.
3. **`mfilter(..., ...)`:** Filters the indices using the lambda function.
4. **`fill(I, 2, ...)`:** Fills the identified extension cell indices with the value '2' directly on the original grid.

**Program Version 3** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I,
               merge(
                   apply(
                       lambda obj: obj | recolor(2, {(i, j + 1) for (i, j) in toindices(obj) if 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0}), 
                       sfilter(
                           lambda obj: color(obj) == 1,
                           objects(I, True, True, False)
                       )
                   )
               )
           )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, True, False)`:**  Extracts all objects from the grid.
2. **`lambda obj: color(obj) == 1`:** Filters for objects with color '1'.
3. **`sfilter(..., ...)`:** Applies the color filter to the objects.
4. **`lambda obj: obj | recolor(2, ...)`:**  For each object with color '1', it creates a new object with extension cells:
    *  `{(i, j + 1) for (i, j) in toindices(obj) if 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0}`:  This set comprehension identifies valid extension cells (right of the object and empty).
    * `recolor(2, ...)`: Recolors these extension cells with '2'.
    * `obj | ...`: Combines the original object with the re-colored extensions. 
5. **`apply(..., ...)`:** Applies the extension logic to all filtered objects.
6. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the modified objects.
7. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the merged objects onto the original grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               merge(
                   apply(
                       lambda obj: obj | recolor(2, sfilter(lambda ind: 0 <= ind[1] + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (ind[0], ind[1] + 1)) == 0, {astuple(ind[0], ind[1] + 1) for ind in toindices(obj)})), 
                       sfilter(
                           lambda obj: color(obj) == 1,
                           objects(I, True, True, False)
                       )
                   )
               )
           )
```

**Explanation:**

Similar to Version 3, but with a slightly different way of calculating extension cells within the lambda function:

1.  **`{astuple(ind[0], ind[1] + 1) for ind in toindices(obj)}`:** Creates a set of potential extension cell indices.
2. **`sfilter(lambda ind: ..., ...)`:** Filters these potential extensions based on grid bounds and emptiness, similar to Version 1. 

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, True, False)
  new_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 1:
      new_obj = set()
      for v, (i, j) in obj:
        new_obj.add((v, (i, j)))
        if 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0:
          new_obj.add((2, (i, j + 1)))
      new_objs.add(frozenset(new_obj))
  return paint(I, merge(new_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, True, False)`:**  Extracts all objects from the grid.
2. It then iterates through each object:
    * If the object's color is '1', it creates a new object (`new_obj`) and copies the original object cells.
    * For each cell in the original object, it checks if an extension to the right is valid (within bounds and empty). If so, it adds an extension cell with value '2' to `new_obj`. 
3. Finally, it paints the merged set of new objects (`new_objs`) onto the original grid. 


## Conclusion

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, illustrating the flexibility and expressiveness of DSLs. By analyzing existing code and the desired transformation, we can generate diverse and efficient solutions for complex grid manipulation tasks.
