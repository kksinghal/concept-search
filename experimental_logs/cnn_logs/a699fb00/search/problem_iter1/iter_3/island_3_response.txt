## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects made of '1's and placing a '2' to the right of each '1' within the object, but only if the space to the right is empty ('0' or out of bounds). 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**
- Two objects are identified: one in the top left corner and one at the bottom left.
- For each '1' in both objects, a '2' is placed to its right if the space is empty.

**Input_1:**
- Several objects are identified, all horizontal lines.
- The transformation is applied as described above. Note that '2's are not placed at the ends of lines if they touch another object or the boundary.

**Input_2:**
- Similar to Input_1, but with objects of different lengths and orientations.
- The transformation is consistently applied regardless of object size or orientation.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  shifted_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objs)
  twos = mfilter(shifted_objs, lambda cell: index(I, cell[1]) == 0)
  O = paint(I, recolor(2, twos))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objs = objects(I, True, False, True)`: Extracts objects consisting only of '1's, excluding the background.
2. `shifted_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objs)`: Shifts each extracted object one cell to the right.
3. `twos = mfilter(shifted_objs, lambda cell: index(I, cell[1]) == 0)`: Filters the shifted objects, keeping only the cells whose original position in the input grid contained a '0'.
4. `O = paint(I, recolor(2, twos))`: Paints the filtered cells with the value '2' onto the input grid. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, recolor(2, mfilter(prapply(lambda loc, d: add(loc, d), 
                                                 toindices(objects(I, True, False, True)), 
                                                 {RIGHT}),
                                      lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0)))
```
**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, True, False, True)`:  Identifies objects made of '1's excluding background.
2. `toindices(...)`: Extracts indices of cells within those objects.
3. `prapply(lambda loc, d: add(loc, d), ..., {RIGHT})`: Generates a set of indices shifted one position to the right from the original object indices.
4. `mfilter(..., lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0)`: Filters these shifted indices, keeping only those where the original grid contains a '0'.
5. `recolor(2, ...)`:  Assigns the color '2' to the filtered indices.
6. `paint(I, ...)`: Applies the color '2' at the specified indices on the input grid, effectively placing '2's to the right of the '1's where applicable.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1):
            if I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j+1] == 0:
                O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j+1)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `O = I`: Initializes the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2. Iterates through each cell of the input grid (except the last column).
3. `if I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j+1] == 0`: Checks if a cell contains '1' and its right neighbor is '0'.
4. `O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j+1)})`: If the condition is met, fills the right neighbor cell in the output grid with '2'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               recolor(2, 
                       mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(toindices(shift(obj, RIGHT)), lambda ind: index(I, ind) == 0),
                             objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, True, False, True)`: Identifies objects formed by '1's (excluding background).
2. `mapply(lambda obj: ..., objects(...))`: Applies a function to each identified object and merges the results.
3. `sfilter(toindices(shift(obj, RIGHT)), lambda ind: index(I, ind) == 0)`: For each object:
    - Shifts the object one position to the right.
    - Extracts indices of the shifted object.
    - Filters the indices, keeping only those where the corresponding cell in the input grid is '0'.
4. `recolor(2, ...)`: Assigns the color '2' to all the filtered indices.
5. `paint(I, ...)`:  Paints the input grid with color '2' at the determined indices.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def shift_and_check(obj):
        shifted = shift(obj, RIGHT)
        return frozenset((2, (i,j)) for v, (i,j) in shifted if (i,j-1) in toindices(obj) and index(I, (i,j)) == 0)
    return paint(I, merge(apply(shift_and_check, objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, True, False, True)`: Extracts objects made of '1's excluding background.
2. `apply(shift_and_check, objects(...))`:  Applies the `shift_and_check` function to each extracted object.
3. `shift_and_check(obj)`: This inner function:
    - Shifts the object one position to the right.
    - Iterates through the shifted object's cells, checking if:
        - The cell's left neighbor was part of the original object.
        - The cell's original position in the input grid contains a '0'.
    - If both conditions are met, it includes the cell (with color '2') in the output set.
4. `merge(...)`:  Combines the results from all objects into a single set.
5. `paint(I, ...)`:  Draws the resulting set (cells with color '2') onto the input grid. 

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformation within the constraints of the DSL, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the language.
