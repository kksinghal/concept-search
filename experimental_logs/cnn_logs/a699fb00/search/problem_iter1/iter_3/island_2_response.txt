## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '1' in the input grid and replacing the rightmost '1' within each object with the digit '2'. 

Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

* Two objects are formed by the digit '1': one in the top-left corner and one at the bottom-left.
* In both objects, the rightmost '1' is replaced by '2'.

**Input_1:**

* Four objects are formed by the digit '1'.
* The rightmost '1' in each object is replaced by '2', leaving the other '1's unchanged.

**Input_2:**

* Five objects are formed by the digit '1'.
* As in previous examples, the rightmost '1' in each object is replaced by '2'.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  modified_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    rightmost_j = valmax(toindices(obj), lambda x: x[1])
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if j == rightmost_j:
        modified_objs = insert((2, (i, j)), modified_objs)
      else:
        modified_objs = insert((v, (i, j)), modified_objs)
  return paint(I, modified_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** We use `objects(I, T, F, T)` to extract objects formed by '1's.
2. **Find rightmost cell:** For each object, we find the rightmost cell using `valmax` on the object's indices with a lambda function to compare column indices (`x[1]`).
3. **Replace with '2':** We iterate through the object's cells. If a cell is the rightmost, we insert a new cell with value '2' at the same index into `modified_objs`. Otherwise, we keep the original cell.
4. **Paint to grid:** Finally, we use `paint` to apply the `modified_objs` to the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, frozenset(frozenset(((2 if j == valmax(toindices(obj), lambda x: x[1]) else v), (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version achieves the transformation within a single line using nested comprehensions:

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts the objects.
2. **Find rightmost and replace:** For each object `obj`, we iterate through its cells `(v, (i, j))`. We use `valmax` with a lambda function `lambda x: x[1]` to find the column index (`j`) of the rightmost cell. If the current cell is the rightmost, we replace its value `v` with '2', otherwise, we keep the original value.
3. **Paint to grid:**  `paint` applies the modified objects to the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modify_obj(obj):
    rightmost_index = argmax(toindices(obj), lambda x: x[1])
    return frozenset((2 if (i, j) == rightmost_index else v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj)
  return paint(I, frozenset(modify_obj(obj) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a helper function `modify_obj` to encapsulate the logic of modifying each object:

1. **Identify objects:**  `objects(I, T, F, T)` extracts the objects.
2. **Modify each object:** The `modify_obj` function finds the index of the rightmost cell within the object using `argmax` and a lambda function to compare column indices. It then iterates through the object's cells, replacing the value at the rightmost index with '2' and keeping the rest unchanged. 
3. **Paint to grid:** `paint` applies the modified objects to the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    rightmost_j = valmax(toindices(obj), lambda x: x[1])
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, {(2 if j == rightmost_j else v, (i, j))})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version constructs the output grid incrementally:

1. **Create empty grid:** We initialize a new grid `new_grid` with the same shape as the input grid but filled with '0's using `canvas`.
2. **Identify objects and find rightmost:**  We extract objects and find the rightmost cell's column index (`rightmost_j`) as in previous versions.
3. **Paint cells to new grid:** We iterate through each object's cells. If the current cell is the rightmost, we paint a '2' at its location in `new_grid`; otherwise, we paint the original cell value.
4. **Return new grid:** Finally, we return the `new_grid`, which now reflects the desired transformation. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def replace_rightmost(obj):
    indices = toindices(obj)
    rightmost = max(indices, key=lambda x: x[1])
    return frozenset((2 if (i, j) == rightmost else I[i][j], (i, j)) for i, j in indices)
  return paint(I, frozenset(replace_rightmost(obj) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a helper function `replace_rightmost` for clarity:

1. **Identify objects:** We first extract objects using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Replace rightmost in object:**  The `replace_rightmost` function finds the index of the rightmost cell in the object. It then iterates through the indices of the object. If the index matches the rightmost index, it replaces the cell value with '2'; otherwise, it retrieves the original value from the input grid `I`.
3. **Paint to grid:** We apply the `replace_rightmost` function to each object and paint the resulting modified objects onto the input grid using `paint`.

These five versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the desired transformation using the DSL. They highlight the flexibility and expressive power of the language for solving spatial reasoning problems.
