## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by connected '1's on the grid (excluding diagonals), and then changing the rightmost '1' of each object to a '2'. 

**Detailed Breakdown:**

* **Input 0:** The input has two objects formed by '1's. For both objects, the rightmost '1' gets replaced by a '2'.
* **Input 1:**  Similar to Input 0, the transformation targets the rightmost '1' in each object, changing it to '2'.
* **Input 2:** Again, the pattern holds. Each object's rightmost '1' becomes a '2'. 


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  rightmost_cells = mapply(lambda obj: (color(obj), astuple(uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj))), objs)
  return paint(I, recolor(2, rightmost_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies objects formed by connected '1's, ignoring diagonals and background.
2. **Find Rightmost Cells:** `mapply` applies a lambda function to each object to find its rightmost cell. `astuple(uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj))` gets the coordinates of the rightmost cell in each object.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** `recolor(2, rightmost_cells)` changes the color of the rightmost cells to '2'. `paint(I, ...)` applies this change to the original grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for j in range(len(I[0])-1, 0, -1):
    for i in range(len(I)):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j-1] == 0:
        I = fill(I, 2, {(i, j)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Backwards:**  The program iterates through the grid columns from right to left (`range(len(I[0])-1, 0, -1)`), and then each row.
2. **Find and Replace:**  If a cell contains a '1' (`I[i][j] == 1`) and the cell to its left is a '0' (`I[i][j-1] == 0`), it means this '1' is the rightmost one in its object, so it gets replaced by a '2'. 

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(2, mfilter(lambda cell: index(I, add(cell, LEFT)) == 0, 
                              merge(apply(toindices, objects(I, True, False, True))))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Object Indices:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` finds the objects. `apply(toindices, ...)` extracts the indices of cells within each object.
2. **Merge and Filter:** `merge(...)` combines the indices from all objects. The `mfilter` keeps only those indices where the cell to their left (`add(cell, LEFT)`) contains a '0' in the original grid (`index(I, ...)`).
3. **Recolor and Paint:** The remaining indices represent the rightmost '1's. These are recolored to '2' and painted onto the original grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def process_object(obj):
        rightmost_j = max(j for _, (i, j) in obj)
        return frozenset({(2, (i, j)) if j == rightmost_j else (v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj})
    return paint(I, merge(apply(process_object, objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Process Objects:**  The program defines a function `process_object` to handle each object individually.
2. **Find Rightmost Column:** Within each object, it finds the maximum column index (`j`) where a '1' exists.
3. **Recolor Rightmost:** It then iterates through the object's cells, replacing the value with '2' only if the cell's column index matches the `rightmost_j`. 
4. **Paint Modified Objects:** Finally, it paints the modified objects back onto the original grid.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return paint(I, recolor(2, 
                       mpapply(lambda loc: astuple(loc[0], loc[1]-1),
                               mpapply(lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT),
                                       merge(apply(toindices, objects(I, True, False, True)))))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Right Neighbours of Object Cells:**  This version first identifies all object cells and then calculates the indices of their immediate right neighbors using `add(loc, RIGHT)`.
2. **Filter for Valid Neighbors:** Using `mpapply` again, it filters for valid neighbors: those that are actually within the grid bounds and have a value of '0'.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** Finally, it recolors the valid neighbors to '2' and paints them onto the input grid, effectively changing the rightmost '1' of each object to a '2'.
