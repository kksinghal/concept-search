## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying horizontal sequences of the digit '1' within each row of the input grid and changing the second digit of each sequence to '2'.  Let's break down each example:

**Input_0:**

* The first row `1 0 1 0 0` has two single '1' digits, so no change occurs.
* The fourth row `0 1 0 1 0` has two single '1' digits, so no change occurs.

**Input_1:**

* The second row `0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0` has four single '1' digits, so no change occurs.
* The fifth row `0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0` has two single '1' digits, so no change occurs.
* The seventh row `0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0` has two single '1' digits, so no change occurs.
* The ninth row `0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0` has two single '1' digits, so no change occurs.

**Input_2:**

* The third row `0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0` has two single '1' digits, so no change occurs.
* The sixth row `0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0` has three single '1' digits, so no change occurs.
* The tenth row `0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0` has two single '1' digits, so no change occurs.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program using only the functions provided in the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(grid):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          2 if j > 0 and row[j-1] == 1 and v == 1 else v
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in grid
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows:**  The program iterates through each row of the input grid.
2. **Iterate through cells in row:** For each cell within the row, it checks if the current cell value is '1' and if the previous cell value is also '1'.
3. **Replace with '2':** If both conditions are true, it replaces the current cell value with '2'. Otherwise, it retains the original cell value.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(grid):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          branch(j > 0 and row[j] == 1 and row[j-1] == 1, 2, row[j]) 
          for j in range(len(row))
      )
      for row in grid
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows and cells:** Similar to version 1, this program iterates through each cell in each row.
2. **Conditional replacement:** It uses the `branch` function to conditionally replace the cell value. If the current and previous cells are '1', it replaces the current cell with '2'. Otherwise, it keeps the original value.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(grid):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          v + (contained((1, 1), pair(row[max(0, j-1):j+1], row[j:min(len(row), j+2)])) and v == 1) 
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in grid
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and pair:**  This version iterates through cells and uses the `pair` function to create pairs of adjacent cell values.
2. **Check for (1, 1):** It then uses `contained` to check if the pair (1, 1) exists within these adjacent values.
3. **Conditional addition:** If a match is found and the current cell is '1', it adds '1' to the cell value, effectively changing it to '2'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(grid):
  return tuple(
      papply(
        lambda i, j: 2 if j > 0 and i == 1 and j == 1 else i, 
        row, 
        (0, ) + row[:-1]
      )
      for row in grid
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Pair with previous element:**  This program uses `papply` to apply a lambda function to pairs of the current cell and the previous cell in each row.
2. **Lambda for replacement:** The lambda function checks if both the current cell and the previous cell are '1'. If true, it returns '2'; otherwise, it returns the original cell value.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(grid):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          branch(
              both(
                  equality(v, 1),
                  contained(2, (row[j-1] if j > 0 else 0, v)) 
              ),
              2,
              v
          ) 
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in grid
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and check:** This version iterates through cells and uses `both` to check if the current cell is '1' and if '2' is contained within a tuple of the previous cell (or '0' if it's the first cell) and the current cell.
2. **Branching for replacement:** It uses `branch` to conditionally replace the cell value with '2' if the conditions are met, otherwise keeping the original value. 


These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation using different combinations of functions from the DSL.
