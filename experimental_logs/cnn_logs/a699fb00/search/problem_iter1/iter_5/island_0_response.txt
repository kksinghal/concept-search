## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation being applied to the input grids involves identifying objects made up of the digit "1" and then extending these objects to the right by one cell, filling this new cell with the digit "2".  This extension only occurs if the right neighbor cell is empty (contains a "0").

**Input_0:** 
- The "1" objects are extended to the right with a "2" if possible.

**Input_1:**
- Same as Input_0, demonstrating the transformation applies across larger grids.

**Input_2:** 
- Again, the same pattern is followed, reinforcing the consistency of the transformation rule.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               asobject(I) | 
               recolor(2, 
                       mfilter(
                           asindices(I), 
                           lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 1 and 0 <= loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0
                       )
               )
           )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asindices(I)`:** Creates a set of all cell indices in the input grid.
2. **`lambda loc: ...`:**  This anonymous function checks if a given cell index `loc` meets the criteria:
   -  The cell at `loc` contains a "1" (`index(I, loc) == 1`).
   -  The cell to the right of `loc` is within the grid bounds (`0 <= loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0])`).
   -  The cell to the right of `loc` contains a "0" (`index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0`).
3. **`mfilter(..., lambda loc: ...)`:** Filters the cell indices, keeping only those that satisfy the lambda function's criteria.
4. **`recolor(2, ...)`:**  Recolors the filtered indices (representing the extension cells) to the value "2".
5. **`asobject(I) | ...`:**  Combines the original object cells from the input grid with the newly recolored extension cells.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the combined object cells onto the input grid, producing the final output. 

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, 2,
               mfilter(
                   asindices(I),
                   lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, loc) == 1 and index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0
               ) |
              asindices(I)
          )

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asindices(I)`:** Gathers all cell indices within the grid.
2. **`lambda loc: ...`:**  An anonymous function filters the indices, ensuring:
    - The current cell is within bounds (`0 <= loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0])`).
    - The cell contains a "1" (`index(I, loc) == 1`).
    - The right neighbor is a "0" (`index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0`).
3. **`mfilter(..., lambda loc: ...)`:** Applies the filter, keeping only indices meeting the criteria.
4. **`... | asindices(I)`:** Combines the filtered indices with all original indices, ensuring original "1"s are preserved.
5. **`fill(I, 2, ...)`:**  Fills the selected indices with the value "2", effectively extending "1" objects to the right.

### Program Version 3: 

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               merge(
                   apply(
                       lambda obj: obj | recolor(2, sfilter(lambda ind: 0 <= ind[1] + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (ind[0], ind[1] + 1)) == 0, {astuple(ind[0], ind[1] + 1) for ind in toindices(obj)})), 
                       sfilter(
                           lambda obj: color(obj) == 1,
                           objects(I, True, True, False)
                       )
                   )
               )
           )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, True, False)`:** Identifies all connected objects in the grid (including diagonal connections).
2. **`lambda obj: color(obj) == 1`:**  Filters for objects composed solely of the color "1".
3. **`sfilter(..., lambda obj: ...)`:** Applies the color filter, keeping only "1" objects.
4. **`lambda ind: ...`:** Another anonymous function, this time checking if an index `ind` (representing a potential extension cell) meets these requirements:
   - It is within grid boundaries (`0 <= ind[1] + 1 < len(I[0])`).
   - The cell to its left contains a "0" (`index(I, (ind[0], ind[1] + 1)) == 0`).
5. **`{astuple(ind[0], ind[1] + 1) for ind in toindices(obj)}`:** Generates a set of potential extension cell indices to the right of each cell in the current object.
6. **`sfilter(..., lambda ind: ...)`:**  Filters the potential extension cells, keeping only valid ones.
7. **`recolor(2, ...)`:** Recolors the valid extension cells to "2".
8. **`obj | ...`:** Combines the original object with its extended cells.
9. **`apply(..., ...)`:** Applies the extension logic to each "1" object.
10. **`merge(...)`:**  Combines all modified objects back into a single set.
11. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the final set of objects onto the input grid. 

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I,
                asobject(I) |
                recolor(2,
                        intersection(
                          shift(ofcolor(I, 1), RIGHT),
                          ofcolor(I, 0)
                        )
                      )
              )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`:** Finds all indices of cells containing the value "1".
2. **`shift(..., RIGHT)`:** Shifts the set of "1" indices one position to the right.
3. **`ofcolor(I, 0)`:** Locates all indices of cells containing "0".
4. **`intersection(..., ...)`:** Finds the common indices between the shifted "1" indices and the "0" indices. This represents the cells to be filled with "2". 
5. **`recolor(2, ...)`:** Recolors the intersection indices to "2".
6. **`asobject(I) | ...`:**  Merges the original grid object with the newly colored "2" cells.
7. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the combined object onto the input grid.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I,
              asobject(I) |
              recolor(2, 
                      mfilter(
                          product(range(len(I)), range(len(I[0]) - 1)),
                          lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 1 and index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0
                      )
                   )
            )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`product(range(len(I)), range(len(I[0]) - 1))`:** Generates all possible cell indices within the grid, excluding the last column.
2. **`lambda loc: ...`:** An anonymous function filters the indices based on these conditions:
    - The cell at the current index contains "1" (`index(I, loc) == 1`).
    - The cell to the right contains "0" (`index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0`). 
3. **`mfilter(..., lambda loc: ...)`:** Filters the generated indices, keeping only those that meet the specified criteria.
4. **`recolor(2, ...)`:** Changes the color of the filtered cells to "2", effectively creating the rightward extension.
5. **`asobject(I) | ...`:**  Combines the original grid object with the new "2" cells.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the combined objects onto the input grid to produce the final output.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation. Each version uses various DSL functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility and power of the provided DSL.
