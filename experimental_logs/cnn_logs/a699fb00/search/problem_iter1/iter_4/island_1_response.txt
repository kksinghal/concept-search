## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves changing the value of a '1' digit to a '2' if and only if there's another '1' immediately to its right on the same row. 

Let's break down how this applies to each example:

**Input_0:**

* The '1' at (0,1) becomes a '2' because there's a '1' at (0,2). 
* The '1' at (3,2) becomes a '2' because there's a '1' at (3,3).

**Input_1:**

* This example follows the same logic, with multiple '1's transforming into '2's on the second row and a few other scattered instances.

**Input_2:**

* Again, the transformation consistently applies, with '2's appearing only when a '1' is followed by another '1' on the same row.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_73251a56(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
        2 if v == 1 and j < width(I) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 1 else v 
        for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through rows and cells:**  We use nested loops to iterate over each cell (value `v` at index `j`) within each row (index `i`) of the input grid `I`.
2. **Check for condition:** For every cell, we check if its value `v` is '1' and if there's a '1' to its right. This is done by ensuring `j` is not the last column (`j < width(I) - 1`) and checking if the value in the next column (`I[i][j + 1]`) is also '1'.
3. **Conditional replacement:** If both conditions are true, we replace the current cell's value with '2'. Otherwise, we keep the original value `v`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_73251a56(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            2 if v == 1 and j < len(row) - 1 and row[j + 1] == 1 else v
            for j, v in enumerate(row)
        )
        for row in I
    )
```

**Explanation:**

* **Similar to Version 1:** This version is nearly identical to Version 1, but it directly accesses the next element in the row using `row[j + 1]` instead of using grid indices like `I[i][j + 1]`. This might offer a slight performance improvement.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_73251a56(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            branch(v == 1 and j < len(row) - 1 and row[j + 1] == 1, 2, v)
            for j, v in enumerate(row)
        )
        for row in I
    )
```

**Explanation:**

* **Using the `branch` function:** This version explicitly employs the `branch` function from the DSL to handle the conditional replacement. While functionally equivalent to the previous versions, it demonstrates a different way to express the same logic.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_73251a56(I):
    shifted_right = tuple(row[1:] + (0,) for row in I)
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            2 if a == 1 and b == 1 else a
            for a, b in zip(row1, row2)
        )
        for row1, row2 in zip(I, shifted_right)
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a shifted grid:** This version first creates a new grid, `shifted_right`, where each row is shifted one position to the right, with a '0' padding the end.
2. **Simultaneous iteration:** We then iterate through both the original grid `I` and `shifted_right` simultaneously.
3. **Compare and replace:** For each corresponding cell pair (a from `I`, b from `shifted_right`), we check if both are '1'. If true, the cell in the output grid gets a '2'; otherwise, it retains the value from the original grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_73251a56(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if v==1 and contained(2,(v,index(I,(i,crement(j))))) else v
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through the grid:** Similar to previous versions, we iterate through rows and cells of the input grid.
2. **Check for '1' and its right neighbor:** We examine if the current cell value (`v`) is '1'. If it is, we construct a tuple containing the current value (`v`) and the value of the cell to its right. The `crement(j)` function helps handle the edge case when `j` is at the last index, preventing an `IndexError`. We then use `contained` to check if '2' exists within this constructed tuple.
3. **Conditional replacement:** Based on the condition check, we either replace the current cell value with '2' or retain the original value.

These five versions showcase diverse ways to achieve the desired transformation while adhering to the provided DSL. Each leverages different functions and logic, demonstrating flexibility in problem-solving within the DSL's constraints.
