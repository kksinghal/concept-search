## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve extending horizontal sequences of '1's to the right by one cell, filling that cell with a '2'. Isolated '1's or vertical sequences are not affected.

**Input 0:**

* The horizontal sequence of '1 1' at the top is extended to '1 2 1'.
* The horizontal sequence of '1 1' at the bottom is extended to '1 2 1'.

**Input 1:**

* The horizontal sequence of '1 1 1 1' is extended to '1 2 1 2 1 2 1'.
* Other '1's are left unchanged as they are either isolated or in vertical sequences.

**Input 2:**

* There are multiple horizontal sequences of '1 1' and '1 1 1', all extended similarly to the previous examples. 

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I,
               asobject(I) |
               recolor(2, 
                       mfilter(
                           asindices(I), 
                           lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 1 and 0 <= loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0
                       )
               )
           )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asindices(I)`:** Get all indices of the input grid `I`.
2. **`mfilter(...)`:** Filter the indices based on the `lambda` function:
   - `index(I, loc) == 1`: Check if the value at the current index is '1'.
   - `0 <= loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0])`: Check if the right neighbor exists within grid boundaries.
   - `index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0`: Check if the right neighbor is '0'.
3. **`recolor(2, ...)`:**  Recolor the filtered indices (right neighbors of '1 1' sequence) with '2'.
4. **`asobject(I) | ...`:** Combine the original object with the recolored indices.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paint the resulting object back onto the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, 2,
              mfilter(
                  asindices(I),
                  lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, loc) == 1 and index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0
              )
          )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asindices(I)`:** Get all indices of the input grid `I`.
2. **`mfilter(...)`:** Filter the indices based on the `lambda` function (same logic as in Version 1).
3. **`fill(I, 2, ...)`:** Fill the filtered indices (right neighbors of '1 1' sequence) with '2' directly on the input grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I,
               merge(
                   apply(
                       lambda obj: obj | recolor(2, {(i, j + 1) for (i, j) in toindices(obj) if 0 <= j + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (i, j + 1)) == 0}), 
                       objects(I, True, False, False)
                   )
               )
           )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, False)`:** Get all objects from the input grid `I`, considering only directly connected cells of the same color.
2. **`apply(lambda obj: ..., ...)`:** Apply a function to each object:
   - `toindices(obj)`: Get the indices of the object.
   - `{(i, j + 1) for ...}`: Generate a set of indices representing the right neighbors of '1' cells within the object, checking for grid boundaries and '0' values.
   - `obj | recolor(2, ...)`:  Combine the original object with the right neighbors recolored to '2'.
3. **`merge(...)`:** Merge all modified objects back into a single object.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paint the final object onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               merge(
                   apply(
                       lambda obj: obj | recolor(2, sfilter(lambda ind: 0 <= ind[1] + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (ind[0], ind[1] + 1)) == 0, {astuple(ind[0], ind[1] + 1) for ind in toindices(obj)})), 
                       sfilter(
                           lambda obj: color(obj) == 1,
                           objects(I, True, True, False)
                       )
                   )
               )
           )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, True, False)`:** Get all connected objects from the grid, regardless of diagonal connections.
2. **`sfilter(lambda obj: ..., ...)`:** Filter the objects to keep only those with color '1'.
3. **`apply(lambda obj: ..., ...)`:** Apply a function to each object:
   - `toindices(obj)`: Get the indices of the object.
   - `{...}`: Create a set of tuples representing right neighbors of each index in the object.
   - `sfilter(lambda ind: ..., ...)`: Filter the neighbor indices, ensuring they are within grid bounds and correspond to a '0' cell.
   - `recolor(2, ...)`: Recolor the filtered neighbor indices to '2'.
   - `obj | ...`: Combine the original object with the recolored neighbors.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merge all modified objects into a single object.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paint the final object back onto the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    new_grid = []
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        new_row = list(row)
        for j, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell == 1 and j < len(row) - 1 and row[j + 1] == 0:
                new_row[j + 1] = 2
        new_grid.append(tuple(new_row))
    return tuple(new_grid)

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through each cell:** This code directly iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Check for conditions:** For each cell, it checks if the cell value is 1, if it's not the last cell in the row, and if the next cell in the row is 0.
3. **Modify the grid:** If the conditions are met, it changes the value of the next cell to 2.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the same transformation using different combinations of DSL functions. Each version showcases the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL in solving spatial reasoning tasks.
