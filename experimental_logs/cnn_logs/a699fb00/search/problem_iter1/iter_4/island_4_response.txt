## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit excluding the background color, 0) and painting the right neighbor cell of each object pixel with color '2', provided the neighbor cell was initially background (color '0').

**Input_0 Example:**
- The '1's form two separate objects.
- For the top object, the right neighbor of (0,1) is painted '2'.
- For the bottom object, the right neighbors of (3,1) and (3,3) are painted '2'.

**Input_1 & Input_2:** 
- The logic applied is identical to Input_0, extending to all objects present in the grid.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  shifted_right = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objs)
  intersection = mpapply(lambda obj1, obj2: toindices(intersection(toindices(obj1), toindices(obj2))), objs, shifted_right)
  return paint(I, recolor(2, sfilter(lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0, intersection))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objs = objects(I, True, False, True)` extracts objects from the grid, excluding background.
2. **Shift Right:** `shifted_right = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objs)` shifts each object one cell to the right.
3. **Find Intersection:** `intersection = mpapply(lambda obj1, obj2: toindices(intersection(toindices(obj1), toindices(obj2))), objs, shifted_right)` finds the intersection between the original objects and their shifted counterparts. This captures the right neighbor cells that were originally part of an object.
4. **Filter Background:** `sfilter(lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0, intersection)` keeps only the intersection cells that are background (color '0') in the input grid.
5. **Paint & Return:** `paint(I, recolor(2, ...))` paints the filtered cells with color '2' on the original grid and returns the result.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(2, mfilter(lambda loc: index(I, subtract(loc, RIGHT)) != 0 and index(I, loc) == 0, asindices(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get All Indices:** `asindices(I)` gets the indices of all cells in the grid.
2. **Filter Right Neighbors:** `mfilter(lambda loc: index(I, subtract(loc, RIGHT)) != 0 and index(I, loc) == 0, ...)` filters for indices where:
    - The cell is background (color '0').
    - Its right neighbor is not background.
3. **Recolor & Paint:** `paint(I, recolor(2, ...))`  recolors the filtered indices to '2' on the original grid and returns the result.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    shifted_right = ((0,) * len(I[0]),) + I[:-1]
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            2 if left != 0 and right == 0 else right
            for left, right in zip(left_row, right_row)
        )
        for left_row, right_row in zip(shifted_right, I)
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Right:** `shifted_right = ((0,) * len(I[0]),) + I[:-1]` shifts the input grid one cell to the right, padding the leftmost column with zeros.
2. **Iterate & Paint:** The nested loop iterates through each cell (`right`) in the original grid and its corresponding right neighbor (`left` in `shifted_right`). If the left cell is not background and the right cell is background, the right cell is painted with color '2'. Otherwise, the original value is retained.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(2, mfilter(lambda cell: index(I, cell) == 0 and any(dneighbor in toindices(objects(I, True, False, True)) for dneighbor in dneighbors(cell) if dneighbor[1] == cell[1] + 1), asindices(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get All Indices:** `asindices(I)` retrieves all cell indices in the grid.
2. **Filter for Right Neighbor:** `mfilter(lambda cell: ..., asindices(I))` filters for cells that satisfy two conditions:
    - The current cell is background (color '0').
    -  At least one of its direct right neighbors belongs to an object (identified using `dneighbors(cell)` and `toindices(objects(I, True, False, True))`).
3. **Recolor and Paint:** `paint(I, recolor(2, ...))` recolors the filtered cells to '2' on the original grid and returns the final grid.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def paint_right_neighbor(obj):
    return recolor(2, sfilter(lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0, toindices(shift(obj, RIGHT))))
  
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(paint_right_neighbor, objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Helper Function:** `paint_right_neighbor(obj)` is a helper function that takes an object and:
    - Shifts it one cell to the right: `shift(obj, RIGHT)`
    - Filters for cells that are background (color '0') in the original grid: `sfilter(lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0, ...)`
    - Recolors the filtered cells to '2': `recolor(2, ...)`
2. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, True, False, True)` extracts all objects from the input grid, excluding background.
3. **Apply & Merge:** `apply(paint_right_neighbor, objs)` applies the helper function to each object and `merge(...)` combines the results.
4. **Paint & Return:** `paint(I, ...)` paints the merged recolorings onto the original grid and returns the final grid.
