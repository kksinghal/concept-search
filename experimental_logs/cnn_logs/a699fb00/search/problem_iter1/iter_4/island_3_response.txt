## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected components of the same color) on the input grid and then coloring the cell to the right of each object pixel with the value '2'. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

* The input has two objects formed by the digit '1'.
* For each object, the cell to the right of each '1' is colored '2' in the output.

**Input_1:**

* Similar to Input_0, but with more objects.
* Again, for every object formed by the digit '1', the cell to its right is colored '2' in the output.

**Input_2:**

* The pattern continues, demonstrating the consistency of the transformation rule.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  shifted_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objs)
  twos = mfilter(shifted_objs, lambda cell: index(I, cell[1]) == 0)
  O = paint(I, recolor(2, twos))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies all objects formed by non-background colors, considering only directly adjacent cells (not diagonal).
2. **Shift Right:** `shifted_objs = apply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objs)` shifts each object one cell to the right.
3. **Filter Empty Cells:** `twos = mfilter(shifted_objs, lambda cell: index(I, cell[1]) == 0)` filters the shifted objects, keeping only the cells with a value of '0' in the original input grid.
4. **Recolor and Paint:** `O = paint(I, recolor(2, twos))` recolors the filtered cells to '2' and paints them onto the original input grid, producing the output.

### Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(2, 
                         mpapply(lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT),
                                 merge(apply(toindices, objects(I, True, False, True))))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Extract Indices:** `merge(apply(toindices, objects(I, True, False, True)))` identifies all objects and merges their individual indices into a single set.
2. **Shift Right:** `mpapply(lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT), ...)` shifts all extracted indices one cell to the right.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** `paint(I, recolor(2, ...))` recolors the shifted indices to '2' and paints them onto the original input grid.

### Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    shifted_indices = set()
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
        for i, j in toindices(obj):
            shifted_indices.add((i, j + 1))
    filtered_indices = {(i, j) for i, j in shifted_indices if 0 <= j < width(I) and index(I, (i, j)) == 0}
    return paint(I, recolor(2, filtered_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Objects and Shift Indices:** This version iterates through each object and its indices, shifting each index one cell to the right and storing them in `shifted_indices`.
2. **Filter Valid Indices:** It then filters `shifted_indices` to keep only those within the grid bounds and corresponding to cells with a value of '0' in the input.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** Finally, it recolors the filtered indices to '2' and paints them onto the input grid to generate the output.

### Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
        O = paint(O, recolor(2, 
                             sfilter(apply(lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT), toindices(obj)), 
                                    lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < width(I) and index(I, loc) == 0)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Objects:** This version iterates through each identified object.
2. **Shift and Filter Indices:** For each object, it shifts its indices one cell to the right and then filters them, keeping only those within grid bounds and corresponding to '0' values in the input.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** It recolors the filtered indices to '2' and paints them onto a copy of the input grid (`O`). This process is repeated for each object, accumulating the changes in the output grid.

### Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_object(obj):
    return sfilter(apply(lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT), toindices(obj)), 
                   lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < width(I) and index(I, loc) == 0)
  return paint(I, recolor(2, merge(apply(process_object, objects(I, True, False, True)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Helper Function:** This version defines a helper function `process_object` to handle the index shifting and filtering for each object. 
2. **Apply Helper Function:** It applies `process_object` to each identified object, generating a set of valid indices for recoloring.
3. **Merge, Recolor, and Paint:** It merges the results from all objects, recolors the indices to '2', and paints them onto the input grid to create the output.


These program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation. They highlight the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for tackling this spatial reasoning task. Each version offers a unique combination of functions and logic, showcasing diverse ways to solve the problem within the DSL's constraints.
