## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extending objects formed by the digit '1' to the right by one cell, filling the extension with the digit '2'. This extension only occurs if the right neighbor cell is empty (contains '0').

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The '1' at (0, 0) is extended to the right, becoming '1 2'.
* The '1' at (0, 2) is extended to the right, becoming '1 2'.
* The '1' at (3, 1) is extended to the right, becoming '1 2'.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* Several '1's across different rows are extended to the right, each becoming '1 2'.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**

* Similar to the previous examples, '1's with empty right neighbors are extended.


## Program_to_be_generated:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               merge(
                   apply(
                       lambda obj: obj | recolor(2, shift(toindices(obj), RIGHT)), 
                       sfilter(
                           lambda obj: color(obj) == 1 and index(I, astuple(uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)) == 0, 
                           objects(I, True, True, False)
                       )
                   )
               )
           )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, True, False)`:**  Extract all objects from the grid.
2. **`sfilter(...)`:** Filter the objects, keeping only those where:
    * **`color(obj) == 1`**: The object consists of '1's.
    * **`index(I, astuple(uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)) == 0`**: The cell to the right of the object is '0'.
3. **`apply(...)`:**  For each filtered object:
    * **`shift(toindices(obj), RIGHT)`:** Calculate the indices of the extension.
    * **`recolor(2, ...)`:** Create a new object with value '2' at the extension indices.
    * **`obj | ...`:**  Combine the original object with the extension.
4. **`merge(...)`:**  Merge all extended objects.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paint the merged objects onto the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, 2, 
              mfilter(
                  ofcolor(I, 1), 
                  lambda loc: index(I, astuple(loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0 and 0 <= loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0])
              )
          ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`:**  Get the indices of all cells containing '1'.
2. **`mfilter(...)`:** Filter the indices, keeping only those where:
   * **`index(I, astuple(loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0`**: The cell to the right is '0'.
   * **`0 <= loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0])`**: The right neighbor is within the grid bounds.
3. **`fill(I, 2, ...)`:**  Fill the filtered indices with the value '2'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  new_grid = [[I[i][j] for j in range(w)] for i in range(h)]
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w - 1):  
      if I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 0:
        new_grid[i][j + 1] = 2
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through the grid and directly modifies a copy if the current cell is '1' and the right neighbor is '0'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I,
               merge(
                   apply(
                       lambda loc: recolor(2, {(loc[0], loc[1] + 1)}), 
                       sfilter(
                           lambda loc: index(I, astuple(loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0 and 0 <= loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0]),
                           ofcolor(I, 1)
                       )
                   )
               )
           )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`:**  Get indices of cells with '1'.
2. **`sfilter(...)`:** Filter indices with '0' to the right and within grid bounds.
3. **`apply(...)`:**  For each filtered index, create a new object with '2' at the right neighbor.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merge all new objects.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paint the merged objects onto the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               asobject(I) | 
               recolor(2, 
                       mfilter(
                           asindices(I), 
                           lambda loc: index(I, astuple(loc[0], loc[1] - 1)) == 1 and 0 <= loc[1] - 1 < len(I[0])
                       )
               )
           )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asindices(I)`:**  Get all indices of the input grid.
2. **`mfilter(...)`:** Filter indices having '1' to their left and within grid bounds.
3. **`recolor(2, ...)`:**  Create a new object with '2' at the filtered indices.
4. **`asobject(I) | ...`:**  Combine the input grid object with the new object.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paint the combined object onto the input grid.
