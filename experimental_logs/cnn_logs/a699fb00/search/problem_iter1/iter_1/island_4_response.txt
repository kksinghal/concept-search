## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves replacing every digit '0' immediately to the right of a digit '1' with the digit '2'. 

**Input-Output Pair Examples:**

- **Input_0:** The '0's at (0,1) and (3,2) are changed to '2's because they are immediately to the right of '1's. 
- **Input_1:** Similar to Input_0, only '0's directly to the right of a '1' are changed.
- **Input_2:**  The pattern remains consistent; '2's replace specific '0's based on their position relative to '1's.


## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objs)
  intersection = mapply(toindices, intersection(objs, shifted_objs))
  return paint(I, recolor(2, intersection))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects (connected components of the same digit) in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Shift right:** `shifted_objs` shifts each object one position to the right.
3. **Find intersections:** `intersection(objs, shifted_objs)` finds the overlapping cells between the original objects and the shifted ones. These are the cells where a '0' exists to the right of a '1'. 
4. **Recolor and paint:** `recolor(2, intersection)` recolors the intersected cells to '2'. Finally, `paint(I, ...)` applies these changes to the original grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if j > 0 and row[j-1] == 1 and val == 0 else val 
      for j, val in enumerate(row)
    ) 
    for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates directly through the grid, replacing '0's with '2's if they are preceded by a '1' in the same row.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
    shifted_right = ((0,) * len(I[0]),) + I[:-1]
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            2 if left == 1 and right == 0 else right
            for left, right in zip(left_row, right_row)
        )
        for left_row, right_row in zip(shifted_right, I)
    ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shifted grid:** `shifted_right` creates a new grid shifted one row up, filling the bottom row with zeros.
2. **Zip and compare:** The code iterates through both grids simultaneously. If a cell in `shifted_right` is 1 and the corresponding cell in the original grid is 0, it replaces the 0 with a 2.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  ones = objects(replace(I, 0, mostcolor(I)), T, F, T)
  return paint(I, recolor(2, mfilter(
    lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0 and index(I, add(loc, LEFT)) == 1,
    asindices(I)
  )))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find ones:**  `ones = objects(replace(I, 0, mostcolor(I)), T, F, T)` identifies the locations of all the '1's in the grid.
2. **Check for zeros to the right:** For each cell in the grid, it checks if the cell is 0 and the cell to its left is 1.
3. **Recolor and paint:** If the condition is true, the cell is recolored to '2' and painted back onto the grid.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          2 if v == 0 and (j > 0 and row[j - 1] == 1) else v
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through each cell, checking if it is a '0' and if the cell to its left is a '1'. If both conditions are true, it replaces the '0' with a '2'.

Each of these programs provides a different approach to achieving the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL.
