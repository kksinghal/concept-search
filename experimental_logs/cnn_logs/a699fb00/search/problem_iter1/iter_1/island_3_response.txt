## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects composed of the digit '1' and adding the digit '2' to the right of each object. The background (digit '0') and other objects remain unchanged. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:** 
- Two objects are detected: one in the top left corner and one at the bottom left. 
- A '2' is added to the right of each object.

**Input_1:** 
- Four objects are identified.
- A '2' is added to the right of each object.

**Input_2:**
- Six objects are found.
- A '2' is added to the right of each object.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions ("Program_to_be_generated") that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Extract objects made of '1's
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objs) # Shift each object to the right
  twos = mfilter(shifted_objs, lambda loc: index(I,loc) == 0) # Filter out shifted cells that overlap with existing objects
  O = fill(I, 2, twos)  # Fill the filtered cells with '2'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, True, False, True)`:**  Extracts objects formed by the digit '1' from the input grid 'I'.
2. **`shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objs)`:** Shifts each extracted object one cell to the right.
3. **`twos = mfilter(shifted_objs, lambda loc: index(I,loc) == 0)`:** Filters the shifted cells, keeping only those located on a background cell (value 0).
4. **`O = fill(I, 2, twos)`:** Fills the remaining shifted cells (representing the added '2's) with the value '2'.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)  # Get indices of all '1's
  right_of_ones =  mpapply(lambda x: add(x, RIGHT), ones) # Calculate indices one cell to the right
  valid_cells = sfilter(right_of_ones, lambda x: index(I, x) == 0) # Keep only indices with '0' in the input grid
  O = fill(I, 2, valid_cells) # Fill the valid cells with '2'
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = ofcolor(I, 1)`:**  Finds the indices of all cells containing the digit '1'.
2. **`right_of_ones =  mpapply(lambda x: add(x, RIGHT), ones)`:** Calculates the indices of cells immediately to the right of each '1'.
3. **`valid_cells = sfilter(right_of_ones, lambda x: index(I, x) == 0)`:** Filters these calculated indices, retaining only those where the original grid 'I' has a '0'.
4. **`O = fill(I, 2, valid_cells)`:** Fills the filtered indices (where '2's should be added) with the digit '2'.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grid = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT) # Shift the entire grid right
  overlapping_ones = mfilter(shifted_grid, lambda x: x[0] == 1 and index(I, x[1]) == 1) # Find shifted '1's overlapping with original '1's
  cells_to_fill = difference(shifted_grid, overlapping_ones)  # Remove overlapping cells from shifted grid
  twos =  frozenset((2, x[1]) for x in cells_to_fill if x[0] == 1) # Extract the positions for the new '2's
  O = paint(I, twos)  # Paint the new '2's onto the original grid
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_grid = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)`:** Shifts the entire grid one cell to the right, treating all cells as an object.
2. **`overlapping_ones = mfilter(shifted_grid, lambda x: x[0] == 1 and index(I, x[1]) == 1)`:** Identifies shifted '1' cells that overlap with original '1' cells in the input grid.
3. **`cells_to_fill = difference(shifted_grid, overlapping_ones)`:** Removes the overlapping '1' cells from the shifted grid.
4. **`twos =  frozenset((2, x[1]) for x in cells_to_fill if x[0] == 1)`:** Extracts the indices of the remaining shifted '1' cells, which will be replaced with '2's.
5. **`O = paint(I, twos)`:**  Paints the digit '2' onto the original grid at the extracted indices.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Initialize output as input
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])-1):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j+1] == 0:
        O = fill(O, 2, {(i,j+1)})  # Fill with '2' if '1' is found and cell to the right is '0'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:**  Initializes the output grid 'O' as a copy of the input grid 'I'.
2. **Iterates through each cell of the input grid (except the last column):**  The nested loops iterate through rows (index 'i') and columns (index 'j') of the grid.
3. **`if I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j+1] == 0:`:**  Checks if the current cell contains '1' and the cell to its right contains '0'.
4. **`O = fill(O, 2, {(i,j+1)})`:** If the condition is met, the cell to the right of the current cell in the output grid 'O' is filled with '2'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1) # Get indices of all '1's
  potential_two_indices = apply(lambda x: add(x, RIGHT), one_indices) # Get indices to the right of all '1's
  valid_two_indices = sfilter(potential_two_indices, lambda x: index(I, x) == 0 and 0 <= x[1] < len(I[0])) # Filter for valid indices within the grid and containing '0'
  O = fill(I, 2, valid_two_indices) # Fill valid indices with '2'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`one_indices = ofcolor(I, 1)`:** Identifies the indices of all cells in the input grid 'I' that contain the digit '1'.
2. **`potential_two_indices = apply(lambda x: add(x, RIGHT), one_indices)`:** Computes a set of potential indices for placing '2's by shifting each '1' index one position to the right.
3. **`valid_two_indices = sfilter(potential_two_indices, lambda x: index(I, x) == 0 and 0 <= x[1] < len(I[0]))`:** Filters the potential indices, keeping only those that:
   - Fall within the bounds of the grid (column index `x[1]` is within the valid range).
   - Correspond to cells containing '0' in the original grid 'I'.
4. **`O = fill(I, 2, valid_two_indices)`:**  Modifies the input grid 'I' by placing the digit '2' at each valid index, effectively adding a '2' to the right of each '1' object.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
