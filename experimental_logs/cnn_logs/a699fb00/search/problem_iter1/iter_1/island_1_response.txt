## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves changing the color of certain '1' digits in the input grid to '2' in the output grid. The specific '1' digits to be changed are those that have another '1' digit immediately to their right.

**Input_0:**

* The '1' at (0,1) is changed to a '2' because there's a '1' to its right (0,2).
* The '1' at (3,3) is changed to a '2' because there's a '1' to its right (3,4).

**Input_1:**

* Several '1' digits are changed to '2' following the same logic. For example, the '1' at (1,1) is changed because there's a '1' at (1,3), and so on.

**Input_2:**

* Again, the same logic applies.  For example, the '1' at (2,1) is changed to a '2' because there's a '1' at (2,3).


## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve_73251a56(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
        2 if v == 1 and j < len(row) - 1 and row[j+1] == 1 else v
        for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This program iterates through each row and each cell within the row. If a cell contains a '1' and it's not the last element in the row and the next element in the row is also a '1', then the current cell's value is changed to a '2'. Otherwise, the original value is retained.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve_73251a56(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
        2 if v == 1 and any(I[i][j+1:j+2]) == 1 else v
        for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

Similar to Version 1, this program iterates through each cell. It checks if the cell is '1' and if there's at least one '1' in the slice of the row starting from the next element. If both conditions are true, the cell's value is changed to '2'. 

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve_73251a56(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
        branch(v == 1 and j < len(row) - 1 and row[j+1] == 1, 2, v)
        for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the `branch` function. It iterates through cells and checks the same condition as in Version 1. If the condition is true, the `branch` function returns '2'; otherwise, it returns the original cell value.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve_73251a56(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
        (lambda x: 2 if x else v)(v == 1 and j < len(row) - 1 and row[j+1] == 1)
        for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a lambda function for a more compact conditional replacement. It iterates through each cell and uses the lambda function to evaluate the condition (same as in previous versions). If true, the lambda function returns '2', otherwise the original cell value.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve_73251a56(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            apply(lambda x: 2 if x else v, (v == 1 and j < len(row) - 1 and row[j+1] == 1,))[0]
            for j, v in enumerate(row)
        )
        for row in I
    )
```

**Explanation:**

This version employs a combination of `apply` and a lambda function. It iterates through each cell and applies the lambda function (with the same condition as before) to a tuple containing the boolean result of the condition. The lambda function returns '2' if the condition is true, otherwise the original cell value. The `apply` function returns a tuple with a single element, so `[0]` is used to extract the value.

These five versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the same transformation using a variety of DSL functions and programming constructs.
