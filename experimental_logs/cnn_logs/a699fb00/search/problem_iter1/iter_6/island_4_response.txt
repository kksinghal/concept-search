## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (groups of connected '1's) in the grid and painting the cell to the right of each '1' with a '2', but only if the cell is currently a '0'. 

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

* **Input_0:** The '1's at (0,0), (0,2), (3,1), and (3,3) get a '2' painted to their right because those cells are initially '0'.
* **Input_1:**  The same logic applies. Notice the '1's at the right edge of the grid don't get a '2' painted beside them because there's no cell to their right. 
* **Input_2:**  Again, the transformation consistently paints a '2' to the right of each '1' within the object, only if that cell is initially '0'.


## Program to be Generated (5 Versions):

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(2, mfilter(lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0 and any(index(I, n) == 1 for n in dneighbors(loc) if n == add(loc, RIGHT)), asindices(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asindices(I)`:** Creates a set of all cell indices in the grid.
2. **`mfilter(...)`:** Filters these indices, keeping only those where:
   - **`index(I, loc) == 0`:** The cell at the current index contains a '0'.
   - **`any(index(I, n) == 1 for n in dneighbors(loc) if n == add(loc, RIGHT))`:** At least one of the directly adjacent neighbors to the right contains a '1'.
3. **`recolor(2, ...)`:**  Transforms the filtered indices into an object where each cell is colored with '2'.
4. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Paints the '2' object onto the original grid `I`, resulting in the final transformed grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True) 
    shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objs)
    valid_cells = mfilter(lambda cell: index(I, cell[1]) == 0, merge(shifted_objs))
    return paint(I, recolor(2, toindices(valid_cells))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Identifies all objects (connected '1's) in the grid, excluding the background.
2. **`shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objs)`:** Shifts each object one cell to the right.
3. **`valid_cells = mfilter(lambda cell: index(I, cell[1]) == 0, merge(shifted_objs))`:** Filters the shifted objects, keeping only the cells that are '0' in the original grid.
4. **`paint(I, recolor(2, toindices(valid_cells)))`:** Paints the valid cells with '2' on the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  return tuple(
        tuple(
            2 if col == 0 and j < len(row) - 1 and row[j+1] == 1 else col 
            for j, col in enumerate(row)
        )
        for i, row in enumerate(I)
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`for i, row in enumerate(I)`:** Iterates through each row of the grid.
2. **`for j, col in enumerate(row)`:** Iterates through each cell in the current row.
3. **`2 if col == 0 and j < len(row) - 1 and row[j+1] == 1 else col`:**  Checks if the current cell is '0' and if the cell to its right exists and is '1'. If true, it replaces the cell with '2'; otherwise, it keeps the original value.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            2 if j < w - 1 and I[i][j] == 0 and I[i][j + 1] == 1 else I[i][j]
            for j in range(w)
        )
        for i in range(h)
    ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`h, w = len(I), len(I[0])`:** Stores the height and width of the grid.
2. **`for i in range(h)`:** Iterates through each row.
3. **`for j in range(w)`:**  Iterates through each column.
4. **`2 if j < w - 1 and I[i][j] == 0 and I[i][j + 1] == 1 else I[i][j]`:** Checks if the current cell is not on the right edge, is '0', and has a '1' to its right. If true, it's replaced with '2'; otherwise, it keeps its original value.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  return tuple(
        tuple(
            2 if I[i][j] == 0 and (j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 1) else I[i][j] 
            for j in range(len(I[0]))
        )
        for i in range(len(I))
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`for i in range(len(I))`:** Iterates through each row.
2. **`for j in range(len(I[0]))`:**  Iterates through each column.
3. **`2 if I[i][j] == 0 and (j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 1) else I[i][j]`:** Similar to version 4, it checks for '0' cells with '1' to the right and replaces them with '2', otherwise keeping the original value.
