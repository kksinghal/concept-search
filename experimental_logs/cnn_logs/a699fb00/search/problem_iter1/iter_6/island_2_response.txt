## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring the rightmost cell of each connected object in the grid to the value '2'.  Connected objects are defined as groups of cells with the same value that are adjacent horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.

**Input_0:**

* Two objects are present: ones formed by '1's and the other formed by '0's.
* The rightmost '1' in each object is recolored to '2'.

**Input_1:**

* Same logic as Input_0, applied to a larger grid with more objects.

**Input_2:**

*  Again, the same logic is applied, recoloring the rightmost cell of each connected object to '2'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_rightmost(obj):
    rightmost_index = rightmost(toindices(obj))
    return frozenset((2 if j == rightmost_index else v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj)
  return paint(I, merge(apply(recolor_rightmost, objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies all connected objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **`apply(recolor_rightmost, ...)`:** Applies the `recolor_rightmost` function to each object.
3. **`recolor_rightmost(obj)`:** 
    * Finds the rightmost index within the object using `rightmost(toindices(obj))`.
    * Iterates through each cell of the object and recolors the cell to '2' if its column index matches the rightmost index.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Combines the modified objects back into a single object set.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the modified objects onto the input grid `I`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def rightmost_cell(obj):
    return frozenset({(2, (i, rightmost(obj))) for i, j in toindices(obj)})
  return paint(I, merge(apply(rightmost_cell, objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Finds all connected objects in the grid.
2. **`apply(rightmost_cell, ...)`:**  Applies the `rightmost_cell` function to each object.
3. **`rightmost_cell(obj)`:** 
    *  Creates a new object containing only the rightmost cell of the input object, with its value changed to '2'.
4. **`merge(...)`:**  Combines the modified cells into a single object set.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the modified cells onto the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modify_column(grid, j):
    filtered_objects = sfilter(objects(grid, T, F, T), lambda obj: j == rightmost(obj))
    return fill(grid, 2, mfilter(filtered_objects, toindices)) if filtered_objects else grid
  return tuple(tuple(modify_column(I, j)[i][j] for j in range(len(I[0]))) for i in range(len(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`modify_column(grid, j)`:** This function modifies a specific column `j` in the grid.
    * **`sfilter(...)`:** Finds all objects whose rightmost cell is in the current column `j`.
    * **`fill(grid, 2, ...)`:** If any such objects are found, it fills their indices with the value '2'.
2. The main program iterates through each cell in the grid and applies `modify_column` to its column.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def recolor_if_rightmost(v, i, j, obj):
    return (2 if j == rightmost(obj) else v, (i, j)) 
  modified_objects =  frozenset({
    frozenset(recolor_if_rightmost(v, i, j, obj) for v, (i, j) in obj) 
    for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)
  })
  return paint(I, modified_objects)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts all connected objects from the input grid.
2. **`recolor_if_rightmost(v, i, j, obj)`:** Checks if a cell is the rightmost of its object. If so, it changes the cell value to '2'; otherwise, the value remains unchanged.
3.  The main program applies `recolor_if_rightmost` to each cell of each object and then paints the modified objects back onto the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def rightmost_recolor(obj):
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, (0, 1))
    return frozenset((2 if (i, j) in toindices(shifted_obj) and (i, j - 1) in toindices(obj) else v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj)
  return paint(I, frozenset(rightmost_recolor(obj) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies all connected objects in the input grid.
2. **`rightmost_recolor(obj)`:** For each object:
    * It shifts the object one position to the right.
    * It iterates through the original object's cells. If a cell's right neighbor is also part of the object, it recolors the cell to '2'. 
3. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the modified objects onto the input grid. 


Each of these programs implements the described transformation using different combinations of DSL functions, demonstrating diverse approaches to solve the task.
