## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify horizontally adjacent pairs of '1's in the input grid and replace the right '1' of each pair with a '2' in the output grid. All other digits remain unchanged.

**Input_0:**

* The pair of '1's in the first row is transformed, replacing the second '1' with a '2'.
* The pair of '1's in the fourth row is similarly transformed.

**Input_1:**

* Three horizontal pairs of '1's are identified and transformed accordingly.

**Input_2:**

* Four horizontal pairs of '1's are identified and transformed accordingly.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**
```python
def solve_horizontal_pairs(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            2 if v == 1 and j < len(row) - 1 and row[j + 1] == 1 else v
            for j, v in enumerate(row)
        )
        for row in I
    )
```

**Explanation:**

* This program iterates through each row of the input grid `I`.
* For each cell in a row, it checks if the current cell value `v` is 1 and if there's a next cell in the row with a value of 1.
* If both conditions are met, it replaces the current cell value with 2; otherwise, it retains the original value.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**
```python
def solve_horizontal_pairs(I):
    J = I
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, v in enumerate(row):
            if j < len(row) - 1 and v == 1 and row[j + 1] == 1:
                J = fill(J, 2, ((i, j + 1),))
    return J
```

**Explanation:**

* This program creates a copy of the input grid `I` as `J`.
* It iterates through each cell in `I`.
* If a cell and its right neighbor both contain '1', it uses the `fill` function to replace the right neighbor's value with '2' in the `J` grid.
* Finally, it returns the modified `J` grid.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**
```python
def solve_horizontal_pairs(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            branch(j < len(row) - 1 and v == 1 and row[j + 1] == 1, 2, v)
            for j, v in enumerate(row)
        )
        for row in I
    )
```

**Explanation:**

* This program iterates through each row of the input grid.
* For every cell, it uses the `branch` function to conditionally replace the cell value.
* If the cell contains a '1' and its right neighbor exists and also contains a '1', it replaces the cell value with '2'.
* Otherwise, it retains the original cell value.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**
```python
def solve_horizontal_pairs(I):
    return tuple(
        tuple(
            papply(
                lambda x, y: 2 if x == 1 and y == 1 else x,
                row,
                (0,) + row[:-1]
            )
        )
        for row in I
    )
```

**Explanation:**

* This program iterates through each row of the input grid.
* For each row, it uses the `papply` function to compare each cell with its right neighbor (using a shifted tuple `(0,) + row[:-1]`).
* If both the cell and its right neighbor have a value of '1', the `papply` function replaces the cell value with '2'.
* Otherwise, the original cell value is retained.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def solve_horizontal_pairs(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          branch(
              contained((1, 1), pair(row, (0,) + row[:-1])),
              2 if v == 1 and j < len(row) - 1 and row[j + 1] == 1 else v,
              v
          )
          for j, v in enumerate(row)
      )
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

* This program iterates through each row of the input grid.
* For each cell, it checks if the pair (1, 1) exists in a pairing of the row with a shifted version of itself `(0,) + row[:-1]` using the `contained` function.
* If the pair (1, 1) is found, it implies a horizontal pair of '1's. Then, it checks if the current cell and its right neighbour are both '1'. If true, it replaces the current cell value with 2.
* If the pair (1, 1) is not found, it directly uses the original cell value.
