## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying '1' digits in the input grid and adding a '2' digit to their immediate right, but only if the cell to the right is empty (contains a '0').

**Input_0:**
- The '1' digits at (0,0) and (0,2) both have a '0' to their right, so a '2' is added at (0,1) and (0,3) respectively.
- The '1' digit at (3,1) has a '0' to its right, so a '2' is added at (3,2).

**Input_1:**
- This input demonstrates that the transformation only applies to '1' digits and not other values.
- It also shows that the transformation only occurs if the cell to the right is empty.

**Input_2:**
- This input further reinforces the above observations.

## Program_to_be_generated:

### Program Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, 
               asobject(I) | 
               recolor(2, 
                       mfilter(
                           asindices(I), 
                           lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 1 and 0 <= loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0
                       )
               )
           )
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`asindices(I)`:** This function gets all the indices of the grid.
2. **`lambda loc: ...`:** This defines an anonymous function that checks if:
    - The value at the current index (`loc`) is '1'.
    - The index to the right of `loc` is within the grid bounds.
    - The value at the index to the right of `loc` is '0'.
3. **`mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: ...)`:** This filters the indices, keeping only those that satisfy the conditions defined in the anonymous function.
4. **`recolor(2, ...)`:** This recolors the filtered indices to '2'.
5. **`asobject(I) | ...`:** This combines the original grid object with the recolor object.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:** This paints the combined object onto the original grid.


### Program Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, 2,
             mfilter(
                 asindices(I),
                 lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, loc) == 1 and index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0
             )
         )
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`asindices(I)`:** Gets all indices of the grid.
2. **`lambda loc: ...`:** Similar to Version 1, checks for '1' with a '0' to its right within grid bounds.
3. **`mfilter(...)`:** Filters indices based on the condition.
4. **`fill(I, 2, ...)`:** Directly fills the filtered indices with '2' in the original grid.


### Program Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I,
             merge(
                 apply(
                     lambda obj: obj | recolor(2, {(ind[0], ind[1] + 1) for ind in toindices(obj) if 0 <= ind[1] + 1 < len(I[0]) and index(I, (ind[0], ind[1] + 1)) == 0}),
                     sfilter(
                         lambda obj: color(obj) == 1,
                         objects(I, True, True, False)
                     )
                 )
             )
         )
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`objects(I, True, True, False)`:** Extracts all objects from the grid.
2. **`sfilter(...)`:** Filters for objects with color '1'.
3. **`lambda obj: ...`:** For each '1' object:
    - `toindices(obj)` gets its indices.
    - It adds indices to the right of each object index, only if within bounds and containing '0'.
    - `recolor(2, ...)` recolors these new indices to '2'.
    - It combines the original and new indices.
4. **`apply(...)`:** Applies the above lambda function to every '1' object.
5. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the resulting objects.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the merged objects onto the original grid.


### Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I,
               asobject(I) |
               recolor(2,
                       {astuple(loc[0], loc[1] + 1) for loc in product(range(len(I)), range(len(I[0]) - 1)) if index(I, loc) == 1 and index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0}
                   )
           )
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`product(range(len(I)), range(len(I[0]) - 1))`:** Generates all possible cell coordinates.
2. **`... if index(I, loc) == 1 and index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] + 1)) == 0`:** Filters for coordinates where the current cell is '1' and the cell to its right is '0' and within bounds.
3. **`{astuple(loc[0], loc[1] + 1) for ...}`:** Creates a set of tuples representing the coordinates to the right of the filtered cells.
4. **`recolor(2, ...)`:** Recolors the cells at the generated coordinates to '2'.
5. **`asobject(I) | ...`:** Combines the original grid object with the recolor object.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the combined object onto the original grid.


### Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    shifted_ones = shift(ofcolor(I, 1), RIGHT)
    return paint(I, asobject(I) | recolor(2,  
                   mfilter(shifted_ones, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]) and index(I, loc) == 0)))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **`ofcolor(I, 1)`:** Get indices of all cells with value '1'.
2. **`shift(..., RIGHT)`:** Shifts those indices one position to the right.
3. **`mfilter(..., lambda loc: ...)`:** Filters the shifted indices, keeping only those:
    - Within the grid's bounds.
    - Having a value of '0' at the shifted location.
4. **`recolor(2, ...)`:** Recolors the filtered indices to '2'.
5. **`asobject(I) | ...`:** Combines the original grid object with the recolor object.
6. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the combined object onto the original grid.

These five program versions each provide a distinct approach to achieving the target transformation, showcasing diverse ways to leverage the provided DSL functions.
