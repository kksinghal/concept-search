## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves adding a '2' to the right of every '1' in the input grid, but only if that position is currently a '0' (the background color). 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:**
    * The '1's at (0,0), (3,1), and (3,3) all get a '2' added to their right. 
    * The '1's at (0,2) and (3,0) do not because there are already '1's to their right.
* **Input_1 & Input_2:** The same logic applies, demonstrating the transformation's consistency across different grid configurations.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(2, 
                           mfilter(lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0 and index(I, subtract(loc, RIGHT)) == 1, 
                                   asindices(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`asindices(I)`:**  Generates all possible indices of the input grid `I`.
2. **`lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0 and index(I, subtract(loc, RIGHT)) == 1`:** This lambda function checks if a given location `loc` has a value of 0 and if the location to its left has a value of 1.
3. **`mfilter(...)`:**  Filters the indices to keep only those that satisfy the lambda function's condition.
4. **`recolor(2, ...)`:**  Sets the color of the filtered indices to '2'.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:**  Applies the color changes to the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_right = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)
  return paint(I, recolor(2, 
                           mfilter(lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0 and index(shifted_right, loc) == 1,
                                   asindices(I)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_right = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)`:** Creates a shifted version of the input grid where all elements are moved one position to the right.
2. **`lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0 and index(shifted_right, loc) == 1`:**  Checks if a location in the original grid is '0' and the corresponding location in the shifted grid is '1'. 
3. **`mfilter(...)`:** Filters the indices based on the lambda function.
4. **`recolor(2, ...)`:**  Colors the filtered indices with '2'.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Paints the changes onto the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  right_neighbors = mfilter(lambda loc: index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == 0, ones)
  return fill(I, 2, mapply(lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT), right_neighbors)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`ones = ofcolor(I, 1)`:** Gets the indices of all '1's in the grid.
2. **`right_neighbors = mfilter(lambda loc: index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == 0, ones)`:**  Filters the '1' indices to keep only those whose right neighbor is a '0'.
3. **`mapply(lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT), right_neighbors)`:** Calculates the indices to the right of the filtered '1's.
4. **`fill(I, 2, ...)`:**  Fills the calculated indices with the value '2'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    right_cells = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(lambda loc: index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == 0, toindices(obj)), objs)
    return paint(I, recolor(2, mapply(lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT), merge(right_cells))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Extracts the objects from the input grid.
2. **`right_cells = mapply(...)`:** For each object, it filters its cell indices to keep only those whose right neighbor in the original grid is 0.
3. **`merge(right_cells)`:** Merges the filtered cell indices from all objects. 
4. **`mapply(lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT), ...)`:** Calculates the indices to the right of all filtered cells.
5. **`paint(I, recolor(2, ...))`:** Colors the calculated indices with '2' on the original grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  padded_grid = hconcat(I, ((0,) * len(I[0]),)) 
  shifted_indices = mapply(lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT), asindices(I)) 
  filtered_indices = sfilter(lambda loc: index(I, subtract(loc, RIGHT)) == 1 and index(padded_grid, loc) == 0, shifted_indices)
  return fill(I, 2, filtered_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`padded_grid = hconcat(I, ((0,) * len(I[0]),))`:** Creates a new grid by adding a column of '0's to the right of the input grid. This padding helps avoid boundary checks.
2. **`shifted_indices = mapply(lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT), asindices(I))`:**  Calculates indices shifted one position to the right for all cells in the original grid.
3. **`filtered_indices = sfilter(...)`:**  Keeps only the shifted indices where the original index holds a '1' and the shifted index in the padded grid holds a '0'.
4. **`fill(I, 2, filtered_indices)`:** Fills the filtered indices in the original grid with the value '2'. 


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to solving the task within the DSL, offering a variety of logic and function combinations.
