## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects formed by the digit '1' and modifies them by changing the digit immediately to the right of each '1' to a '2'. This transformation only occurs within the bounds of the object.

**Example:**

In Input_2, consider the object:
```
0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 
```
The transformation results in: 
```
0 0 0 1 2 1 2 1 0 0
```

Let's break down how this applies to each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- The top-right '1' in each object is followed by a '0' within the object boundary. This '0' is replaced by a '2'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- Similar to Input_0,  '0's following a '1' within the object boundaries are replaced with '2's.

**Input_2 to Output_2:** 

-  The same pattern applies; '0's to the right of '1's within the object are replaced.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program utilizing different DSL functions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(grid):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if v == 1 and j < len(row) - 1 and row[j+1] == 1 else v
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for row in grid
  )
```

**Explanation:**

- This version iterates through each row and cell of the grid.
- It checks if the current cell is '1' and if the next cell in the row is also '1'.
- If both conditions are true, it replaces the current cell with '2'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(grid):
  objs = objects(grid, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if j < len(grid[0]) - 1 and (v, (i, j+1)) in obj:
        grid = fill(grid, 2, {(i, j)})
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

-  Identifies '1' objects using `objects` function.
- Iterates through each object and cell, replacing the cell with '2' if its right neighbor is part of the same object.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(grid):
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if any(grid[i][k] == 1 for k in range(j+1, len(row))) and v == 1 else v
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for i, row in enumerate(grid)
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

- Iterates through rows and cells.
- For each '1', it checks if there's another '1' to its right within the same row.
- If found, replaces the current '1' with '2'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(grid):
  new_grid = tuple(tuple(0 for _ in range(len(grid[0]))) for _ in range(len(grid)))
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, v in enumerate(row):
      if v == 1:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, 1, {(i, j)})
        if j < len(row) - 1 and grid[i][j+1] == 1:
          new_grid = fill(new_grid, 2, {(i, j)})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

- Creates a new empty grid.
- Copies '1's from the original grid. 
- If a '1' has a right neighbor also as '1', it overwrites the copied '1' with a '2'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(grid):
  shifted_grid = tuple(tuple(0) + row for row in grid)
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      2 if row[j] == 1 and shifted_row[j] == 1 else v
      for j, v in enumerate(row)
    )
    for row, shifted_row in zip(grid, shifted_grid)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

- Creates a shifted version of the grid, padding each row with a '0' at the beginning.
- Compares each cell with the corresponding cell in the shifted grid.
- If both are '1', it indicates a '1' followed by another '1' in the original grid, and the current cell is replaced with '2'.
