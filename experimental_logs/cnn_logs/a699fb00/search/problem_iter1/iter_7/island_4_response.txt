## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions) of the digit '1' in the input grid. For each such object, a '2' is painted to the right of each '1' if that cell is currently a '0'.

**Example Breakdown:**

- **Input_0:**  The top-right '1' gets a '2' painted to its right. Similarly, the bottom '1' gets a '2' painted to its right.
- **Input_1 & Input_2:**  The same logic applies â€“ for every '1' in each object, a '2' is painted to its right if that cell is empty (contains a '0').

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions implementing the described transformation:

**Version 1:** (Inspired by Program_A's row-wise iteration and Program_B's object identification)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if j + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j + 1] == 0:
        I = fill(I, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
  return I

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:** We identify objects composed of '1's using `objects(I, True, False, True)`.
2. **Iterate and Paint:** For each object, we iterate through its cells. If a cell's right neighbor is within the grid bounds and contains a '0', we use `fill` to paint a '2' at that neighbor's location.

**Version 2:** (Inspired by Program_A's conditional painting and Program_B's object shifting)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, RIGHT), objs)
  return paint(I, recolor(2, toindices(mfilter(lambda cell: index(I, cell[1]) == 0, merge(shifted_objs)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification and Shifting:**  We identify objects and then shift them one position to the right using `shift(obj, RIGHT)`.
2. **Filtering Valid Cells:** We merge all the shifted objects and filter for cells that originally contained a '0' using `index(I, cell[1]) == 0`.
3. **Painting:**  We recolor the filtered cells to '2' and paint them onto the input grid.

**Version 3:** (Leveraging `dneighbors` for neighbor checking)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, recolor(2, mfilter(lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0 and any(index(I, n) == 1 for n in dneighbors(loc) if n == add(loc, RIGHT)), asindices(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Indices:** We iterate through all grid indices using `asindices(I)`.
2. **Check Right Neighbor:** For each index, we check if its value is '0' and if its right neighbor (using `dneighbors` and `add(loc, RIGHT)`) exists and has a value of '1'.
3. **Paint:** If both conditions are met, we paint a '2' at the current index.

**Version 4:** (Using nested loops and direct grid manipulation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 0:
        I = fill(I, 2, {(i, j + 1)})
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Nested Iteration:** We iterate through the grid using nested loops.
2. **Neighbor Check and Paint:**  For each cell, we check if it contains a '1' and if its right neighbor exists and contains a '0'. If so, we paint a '2' at the right neighbor's location.

**Version 5:** (Using list comprehensions for conciseness)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(tuple(2 if j > 0 and row[j - 1] == 1 and v == 0 else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **List Comprehension:**  We use nested list comprehensions to iterate through the grid.
2. **Conditional Painting:**  For each cell, we check if its left neighbor exists, contains a '1', and the current cell is a '0'. If true, we replace the current cell with a '2'. Otherwise, we keep the original value.


Each version implements the same transformation logic but uses different function combinations and approaches. Choosing the optimal version would depend on factors like code readability, efficiency, and personal preference.
