## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring the rightmost cell of each connected object (considering only horizontal and vertical adjacency) to the value '2'. 

Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 - Output_0:**

* The top-left '1' object has its rightmost cell (1,2) recolored to '2'.
* Similarly, the bottom '1' object has its rightmost cell (4,3) recolored to '2'.

**Input_1 - Output_1:**

*  The transformation is applied to each '1' object, recoloring their respective rightmost cells to '2'. 

**Input_2 - Output_2:**

*  The pattern continues - rightmost cells of all objects formed by '1's are recolored.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def recolor_rightmost(obj):
        return frozenset((2 if (i, j) == (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj)) else v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj)
    return paint(I, frozenset(recolor_rightmost(obj) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`recolor_rightmost(obj)`:** This function iterates through each cell of an object. If a cell's indices match the object's uppermost row and rightmost column, its value is changed to '2'; otherwise, the original value is kept.

2. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  This extracts connected objects from the input grid `I`, considering only horizontally and vertically adjacent cells, without background.

3. **`paint(I, ...)`:** This function paints the modified objects back onto the input grid `I`.

**Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def condition(i, j, obj):
    return j == rightmost(obj) and i == min(k for k, l in toindices(obj) if l == j)
  def recolor_if_rightmost(obj):
    return frozenset((2 if condition(i, j, obj) else v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj)
  modified_objects = frozenset(recolor_if_rightmost(obj) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T))
  return paint(I, modified_objects)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`condition(i, j, obj)`:** This function checks if a cell at index (i,j) is the rightmost cell of the object `obj`, considering the possibility of multiple rightmost cells in the same column.

2.  **`recolor_if_rightmost(obj)`:** This function applies recoloring to '2' only if `condition` is met for a cell in the object.

3.  The rest of the code functions similarly to Version 1.

**Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def rightmost_index(obj):
    return max(((i, j) for i, j in toindices(obj)), key=lambda x: x[1])
  def recolor_rightmost(obj):
    ri, rj = rightmost_index(obj)
    return frozenset(((2 if (i, j) == (ri, rj) else v), (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj)
  return paint(I, frozenset(recolor_rightmost(obj) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`rightmost_index(obj)`:** This function finds the index of the rightmost cell in the object `obj`.

2.  **`recolor_rightmost(obj)`:** This function recolors the cell at the identified rightmost index to '2'.

**Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def recolor_rightmost(obj):
        rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
        return frozenset(
            (2 if j == rightmost_j and i == min(k for k, l in toindices(obj) if l == rightmost_j) else v, (i, j))
            for v, (i, j) in obj
        )
    return paint(I, frozenset(recolor_rightmost(obj) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`recolor_rightmost(obj)`:** 
   - It first finds the `rightmost_j` (rightmost column index) of the object.
   - Then, for each cell, it checks:
     - If the cell's column index `j` is the `rightmost_j` AND
     - If the cell's row index `i` is the minimum row index among all cells in the `rightmost_j` column (this ensures it's the topmost rightmost cell).
   - If both conditions are true, it recolors the cell to '2'; otherwise, it keeps the original value.

**Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def shift_and_compare(obj):
        shifted = shift(obj, (0, 1))
        return frozenset((2 if (i, j) in toindices(shifted) and (i, j - 1) in toindices(obj) else v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj)
    return paint(I, frozenset(shift_and_compare(obj) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shift_and_compare(obj)`:**
   - It first shifts the object `obj` one step to the right, creating `shifted`.
   - Then, for each cell in the original `obj`, it checks:
     - If the cell's index `(i, j)` is present in `shifted` AND
     - If the index `(i, j - 1)` (the cell to its left) is present in the original `obj`.
   - If both conditions are true, it means this cell is the rightmost cell of a horizontal segment within the object, so it's recolored to '2'. Otherwise, the original value is kept.
