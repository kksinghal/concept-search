## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation identifies the horizontal center of each contiguous object (group of connected non-zero digits) in the input grid. It then draws a vertical line of '3's centered on this horizontal center point within the object's bounding box.

**Input 0:** 
- Two objects are detected: one in the top left, one in the bottom right. 
- For each object, a vertical line of '3's is drawn in the middle of its bounding box.

**Input 1:**
- One object is detected.
- A vertical line of '3's is drawn in the middle of its bounding box.

**Input 2:**
- Two objects are detected.
- For each object, a vertical line of '3's is drawn in the middle of its bounding box.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program_v1(I):
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
        left_j = leftmost(obj)
        right_j = rightmost(obj)
        center_j = (left_j + right_j) // 2
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, connect((uppermost(obj), center_j), (lowermost(obj), center_j))))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** A canvas `O` filled with '0's and the same dimensions as the input `I` is created.
2. **Iterate Objects:** The program iterates through each object in the input grid `I` using `objects` function.
3. **Calculate Center:** For each object, the leftmost (`left_j`) and rightmost (`right_j`) column indices are determined. The horizontal center (`center_j`) is calculated.
4. **Draw Line:** A vertical line of '3's is drawn on the output canvas `O`  from the uppermost row to the lowermost row of the object at the calculated `center_j`.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program_v2(I):
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    for j in range(width(I)):
        column = tuple(I[i][j] for i in range(height(I)))
        if any(x != 0 for x in column):
            start_i = next((i for i, x in enumerate(column) if x != 0), None)
            end_i = height(I) - next((i for i, x in enumerate(column[::-1]) if x != 0), None)
            middle_i = (start_i + end_i) // 2
            O = fill(O, 3, {(middle_i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Create an output canvas `O` filled with '0's, having the same dimensions as the input `I`.
2. **Iterate Columns:**  The code iterates through each column `j` of the input grid `I`.
3. **Identify Object:**  It checks if any non-zero value exists in the current column. 
4. **Find Boundaries & Center:** If an object is present, it identifies the starting row (`start_i`) and ending row (`end_i`) of the object in that column.  The vertical center `middle_i` is then calculated.
5. **Draw Pixel:**  A single '3' pixel is drawn at the calculated `middle_i` row and the current `j` column on the output canvas `O`. 

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge({recolor(3, {(center(obj)[0], center(obj)[1])}) for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  The program identifies all distinct objects in the input grid `I` using the `objects` function.
2. **Calculate Center:** For each object, the `center` function is used to determine the center point coordinates.
3. **Recolor Center:** The `recolor` function changes the color of the center point of each object to '3'.
4. **Merge and Paint:** The recoloured centers from all objects are merged, and this merged set of points is painted onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid, resulting in the final output grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def program_v4(I):
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
        upper = uppermost(obj)
        lower = lowermost(obj)
        O = paint(O, recolor(3, {(i, leftmost(obj) + width(obj) // 2) for i in range(upper, lower + 1)}))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialize Output:** It initializes an output grid `O` of the same size as the input grid `I`, filled with '0's.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** It uses the `objects` function to identify distinct objects in the input grid `I`. 
3. **Determine Line Boundaries:**  For each object, it determines the topmost row (`upper`) and bottommost row (`lower`) of the object. It also calculates the horizontal center column index.
4. **Draw Vertical Line:** It draws a vertical line of '3's from the `upper` row to the `lower` row at the calculated center column index on the output grid `O`.


**Program Version 5**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge({recolor(3, {(i, centerofmass(obj)[1]) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1)}) for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)}))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:**  The code identifies all unique objects within the input grid `I` using the `objects` function, treating each connected group of non-zero values as a separate object.
2. **Iterate Through Objects:** The code then iterates through each identified object.
3. **Draw Vertical Line:** For each object, it determines its vertical span (from `uppermost` to `lowermost` row) and draws a vertical line of '3's. The horizontal position of the line is determined by `centerofmass` of the object.
4. **Merge and Paint:** All the drawn lines (recolored object centers) are then merged together, and this merged set of pixels is painted onto a blank canvas (initialized with '0's) of the same dimensions as the input grid, resulting in the final output.
