## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applies the following logic:

* **Identify objects:** The program first identifies all objects (connected components) in the input grid, excluding the background color (most common color).
* **Horizontal line at the center of mass:** For each object, a horizontal line of color '3' is drawn, centered on the object's center of mass. The line's length spans the object's width.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def draw_hline(obj, grid):
    i, j = centerofmass(obj)
    line = {(i, k) for k in range(j - width(obj) // 2, j + width(obj) // 2 + (width(obj) % 2))}
    return paint(grid, recolor(3, line))
  
  cleaned_grid = cover(I, merge(objects(I, True, False, True)))
  return last(rapply(lambda obj: lambda g: draw_hline(obj, g), objects(I, True, False, True)))(cleaned_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`draw_hline(obj, grid)` Function:**
   - Takes an object and the grid as input.
   - Calculates the center of mass `(i, j)` of the object.
   - Creates a horizontal line `line` of indices spanning the object's width, centered at `j`.
   - Recolors the `line` indices to '3' and paints them onto the `grid`.
   - Returns the modified `grid`.

2. **Main Program:**
   - Extracts all objects from the input grid `I` (excluding background) and merges them.
   - Creates a `cleaned_grid` by covering (removing) the merged objects from `I`.
   - Applies the `draw_hline` function to each object and the `cleaned_grid` using `rapply`.
   - The `last` function is used as a workaround for `rapply` not being directly iterable, ensuring only the final modified grid is returned.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def hline_at_center(grid, obj):
    i, j = centerofmass(obj)
    w = width(obj)
    return fill(grid, 3, {(i, j + k - w // 2) for k in range(w)})

  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  return paint(cover(I, merge(objs)), merge(apply(lambda obj: hline_at_center(I, obj), objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`hline_at_center(grid, obj)` Function:**
   - Takes the grid and an object as input.
   - Calculates the center of mass `(i, j)` and width `w` of the object.
   - Creates a set of indices for a horizontal line centered at `j` with length `w`.
   - Fills the `grid` with color '3' at the calculated indices.
   - Returns the modified `grid`.

2. **Main Program:**
   - Identifies all objects in the input grid `I` (excluding background) and stores them in `objs`.
   - Covers (removes) the merged objects from the grid.
   - For each object in `objs`, the `hline_at_center` function is applied, generating a grid with a horizontal line at the object's center.
   - The resulting grids are merged and then painted onto the previously cleaned grid, producing the final output.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modified_grid(grid, obj):
    center_i, center_j = centerofmass(obj)
    width_obj = width(obj)
    for k in range(width_obj):
      j = center_j + k - width_obj // 2
      grid = fill(grid, 3, {(center_i, j)})
    return grid

  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  cleaned_grid = cover(I, merge(objs))
  return last(rapply(lambda obj: lambda g: modified_grid(g, obj), objs))(cleaned_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`modified_grid(grid, obj)` Function:**
   - Takes the grid and an object as input.
   - Calculates the object's center of mass and width.
   - Iterates through the object's width, calculating the corresponding column index `j` for each point on the horizontal line.
   - Fills the grid with color '3' at each calculated `(center_i, j)` location.
   - Returns the modified grid.

2. **Main Program:**
   - Identifies all objects in the input grid (excluding background) and stores them in `objs`.
   - Creates a `cleaned_grid` by removing the merged objects from the input grid.
   - For each object in `objs`, the `modified_grid` function is applied to the `cleaned_grid`.
   - Uses `rapply` to iteratively apply the function to each object, with `last` ensuring only the final modified grid is returned.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def apply_line(obj, g):
    ci, cj = centerofmass(obj)
    w = width(obj)
    return paint(g, recolor(3, {(ci, cj - w // 2 + k) for k in range(w)}))
  
  return last(rapply(lambda obj: lambda g: apply_line(obj, g), objects(I, True, False, True)))(cover(I, merge(objects(I, True, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`apply_line(obj, g)` Function:**
   - Takes an object and the grid (`g`) as input.
   - Calculates the center of mass (`ci`, `cj`) and width (`w`) of the object.
   - Generates a set of indices representing a horizontal line centered at `cj` with length `w`.
   - Recolors the line indices to '3' and paints them onto the grid `g`.
   - Returns the modified grid.

2. **Main Program:**
   - Extracts all objects from the input grid `I` (excluding background) and merges them.
   - Creates a cleaned grid by covering (removing) the merged objects from `I`.
   - Uses `rapply` to apply the `apply_line` function to each object and the cleaned grid.
   - `last` is used as a workaround for `rapply`'s output format, ensuring only the final modified grid is returned.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def line_on_grid(obj, grid):
    i, j = centerofmass(obj)
    w = width(obj)
    line = {(i, j - w // 2 + k) for k in range(w)}
    return paint(grid, recolor(3, line))

  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  cleaned = cover(I, merge(objs))
  return last(rapply(lambda o: lambda g: line_on_grid(o, g), objs))(cleaned)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`line_on_grid(obj, grid)` Function:**
   - Takes an object and the grid as input.
   - Calculates the center of mass (`i`, `j`) and width (`w`) of the object.
   - Defines a set of indices `line` representing a horizontal line centered at `j` with length `w`.
   - Recolors the `line` indices to '3' and paints them onto the `grid`.
   - Returns the modified grid.

2. **Main Program:**
   - Identifies all objects in the input grid `I` (excluding background) and stores them in `objs`.
   - Creates a cleaned grid `cleaned` by covering (removing) the merged objects from `I`.
   - Employs `rapply` to apply the `line_on_grid` function to each object and the `cleaned` grid.
   - `last` ensures that only the final modified grid from `rapply` is returned as the output.
