## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying each distinct object (connected non-zero digits) in the input grid and drawing a horizontal line with the color '3' at the vertical center of each object. The line's width matches the width of the object.

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**
- Two objects are identified: One at the top and one at the bottom.
- A horizontal line of width 3 is drawn at the vertical center of the top object.
- A horizontal line of width 2 is drawn at the vertical center of the bottom object.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- One object is identified in the top half of the grid.
- A horizontal line of width 3 is drawn at the vertical center of the object.

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
- Two objects are identified: One at the top and one on the right side.
- A horizontal line of width 5 is drawn at the vertical center of the top object.
- No line is drawn for the right-side object as it is not wide enough (width <= 1). 

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  def draw_hline(obj, grid):
    if width(obj) <= 1: # Do not draw for objects with width less than 2
        return grid
    i, j = centerofmass(obj)
    w = width(obj)
    line = {(i, j + k - w // 2) for k in range(w)}
    return paint(grid, recolor(3, line))
  
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  cleaned = cover(I, merge(objs))
  return last(apply(lambda obj: draw_hline(obj, cleaned), objs)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`draw_hline(obj, grid)`:** This function takes an object and the grid as input. It calculates the center of mass, width, and constructs a horizontal line of '3's at the object's center with the object's width. It then paints this line onto the grid.
2. **`objects(I, True, False, True)`:** Identifies all distinct objects in the input grid.
3. **`cover(I, merge(objs))`:** Creates a cleaned grid by removing all objects.
4. **`apply(lambda obj: draw_hline(obj, cleaned), objs)`:**  Applies the `draw_hline` function to each object, drawing a line on the cleaned grid.
5. **`last(...)`:** Returns the final modified grid after processing all objects.


**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  def draw_hline(grid, obj):
    if width(obj) > 1: 
      i, _ = centerofmass(obj)
      j = leftmost(obj)
      w = width(obj)
      line =  {(i, j + k) for k in range(w)}
      grid = paint(grid, recolor(3, line))
    return grid

  cleaned = cover(I, merge(objects(I, True, False, True)))
  return last(apply(lambda obj: draw_hline(cleaned, obj), objects(I, True, False, True)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`draw_hline(grid, obj)`:** Takes the grid and object as input. Similar to version 1, it calculates the leftmost point and width of the object and draws a horizontal line using '3's at the object's center.
2. **`cover(...)`:** Removes all objects from the input grid to create a cleaned grid.
3. **`apply(...)`:** Applies the `draw_hline` function to each identified object on the cleaned grid.
4. **`last(...)`:** Returns the final modified grid.


**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  def modified_grid(grid, obj):
    if width(obj) > 1:
      center_i, center_j = centerofmass(obj)
      width_obj = width(obj)
      for k in range(width_obj):
        j = center_j + k - width_obj // 2
        grid = fill(grid, 3, {(center_i, j)})
    return grid

  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  cleaned_grid = cover(I, merge(objs))
  return last(apply(lambda obj: modified_grid(cleaned_grid.copy(), obj), objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`modified_grid(grid, obj)`:** Similar to previous versions, it identifies the horizontal center and width of the object. It then iterates over each column within the object's width and uses `fill` to paint '3's at the center row.
2. **`objs = objects(...)`:**  Identifies all objects in the input grid.
3. **`cleaned_grid = cover(...)`:** Creates a cleaned grid by removing all objects.
4. **`apply(...)`:**  Applies the `modified_grid` function to each object on a copy of the cleaned grid to avoid overwriting. 
5. **`last(...)`:**  Returns the final modified grid.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  def apply_line(obj, grid):
    if width(obj) > 1:
      ci, cj = centerofmass(obj)
      w = width(obj)
      line =  {(ci, cj - w // 2 + k) for k in range(w)}
      grid = paint(grid, recolor(3, line))
    return grid

  return last(apply(lambda obj: apply_line(obj, cover(I.copy(), merge(objects(I, True, False, True)))), objects(I, True, False, True)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`apply_line(obj, grid)`:** This function calculates the center and width of the object and paints a horizontal line of '3's on the provided grid.
2.  It directly applies the `apply_line` function to each object with a cleaned grid created within the `apply` function itself. This makes the code more concise.


**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  def line_on_grid(obj, grid):
    if width(obj) > 1:
      i, j = centerofmass(obj)
      w = width(obj)
      for k in range(w):
        grid = fill(grid, 3, {(i, j - w // 2 + k)})
    return grid

  return last(apply(lambda obj: line_on_grid(obj, cover(I.copy(), merge(objects(I, True, False, True)))), objects(I, True, False, True))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`line_on_grid(obj, grid)`:** Calculates the center, width and iterates through the columns to fill '3's at the center row of the object. 
2.  Similar to version 4, it creates a cleaned grid within the `apply` function for conciseness.

Each version uses a slightly different approach in terms of calculating line coordinates and painting them on the grid, ensuring distinct logic and function combinations. They all achieve the same goal of drawing horizontal lines at the center of each object with the same width.
