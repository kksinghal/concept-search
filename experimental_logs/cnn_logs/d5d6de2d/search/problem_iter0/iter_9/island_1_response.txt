## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying horizontal lines of the digit '2' in the input grid and replacing them with the digit '3' in the output grid.  The position of the '3' line in the output grid corresponds to the vertical center of the '2' line in the input grid. Isolated '2's or vertical lines of '2's are ignored. 

Here's a breakdown:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- Two horizontal '2' lines exist in the input.
- The top line is centered at row 2 (0-based indexing) and becomes a '3' line at row 2 in the output.
- The bottom line is centered at row 7 and becomes a '3' line at row 7 in the output.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- Only one horizontal '2' line exists in the input, centered at row 3.
- This translates to a '3' line at row 3 in the output.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

- One horizontal '2' line is present in the input, spanning columns 2-5 and centered at row 2. 
- The output reflects this with a '3' line at row 2 in the same columns.

## Program_to_be_generated: 

**Program Version 1**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    if 2 in row and row.count(2) > 1 and set(row) != {0, 2}:  # Check for horizontal '2' lines only
      O = fill(O, 3, {(i, j) for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == 2})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Create an empty canvas 'O' of the same size as input 'I', filled with '0's.
2. **Iterate Rows:** Loop through each row 'row' and its index 'i' in the input grid.
3. **Identify Horizontal Lines:** 
    -  `2 in row`: Check if the row contains at least one '2'.
    - `row.count(2) > 1`: Ensure it's not an isolated '2'.
    - `set(row) != {0, 2}`:  Verify it's not a vertical line (only '0' and '2' present).
4. **Fill Output:** If a horizontal '2' line is found, fill the corresponding row 'i' in the output grid 'O' with '3's where '2's were present in the input row.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True):
    if hline(obj): continue # Ignore vertical lines
    min_i, max_i = uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj)
    if max_i - min_i == 0: continue # Ignore single-cell objects
    center_i = (min_i + max_i) // 2
    O = fill(O, 3, {(center_i, j) for _, (i, j) in obj})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Create an empty canvas 'O' with the same dimensions as the input 'I'.
2. **Extract Objects:**  Identify connected components (objects) of '2's in the input using `objects` with `univalued=True`, `diagonal=False`, and `without_bg=True`.
3. **Iterate Objects:**  Loop through each extracted object `obj`.
4. **Filter Vertical Lines:**  Skip processing if the object is a vertical line (`hline(obj)`).
5. **Filter Single Cells:** Skip if the object occupies only a single cell.
6. **Determine Center Row:** Calculate the center row index `center_i` of the object.
7. **Fill Output:** Fill the output grid 'O' with '3's at the `center_i` row and the corresponding columns of the object. 

**Program Version 3**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  O = I[:]  # Create a copy of the input grid
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    if 2 in row and row.count(2) > 1 and set(row) != {0, 2}:
      O = fill(O, 0, {(i, j) for j in range(len(row))}) # Clear the row
      center_index = (len(row) - row.count(0)) // 2  # Calculate the center index
      O = fill(O, 3, {(i, center_index + j) for j in range(row.count(2))}) # Fill '3's
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Copy Input:** Create a copy 'O' of the input grid 'I'.
2. **Iterate Rows:** Loop through each row and its index in the input grid.
3. **Identify Horizontal '2' Lines:** Similar to Version 1, check for horizontal lines of '2's.
4. **Clear Row:** If a horizontal '2' line is found, clear the entire corresponding row in the output grid 'O'.
5. **Calculate Center Index:** Determine the horizontal center index of the '2' line.
6. **Fill '3's:**  Fill the cleared row in 'O' with '3's starting from the calculated center index and spanning the length of the original '2' line.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def program_v4(I):
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
    for obj in objs:
        if width(obj) > 1 and height(obj) == 1: # Check for horizontal line
            center_j = (leftmost(obj) + rightmost(obj)) // 2 # Calculate center column
            O = fill(O, 3, {(i, center_j) for _, (i, _) in obj})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** An empty canvas 'O' is created with the same shape as input 'I'.
2. **Extract Objects:** Connected components (objects) are extracted from 'I' using the `objects` function, similar to Version 2.
3. **Iterate and Filter Objects:** 
   - The code iterates over each extracted `obj`.
   - It checks if the `obj` represents a horizontal line (`width(obj) > 1 and height(obj) == 1`).
4. **Calculate and Fill:** 
   - If a horizontal line is identified, the center column (`center_j`) is calculated.
   - The output grid `O` is then filled with '3's in the same row as the `obj` and at the calculated `center_j` column.

**Program Version 5** 

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 2 and (j == 0 or I[i][j-1] != 2) and (j == len(I[0])-1 or I[i][j+1] == 2): # Find the leftmost '2' of each horizontal line
        min_j = j
        max_j = j
        while max_j < len(I[0])-1 and I[i][max_j+1] == 2:
          max_j += 1
        center_j = (min_j + max_j) // 2
        O = fill(O, 3, {(i, center_j)}) # Fill the corresponding cell in the output grid with '3'
        
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** An empty output grid 'O' of the same size as the input 'I' is created and initialized with '0's.
2. **Iterate Through Grid:** The code uses nested loops to iterate over each cell in the input grid 'I'.
3. **Identify Leftmost '2' of Horizontal Line:** 
   - It checks if the current cell contains a '2' (`I[i][j] == 2`).
   - It ensures that this '2' is the leftmost '2' of a horizontal line by checking if the previous column cell doesn't contain a '2' (`j == 0 or I[i][j-1] != 2`) and the next column cell contains a '2' (`j == len(I[0])-1 or I[i][j+1] == 2`).
4. **Calculate Center and Fill:**
   - If the conditions are met, it finds the rightmost '2' of the horizontal line.
   - It then calculates the center column index (`center_j`) of this line. 
   - Finally, it fills the corresponding cell in the output grid 'O' with a '3' at the calculated center column and the same row.
