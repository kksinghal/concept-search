## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify the central column of each connected component of '2's in the input grid and replace it with a vertical line of '3's in the output grid. The output grid retains the original dimensions of the input grid. 

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

- Two connected components of '2's exist.
- The first component's central column is at index 2.
- The second component's central column is at index 6.
- The output replaces these columns with '3's.

**Input_1:**

- One connected component of '2's exists.
- The central column is at index 5.
- The output replaces this column with '3's.

**Input_2:**

- Two connected components of '2's exist.
- The first component's central column is at index 2.
- The second component's central column is at index 10.
- The output replaces these columns with '3's.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Create an output grid filled with 0s.
  for obj in objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True): # Iterate through connected components of '2's.
    if color(obj) == 2:
      center_j = centerofmass(obj)[1] # Find the column index of the center of mass.
      O = fill(O, 3, {(i, center_j) for i in range(height(I))}) # Draw a vertical line of '3's.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas (`O`) with the same dimensions as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Component Iteration:** Iterates through each connected component (`obj`) of '2's identified by the `objects` function.
3. **Center Identification:** For each component, calculates the column index (`center_j`) of its center of mass using `centerofmass`.
4. **Line Drawing:**  Fills a vertical line of '3's at the calculated column index in the output grid `O`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for j in range(width(I)): # Iterate over columns.
    if any(I[i][j] == 2 for i in range(height(I))): # Check if the column contains a '2'.
      leftmost_2 = min(i for i in range(height(I)) if I[i][j] == 2) # Find the topmost '2'.
      rightmost_2 = max(i for i in range(height(I)) if I[i][j] == 2) # Find the bottommost '2'.
      center_i = (leftmost_2 + rightmost_2) // 2 # Calculate the center row index.
      O = fill(O, 3, {(center_i, j)}) # Fill the center cell with '3'.
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an output grid (`O`) filled with 0s, matching the input dimensions.
2. **Column Scanning:** Iterates through each column (`j`) of the input grid.
3. **'2' Presence Check:** Checks if the current column contains any '2'.
4. **Extreme '2's:**  If a '2' exists, find the row indices (`leftmost_2`, `rightmost_2`) of the topmost and bottommost '2's.
5. **Center Calculation and Filling:**  Calculates the center row index (`center_i`) and fills the corresponding cell in the output grid with '3'.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return hconcat(*[
    fill(canvas(0, (height(I), 1)), 3, {(sum(i * (I[i][j] == 2) for i in range(height(I))) // max(1, colorcount(I, 2)), 0)})
    if any(I[i][j] == 2 for i in range(height(I)))
    else canvas(0, (height(I), 1))
    for j in range(width(I))
  ]) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Column-wise Processing:** Uses list comprehension to process each column individually.
2. **'2' Check and Filling:** For each column (`j`), it checks if '2' is present. If yes, it calculates the weighted average of row indices where '2' occurs and uses `fill` to place '3' at that row in a single-column canvas.
3. **Empty Column Handling:** If no '2' is present, it creates an empty single-column canvas.
4. **Horizontal Concatenation:** Finally, it uses `hconcat` to horizontally join all the processed columns.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return canvas(0, shape(I)) if colorcount(I, 2) == 0 else paint(
    canvas(0, shape(I)),
    recolor(3,
            {(sum(i for i in range(height(I)) if I[i][j] == 2) // max(1, colorcount(I[:, j], 2)), j)
            for j in range(width(I)) if any(I[i][j] == 2 for i in range(height(I)))}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Empty Grid Check:** Checks if the input grid has any '2's. If not, it returns a canvas of '0's.
2. **Center Indices:** Calculates the center row index for each column containing a '2'.
3. **Recoloring:**  Creates a new object (`recolor`) by changing the color of the calculated center indices to '3'.
4. **Painting:**  Paints the recoloured object onto a blank canvas (`canvas`) of the same size as the input. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in fgpartition(I):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      min_j = min(j for _, (i, j) in obj)
      max_j = max(j for _, (i, j) in obj)
      center_j = (min_j + max_j) // 2
      O = fill(O, 3, {(i, center_j) for i in range(height(I))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an output grid (`O`) of '0's with the same dimensions as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Foreground Partitioning:** Partitions the input grid into objects, excluding the background color, using `fgpartition`.
3. **Object Filtering and Processing:** Iterates over each object. If the object's color is '2', it finds the leftmost and rightmost column indices (`min_j`, `max_j`) of the object.
4. **Center Calculation and Line Drawing:** Calculates the center column index (`center_j`) and draws a vertical line of '3's on the output grid (`O`) at that column index.


These five versions offer diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing different aspects and capabilities of the provided DSL.
