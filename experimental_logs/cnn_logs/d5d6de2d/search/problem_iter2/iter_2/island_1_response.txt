## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves moving all the non-zero digits in each row to the beginning of that row, while maintaining their order and relative position. The background (0) fills the rest of the grid.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The 3s in rows 3 and 8 are moved to the beginning of their respective rows. 
* **Input_1:** The 3s in row 3 are moved to the beginning of the row.
* **Input_2:** The 3s in rows 4 and 8 are moved to the beginning of their respective rows.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  moved_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))  
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    non_zero_digits = tuple(v for v in row if v != 0)
    for j, val in enumerate(non_zero_digits):
      moved_grid = fill(moved_grid, val, frozenset(((i, j),))) 
  return moved_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize:** Create an empty grid (`moved_grid`) of the same size as the input (`I`) filled with zeros.
2. **Iterate Rows:** Loop through each row (`i`) and its elements (`row`) in the input grid.
3. **Extract Non-Zeros:** Create a tuple (`non_zero_digits`) containing only the non-zero digits from the current row.
4. **Place Digits:** Loop through the extracted non-zero digits (`val`) and their indices (`j`) and place them sequentially at the beginning of the corresponding row in `moved_grid` using the `fill` function.
5. **Return:** Return the transformed grid (`moved_grid`).

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(v for v in row if v != 0) + tuple(0 for _ in range(width(I) - len([v for v in row if v != 0])))
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **List Comprehension:** Utilizes nested list comprehensions to efficiently transform the grid.
2. **Extract and Fill:** For each row in the input grid, it extracts the non-zero values and concatenates them with a sequence of zeros to maintain the row's original length.
3. **Return:** Returns the transformed grid.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  return tuple(
      tuple(v if j < len([x for x in row if x != 0]) else 0 for j, v in enumerate(row))
      for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Dimensions:** Obtains the height (`h`) and width (`w`) of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** Iterates through each cell (`i`, `j`) and checks if the column index `j` is less than the count of non-zero values in the row. If true, it keeps the original value (`v`); otherwise, it sets the cell to 0.
3. **Return:** Returns the transformed grid.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(row[j] if j < len([k for k, v in enumerate(row) if v != 0]) else 0 for j in range(width(I)))
      for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate with Condition:** Iterates through each cell (`i`, `j`) of the input grid `I`.
2. **Conditional Value:** For each cell, it checks if the column index `j` is within the range of non-zero values in the current row. If true, it retains the original value; otherwise, it assigns 0 to the cell. 
3. **Return:** Returns the transformed grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(v for v, k in zip(row, range(width(I))) if v != 0) + tuple(0 for _ in range(width(I) - len([v for v in row if v != 0])))
      for row in I
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Filter:** Uses a list comprehension to iterate through each row and applies a conditional filter using `zip` to extract non-zero values along with their original indices. 
2. **Concatenate:** Concatenates the extracted non-zero values with a sequence of zeros to maintain the row's width.
3. **Return:** Returns the transformed grid.
