## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to extract the leftmost column of each object and then paste it multiple times vertically, starting from a specific row. Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The leftmost column of the top 3-object (three 3s) is extracted.
* This column is pasted thrice vertically starting from row 2 (0-indexed).
* The leftmost column of the bottom 3-object (four 3s) is extracted.
* This column is pasted four times vertically starting from row 6.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The leftmost column of the 3-object (three 3s) is extracted.
* This column is pasted thrice vertically starting from row 2.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The leftmost column of the 3-object (six 3s) is extracted.
* This column is pasted six times vertically starting from row 2.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  new_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    leftmost_col = frozenset((v, (i, leftmost(obj))) for v, (i, j) in obj)
    start_row = uppermost(obj) + 2 
    height_ = height(obj)
    for i in range(height_):
      new_objs.add(shift(leftmost_col, (i * height_, 0)))
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), frozenset(new_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Similar to Program_A, we first extract all objects from the input grid 'I'.
2. **Iterate Objects:** We loop through each object `obj`.
3. **Extract Leftmost Column:** `leftmost_col` stores cells from the object's leftmost column.
4. **Calculate Starting Row:** `start_row` is determined based on the object's top row.
5. **Vertical Repetition:** We shift the `leftmost_col` vertically by multiples of its height and add them to `new_objs`.
6. **Paint on Canvas:** Finally, we paint the combined `new_objs` onto a blank canvas of the input's shape.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  new_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    left, _ = ulcorner(obj)
    height_ = height(obj)
    for i in range(height_):
      new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(recolor(I[i + uppermost(obj)][left], {(0, 0)}), (i + uppermost(obj) + 2, left)))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Initialize Canvas:** Create an empty canvas with the same shape as the input.
3. **Iterate Objects:** Loop through each detected object.
4. **Extract Leftmost Value:** Get the value of the top-left corner cell of the object.
5. **Vertical Painting:** For each row in the object's height:
   - Create a single-cell object with the extracted value.
   - Shift this object to the appropriate position on the new grid.
   - Paint this object onto the new grid.
6. **Return Grid:** Finally, return the modified grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    new_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))
    for j in range(width(I)):
        column = frozenset((I[i][j], (i, j)) for i in range(height(I)))
        objs = objects(vconcat(canvas(0, (1, width(I))), paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), column)), T, F, T)
        for obj in objs:
          if len(obj) > 1:
            leftmost_col = frozenset((v, (i, 0)) for v, (i, _) in obj)
            height_ = height(obj)
            for i in range(height_):
              new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(leftmost_col, (i + 2, j)))
    return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Create an empty grid of the same size as the input.
2. **Iterate Columns:** Loop through each column of the input grid.
3. **Extract Column:** Create a temporary object representing the current column.
4. **Identify Objects:**  Simulate the column as an object and detect it using `objects`.
5. **Process Multi-Cell Objects:** For objects longer than one cell:
   - Extract the values and their relative row positions.
   - For each cell in the object, paint it repeatedly downwards on the new grid.
6. **Return Grid:** Return the modified grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h, w = shape(I)
    O = canvas(0, (h, w))
    for x in range(w):
        for y in range(h):
            if I[y][x] != 0:
                obj_height = 0
                for k in range(y, h):
                    if I[k][x] != 0:
                        obj_height += 1
                    else:
                        break
                for i in range(obj_height):
                  O = paint(O, {(I[y][x], (y+2+i, x))})
                break  # Move to the next column
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Canvas:** Create an empty output grid `O` of the same size as the input.
2. **Iterate Cells:** Loop through each cell of the input grid using nested loops.
3. **Find Non-Zero Cells:**  If a cell contains a non-zero value:
   - Calculate the height of the object starting from that cell.
   - Paint the cell's value downwards on the output grid, repeating it for the object's height.
   - Break the inner loop to move to the next column after processing an object.
4. **Return Grid:**  Return the populated output grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  new_objs = []
  for obj in objs:
    left = leftmost(obj)
    for i, (v, (row, col)) in enumerate(obj):
      if col == left:
        new_objs.extend([(v, (row + 2 + k, col)) for k in range(height(obj))])
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), frozenset(new_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify and store all distinct objects from the input grid.
2. **Iterate Objects and Cells:** Loop through each object and its individual cells.
3. **Leftmost Column Check:** For each cell, check if it belongs to the leftmost column of its parent object.
4. **Replicate Vertically:** If it's a leftmost cell, replicate it downwards on the grid, starting two rows below its original position. The number of replications is equal to the object's height.
5. **Paint and Return:** Finally, paint all replicated cells onto a blank canvas of the input grid's dimensions and return the resulting grid. 

## Conclusion:

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing diverse logic and function combinations within the DSL. Each version effectively extracts the leftmost column of each object in the input grid and replicates it vertically, achieving the desired output.
