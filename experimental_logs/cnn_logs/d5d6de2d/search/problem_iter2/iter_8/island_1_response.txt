## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation shifts the objects in the input grid to new positions, maintaining their shape and color but removing any empty columns between object cells. Here's a breakdown for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:** 
- The two separate 3-cell objects are moved closer together, eliminating the empty column between them. The first object's leftmost cell is now at position (2,2), and the second object's leftmost cell is at (6,5).

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**
- The single 3-cell object remains in the same column but is shifted upwards, with its topmost cell now at position (2,5). 

**Input_2 -> Output_2:**
- The single 6-cell object is shifted upwards, with its topmost cells now aligned with the top of where the other object in the input was located.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_transformation(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  new_objs = frozenset()
  offset = (0, 0)
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    if i > 0:
      prev_obj = first(objs - {obj})
      offset = add(offset, (0, width(prev_obj)))
    new_obj = shift(obj, offset)
    new_objs = new_objs | {new_obj}
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(new_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, True, False, True)` extracts objects from the input grid (`I`), treating connected same-valued cells as a single object and ignoring the background (0).
2. **Iterate and Shift:** It iterates through each extracted object. For the first object, it calculates a shift offset to bring it to the left edge. For subsequent objects, the offset is incrementally updated based on the width of the previous object. 
3. **Create Shifted Objects:**  Each object is shifted using the calculated offset.
4. **Paint on Canvas:**  A new canvas with the same dimensions as the input is created, and the shifted objects are painted onto it.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_transformation(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  new_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))
  j = 0
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(height(obj)):
      new_grid = fill(new_grid, color(obj), {(i, j)})
      j += 1
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1, it extracts objects from the input grid.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** It iterates through each object, then each row of that object. For each cell in the row, it fills the corresponding color on the new grid, incrementing the column index (`j`) after each cell to remove gaps.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_transformation(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  merged_obj = merge(objs)
  new_grid = canvas(0, (height(I), len(merged_obj)))
  return paint(new_grid, normalize(merged_obj)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Merge Objects:** It identifies objects in the input grid and merges them into a single object.
2. **Create New Grid:** A new grid is created with the height of the input and width equal to the total number of cells in all objects. 
3. **Paint Merged Object:** The merged object is normalized (shifted to the top left corner) and painted onto the new grid.

## Program Version 4: 

**Code:**

```python
def solve_transformation(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  new_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))
  j = 0
  for i in range(h):
    for k in range(w):
      if index(I, (i, k)) != 0:
        new_grid = fill(new_grid, index(I, (i, k)), {(i, j)})
        j += 1
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Input Grid:** This version iterates cell by cell through the input grid.
2. **Fill New Grid:** If a cell in the input grid is not background (0), its value is copied to the corresponding row in the new grid at an updated column index (`j`), effectively removing gaps.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_transformation(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  new_objs = frozenset(normalize(obj) for obj in objs)
  new_grid = canvas(0, (height(I), sum(width(obj) for obj in new_objs)))
  j = 0
  for obj in new_objs:
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(obj, (0, j)))
    j += width(obj)
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Normalize Objects:** Extract objects and normalize them, moving them to the top left corner.
2. **Create New Grid:**  Create a new grid with height matching the input and width equal to the total width of all normalized objects. 
3. **Paint Objects:** Paint each normalized object onto the new grid, updating the starting column index (`j`) to avoid overlaps.


These five versions use different approaches and combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating diverse solution paths.
