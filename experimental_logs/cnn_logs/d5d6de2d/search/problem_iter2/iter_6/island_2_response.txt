## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation shifts the non-background objects in the input grid towards the center of the grid. The direction of the shift for each object is determined by the object's original position relative to the center. 

* **Input_0:** The top object moves down, the bottom object moves up. Both move slightly towards the center horizontally.
* **Input_1:** The object moves up towards the center.
* **Input_2:** Both the top and bottom objects move up towards the center. The bottom object also shifts left. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  center_i, center_j = centerofmass(asobject(I))  # Find grid center
  for obj in objs:
    obj_center_i, obj_center_j = center(obj)
    vertical_direction = sign(center_i - obj_center_i)  # 1 for up, -1 for down
    horizontal_direction = sign(center_j - obj_center_j)  # 1 for right, -1 for left
    I = move(I, obj, (vertical_direction, horizontal_direction))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Identifies non-background objects in the grid.
2. **Find Grid Center:** Calculates the center of the grid.
3. **Iterate and Shift:**  For each object:
   -  Determines the vertical and horizontal direction to move towards the center.
   -  Moves the object one step in the determined direction.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    I = move(I, obj, gravitate(obj, asindices(I)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Iterates through non-background objects.
2. **Gravitate Towards Center:** For each object:
    - Calculates the direction to move the object to be adjacent to the center.
    -  Moves the object one step in the calculated direction. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  center = (h // 2, w // 2)
  new_grid = canvas(mostcolor(I), (h, w))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    obj_center = center(obj)
    direction = position(frozenset({center}), frozenset({obj_center}))
    new_grid = paint(new_grid, shift(obj, direction))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** Creates a new grid filled with the background color.
2. **Calculate Center:**  Determines the grid's center.
3. **Shift and Paint:** For each object in the input grid:
    - Calculates the relative position of the object's center to the grid's center.
    -  Shifts the object one step in the calculated direction.
    - Paints the shifted object onto the new canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  grid_center = centerofmass(asobject(I))
  for obj in objs:
    obj_center = centerofmass(obj)
    if obj_center[0] < grid_center[0]:
      I = move(I, obj, DOWN)  
    elif obj_center[0] > grid_center[0]:
      I = move(I, obj, UP)
    if obj_center[1] < grid_center[1]:
      I = move(I, obj, RIGHT)
    elif obj_center[1] > grid_center[1]:
      I = move(I, obj, LEFT)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Center:** Finds non-background objects and the grid's center.
2. **Directional Movement:** For each object:
    -  If the object's center is above the grid's center, move it down.
    -  If the object's center is below the grid's center, move it up.
    -  If the object's center is to the left of the grid's center, move it right.
    -  If the object's center is to the right of the grid's center, move it left.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  grid_indices = asindices(I)
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    closest_distance = manhattan(obj, grid_indices)
    best_direction = (0, 0)
    for direction in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]:
      shifted_obj = shift(obj, direction)
      new_distance = manhattan(shifted_obj, grid_indices)
      if new_distance < closest_distance:
        closest_distance = new_distance
        best_direction = direction
    I = move(I, obj, best_direction)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Grid Indices:** Obtains all indices of the grid.
2. **Iterate Objects:** For each non-background object:
    -  Calculate the Manhattan distance between the object and the grid.
    -  Iterate through possible directions (up, down, left, right).
    -  For each direction, calculate the distance after shifting. 
    -  If the shifted distance is smaller than the current closest distance, update the best direction.
    - Move the object in the best direction.
