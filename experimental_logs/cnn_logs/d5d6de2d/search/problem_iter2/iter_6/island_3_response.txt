## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids seems to be:

1. **Object Isolation:** Identify the object (defined as connected cells with the same value different from the background).
2. **Vertical Compression:** Compress the object vertically to remove any internal spaces, forming a solid vertical line.
3. **Horizontal Expansion:** Expand the object horizontally to match the original width of the object.
4. **Repositioning:** The compressed and expanded object is then moved to the leftmost position in its original row.

Let's break down how this applies to each example:

* **Input_0:** The 3x3 square is compressed vertically into a 3x1 line and expanded back to a 3x3 shape. This shape is then shifted to the leftmost position.
* **Input_1:** The 1x3 line remains unchanged during compression and expansion. It is then shifted to the leftmost position.
* **Input_2:**  The 1x6 line is compressed and expanded similarly, becoming a solid 3x2 block. This block is shifted to the leftmost position of its original row.


## Program to be Generated (DSL Code and Explanations):

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  obj = argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), size)  # Isolate the object
  color_val = color(obj)  # Extract the object's color
  h, w = shape(obj)  # Get original height and width
  compressed_obj = {(color_val, (i, 0)) for i in range(h)}  # Compress vertically
  expanded_obj = {(color_val, (i, j)) for i in range(h) for j in range(w)}  # Expand horizontally
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shift(expanded_obj, (uppermost(obj), 0)))  # Paint onto a blank canvas at the leftmost position
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version directly manipulates the object's indices. It compresses the object by setting all column indices to 0 and then expands it by iterating through the original width. Finally, it paints the object onto a new canvas at the correct position.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  obj = argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), size) # Isolate the object
  color_val = color(obj) # Extract the object's color
  h, w = shape(obj) # Get original height and width
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(color_val, product(interval(0, h, 1), interval(0, w, 1))))  # Paint a solid rectangle with the object's color and dimensions at the object's upper-left corner
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version leverages the `product` function to directly generate the indices for a solid rectangle of the correct size and color. It then paints this rectangle at the object's original upper-left corner.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  obj = argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), size)  # Isolate the object
  color_val = color(obj)  # Extract the object's color
  h, w = shape(obj)  # Get original height and width
  compressed_obj = recolor(color_val, {(i, 0) for i in range(h)})  # Compress vertically and recolor
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), hupscale(vupscale(canvas(color_val, (1, 1)), h), w - 1))  # Create a 1x1 object, upscale vertically and horizontally, then paint at the object's upper-left corner
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version uses upscaling to create the final shape. It first creates a 1x1 object with the desired color. Then, it upscales it vertically by the object's height and horizontally by the object's width minus 1 (as the initial object already provides one unit of width). Finally, it paints this upscaled object onto the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  obj = argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), size) # Isolate the object
  color_val = color(obj) # Extract the object's color
  h = height(obj) # Get the original height
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(color_val, {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(obj), uppermost(obj) + h) for j in range(width(obj))})) # Paint a solid rectangle at the object's original upper-left corner with the correct height and original width
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version iterates through the desired height and original width of the object, creating a set of indices that form a solid rectangle. It then recolors this set of indices and paints it onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  obj = argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), size)  # Isolate the object
  color_val = color(obj)  # Extract the object's color
  h, w = shape(obj)  # Get original height and width
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(color_val, backdrop(shift( {(0, j) for j in range(w)}, (uppermost(obj), 0) )))) # Create a horizontal line with the object's width, shift it to the correct row, get its backdrop indices (forming a solid rectangle), recolor and paint it
  return O
```

**Explanation:** This version utilizes the `backdrop` function to create the solid rectangle. It first generates a horizontal line with the object's width. It then shifts this line to the object's row and uses `backdrop` to obtain the indices within its bounding box, effectively creating a solid rectangle. Finally, it recolors this rectangle and paints it onto the canvas.


These five programs demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation using different combinations of DSL functions while achieving zero similarity in their logic and implementation.
