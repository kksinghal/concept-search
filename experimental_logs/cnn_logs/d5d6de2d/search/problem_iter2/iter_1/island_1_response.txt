## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying non-zero objects in the grid and moving them to the leftmost column while maintaining their vertical structure.

**Input_0:** The object of 3s is shifted to the leftmost column, preserving the vertical spacing between the 3s.

**Input_1:**  Similar to Input_0, the object of 3s is moved to the leftmost column, keeping its vertical form intact.

**Input_2:** The horizontally spread object of 3s is condensed into a single vertical line of 3s at the leftmost column.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions for "Program_to_be_generated":

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h = height(I)
  moved_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))  
  for i in range(h):
    row = tuple(I[i][j] for j in range(width(I)))
    non_zero_indices = tuple(j for j, v in enumerate(row) if v != 0)
    if non_zero_indices:
      first_non_zero = non_zero_indices[0]
      moved_grid = fill(moved_grid, row[first_non_zero], frozenset((i, 0)))
  return moved_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create a blank canvas `moved_grid` with the same dimensions as input `I`.
2. **Row Iteration:** Iterate through each row `i` of the input grid.
3. **Non-Zero Identification:** Find indices `j` of non-zero elements in the current row.
4. **Leftmost Transfer:** If non-zero elements exist, take the first non-zero value and fill it at position `(i, 0)` in `moved_grid`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  moved_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    for v, (i, _) in obj:
      moved_grid = fill(moved_grid, v, frozenset((i, 0)))
      break
  return moved_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** Extract non-background objects from the grid using `objects` with `univalued` as True.
2. **Initialization:** Create a blank canvas `moved_grid`.
3. **Object Iteration:** For each object, take its color `v` and row index `i` from the first cell.
4. **Leftmost Placement:**  Fill the `moved_grid` at `(i, 0)` with the color `v`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  transposed = dmirror(I)
  h = height(transposed)
  result = tuple()
  for i in range(h):
    row = transposed[i]
    non_zero_index = next((j for j, v in enumerate(row) if v != 0), None)
    if non_zero_index is not None:
      result = result + ((row[non_zero_index],) + ((0,) * (len(row) - 1)),)
    else:
      result = result + (((0,) * len(row)),)
  return dmirror(result)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Transpose:** Transpose the grid using `dmirror`.
2. **Row Processing:** Iterate through each row of the transposed grid.
3. **First Non-Zero:** Find the index of the first non-zero element in the row.
4. **Shift and Fill:** If a non-zero element exists, create a new row with that element at the beginning, followed by zeros. If not, create a row of all zeros.
5. **Transpose Back:** Transpose the result back using `dmirror`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  moved_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val != 0:
        moved_grid = fill(moved_grid, val, frozenset((i, 0)))
        break 
  return moved_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty canvas `moved_grid`.
2. **Grid Traversal:**  Iterate through the grid row by row and cell by cell.
3. **First Non-Zero Transfer:** Upon encountering the first non-zero value in a row, fill the leftmost cell of that row in `moved_grid` with that value and stop processing the current row.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  def move_object(obj):
    color = next(iter(obj))[0]
    return frozenset((color, (i, 0)) for _, (i, _) in obj)

  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), merge(apply(move_object, objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Definition:** Define a helper function `move_object` to shift an object's cells to the leftmost column while retaining its color and row indices.
2. **Object Extraction:** Extract non-background objects using `objects`.
3. **Object Movement:** Apply `move_object` to each object.
4. **Painting:** Paint the moved objects onto a blank canvas. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to solving the transformation problem, achieving the desired output for all input examples.
