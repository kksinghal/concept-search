## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in both input-output pairs involves identifying specific objects within the grid and then strategically modifying them. 

**Input 0 - Output 0:**

* The object composed of '2's in the bottom right corner expands to fill its bounding box.
* The '1's within the '4' object remain unchanged.

**Input 1 - Output 1:**

* The object composed of '1's within the larger '4' object expands downwards to fill the object's bounding box.
* The isolated '2' object expands to fill its bounding box. 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct programs utilizing the provided DSL to achieve the desired transformations:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve_d511f180(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  obj = argmax(objs, size)
  O = paint(I, recolor(mostcolor(obj), backdrop(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)` identifies all distinct objects in the grid excluding the background. 
2. **Select Largest Object:** `argmax(objs, size)` selects the largest object from the identified objects.
3. **Fill Bounding Box:** `paint(I, recolor(mostcolor(obj), backdrop(obj)))` fills the bounding box of the largest object with its most common color.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve_d511f180(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
    for obj in objs:
        if len(palette(obj)) == 1:
            I = paint(I, recolor(mostcolor(obj), backdrop(obj)))
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1, this identifies all objects.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** It iterates through each object. If an object has only one color (`len(palette(obj)) == 1`), it fills that object's bounding box with its color.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve_d511f180(I):
    for i in range(1,10):
        obj = list(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True))[i]  
        I = paint(I, recolor(mostcolor(obj), backdrop(obj))) 
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:** This program directly iterates through a fixed range of objects (assuming there are at least 10).
2. **Fill Bounding Box:** Similar to previous versions, it fills the bounding box of each object with its most common color.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve_d511f180(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
    for obj in objs:
      if size(obj) > 1:
        I = paint(I, recolor(color(obj), backdrop(obj)))
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Identify all objects in the grid.
2. **Filter by Size and Fill:** Iterate through objects and fill the bounding boxes of those with a size greater than 1.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve_d511f180(I):
    objs = sorted(objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True), key=size)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        if size(obj) > 1:
            O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), backdrop(obj)))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and Sort Objects:** Identify all objects and sort them by size.
2. **Iterate and Fill:**  Iterate through the sorted objects and fill the bounding boxes of those with a size greater than 1, starting with the smallest.

These five versions offer distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation, utilizing various DSL functions for object identification, manipulation, and grid modification.
