## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:** The transformation involves two key changes to the input grid:

1. **Color Expansion:** The patch of '2's at the bottom right corner of the input grid is expanded horizontally, replacing any existing '4's in its path.
2. **Color Swap:** Within the expanded patch, the inner '2's are replaced with '4's.

**Input 1 -> Output 1:** Similar to the first transformation, this one also involves color expansion and swapping:

1. **Color Expansion:**  The patch of '2's at the bottom right corner of the input is expanded horizontally, replacing any '4's in its path.
2. **Color Swap:** Within the expanded patch, the center two columns are replaced with alternating '1's and '2's, effectively swapping the inner two columns.


## Program Version 1

**Code:**
```python
def solve_c8f0f002(I):
  obj = objects(I, False, False, True)
  obj = extract(obj, lambda o: color(o) == 2)
  filled = fill(I, 2, backdrop(shift(obj, (0, width(obj) - 1))))
  switched = switch(filled, 2, 4)
  O = paint(I, asobject(switched))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Isolate target object:** `objects`, `extract`, and `color` are used to isolate the object consisting of '2's.
2. **Expand horizontally:** `shift` and `backdrop` are applied to create a patch representing the expanded area. `fill` fills this area with '2's.
3. **Color Swap:** `switch` is employed to swap the inner '2's with '4's within the expanded patch.
4. **Combine with original:** The modified grid is converted back to an object using `asobject` and painted onto the original grid using `paint`, resulting in the final output.

## Program Version 2

**Code:**
```python
def solve_c8f0f002(I):
  twos = ofcolor(I, 2)
  rightmost_two =  max(twos, key=lambda x: x[1])
  expansion_area = backdrop(shift({rightmost_two}, (0, width(twos) - 1)))
  filled_grid = fill(I, 2, expansion_area)
  O = switch(filled_grid, 2, 4)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Expansion Limit:**  Identify the rightmost '2' using `ofcolor` and `max`. This determines the horizontal expansion limit.
2. **Define Expansion Area:** `shift` and `backdrop` are used to create a patch covering the expansion area, starting from the rightmost '2'.
3. **Fill and Swap:**  Similar to Version 1, `fill` replaces the expansion area with '2's and `switch` swaps the inner '2's with '4's.

## Program Version 3

**Code:**
```python
def solve_c8f0f002(I):
  O = I
  for j in range(width(I)):
    if index(I, (len(I)-1, j)) == 2:
      for i in range(height(I)):
        if index(I, (i, j)) == 4:
          O = paint(O, recolor(2, {(i, j)}))
  O = switch(O, 2, 4)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterative Approach:** This version uses nested loops to iterate through each column and row of the grid.
2. **Find Expansion Columns:** The outer loop identifies columns containing a '2' in the bottom row.
3. **Replace '4's with '2's:** The inner loop checks for '4's in identified columns and replaces them with '2's using `paint` and `recolor`.
4. **Final Swap:** Like previous versions, `switch` is applied at the end for the final color swap.

## Program Version 4

**Code:**
```python
def solve_c8f0f002(I):
  target_object = extract(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda o: color(o) == 2)
  expansion_width = width(target_object) - 1
  shifted_object = shift(target_object, (0, expansion_width))
  O = paint(I, recolor(2, backdrop(shifted_object)))
  O = switch(O, 2, 4)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Expansion:** This version directly calculates the expansion width and shifts the target object accordingly.
2. **Backdrop Filling:** `backdrop` and `recolor` are used to fill the entire bounding box of the shifted object with '2's.
3. **Simplified Swap:** The color swap remains the same as previous versions, utilizing `switch`.

## Program Version 5

**Code:**
```python
def solve_c8f0f002(I):
    target_color = 2
    replace_color = 4
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0])):
            if I[i][j] == target_color:
                for k in range(j + 1, len(I[0])):
                    if I[i][k] == replace_color:
                        I = paint(I, recolor(target_color, {(i, k)}))
    return switch(I, target_color, replace_color)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterative Expansion and Replacement:** This version utilizes nested loops to identify the target color and replace the designated color.
2. **Direct Modification:** It directly modifies the input grid (I) by iterating and replacing values based on conditions.
3. **Final Swap:** The `switch` function is applied at the end to achieve the final color swap.


These five versions provide distinct approaches to solving the transformation task using different combinations of DSL functions, showcasing diverse coding solutions. Each version aims to achieve the same output while demonstrating different ways to manipulate objects and colors within the grid.
