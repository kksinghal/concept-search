## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying a non-background object and expanding it to fill its bounding box.  The expanded object is then recolored based on its orientation:

**Input 0:**
* **Object:** The object with color '2'.
* **Expansion:** The object expands horizontally to fill its bounding box.
* **Recoloring:**  The expanded object is recolored with '4' on the top and bottom rows, and '2' for the middle rows.

**Input 1:**
* **Object:** The object with color '2'.
* **Expansion:** The object expands vertically to fill its bounding box.
* **Recoloring:** The expanded object is recolored with '4' on the left and right columns, and '1' for the middle columns.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct programs to achieve the transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Extract the non-background object
  obj = extract(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda o: color(o) != mostcolor(I))
  
  # Determine expansion direction based on object shape
  expansion = (height(obj) - 1, 0) if portrait(obj) else (0, width(obj) - 1)

  # Fill the bounding box of the shifted object with the object's color
  filled = fill(I, color(obj), backdrop(shift(obj, expansion)))

  # Recolor based on expansion direction
  return switch(filled, color(obj), 1 if expansion[0] else 4) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:**  Identifies the object that's not the background.
2. **Expansion Direction:** Calculates whether to expand vertically or horizontally based on the object's height and width.
3. **Bounding Box Filling:** Fills the entire bounding box of the expanded object with the original object's color.
4. **Recoloring:**  Switches the original object's color with either '1' (for vertical expansion) or '4' (for horizontal expansion).

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the non-background object
  obj = extract(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda o: color(o) != mostcolor(I))
  
  # Calculate the bounding box of the object
  bbox = backdrop(obj)

  # Expand the object to fill its bounding box
  expanded_obj = recolor(color(obj), bbox)

  # Paint the expanded object onto the grid
  painted = paint(I, expanded_obj)

  # Determine the recoloring value based on the object's shape
  recolor_value = 4 if portrait(obj) else 1 

  # Switch the original object color with the recolor value within the bounding box
  return switch(painted, color(obj), recolor_value)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object and Bounding Box:** Finds the non-background object and calculates its bounding box.
2. **Expansion:** Creates a new object representing the expanded version by recoloring the bounding box with the original object's color.
3. **Painting:** Paints the expanded object onto the input grid.
4. **Conditional Recoloring:**  Determines the appropriate recoloring value ('4' for vertical, '1' for horizontal) and switches colors within the bounding box.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Directly find the bounding box of the non-background color
  bbox = backdrop(extract(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda o: color(o) != mostcolor(I)))
  
  # Determine if the bounding box is taller than it is wide
  is_vertical = height(bbox) > width(bbox)

  # Fill the bounding box with the appropriate color based on its orientation
  filled = fill(I, 1 if is_vertical else 4, bbox)

  # Overlay the original object back onto the filled bounding box
  return paint(filled, toobject(bbox, I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Direct Bounding Box:**  Efficiently identifies the bounding box of the non-background object directly.
2. **Orientation Check:** Determines if the bounding box is taller (vertical) or wider (horizontal).
3. **Conditional Filling:** Fills the entire bounding box with either '1' (vertical) or '4' (horizontal).
4. **Object Overlay:** Paints the original object from the input grid back onto the filled bounding box.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the non-background object
  obj = extract(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda o: color(o) != mostcolor(I))

  # Get the upper-left and lower-right corners of the object's bounding box
  ul = ulcorner(obj)
  lr = lrcorner(obj)

  # Create the grid for the expanded object
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))

  # Iterate through the rows of the bounding box
  for i in range(ul[0], lr[0] + 1):
    # Determine the fill color based on row and object orientation
    fill_color = 4 if (portrait(obj) and (i == ul[0] or i == lr[0])) else \
                  1 if (not portrait(obj) and (i == ul[0] or i == lr[0])) else \
                  color(obj)
    
    # Fill the row within the bounding box
    for j in range(ul[1], lr[1] + 1):
      O = fill(O, fill_color, {(i, j)})

  # Overlay the original grid onto the expanded object
  return cellwise(I, O, fallback=O[0][0])
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object and Corners:**  Finds the non-background object and gets the corners of its bounding box.
2. **Canvas Creation:**  Creates a new canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
3. **Iterative Filling:** Iterates through each row within the bounding box, determining the appropriate fill color (border color or object color).
4. **Grid Overlay:** Overlays the original input grid onto the expanded object grid, preserving the original object's shape.


**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Get the bounding box of the non-background object
  bbox = backdrop(extract(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda o: color(o) != mostcolor(I)))

  # Determine the fill color for the border based on bounding box orientation
  border_color = 4 if height(bbox) > width(bbox) else 1

  # Fill the bounding box with the border color
  filled_bbox = fill(I, border_color, bbox)

  # Fill the inside of the bounding box with the original object's color
  filled_inside = underfill(filled_bbox, color(toobject(bbox, I)), bbox)
  
  return filled_inside 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Bounding Box and Border Color:**  Calculates the bounding box and determines the border color based on its orientation.
2. **Border Filling:** Fills the entire bounding box with the border color.
3. **Inside Filling:**  Uses `underfill` to intelligently fill only the background color areas within the bounding box with the original object's color, effectively expanding it while preserving the border.
