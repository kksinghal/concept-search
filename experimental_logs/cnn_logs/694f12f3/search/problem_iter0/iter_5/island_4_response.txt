## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the center horizontal lines of each object, recoloring them based on their order of appearance. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The top object's central horizontal line is recolored to '1'. 
- The bottom object's central horizontal line is recolored to '2'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The top object's central horizontal line is recolored to '2'.
- The bottom object's central horizontal line is recolored to '1'.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    color = 1 if i == 0 else 2
    center_i = (uppermost(obj) + lowermost(obj)) // 2
    line = frozenset({(color, (center_i, j)) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)})
    O = paint(O, line)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Extract individual objects from the input grid using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:**  Loop through each object:
   - Determine the recoloring value (1 for the first object, 2 for others).
   - Calculate the center row index (`center_i`).
   - Create a new object representing the central horizontal line with the new color.
   - Paint this line onto the output grid `O`.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
        line = frozenset((i + 1, (j, center(obj)[1])) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1))
        O = paint(O, line)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Blank Canvas:** Initialize an empty canvas `O` of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
3. **Iterate and Paint:**  Iterate through each object:
   - Create a horizontal line object directly on the canvas with color `i+1` (1-based indexing).
   - The line spans the object's width at the object's center column.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    O = I
    for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
        center_row = tophalf(obj) if i == 0 else bottomhalf(obj)
        line = frozenset((i + 1, (j, c)) for (v, (j, c)) in center_row if c == center(obj)[1])
        O = paint(O, line)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Similar to previous versions.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:**  Loop through each object:
   - Select the top half of the first object and the bottom half of other objects.
   - Extract the central column from the selected half to form the line.
   - Recolor the line to `i+1` and paint it onto the output grid. 

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    c = center(obj)[1]
    line = mfilter(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1] == c)
    recolored_line = recolor(i + 1, line)
    O = paint(O, recolored_line)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Iterate and Modify:**  Iterate through each object:
   - Get the column index of the center of the object (`c`).
   - Filter the object to keep only cells on the central column using `mfilter`.
   - Recolor the filtered line to `i+1`.
   - Paint the recolored line onto the output grid. 

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    start = (center(obj)[0], leftmost(obj))
    end = (center(obj)[0], rightmost(obj))
    line = connect(start, end)
    O = paint(O, recolor(i+1, line))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Blank Canvas:** Create an empty canvas.
3. **Iterate and Draw:** For each object:
   - Determine the starting and ending points of the central horizontal line.
   - Use `connect` to generate the line indices between the start and end points.
   - Recolor the line to `i+1` and paint it onto the canvas.
