## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves modifying the color of the "inner" cells of objects with color 4 based on their position and index. Here's a breakdown:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Top Object:** The inner cells of the top object (above the middle row) are all recolored to 1.
2. **Bottom Object:**  The inner cells of the bottom object (below the middle row) maintain their original color (4) on the outline and corners. The remaining inner cells alternate between 2 and 4, forming a checkerboard pattern.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. **Top Object:** The inner cells of the top object are all recolored to 2, creating a solid fill.
2. **Bottom Object:**  Similar to the bottom object in Output_0, the outline and corners keep their original color (4). The other inner cells alternate between 1 and 4 in a checkerboard pattern. 

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), FOUR)
  O = I
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    inner_area = difference(backdrop(obj), box(obj))
    if uppermost(obj) < len(I) // 2:
      O = fill(O, ONE, inner_area)
    else:
      for a, b in enumerate(range(leftmost(inner_area), rightmost(inner_area) + 1)):
        for c in range(uppermost(inner_area), lowermost(inner_area) + 1):
          if (a + c) % 2 == 0:
            O = fill(O, TWO if even(i) else ONE, {(c, b)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Iterates through objects of color 4.
- Distinguishes top and bottom objects based on their position relative to the middle row.
- Fills top objects with 1.
- For bottom objects:
    - Uses nested loops to iterate through the inner area.
    - Applies alternating 1/2 or 2/4 fill based on object index and cell position using modulo operation.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == FOUR:
        obj = extract(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), FOUR), lambda obj: contained((i, j), obj))
        if i < len(I) // 2:
          O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})
        else:
          if (i + j) % 2 == 0 and not contained((i, j), box(obj)):
            O = fill(O, TWO, {(i, j)})
          elif not contained((i, j), box(obj)):
            O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Iterates through each cell in the grid.
- For cells with color 4:
    - Determines if the cell belongs to a top or bottom object.
    - Top object cells are filled with 1.
    - Bottom object cells:
        - Use modulo operation to achieve the alternating pattern based on row and column index.
        - Only modifies cells within the object's inner area.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), FOUR)
  O = I
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    if uppermost(obj) < len(I) // 2:
      O = fill(O, ONE, difference(backdrop(obj), box(obj)))
    else:
      checkered_fill = chain(
          partial(fill, O),
          lambda p: {(a, b) for a, b in enumerate(range(leftmost(p), rightmost(p) + 1)) if (a + b) % 2 == 0},
          lambda p: difference(backdrop(p), box(p))
      )(obj)
      O = fill(O, TWO if even(i) else ONE, checkered_fill)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Employs functional programming concepts like `chain` and `partial`.
- Similar to Version 1, it differentiates between top and bottom objects.
- The `checkered_fill` function elegantly calculates and applies the checkerboard pattern using a lambda expression.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i, obj in enumerate(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), FOUR)):
    inner = difference(backdrop(obj), box(obj))
    if uppermost(obj) < len(I) // 2:
      O = paint(O, recolor(ONE, inner))
    else:
      fill_color = TWO if even(i) else ONE
      checkered_cells = {(i, j) for i in range(uppermost(inner), lowermost(inner) + 1) for j in range(leftmost(inner), rightmost(inner) + 1) if (i + j) % 2 == 0}
      O = paint(O, recolor(fill_color, checkered_cells & inner))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Starts by creating an empty canvas filled with the background color.
- Iterates through objects, identifies the inner area, and paints it accordingly.
- Uses set operations to efficiently select cells for the checkerboard pattern within the inner area.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = I
  for i, obj in enumerate(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), FOUR)):
    for x, y in enumerate(range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1)):
      for z in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1):
        if (uppermost(obj) < len(I) // 2) and not contained((z, y), box(obj)):
          O = fill(O, ONE, {(z, y)})
        elif (uppermost(obj) >= len(I) // 2) and (x + z) % 2 == 0 and not contained((z, y), box(obj)):
          O = fill(O, TWO if even(i) else ONE, {(z, y)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- Similar to Version 2, it iterates through each cell within the objects.
- Directly applies the transformation rules based on object position, cell indices, and object index, streamlining the logic.

These five versions showcase diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating the flexibility of the DSL and the creative potential in problem-solving.
