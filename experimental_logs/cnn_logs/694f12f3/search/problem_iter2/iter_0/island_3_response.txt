## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 
- The transformation focuses on the two distinct objects formed by the digit '2' and the digit '4' in the bottom half of the grid. 
- The object formed by '2's is expanded horizontally to cover the entire width of the original '4' object.
- The '4's at the edges of the original '4' object are retained, while the inner '4's are replaced by '2's.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- Similar to the first transformation, this one also targets the '2' and '4' objects in the bottom half.
- This time, the '2' object expands vertically to match the height of the '4' object.
- The top and bottom '4's of the original '4' object remain, while the middle '4's are replaced by '2's.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  obj2 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  obj4 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 4 and lowermost(obj) > len(I) // 2)
  obj2_expanded = backdrop(obj4)
  O = paint(fill(I, bg, obj2 | obj4), recolor(2, obj2_expanded))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Identify the '2' and '4' objects in the bottom half of the grid.
2. **Expand '2' Object:** Calculate the bounding box (backdrop) of the '4' object and use it to define the expanded area for the '2' object.
3. **Fill and Paint:** Clear the original objects with the background color and then paint the expanded '2' object and the remaining '4's back onto the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  h, w = shape(I)
  bottom = bottomhalf(I)
  objs = objects(bottom, False, False, True)
  obj2 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  obj4 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 4)
  if width(obj2) < width(obj4):
    obj2 = recolor(2, backdrop(obj4))
  else:
    obj2 = recolor(2, backdrop(vconcat(obj2, obj4)))
  O = vconcat(tophalf(I), paint(fill(bottom, 0, objs), obj2 | obj4))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Split Grid:** Divide the grid into top and bottom halves.
2. **Object Manipulation:**  Identify objects in the bottom half and expand the '2' object horizontally or vertically based on the relative widths of the '2' and '4' objects.
3. **Reconstruct Grid:** Combine the unmodified top half with the modified bottom half.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  obj2 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  obj4 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 4 and lowermost(obj) > len(I) // 2)
  if width(obj2) < width(obj4):
    new_obj2 = {(2, (i, j)) for i in range(uppermost(obj2), lowermost(obj2) + 1) 
                for j in range(leftmost(obj4), rightmost(obj4) + 1)}
  else:
    new_obj2 = {(2, (i, j)) for i in range(uppermost(obj4), lowermost(obj2) + 1)
                for j in range(leftmost(obj2), rightmost(obj2) + 1)}
  O = paint(fill(I, bg, objs), new_obj2 | obj4)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Extraction:** Identify the '2' and '4' objects.
2. **Create Expanded Object:**  Construct a new object representing the expanded '2' object based on the relative positions of the original objects.
3. **Paint New Objects:** Clear the original objects and paint the new '2' object and the unmodified '4' object.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bottom = bottomhalf(I)
  objs = objects(bottom, False, False, True)
  obj2 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 2)
  obj4 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 4)
  if width(obj2) < width(obj4):
    expansion = (0, width(obj4) - width(obj2))
  else:
    expansion = (height(obj4) - height(obj2), 0)
  O = vconcat(tophalf(I), paint(fill(bottom, 0, objs), upscale(obj2, expansion)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Isolate Bottom Half:** Focus on the bottom half of the grid.
2. **Determine Expansion:** Calculate the required horizontal or vertical expansion for the '2' object.
3. **Upscale and Combine:** Upscale the '2' object accordingly and combine it with the unmodified '4' object on a cleared bottom half before reattaching the top half.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I) // 2, len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 2:
        if any(I[k][j] == 4 for k in range(len(I) // 2, len(I))):
          O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Replace:** This program iterates through the bottom half of the grid. 
2. **Conditional Fill:** If a cell contains a '2' and it shares a column with a '4' in the bottom half, it fills that cell with a '2' in the output grid. 

These five program versions provide diverse solutions using different combinations of DSL functions, showcasing the flexibility and power of the provided programming language.
