## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The input grid has two distinct objects (besides the background): a shape formed by the digit '1' and a shape formed by the digit '2'. 
2. **Expand and Recolor:** Both objects are expanded to fill their bounding boxes. The '1' object is recolored to '4', and the '2' object is recolored to a combination of '2' (inner) and '4' (border).

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Similar to Input_0, there are two distinct objects: one formed by '1' and another by '2'.
2. **Expand and Recolor:** The objects are expanded to fill their bounding boxes. This time, the '1' object is recolored to a combination of '1' (inner) and '4' (border), while the '2' object is recolored entirely to '4'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    I = paint(I, recolor(FOUR, box(toindices(obj))))
    if color(obj) == TWO:
      I = underfill(I, TWO, toindices(obj))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Objects:**  The `for` loop iterates over each object in the input grid (`I`), excluding the background.
2. **Paint Bounding Box:** For each object, its bounding box is determined using `box(toindices(obj))`, and this box is painted with the color '4' using `paint` and `recolor`.
3. **Conditional Inner Fill:** If the original object's color (`color(obj)`) was '2', the inside of the bounding box is filled with '2' using `underfill`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    I = paint(I, recolor(FOUR, backdrop(toindices(obj))))
    if color(obj) != ONE:
      I = underpaint(I, recolor(color(obj) * TWO - ONE, toindices(obj)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Store Objects:** The code first extracts all objects from the grid and stores them in the `objs` variable.
2. **Iterate and Fill Backdrop:** For each object, it fills its entire bounding box (including the object itself) with '4' using `backdrop`.
3. **Conditional Recoloring:** If the object's color is not '1', it then recolors the original object area. For '2', it becomes '3' (`2 * 2 - 1`), effectively creating a border effect.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for val in palette(I) - {ZERO}:
    obj = toindices(extract(objects(I, T, F, T), matcher(color, val)))
    new_col = FOUR if val == TWO else val
    I = paint(I, recolor(new_col, box(obj)))
    if val != ONE:
      I = underfill(I, new_col - ONE, obj)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Colors:** This version iterates over each unique color (`val`) in the grid, excluding the background color '0'.
2. **Extract Object by Color:** It finds the object with the current color (`val`) using `extract` and `matcher`.
3. **Recolor and Fill:**  Similar to previous versions, it paints the bounding box with a new color (`new_col`) and conditionally fills the inside based on the original color.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    indices = toindices(obj)
    I = fill(I, FOUR, backdrop(indices))
    if color(obj) == TWO:
      I = paint(I, recolor(TWO, indices - corners(indices)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Iteration and Filling:** This version iterates through objects and fills their bounding boxes with '4'.
2. **Corner Removal and Recoloring:** For objects originally colored '2', it recolors the object area back to '2' but specifically excludes the corner cells using `corners(indices)`, creating a distinct visual style.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    box_indices = box(toindices(obj))
    inner_indices = toindices(obj) - box_indices 
    I = paint(I, recolor(FOUR, box_indices))
    if color(obj) == TWO:
      I = paint(I, recolor(TWO, inner_indices))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Separate Box and Inner Indices:**  This version explicitly calculates and stores the indices for the bounding box (`box_indices`) and the inner area (`inner_indices`) of each object.
2. **Paint and Recolor:** It paints the bounding box with '4'. If the original color was '2', it then recolors the inner area back to '2'.
