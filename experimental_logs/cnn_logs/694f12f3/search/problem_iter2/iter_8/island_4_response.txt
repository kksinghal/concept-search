## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Object Expansion:** The object with color '2' expands horizontally to cover the width of the object with color '4' located above it.
2. **Color Change:** The expanded object with color '2' changes its color to match the color of the object above it (color '4'). 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. **Object Expansion & Shift:**  The object with color '2' expands horizontally to cover the width of the object with color '4' located above it. Additionally, it shifts one row upwards.
2. **Color Change (Two-Step):** The expanded and shifted object with color '2' changes its color to '4'. The original object with color '1', now enclosed within the expanded object, changes its color to '2'. 

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      target_obj = extract(objs, lambda x: hmatching(x, obj) and uppermost(x) < uppermost(obj))
      target_color = color(target_obj)
      left_edge = leftmost(toindices(target_obj))
      right_edge = rightmost(toindices(target_obj))
      top_row = uppermost(toindices(obj))
      expanded_indices = {(top_row, j) for j in range(left_edge, right_edge + 1)}
      O = fill(I, target_color, expanded_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Uses `objects` to identify individual objects in the grid.
2. **Find Expansion Target:** For each object of color '2', it finds the object of a different color ('4' in this case) located directly above it using `hmatching` and `uppermost`.
3. **Determine Expansion Area:** The left and right edges of the target object are found using `leftmost` and `rightmost`, and the top row of the expanding object is found with `uppermost`. 
4. **Fill Expansion:** The `fill` function paints the identified area with the target object's color, effectively expanding and recoloring the object.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  obj2 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda x: color(x) == 2)
  obj_above = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda x: hmatching(x, obj2) and uppermost(x) < uppermost(obj2))
  new_obj2 = recolor(color(obj_above), toindices(obj2))
  shifted_obj2 = shift(new_obj2, (-1, 0))
  O = paint(I, shifted_obj2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Relevant Objects:** Directly extracts the object with color '2' and the object above it using `extract` and filtering based on color and relative position (`hmatching`, `uppermost`).
2. **Recolor and Shift:** Recolors the object with color '2' to the color of the object above it using `recolor`. Then, it shifts the object one row upwards using `shift`.
3. **Paint onto Grid:** Finally, it paints the shifted and recolored object onto the original grid using `paint`. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  twos = toindices(extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda x: color(x) == 2))
  target_row = minimum(twos, lambda x: x[0]) - 1
  left_bound = minimum(twos, lambda x: x[1])
  right_bound = maximum(twos, lambda x: x[1])
  fill_area = {(target_row, j) for j in range(left_bound, right_bound + 1)}
  target_color = index(I, (target_row, left_bound))
  O = fill(I, target_color, fill_area)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Target Area:**  Identifies the indices of the object with color '2' and determines the row above it, as well as its left and right boundaries.
2. **Fill Target Row:** Uses `fill` to paint the identified row with the color found at the leftmost index of that row. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 2:
      upper_obj = extract(objs, lambda x: hmatching(obj, x) and uppermost(x) < uppermost(obj))
      expansion_width = width(upper_obj)
      expanded_obj = crop(I, (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)), (1, expansion_width))
      painted_obj = recolor(color(upper_obj), asindices(expanded_obj))
      O = paint(I, painted_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Identify:** Iterates through objects and identifies the object with color '2' and the object directly above it.
2. **Create Expanded Object:**  Uses `crop` to extract a one-row slice from the grid, effectively creating a horizontally expanded version of the object '2' based on the width of the object above.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** Recolors the extracted slice to match the color of the object above and then paints it onto the original grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  obj2 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda x: color(x) == 2)
  upper_obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda x: hmatching(obj2, x) and uppermost(x) < uppermost(obj2))
  expansion_start = (uppermost(obj2), leftmost(upper_obj))
  expansion_end = (uppermost(obj2), rightmost(upper_obj))
  fill_line = connect(expansion_start, expansion_end)
  O = fill(I, color(upper_obj), fill_line)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate Objects and Boundaries:** Extracts the object with color '2' and the object above it. Then, it identifies the starting and ending points for the expansion based on their boundaries.
2. **Connect and Fill:** Uses `connect` to generate a horizontal line of indices representing the expansion area.  Finally, it uses `fill` to paint this line with the color of the object located above.
