## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place involves identifying objects within the grid and applying a color change based on the object's original color. Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The object consisting of "1"s retains its color.
* The object consisting of "2"s is recolored to "4"s.
* The object consisting of "4"s is recolored to a combination of "4"s (outer layer) and "2"s (inner layer), effectively creating a border effect.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The object consisting of "1"s retains its color.
* The object consisting of "2"s is recolored to "4"s.
* The object consisting of "4"s is recolored to a combination of "4"s (outer layer) and "1"s (inner layer), also creating a border effect.

**Overall Logic:**

The transformation aims to create a border effect within objects, replacing the inner cells with a different color while preserving the outer layer's color.  The specific replacement color seems to depend on the original color of the object.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct code versions, each with an explanation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve_3aa6fb7a(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    for obj in objs:
        col = color(obj)
        if col == ONE:
            continue
        elif col == TWO:
            I = paint(I, recolor(FOUR, toindices(obj)))
        else:
            I = paint(I, recolor(FOUR, box(toindices(obj))))
            I = underfill(I, TWO, toindices(obj))
    return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all distinct objects in the grid `I`.
2. **Iterate and Recolor:**  The code iterates through each object:
    *  If the object's color is "1", no changes are made.
    * If the object's color is "2", it's recolored to "4" using `recolor` and `paint`.
    * For other colors (assumed to be "4" here), it paints the object's border with "4" (`box` finds the border indices) and then fills the area inside the border with "2" using `underfill`.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve_3aa6fb7a(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    outer_layer = box(toindices(obj))
    inner_layer = toindices(obj) - outer_layer
    col = color(obj)
    if col == TWO:
      I = paint(I, recolor(FOUR, toindices(obj)))
    else:
      I = paint(I, recolor(FOUR, outer_layer))
      I = paint(I, recolor(col - ONE, inner_layer)) 
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object and Layer Separation:** Similar to version 1, it identifies objects. Then, for each object, it separates the outer layer (border) and the inner layer of the object.
2. **Color-Specific Recoloring:**
    *  "2" colored objects are entirely recolored to "4".
    * For other colors, the outer layer retains its original color, and the inner layer is recolored to a value one less than the original color. 

**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve_3aa6fb7a(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == ONE:
      continue
    new_color = FOUR if color(obj) == TWO else color(obj)
    border = box(toindices(obj))
    I = paint(I, recolor(new_color, border))
    I = underfill(I, new_color - ONE, toindices(obj))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object and Border Identification:**  Identifies objects and determines their borders using `box`.
2. **Conditional Recoloring:**
    * Ignores objects with color "1".
    * Determines the new color (`new_color`) based on the object's original color: "2" becomes "4", others retain their color.
    * Paints the border with `new_color`.
    * Fills the area within the border with a color one less than `new_color` using `underfill`.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve_3aa6fb7a(I):
  for col in palette(I) - {ZERO}:
    obj = toindices(objects(I, T, F, T).pop())
    new_col = FOUR if col == TWO else col
    I = paint(I, recolor(new_col, box(obj)))
    if col != ONE:
      I = underfill(I, new_col - ONE, obj)
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate by Colors:** This version iterates over each color present in the grid, except for the background color "0".
2. **Object and Border Handling:**  It assumes a single object per color (using `pop`) and determines its border.
3. **Color-Based Modification:**
    * Determines the `new_col` as in previous versions.
    * Paints the border with `new_col`.
    * For colors other than "1", it fills the inside with `new_col - ONE`.

**Program Version 5** 

```python
def solve_3aa6fb7a(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    c = color(obj)
    if c == ONE: 
      continue
    I = paint(I, recolor(FOUR if c == TWO else c, box(toindices(obj))))
    if c != ONE:
      I = paint(I, recolor(c-1, toindices(obj)-box(toindices(obj))))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:** Identifies individual objects within the input grid.
2. **Color-Specific Actions:**
    *  Ignores objects with color "1".
    * For colors other than "1":
        * Colors the border of the object with either "4" (if the original color was "2") or retains the original color.
        * Colors the interior of the object with a color one less than the original color. 

These program versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, providing diverse solutions using the DSL.
