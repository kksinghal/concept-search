## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Object Isolation:** The transformation focuses on the '5' object and the '2' object. 
2. **'5' Object Transformation:** The '5' object is shifted one cell up.
3. **'2' Object Transformation:** The '2' object is split into two identical parts. One part remains in its original position, while the other is moved three cells to the right.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. **Object Isolation:** The transformation focuses on the '2' object and the '5' object.
2. **Shift and Split:** Both the '2' object and the '5' object are shifted one cell to the right. Then, both objects are split into two identical parts, with one part moved four cells down from its shifted position. 


## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 5:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-1, 0)))  # Shift '5' object up by one unit
    elif color(obj) == 2:
      if width(obj) > 3:  # Identify the wider '2' object
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 1))) # Shift right by one unit
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (4, 2)))  # Duplicate and shift down and right
      else:
        O = paint(O, obj) # Keep smaller '2' object in place
    else:
      O = paint(O, obj)  # Keep other objects unchanged
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version iterates through objects, identifying them by color.
* It shifts the '5' object up by one unit.
* The '2' object is conditionally processed based on its width to handle both input cases.
*  Wider '2' objects are shifted right by one unit, then duplicated and shifted down and right.
*  Smaller '2' objects are left unchanged.
* Other objects remain in their original positions.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  fives = first(sfilter(objs, matcher(color, 5)))
  twos = first(sfilter(objs, matcher(color, 2)))
  O = paint(O, shift(fives, (-1, 0))) # Shift '5' object up
  if width(twos) > 3:
    O = paint(O, shift(twos, (0, 1)))  # Shift right 
    O = paint(O, shift(twos, (4, 3)))  # Duplicate and shift down and right
  else:
    O = paint(O, twos)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

* This version first extracts the '5' and '2' objects directly.
* It then applies the shift to the '5' object.
* The '2' object is processed based on width, applying shifts to the wider version and its duplicate.
* This version directly manipulates the extracted objects, leading to a more concise code structure.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    c = color(obj)
    if c == 5:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-1, 0)))
    elif c == 2:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 1)))
      if width(obj) > 3:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (4, 2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version streamlines the code by directly embedding the color check within the loop.
* It applies a right shift to all '2' objects and conditionally applies the down-right shift to the wider version. 
* This version emphasizes efficiency by minimizing conditional branches.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for v, obj in [(color(obj), obj) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)]:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-1, 0))) if v == 5 else paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 1)) if v == 2 else obj)
    if v == 2 and width(obj) > 3:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (4, 2))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version utilizes a more functional approach by iterating through a list of (color, object) tuples.
* The conditional shifts are condensed into a single line using Python's conditional expressions.
* This version highlights a different coding style within the DSL's capabilities.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = paint(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), shift(first(sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), matcher(color, 5))), (-1, 0)))  
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if color(obj) == 2:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (0, 1)))
      if width(obj) > 3:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (4, 2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version separates the handling of the '5' object by directly painting its shifted version onto the canvas.
* The remaining logic focuses on conditionally shifting and duplicating the '2' object.
* This version demonstrates a hybrid approach combining direct manipulation with iterative processing.


## Conclusion:

These five program versions showcase the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version achieves the desired transformation using different logic and function combinations, offering diverse solutions to the problem.
