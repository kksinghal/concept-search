## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation identifies the two non-background objects (representing the digits '5' and '2'). It then creates a frame around the '2' object and extends this frame upwards to the top of the grid. The '2' object is then duplicated within the frame, leaving the original '5' object untouched.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** Similar to the first transformation, this one identifies the two non-background objects (again '5' and '2'). This time, it creates a frame around the '5' object and extends the frame leftwards to the edge of the grid.  The '2' object from the input is then placed within the frame, leaving the original '5' object untouched.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  small = argmin(objs, size)
  large = argmax(objs, size)
  frame = box(large) 
  top_extension = connect(ulcorner(frame), (0, ulcorner(frame)[1]))
  if leftmost(small) < leftmost(large):
    extension = connect(ulcorner(frame), (ulcorner(frame)[0], 0))
  else: 
    extension = connect(urcorner(frame), (urcorner(frame)[0], len(I[0])-1))
  filled_extension = underfill(I, small[0][0], extension)
  painted_frame = underfill(filled_extension, small[0][0], frame | top_extension)
  O = paint(painted_frame, large)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  The code identifies the background color, finds all objects, and determines the smallest and largest objects.
2. **Create Frame:** A frame (outline) is created around the largest object.
3. **Extend Frame:** The frame is extended upwards to the top of the grid. An additional extension is created, either leftwards or rightwards depending on the relative positions of the small and large objects.
4. **Fill Frame:** The extension is filled with the color of the smaller object.
5. **Paint Final Output:** The frame and the top extension are filled with the color of the smaller object. Finally, the larger object is painted onto the grid, resulting in the final output. 

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  a = argmin(objs, size)
  b = argmax(objs, size)
  if leftmost(a) < leftmost(b):
    direction = LEFT
  else:
    direction = RIGHT
  border = {(0, j) for j in range(len(I[0]))} if direction == LEFT else {(0, j) for j in range(len(I[0]))}
  O = paint(underfill(I, a[0][0], connect(center(b), extract(border, lambda x: manhattan(x, b) <= height(b)))), b)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Direction:**  Find the smallest and largest objects and determine the direction (left or right) based on their relative horizontal positions.
2. **Determine Border:** Identify the appropriate border (left or right) based on the determined direction.
3. **Connect and Fill:** Connect the center of the larger object to the nearest border point within a certain Manhattan distance (ensuring the frame extends to the edge). This connected line is then filled with the color of the smaller object. 
4. **Paint Final Output:** Finally, the larger object is painted onto the grid.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  small = argmin(objs, size)
  large = argmax(objs, size)
  f = box(large)
  if leftmost(small) < leftmost(large):
    e = connect(ulcorner(f), (ulcorner(f)[0], -1)) 
  else:
    e = connect(urcorner(f), (urcorner(f)[0], len(I[0])))
  O = paint(underfill(I, small[0][0], f | e | connect(ulcorner(f), (-1, ulcorner(f)[1]))), large)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Create Frame:** Find the smallest and largest objects and create a frame around the larger object.
2. **Determine Extension Direction:** Similar to version 2, determine whether the extension should go left or right. 
3. **Create Extensions:**  Create the horizontal and vertical extensions of the frame. The horizontal extension (`e`) goes beyond the grid boundary to ensure complete filling.
4. **Fill and Paint:** Fill the frame and extensions with the color of the smaller object and paint the larger object onto the grid. 

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  small = argmin(objs, size)
  large = argmax(objs, size)
  up = ulcorner(large)
  target = (0, up[1])
  diff = subtract(target, up)
  O = paint(underfill(I, small[0][0], box(large) | connect(up, target)), shift(large, diff))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Anchor Points:**  Find the smallest and largest objects.  Determine the upper-left corner of the larger object (`up`) and a target point (`target`) on the top border directly above `up`.
2. **Calculate Shift:** Calculate the difference (`diff`) between the target point and the upper-left corner, which represents the required shift for the larger object.
3. **Fill and Shift:** Fill the frame and the connecting line between `up` and `target` with the color of the smaller object.  Finally, shift the larger object by `diff` to its final position within the frame. 

## Program Version 5: 

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  small = argmin(objs, size)
  large = argmax(objs, size)
  frame = box(large)
  h = height(large)
  if leftmost(small) < leftmost(large):
    extension = {(i, 0) for i in range(h)}
  else:
    extension = {(i, len(I[0])-1) for i in range(h)}
  O = paint(underfill(I, small[0][0], frame | connect(ulcorner(frame), (0, ulcorner(frame)[1])) | extension), large)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects and Create Frame:**  Find the smallest and largest objects and create a frame around the larger object.
2. **Determine Extension Side:** Determine the side (left or right) for the vertical extension based on the relative positions of the objects.
3. **Create Extensions:** Construct the vertical extension line reaching the top border and a horizontal line along the determined side, effectively creating a connected frame extension.
4. **Fill and Paint:** Fill the frame and extensions with the color of the smaller object and paint the larger object onto the grid.
