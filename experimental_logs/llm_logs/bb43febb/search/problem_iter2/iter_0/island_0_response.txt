## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying distinct objects in the input grid (where an object is defined as a connected group of identical digits) and then moving each object within the output grid based on its original position and characteristics. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The large '5' object is moved one row up and its leftmost column is shifted to the right end of the object.
* The smaller '2' object is also moved one row up and its rightmost column is shifted to the left end of the object.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The '5' objects at the top and bottom are moved inwards, effectively switching their vertical positions while preserving their horizontal arrangement.
* The '2' object remains in the same vertical position but its rightmost column is shifted to the left end of the object.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformations.

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) # Create a blank canvas
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T): # Iterate over each object
    if size(obj) > 1:
      if uppermost(obj) < halve(height(I)): # Check if object is in the top half
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (NEG_ONE, ONE))) # Shift up and right
      else:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (NEG_ONE, NEG_ONE))) # Shift up and left
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Iterates through each object larger than one cell.
* Objects in the top half of the grid are shifted one cell up and one cell right. 
* Objects in the bottom half are shifted one cell up and one cell left.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      w = width(obj)
      if portrait(obj): # Check if object is taller than wide
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (ZERO, w - 1))) # Shift right by width - 1
      else:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (ZERO, -(w - 1)))) # Shift left by width - 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Iterates through each object.
* If the object is taller than it is wide, it's shifted to the right by its width - 1.
* Otherwise, it's shifted to the left by its width - 1.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = fill(I, ZERO, asindices(I)) # Create a blank canvas
  for obj in objs:
    if size(obj) > 1:
      c = centerofmass(obj)
      if c[0] < halve(height(I)): # Check object's center of mass vertical position
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (ZERO, width(obj) - 1))) # Shift right by width - 1
      else:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (ZERO, -(width(obj) - 1)))) # Shift left by width - 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Iterates through each object.
* Determines the vertical position of the object's center of mass.
* Shifts the object right by its width - 1 if the center of mass is in the top half of the grid.
* Shifts the object left by its width - 1 if the center of mass is in the bottom half.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      if color(obj) == 5: # Check if object color is 5
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (NEG_ONE, width(obj) - 1))) # Shift up and right by width - 1
      else:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (NEG_ONE, -(width(obj) - 1)))) # Shift up and left by width - 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Iterates through each object.
* If the object's color is 5, it's shifted one cell up and right by its width - 1.
* Otherwise, it's shifted one cell up and left by its width - 1.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      if obj == argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), size): # Check if object is the largest
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (NEG_ONE, ONE))) # Shift up and right
      else:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, (NEG_ONE, NEG_ONE))) # Shift up and left
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Iterates through each object.
* Identifies the largest object in the grid.
* Shifts the largest object one cell up and one cell right.
* All other objects are shifted one cell up and one cell left.


These are just five potential solutions. There might be many other ways to achieve the desired transformations in this DSL.  The key is to carefully analyze the input-output pairs to identify the underlying pattern and then use the available functions to express that pattern in code.
