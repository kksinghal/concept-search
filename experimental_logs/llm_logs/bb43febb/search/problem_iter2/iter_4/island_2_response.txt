## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

1. **Identify objects:** The input has two objects: a '5' object and a '2' object.
2. **Shift '5' object:** The '5' object is shifted one cell up and one cell left.
3. **Expand and shift '2' object:** The '2' object is expanded to be 2x2 instead of 1x2. This expanded '2' object is then shifted one cell up and one cell left.
4. **Combine objects:**  The shifted and expanded objects are combined on a background of '0's.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

1. **Identify objects:** The input has two objects: a '5' object and a '2' object.
2. **Shift '5' object:** The '5' object is shifted one cell left.
3. **Transpose and shift '2' object:** The '2' object is transposed (rows become columns and vice versa). The transposed '2' object is then shifted one cell up and one cell left.
4. **Combine objects:** The shifted and transposed objects are combined on a background of '0's.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 5))
  obj2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 2))
  shifted_obj5 = shift(obj5, (-1, -1))
  expanded_obj2 = frozenset(
      (2, (i + di, j + dj)) 
      for di in range(2) 
      for dj in range(2) 
      for v, (i, j) in obj2
  )
  shifted_obj2 = shift(expanded_obj2, (-1, -1))
  O = paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shifted_obj5), shifted_obj2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  Find the objects composed of '5' and '2' using `colorfilter` and `objects`.
2. **Shift '5' object:** Shift the '5' object one cell up and left using `shift`.
3. **Expand and shift '2' object:** Expand the '2' object by creating new cells with value '2' adjacent to existing '2' cells. Then, shift this expanded object one cell up and left.
4. **Combine objects:** Create a canvas of '0's the same size as the input grid. Paint the shifted '5' and expanded '2' objects onto this canvas.


**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 5))
  obj2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 2))
  shifted_obj5 = shift(obj5, (-1, -1))
  transposed_obj2 = frozenset(
      (2, (j, i))
      for v, (i, j) in obj2
  )
  shifted_obj2 = shift(transposed_obj2, (-1, -1))
  O = paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shifted_obj5), shifted_obj2)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Shift '5' object:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Transpose and shift '2' object:** Transpose the '2' object by swapping the row and column indices of its cells. Then, shift this transposed object one cell up and left.
4. **Combine objects:** Same as Version 1.

**Version 3 (Optimized for Input 0):**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 5))
  obj2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 2))
  O = paint(
      paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shift(obj5, (-1, -1))), 
      shift(upscale(obj2, 2), (-2, -2))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Shift '5' object:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Upscale and shift '2' object:** This version directly uses the `upscale` function to expand the '2' object by a factor of 2. This eliminates the need for manually creating adjacent cells. The upscaled object is then shifted two cells up and left to match the output.
4. **Combine objects:** Same as Version 1.

**Version 4 (Optimized for Input 1):**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 5))
  obj2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 2))
  O = paint(
      paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shift(obj5, (0, -1))), 
      shift(dmirror(obj2), (-1, -1))
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Shift '5' object:**  Shift the '5' object one cell left using `shift`.
3. **Mirror and shift '2' object:** This version utilizes the `dmirror` function to directly transpose the '2' object. This mirrored object is then shifted one cell up and left.
4. **Combine objects:** Same as Version 1.


**Version 5 (Generic):**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj5 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 5))
  obj2 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), 2))
  shift_amount = (-1, -1)
  if portrait(obj2):
    transformed_obj2 = shift(dmirror(obj2), shift_amount)
  else:
    transformed_obj2 = shift(upscale(obj2, 2), (-2, -2))
  O = paint(
      paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shift(obj5, shift_amount)), 
      transformed_obj2
  )
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Determine transformation based on object shape:** This version adds a conditional to dynamically choose between transposing or upscaling the '2' object based on its shape using the `portrait` function. If the object is taller than it is wide, it's transposed. Otherwise, it's upscaled. 
3. **Apply transformation and shift:** The chosen transformation (transpose or upscale) is applied to the '2' object, and the resulting object is shifted. 
4. **Combine objects:** Same as Version 1. 

This version aims to be more general and adapt to potential variations in the '2' object's shape while still achieving the desired output for the given inputs.
