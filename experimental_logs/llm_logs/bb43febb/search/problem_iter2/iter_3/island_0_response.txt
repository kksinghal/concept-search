## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

The transformation involves taking each object (group of connected same-value digits) except the background (most frequent digit, here '3'), shifting it either up and right or up and left based on its color, and then placing it back onto a blank canvas.  The shift direction is determined as follows:
* Objects with color '5' shift up and right by a distance equal to their width minus 1.
* Objects with color '2' shift up and left by a distance equal to their width minus 1.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

This transformation follows a similar pattern as the previous one. Each object, except the background ('3'), is moved up and either left or right depending on its color, and placed on a blank canvas. The shift behavior is:
* Objects with color '5' shift up by one unit and right by a distance equal to their width minus 1.
* Objects with color '2' shift up by one unit and left by a distance equal to their width minus 1.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):  # Iterate over objects in the input
    if color(obj) == 5:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-1, width(obj) - 1)))  # Shift up and right for color 5
    elif color(obj) == 2:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-1, -(width(obj) - 1))))  # Shift up and left for color 2
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version directly implements the observed pattern. It iterates through each object and applies the appropriate shift based on its color before painting it onto the canvas.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    direction = (1 if color(obj) == 2 else -1) * (width(obj) - 1)  # Calculate direction based on color
    O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-1, direction)))  # Shift up and left/right based on direction
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version calculates the horizontal shift direction dynamically based on the object's color, making the code more concise.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Start with the input grid
  for v in palette(I) - {mostcommon(I)}:  # Iterate over colors except the background
    obj = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), matcher(color, v))  # Extract object with current color
    direction = (1 if v == 2 else -1) * (width(obj) - 1)  # Calculate direction based on color
    O = move(O, obj, (-1, direction))  # Move the object on the grid
  return replace(O, mostcommon(I), ZERO)  # Replace background with zeros
```

**Explanation:**

This version modifies the input grid directly instead of using a separate canvas. It iterates over each color (excluding the background), extracts the corresponding object, calculates the shift, moves the object, and finally replaces the background with zeros.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-1, (width(obj) - 1) * (2 * (color(obj) == 2) - 1))))  # Shift based on color and width
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a more compact expression to calculate the shift direction and distance within a single line, leveraging boolean logic and arithmetic operations.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shift_map = {5: width(extract(objects(I, T, F, T), matcher(color, 5))) - 1,
               2: -(width(extract(objects(I, T, F, T), matcher(color, 2))) - 1)}  # Pre-calculate shifts for each color
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, (-1, shift_map[color(obj)])))  # Apply pre-calculated shifts
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version pre-calculates the horizontal shift distances for each color and stores them in a dictionary. Then, it iterates through the objects, looks up the pre-calculated shift for the current object's color, and applies it. This approach can be more efficient if there are many objects with the same color.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches and coding styles while achieving the same transformation logic. Each version highlights the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for manipulating objects and grids.
