## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** 

The transformation recolors the interior cells of the non-background object (value 5) to the value 2, keeping the perimeter cells unchanged. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

Similar to the previous transformation, the interior cells of all non-background objects are recolored to 2, while preserving the perimeter cells.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      periphery = box(obj) 
      interior = difference(toindices(obj), periphery)
      O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, toobject(interior, I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over objects:** Loop through each non-background object in the input grid `I`.
2. **Identify interior:** For each object, determine its periphery using `box` and compute the interior by subtracting the periphery from the object's indices.
3. **Recolor and paint:** Recolor the cells corresponding to the interior indices to 2 using `recolor` and `toobject`. Paint these recolored cells onto the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      for v, (i, j) in obj:
        if all((i + di, j + dj) in toindices(obj) for di, dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]):
          O = paint(O, {(TWO, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:** Loop through each cell within each non-background object.
2. **Check for interior:** For each cell, check if all its directly adjacent neighbors belong to the same object. If yes, it's an interior cell.
3. **Recolor interior:** Recolor the identified interior cells to 2 and paint them onto the output grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      O = underpaint(O, obj)
      O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, toobject(trim(subgrid(obj, I)), I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize output:** Create an output grid `O` filled with the background color.
2. **Paint objects:** For each non-background object, paint it onto the output grid.
3. **Recolor interior:**  Recolor the interior of each painted object to 2 (using logic similar to Program Version 1) and repaint it onto the output. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      for x in range(1, width(obj) - 1):
        for y in range(1, height(obj) - 1):
          i, j = add(ulcorner(obj), (y, x))
          O = paint(O, {(TWO, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate based on dimensions:** For each object, iterate through its width and height, excluding the border cells.
2. **Calculate interior indices:** Calculate the indices of interior cells based on the object's upper-left corner and the iteration variables.
3. **Recolor and paint:** Recolor the identified interior cells to 2 and paint them onto the output grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      trimmed = trim(subgrid(obj, I))
      O = paint(cover(O, obj), recolor(TWO, toobject(trimmed, I)))
      O = paint(O, toobject(box(obj), I)) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Trim and recolor:** Trim the object to get its interior, recolor it to 2, and paint it onto a grid where the original object is erased.
2. **Paint the border:** Extract the border of the original object and paint it back onto the output grid to restore the perimeter.
