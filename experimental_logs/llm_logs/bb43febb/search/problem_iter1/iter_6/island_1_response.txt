## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on modifying objects within the grid based on their shape and size. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Target Object:** Identify the largest object in the grid (the '5' object).
2. **Inner Fill:** Fill the interior of the target object with the value '2', leaving a one-cell border of '5' around the perimeter.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. **Target Objects:** Identify all objects in the grid.
2. **Size and Shape Filtering:** Select objects that meet the following criteria:
    * **Size:** Larger than one cell.
    * **Shape:** Not a horizontal line.
3. **Inner Fill:** Similar to Input_0, fill the interior of each selected object with the value '2', maintaining a one-cell border of the original value.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Find objects, ignore background
  def fill_inner(obj):
    return fill(I, TWO, difference(toindices(obj), box(obj))) if size(obj) > 1 and not hline(obj) else I
  filled_objs = mapply(fill_inner, objs) # Fill objects if size > 1 and not a horizontal line
  return last(filled_objs) # Return the last filled grid
```

**Explanation:**

* This version leverages the `objects` function to isolate individual objects.
* It then uses a `fill_inner` function to determine if an object should be filled. The criteria are: size greater than one and not a horizontal line (`hline`). 
* The `fill` function, combined with `difference` and `box`, ensures only the interior is filled.
* Finally, the `last` function is used to return the final modified grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  def process_object(obj):
    if size(obj) > 1 and not hline(obj):
      inner_area = difference(backdrop(obj), box(obj))
      return fill(I, TWO, inner_area)
    return I
  return last(mapply(process_object, objects(I, T, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

* Similar to version 1, this version uses `objects` for object isolation.
* A separate function `process_object` encapsulates the filling logic.
* It calculates the `inner_area` by finding the difference between the object's bounding box (`backdrop`) and its outline (`box`).
* The `fill` function modifies the grid based on the calculated `inner_area`. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) > 1 and not hline(obj)) # Filter objects
  filled_grid = I
  for obj in filtered_objs:
    filled_grid = fill(filled_grid, TWO, difference(toindices(obj), box(obj)))
  return filled_grid
```

**Explanation:**

* This version directly filters objects using `sfilter` based on size and shape constraints.
* It iterates through the `filtered_objs` and applies the fill logic to each.
* The `fill` function modifies the `filled_grid` iteratively for each object.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  def modify_grid(grid, obj):
    return fill(grid, TWO, difference(toindices(obj), box(obj)))
  return last(
      reduce(
        modify_grid, 
        sfilter(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: size(obj) > 1 and not hline(obj)),
        I
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

* This version introduces the `reduce` function for iterative grid modification.
* It defines a `modify_grid` function specifically for applying the fill logic within the `reduce` function.
* The `reduce` function starts with the initial grid (`I`) and applies `modify_grid` to each filtered object.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  def is_valid_object(obj):
    return size(obj) > 1 and not hline(obj)
  valid_objects = set(filter(is_valid_object, objects(I, T, F, T)))
  inner_areas = set(difference(backdrop(obj), box(obj)) for obj in valid_objects)
  return last(fill(I, TWO, area) for area in inner_areas)
```

**Explanation:**

* This version focuses on pre-calculating valid objects and their inner areas.
* It uses the `filter` function with `is_valid_object` to select the appropriate objects.
* Then, it generates a set of `inner_areas` for all valid objects.
* Finally, it applies the `fill` function to the initial grid (`I`) using each `inner_area`.
