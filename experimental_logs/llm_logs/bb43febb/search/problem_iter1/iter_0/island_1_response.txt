## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying rectangular regions of a specific color (5 in the given examples) and replacing the inner cells of these regions with another color (2 in the given examples), while leaving the border cells unchanged. 

* **Input_0 to Output_0:** The large 5x7 rectangle in the input has its inner 3x5 region filled with 2s.
* **Input_1 to Output_1:** Both the 7x6 and 5x5 rectangles undergo the same inner fill transformation with the color 2.


## Program Version 1: 

**Code:**

```python
def solve_25d8a9c8(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  for obj in objs:
    if len(obj) > 2:
      obj_indices = toindices(obj)
      inner_indices = difference(obj_indices, box(obj_indices))
      I = fill(I, TWO, inner_indices)
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all connected regions of the same color.
2. **Iterate Through Objects:** The code iterates through each identified object.
3. **Filter by Size:** `if len(obj) > 2` ensures that only objects larger than a single cell are considered.
4. **Get Object Indices & Inner Indices:** `obj_indices` stores the indices of the current object. `inner_indices` calculates the indices of the inner cells by subtracting the border cells using `box` and `difference` functions.
5. **Fill Inner Region:** `fill(I, TWO, inner_indices)` replaces the color of the inner cells with the value '2'.
6. **Return Modified Grid:** The modified grid `O` is returned.


## Program Version 2: 

**Code:**

```python
def solve_25d8a9c8(I):
  for i in range(1, len(I)-1):
    for j in range(1, len(I[0])-1):
      if I[i][j] != ZERO and I[i-1][j] == I[i][j] and I[i][j-1] == I[i][j]:
        I = fill(I, TWO, {(i, j)})
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Inner Cells:** The code iterates through each cell of the grid, excluding the border cells.
2. **Check for Surrounding Cells:**  It checks if the current cell and its top and left neighbors have the same color and that the color is not the background color (0 in this case).
3. **Fill if Inner Cell:** If the condition is met, indicating an inner cell of a region, the cell's color is replaced with '2'.
4. **Return Modified Grid:** The modified grid `O` is returned.


## Program Version 3: 

**Code:**

```python
def solve_25d8a9c8(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  inner_cells = set()
  for obj in objs:
    if len(obj) > 2:
      obj_indices = toindices(obj)
      top_left = ulcorner(obj_indices)
      bottom_right = lrcorner(obj_indices)
      for i in range(top_left[0]+1, bottom_right[0]):
        for j in range(top_left[1]+1, bottom_right[1]):
          inner_cells.add((i,j))
  O = fill(I, TWO, inner_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Same as Version 1, it identifies connected regions.
2. **Iterate and Collect Inner Indices:**  It iterates through objects and for those larger than a single cell, it calculates the bounding box using `ulcorner` and `lrcorner`. Then, it iterates within the bounding box, collecting indices of inner cells.
3. **Fill Collected Indices:** Finally, it fills all collected inner cell indices with color '2'. 


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_25d8a9c8(I):
  painted = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  for obj in objs:
    if size(obj) > 1:
      ul = ulcorner(obj)
      lr = lrcorner(obj)
      for i in range(ul[0] + 1, lr[0]):
        for j in range(ul[1] + 1, lr[1]):
          painted = fill(painted, TWO, {(i, j)})
  O = paint(I, asobject(painted))
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:**  `painted = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))` creates a new grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background color (0).
2. **Identify Objects:**  Identifies connected regions in the input grid.
3. **Iterate and Fill on Canvas:** Iterates through objects, and for objects larger than a single cell, it determines the inner bounding box and fills the corresponding cells in the `painted` canvas with the color '2'.
4. **Combine with Input:**  The `paint` function overlays the filled regions from the `painted` canvas onto the original input grid, resulting in the final output. 


## Program Version 5: 

**Code:**

```python
def solve_25d8a9c8(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != ZERO:
        adjacent_same = 0
        for di in [-1, 1]:
          for dj in [-1, 1]:
            if 0 <= i+di < len(I) and 0 <= j+dj < len(I[0]) and I[i+di][j+dj] == I[i][j]:
              adjacent_same += 1
        if adjacent_same >= 2:
          O = fill(O, TWO, {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **Iterate Through All Cells:** Iterates through every cell in the grid.
2. **Check Diagonal Neighbors:** For each non-background cell, it checks its diagonal neighbors. If at least two diagonal neighbors have the same color as the current cell, it implies an inner cell.
3. **Fill if Inner Cell:**  If the condition is met, the cell's color in the output grid `O` is replaced with '2'.
4. **Return Modified Grid:** The modified grid `O` is returned.

These five versions offer diverse approaches to the problem, using different DSL function combinations and logic to achieve the desired transformation. Each version highlights the flexibility and expressive power of the DSL in solving spatial reasoning tasks.
