## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves recoloring the inner cells of each object in the input grid to the value '2' while preserving the original color of the border cells. 

Let's break it down for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 -> Output_0:**

* The input grid has a single object formed by the digit '5'.
* The output grid preserves the outer layer of '5's, forming the border of the object.
* All '5's enclosed within the border are replaced with '2's.

**Input_1 -> Output_1:**

* The input grid contains two objects formed by the digit '5'.
*  Similar to the previous example, the output grid maintains the outer layer of each object as '5's.
* The inner '5's of both objects are replaced by '2's.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions ("Program_to_be_generated") in the provided DSL that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      O = underpaint(O, recolor(TWO, toindices(trim(subgrid(obj, I)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** `O = I` initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Object Iteration:** `for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):` iterates through each object in the input grid `I`. `T, F, T` signifies univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True, ensuring only connected objects excluding the background are considered.
3. **Size Check:** `if size(obj) > 1:` proceeds only if the object has more than one cell.
4. **Inner Cell Identification:**
    * `subgrid(obj, I)` extracts the smallest subgrid containing the object.
    * `trim(subgrid(obj, I))` removes the outer layer (border) of the subgrid, leaving only the inner cells.
    * `toindices(trim(subgrid(obj, I)))` retrieves the indices of these inner cells.
5. **Recoloring:** `recolor(TWO, toindices(trim(subgrid(obj, I))))` creates a new object with color '2' at the indices of the inner cells.
6. **Underpainting:** `underpaint(O, recolor(TWO, toindices(trim(subgrid(obj, I)))))` paints the '2' colored object onto the output grid `O` only where the background color is present, ensuring the border remains untouched. 
7. **Output:** The loop continues for all objects, and finally, the transformed grid `O` is returned.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), toindices(box(obj))))
      O = underpaint(O, recolor(TWO, toindices(trim(subgrid(obj, I)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** `O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates an empty output grid `O` filled with the background color of the input grid `I`.
2. **Object Iteration & Size Check:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Border Painting:** 
    * `box(obj)` identifies the indices forming the border of the object.
    * `recolor(color(obj), toindices(box(obj)))` creates a new object with the original color at the border indices.
    * `paint(O, recolor(color(obj), toindices(box(obj))))` paints this border object onto the output grid.
4. **Inner Cell Recoloring & Painting:** This part is identical to steps 4-6 in Version 1, recoloring the inner cells to '2' and painting them onto the output grid. 
5. **Output:** The loop continues for all objects, and finally, the transformed grid `O` is returned.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      border = frozenset((index(I, (i, j)), (i, j)) for i, j in toindices(box(obj)))
      O = underpaint(paint(O, border), recolor(TWO, toindices(trim(subgrid(obj, I))))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Object Iteration & Size Check:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Border Extraction:** 
    * `box(obj)` identifies the indices forming the border of the object.
    * `(index(I, (i, j)), (i, j)) for i, j in toindices(box(obj))` extracts the color and indices for each border cell from the input grid `I`.
    * `border = frozenset(...)` creates a new object representing the border with the correct color and indices.
4. **Border & Inner Cell Painting:** This part combines the border painting and inner cell recoloring from Version 2 into a single line:
    * `paint(O, border)` paints the border object onto the output grid.
    * `underpaint(..., recolor(TWO, toindices(trim(subgrid(obj, I)))))` recolors the inner cells to '2' and paints them onto the output grid, similar to Version 1.
5. **Output:** The loop continues for all objects, and finally, the transformed grid `O` is returned.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      O = paint(O, recolor(TWO, difference(toindices(obj), toindices(box(obj)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Object Iteration & Size Check:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Inner Cell Identification:**
    * `toindices(obj)` retrieves the indices of all cells in the object.
    * `toindices(box(obj))` retrieves the indices of the border cells.
    * `difference(toindices(obj), toindices(box(obj)))` calculates the set difference, effectively isolating the indices of the inner cells.
4. **Recoloring & Painting:** 
    * `recolor(TWO, ...)` creates a new object with color '2' at the inner cell indices.
    * `paint(O, ...)` paints this new object onto the output grid, effectively recoloring the inner cells while preserving the border.
5. **Output:** The loop continues for all objects, and finally, the transformed grid `O` is returned.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      for cell in obj:
        if cell[1] in toindices(box(obj)):
          O = paint(O, {cell})
        else:
          O = paint(O, {(TWO, cell[1])})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Canvas Creation:** Same as Version 2.
2. **Object Iteration & Size Check:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Cell Iteration:** `for cell in obj:` iterates through each cell within the current object.
4. **Border or Inner Cell Check:** `if cell[1] in toindices(box(obj)):` checks if the cell's index is part of the border indices.
5. **Selective Painting:**
    * If the cell is on the border: `O = paint(O, {cell})` paints the cell onto the output grid with its original color.
    * If the cell is not on the border (inner cell): `O = paint(O, {(TWO, cell[1])})` paints the cell onto the output grid with color '2'.
6. **Output:** The loop continues for all objects and cells, and finally, the transformed grid `O` is returned.

These five program versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation, illustrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
