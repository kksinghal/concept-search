## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation involves identifying the largest object composed of '5's. Then, within this object, all cells except those directly connected to the object's border are replaced with '2's.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**  This transformation follows the same logic as the previous one. The largest object composed of '5's is identified.  Within this object, cells not directly connected to the border are replaced with '2's. 


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = largest(objects(I, T, F, T))
  border = toindices(obj) - inbox(obj)
  O = fill(I, TWO, toindices(obj) - border)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = largest(objects(I, T, F, T))`**: This line identifies all objects on the grid ('I') that are univalued (all cells have the same value - 'T'), not diagonally connected ('F'), and excluding the background ('T'). From these objects, it selects the largest one and assigns it to the variable 'obj'.

2. **`border = toindices(obj) - inbox(obj)`**: This line calculates the border indices of the 'obj'. It does this by finding the difference between all indices of the object ('toindices(obj)') and the indices within its internal bounding box ('inbox(obj)').

3. **`O = fill(I, TWO, toindices(obj) - border)`**: This line fills the input grid 'I' with the value '2' ('TWO') at all indices belonging to the object ('toindices(obj)') except those on the border ('border').  This effectively replaces the inner cells of the object with '2's.

4. **`return O`**: The transformed grid 'O' is returned as the output.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), size)
  inner = mfilter(toindices(obj), lambda loc: neighbors(loc) <= toindices(obj))
  O = underfill(I, TWO, inner)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), size)`**: Similar to version 1, this line identifies the largest object (using 'argmax' and 'size' for maximum size) in the grid 'I' based on the specified criteria. 

2. **`inner = mfilter(toindices(obj), lambda loc: neighbors(loc) <= toindices(obj))`**: This line identifies the inner indices of the object 'obj'. It iterates through all object indices and uses a lambda function to select only those whose neighboring cells ('neighbors(loc)') are entirely contained within the object's indices ('toindices(obj)').

3. **`O = underfill(I, TWO, inner)`**: This line fills the input grid 'I' with the value '2' ('TWO') but only at the 'inner' indices. 'underfill' ensures that only cells with the background color are replaced.

4. **`return O`**: The transformed grid 'O' is returned.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = largest(objects(I, T, F, T))
  shifted_objs = rapply(lambda d: shift(obj, d), ((1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)))
  border =  mapply(intersection, pair(repeat(toindices(obj), 4), toindices(shifted_objs)))
  O = fill(I, TWO, toindices(obj) - border)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = largest(objects(I, T, F, T))`**:  Identifies the largest object as in previous versions.

2. **`shifted_objs = rapply(lambda d: shift(obj, d), ((1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)))`**: This line creates four shifted versions of the object, each shifted by one unit in the four cardinal directions.

3. **`border =  mapply(intersection, pair(repeat(toindices(obj), 4), toindices(shifted_objs)))`**: This line calculates the border indices by finding the intersections between the original object and its shifted versions.

4. **`O = fill(I, TWO, toindices(obj) - border)`**:  Fills the grid 'I' with '2's at object indices except the border.

5. **`return O`**: Returns the transformed grid 'O'.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), size)
  border =  toindices(obj) & mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj)) 
  O = underfill(I, TWO, toindices(obj)-border)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = argmax(objects(I, T, F, T), size)`**: Identifies the largest object in the grid.

2. **`border = toindices(obj) & mapply(dneighbors, toindices(obj))`**:  Calculates the border by finding the intersection between the object's indices and the direct neighbors of all its indices. 

3. **`O = underfill(I, TWO, toindices(obj)-border)`**: Fills the grid with '2's at object indices excluding the border.

4. **`return O`**: Returns the transformed grid.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = largest(objects(I, T, F, T))
  filled = fill(I, TWO, toindices(obj))
  O = paint(filled, toobject(box(obj), I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = largest(objects(I, T, F, T))`**:  Identifies the largest object.

2. **`filled = fill(I, TWO, toindices(obj))`**: Fills the entire object with '2's.

3. **`O = paint(filled, toobject(box(obj), I))`**: This line paints back the original values of the object's outline on top of the filled grid. This effectively keeps the border intact while filling the inside. 

4. **`return O`**: Returns the transformed grid.
