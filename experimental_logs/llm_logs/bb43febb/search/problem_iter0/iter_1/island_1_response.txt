## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces the inner cells of each object with the value '2', while preserving the outer border of the object. 

**Example:**

Input:
```
5 5 5 5 5
5 5 5 5 5
5 5 5 5 5 
5 5 5 5 5
5 5 5 5 5
```

Output:
```
5 5 5 5 5
5 2 2 2 5
5 2 2 2 5
5 2 2 2 5
5 5 5 5 5
```


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Extract objects, ignoring background
    O = I 
    for obj in objs:
        if height(obj) > 1 and width(obj) > 1:  # Only modify objects larger than 1x1
            inner_obj = shift(crop(obj, (1,1), (height(obj)-2, width(obj)-2)), (-1,-1)) # Extract and shift back the inner region
            O = paint(cover(O, inner_obj), recolor(TWO, inner_obj)) # Cover inner region and paint with '2'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  We first extract all objects from the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate and Modify:** We iterate through each extracted object. If the object is larger than a single cell:
    *  **Extract Inner Region:**  The `crop` function extracts the inner region of the object, excluding the border. `shift` realigns the region to its original position.
    *  **Cover and Recolor:** The `cover` function removes the original inner region from the grid by replacing it with the background color. Then, `recolor` changes the color of the extracted inner region to '2'. Finally, the `paint` function draws this modified region back onto the grid.
3. **Return Modified Grid:**  The modified grid is returned as the output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), ZERO, asindices(I)) # Create empty canvas
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    for obj in objs:
        if len(obj) > 1:
            O = paint(O, recolor(FIVE, box(obj))) # Draw the border
            O = underfill(O, TWO, shift(backdrop(obj), (1,1))) # Fill the inside with '2'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:** An empty canvas with the same dimensions as the input is created.
2. **Extract and Modify:** Objects are extracted. For each object larger than a single cell:
    * **Draw Border:**  The `box` function identifies the border indices of the object. These indices are then recolored to '5' and painted onto the canvas, effectively recreating the object's border.
    * **Fill Inside:**  The `backdrop` function gets all indices within the object's bounding box. `shift` moves this box inwards by one cell in both directions. `underfill` then fills these indices with '2' but only if they are currently the background color (ensuring it doesn't overwrite the border).
3. **Return Modified Grid:** The canvas, now containing the modified objects, is returned.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(height(I)):
        for j in range(width(I)):
            if contained(add((i,j), dneighbors((i,j))), ofcolor(I, index(I, (i,j)))) and contained(add((i,j), ineighbors((i,j))), ofcolor(I, index(I, (i,j)))):
                O = paint(O, {(TWO, (i, j))}) # Change pixel to '2' if it has same-colored diagonal and direct neighbours
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Cells:** The code iterates through each cell of the input grid.
2. **Check Neighbors:** For each cell, it checks if both its direct (up, down, left, right) and diagonal neighbors are of the same color as the current cell. 
3. **Modify Inner Cells:** If both conditions are true, it implies the cell is an inner cell. The cell is then painted with the value '2'.
4. **Return Modified Grid:**  The grid, with its inner cells modified, is returned.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    O = I
    for obj in objs:
        inner_indices = difference(backdrop(obj), box(obj)) # Indices inside the object but not on the border
        O = fill(O, TWO, inner_indices) # Fill the inner indices with '2'
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Objects are extracted from the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **Iterate and Identify Inner Cells:** For each object:
    *  **Get Inner Indices:** `backdrop` gets all indices within the object's bounding box. `box` gets the indices forming the object's border.  `difference` subtracts the border indices from the bounding box indices, resulting in a set of indices representing the object's inner region.
    *  **Fill Inner Region:** `fill` sets the value of all cells at the inner indices to '2'.
3. **Return Modified Grid:**  The modified grid, with its inner regions filled with '2', is returned.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    for i in range(1, height(I)-1):
        for j in range(1, width(I)-1):
            if index(I, (i,j)) == index(I, (i-1,j)) == index(I, (i+1,j)) == index(I, (i, j-1)) == index(I, (i, j+1)):
                O = paint(O, {(TWO, (i,j))}) # Change to '2' if surrounded by the same color
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Inner Cells:** The code iterates through each cell of the input grid, excluding the outer border.
2. **Check Direct Neighbors:** For each cell, it checks if all its direct neighbors (up, down, left, right) have the same color as the current cell.
3. **Modify Inner Cells:** If the condition is met, indicating the cell is surrounded by the same color, it's painted with '2'.
4. **Return Modified Grid:** The grid, with the identified inner cells changed, is returned. 

These five versions provide different approaches to achieve the same transformation, demonstrating flexibility in solving the problem using the given DSL. Each leverages different functions and logic, offering a diverse set of solutions.
