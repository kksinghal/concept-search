## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation identifies objects within the grid (excluding the background) and then fills the "inbox" of each object with the value '2'. The "inbox" refers to the area enclosed within the object's outer boundary, excluding the boundary itself.

**Example:**

Consider Input_0:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0
5 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 0
5 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 0
5 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 0
5 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

The largest object consists of the '5' values.  Its "inbox" would be:

```
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .
. 2 2 2 . . . . .
. 2 2 2 . . 2 . .
. 2 2 2 . . 2 . .
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . . . .
```

This area is then filled with '2' in the output.

## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct code versions to implement the transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, F, F, T)  # Extract objects, excluding background
  x2 = mapply(toindices, x1) # Get indices for each object
  x3 = mapply(inbox, x2)     # Calculate the inbox for each object
  O = fill(I, TWO, merge(x3)) # Fill all inboxes with the value '2'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, F, F, T)` identifies all objects within the grid, excluding the background.
2. **Get Object Indices:** `mapply(toindices, x1)` converts each object into a set of its cell indices.
3. **Calculate Inboxes:** `mapply(inbox, x2)` calculates the "inbox" indices for each object.
4. **Fill Inboxes:** `fill(I, TWO, merge(x3))` merges all inbox indices and fills those locations in the original grid with the value '2'.


**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, F, F, T)   # Extract objects, excluding background
  O = I                       # Initialize the output grid
  for obj in x1:
    O = fill(O, TWO, inbox(toindices(obj))) # Fill the inbox of each object with '2'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, F, F, T)` identifies objects (excluding background).
2. **Iterate and Fill:**  The code iterates through each extracted object (`obj`). For each object:
   - `toindices(obj)` retrieves the indices of the object's cells.
   - `inbox(...)` calculates the "inbox" indices.
   - `fill(O, TWO, ...)` fills the inbox with '2' in the output grid (`O`).


**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, F, F, T)  # Extract objects
  x2 = apply(lambda obj: fill(I, TWO, inbox(toindices(obj))), x1) # Fill inbox for each object
  O = last(x2) # Use last filled grid as output 
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, F, F, T)` identifies objects in the grid.
2. **Apply Filling:**  `apply(lambda obj: ..., x1)` applies a function to each object in `x1`. The function: 
   - `fill(I, TWO, inbox(toindices(obj)))` calculates the inbox of the current object and fills it with '2' in a copy of the input grid (`I`).
3. **Get Last Grid:**  Since `apply` returns a container of modified grids, `last(x2)` selects the last one, which contains all filled inboxes.


**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I                                     # Start with the input grid
  for i in range(len(I)):                   # Iterate through rows
    for j in range(len(I[0])):              # Iterate through columns
      if contained((i, j), delta(objects(I, F, F, F))):  # Check if in any object's delta
        O = fill(O, TWO, {(i,j)})           # If in delta, fill with '2'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Through Grid:** This version iterates directly through the grid's cells.
2. **Check Delta:** For each cell `(i, j)`, it checks if the cell is part of the delta of any object in the grid.
3. **Fill if in Delta:** If the cell belongs to an object's delta, it is filled with '2'.


**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, F, F, T)  # Extract objects excluding background
  x2 = mapply(lambda obj: difference(backdrop(obj), obj), x1) # Find outer boundary of each object
  x3 = mapply(dneighbors, x2) # Get neighbors of each boundary cell
  x4 = intersection(merge(x3), asindices(I)) # Filter neighbors within grid bounds
  O = fill(I, TWO, difference(x4, merge(x2))) # Fill the valid neighbor cells with '2'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `objects(I, F, F, T)` extracts objects (excluding background).
2. **Find Outer Boundaries:** `mapply(lambda obj: ..., x1)` finds the outer boundary of each object by calculating the difference between its backdrop and itself.
3. **Get Boundary Neighbors:** `mapply(dneighbors, x2)` finds the direct neighbors of each cell in the outer boundaries.
4. **Filter Valid Neighbors:**  `intersection(..., asindices(I))` keeps only those neighbor cells that are within the grid's boundaries.
5. **Fill Valid Neighbors:** `fill(I, TWO, ...)` fills the valid neighbor cells (excluding the boundary cells themselves) with '2'.


These five versions provide diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL and different coding styles.
