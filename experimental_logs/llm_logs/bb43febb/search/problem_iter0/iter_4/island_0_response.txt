## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation identifies all non-background objects. For each object, it creates an internal "frame" by recoloring the cells one unit away from the object's border to the color '2'. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:** The same "framing" logic is applied here as well.  Every non-background object gets an internal frame of color '2'. 


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      O = underfill(O, TWO, inbox(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** The output grid `O` is initialized as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** The code iterates through each non-background object (`obj`) in the input grid.
3. **Apply Frame:** For each object larger than one cell, it uses `underfill` to recolor the cells within the object's `inbox` (the area one unit inside the object's border) to the color '2'. This effectively creates the internal frame.
4. **Return Output:** The modified grid `O` is returned as the output.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  framed_objs = frozenset(recolor(TWO, inbox(obj)) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if size(obj) > 1)
  return paint(I, merge(framed_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Generate Frames:**  The code first generates a set (`framed_objs`) containing the internal frames of all non-background objects. For each object, it recolors the `inbox` to color '2'. 
2. **Paint Frames:** It then uses `paint` to overlay all the generated frames onto the original input grid `I`.
3. **Return Output:** The resulting grid with the painted frames is returned.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    if size(obj) > 1:
      for loc in toindices(obj):
        if len(dneighbors(loc) & toindices(obj)) < 4: 
          O = fill(O, TWO, {loc})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**  Similar to Version 1, it starts by making the output grid `O` a copy of the input `I`.
2. **Iterate and Check Neighbors:** It then iterates through each cell (`loc`) of each non-background object. For each cell, it checks if it has less than 4 direct neighbors that are also part of the same object. This identifies cells on the inner border of the object.
3. **Fill Border Cells:** If a cell is on the inner border, it is filled with color '2'. 
4. **Return Output:** Finally, the modified grid `O` is returned.


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(
      recolor(TWO, difference(backdrop(obj), outbox(obj))) 
      for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if size(obj) > 1)
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate Frame Cells:** For each non-background object, it calculates the set of cells that constitute the internal frame by finding the difference between the object's `backdrop` (all cells in its bounding box) and its `outbox` (the cells surrounding the bounding box).
2. **Recolor and Merge:** These frame cells are then recolored to '2' and merged into a single set.
3. **Paint and Return:** Finally, the merged set of frame cells is painted onto the original input grid `I` and returned as the output.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return cellwise(I, fill(canvas(ZERO, shape(I)), TWO, 
                         merge(inbox(obj) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if size(obj) > 1)),
                  I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Frame Grid:** It creates a separate grid of the same size as the input, filled entirely with '2's in the `inbox` positions of all non-background objects.
2. **Cellwise Comparison:** It then performs a `cellwise` comparison between the input grid and the frame grid. For each cell, if the values match (both are '2'), it retains the '2'. Otherwise, it uses the value from the original input grid. 
3. **Return Output:** The result of the `cellwise` comparison, which is the input grid with the added frames, is returned as the output.
