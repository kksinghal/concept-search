## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to recolor the inner cells of each object in the grid to the value '2', while keeping the outer border of each object unchanged. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** A single object with the value '5' is present.
* **Output_0:** The outer border of the object retains the value '5', while the inner cells are recolored to '2'.

* **Input_1:** Two objects are present, one with the value '5' and another with the value '0' (background).
* **Output_1:**  The outer border of both objects remain unchanged, while the inner cells of the '5' object are recolored to '2'.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract all objects excluding background
  recolored_objs = frozenset({recolor(2, toobject(inbox(obj), I)) for obj in objs})  # Recolor inner cells of each object using 'inbox' function
  O = I  # Initialize output grid as input grid
  for obj in recolored_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)  # Paint each recolored object onto the output grid
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies and separates individual objects in the input grid (`I`), excluding the background.
2.  **`recolor(2, toobject(inbox(obj), I))`:**  For each object (`obj`), the `inbox` function defines the inner region. This region is converted to an object using `toobject` and subsequently recolored to '2' using `recolor`. 
3.  **`paint(O, obj)`:** Each recolored object is then painted onto a copy of the input grid (`O`) to generate the output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) 
  recolored_objs = frozenset({recolor(2, obj - toobject(box(obj), I)) for obj in objs})  # Recolor by subtracting the outline from the object
  O = I 
  for obj in recolored_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
2. **`recolor(2, obj - toobject(box(obj), I))`:**  Identifies the inner region of each object by subtracting its outline (obtained using `box`) from the object itself.  The inner region is then recolored to '2'.
3. **`paint(O, obj)`:** The recolored objects are painted onto the output grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  inner_cells = mapply(lambda obj: subtract(shape(obj), (2, 2)), objs)  # Calculate inner rectangle dimensions
  recolored_objs = frozenset({recolor(2, toobject(crop(I, add(ulcorner(obj),(1,1)), inner_cell), I)) for obj, inner_cell in zip(objs, inner_cells) if all(x>0 for x in inner_cell)})  # Crop and recolor inner rectangles
  O = I 
  for obj in recolored_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts objects from the input.
2. **`subtract(shape(obj), (2, 2))`:**  Calculates the dimensions of the inner rectangle for each object by reducing the object's width and height by 2.
3.  **`crop(I, add(ulcorner(obj),(1,1)), inner_cell)`:** Crops the inner rectangle from the input grid based on the calculated dimensions and the object's upper-left corner (`ulcorner`).
4.  **`recolor(2, ...)`:** Recolors the cropped inner rectangle to '2'.
5.  **`paint(O, obj)`:**  Paints the recolored objects onto the output grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (1, 1)), objs)  # Shift objects diagonally
  recolored_objs = frozenset({recolor(2, toobject(intersection(toindices(shifted_obj), toindices(obj)), I)) for obj, shifted_obj in zip(objs, shifted_objs)}) # Find intersecting cells and recolor
  O = I
  for obj in recolored_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Extracts objects from the input.
2. **`shift(obj, (1, 1))`:** Creates a diagonally shifted version of each object.
3.  **`intersection(toindices(shifted_obj), toindices(obj))`:**  Identifies the intersecting cells between the original object and its shifted counterpart, representing the inner region.
4.  **`recolor(2, ...)`:** Recolors the identified inner region to '2'.
5.  **`paint(O, obj)`:** Paints the recolored objects onto the output grid.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  recolored_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    inner_cells = delta(delta(toindices(obj))) #  Double delta to get inner cells
    recolored_obj = recolor(2, toobject(inner_cells, I)) 
    recolored_objs = recolored_objs.union({recolored_obj}) 
  O = I 
  for obj in recolored_objs:
    O = paint(O, obj) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts objects from the input.
2. **`delta(delta(toindices(obj)))`:** Applies the `delta` function twice to the object's indices. The first `delta` identifies the bounding box surrounding the object, excluding the object itself. The second `delta` applied to the result gives the inner cells of the object.
3.  **`recolor(2, toobject(inner_cells, I))`:** Recolors the identified inner cells to '2'.
4.  **`paint(O, obj)`:** Paints the recolored objects onto the output grid. 

Each of these program versions utilizes different combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same goal: recolor the inner cells of each object to '2' while leaving the outer border intact. This showcases the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL in accomplishing a single transformation using diverse approaches.
