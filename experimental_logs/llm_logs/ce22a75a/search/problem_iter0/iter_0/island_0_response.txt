## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

The transformation takes all occurrences of the digit '5' and replaces them with 3x3 squares of the digit '1'. The squares are positioned with their upper-left corner at the location of the original '5'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

Similar to the previous transformation, occurrences of the digit '5' are replaced with 3x3 squares of '1'. However, if a square would extend beyond the bottom boundary of the grid, it continues from the top of the same column.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  fives = colorfilter(objs, 5)
  squares = mapply(lambda obj: backdrop(shift(obj, (-1,-1))), fives)
  O = fill(I, 1, merge(squares))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects`: Identifies all objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid.
2. `colorfilter`: Filters for objects consisting only of the digit '5'.
3. `mapply` and `shift`: For each '5' object, calculates the indices of a 3x3 square with its upper-left corner at the '5' location, shifted one up and one left.
4. `merge`: Combines the indices of all squares.
5. `fill`:  Fills the input grid with the digit '1' at the calculated square indices.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  five_indices = ofcolor(I, 5)
  shifted_indices = mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0]-1,loc[1]-1),(loc[0]-1,loc[1]),(loc[0]-1,loc[1]+1),(loc[0],loc[1]-1),(loc[0],loc[1]),(loc[0],loc[1]+1),(loc[0]+1,loc[1]-1),(loc[0]+1,loc[1]),(loc[0]+1,loc[1]+1)}, five_indices)
  O = fill(I, 1, merge(shifted_indices))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `ofcolor`: Finds the indices of all cells containing the digit '5'.
2. `mapply`: For each '5' index, generates the indices of all cells within a 3x3 square centered at the '5'.
3. `merge`: Combines all the generated indices.
4. `fill`: Fills the input grid with '1' at the combined indices.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  square = canvas(1, THREE_BY_THREE)
  five_locations = occurrences(I, canvas(5, UNITY))
  squares = mapply(lambda loc: shift(asindices(square), loc), five_locations)
  O = fill(I, 1, merge(squares))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `canvas`: Creates a 3x3 grid filled with the digit '1'.
2. `occurrences`: Finds the locations of all individual '5' digits.
3. `mapply` and `shift`:  For each '5' location, shifts the 3x3 square to have its upper-left corner at the '5' location.
4. `asindices`: Converts the shifted squares into sets of indices.
5. `merge`: Combines the indices of all squares.
6. `fill`: Fills the input grid with '1' at the calculated indices.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == 5:
        for k in range(max(0,i-1),min(len(I),i+2)):
          for l in range(max(0,j-1),min(len(I[0]),j+2)):
            O = fill(O, 1, {(k,l)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
2. If a cell contains '5', it iterates through a 3x3 region centered at that cell, handling boundary conditions.
3. For each cell within the 3x3 region, it fills the corresponding cell in the output grid with '1'.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == 5:
        for x in range(i - 1, i + 2):
          for y in range(j - 1, j + 2):
            if 0 <= x < h and 0 <= y < w:
              O = fill(O, 1, {(x, y)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Creates an empty output grid of the same size as the input.
2. Iterates through each cell of the input grid.
3. If a cell contains '5', it iterates through a 3x3 region around it, ensuring the indices are within the grid boundaries.
4. For each valid index within the 3x3 region, it fills the corresponding cell in the output grid with '1'.


These five versions provide a diverse set of solutions using distinct logic and function combinations from the DSL to achieve the desired transformations.
