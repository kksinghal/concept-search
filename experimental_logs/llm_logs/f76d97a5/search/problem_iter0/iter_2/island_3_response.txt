## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the most common element (presumably the background) and the distinct objects within the input grid. Then, it hollows out each object, retaining only its outline, and fills the interior with the background element.

**Input 0:**

* **Input:** 
```
4 5 4
5 5 5
4 5 4
```
* **Output:**
```
0 4 0
4 4 4
0 4 0
```

**Analysis:** The most common element '5' is identified as the background. The object consisting of '4's is hollowed out, leaving only the outer '4's intact. The interior of the object is then filled with the background element '5'.

**Input 1 & 2:**

The same transformation logic applies to Inputs 1 and 2, with '6' and '9' being the objects and '5' being the background element, respectively.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each utilizing different approaches to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcommon(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), 
               frozenset(
                 frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if (i, j) in box(toindices(obj)))
                 for obj in objs
               )
             )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcommon(I)`:**  Identifies the most common element in the input grid `I`, assumed to be the background.
2. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts distinct objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
3. **`paint(...)`:** Paints the final objects onto a canvas.
    *  **`canvas(bg, shape(I))`:** Creates a new grid of the same size as the input, filled with the background element `bg`.
    * **`frozenset(...)`:** Generates the set of objects to be painted.
       * **`frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if (i, j) in box(toindices(obj)))`:** For each object, keeps only the cells that are part of its outline (`box`).


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcommon(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  hollowed_objs = frozenset(
      recolor(bg, inbox(toindices(obj))) for obj in objs
  )
  return paint(I, hollowed_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcommon(I)`:**  Identifies the background element.
2. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts objects (excluding background).
3. **`hollowed_objs = ...`:**  Creates new objects representing the hollowed interiors.
    *  **`recolor(bg, inbox(toindices(obj)))`:** Fills the `inbox` of each object's indices with the background color.
4. **`paint(I, hollowed_objs)`:**  Paints the hollowed interiors onto the original grid, effectively erasing the object's interior.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcommon(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return cellwise(
      I, 
      paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), mapply(box, objs)), 
      bg
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcommon(I)`:**  Identifies the background element.
2. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts objects.
3. **`cellwise(...)`:**  Compares the original grid with a grid containing only object outlines.
    * **`paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), mapply(box, objs))`:** Creates a grid with background and object outlines.
    * **`bg`:** If the cells don't match (meaning it's not an outline), the background element is used.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcommon(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    I = fill(I, bg, inbox(toindices(obj)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcommon(I)`:**  Identifies the background element.
2. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts objects.
3. **`for obj in objs: ...`:** Iterates through each object.
    * **`I = fill(I, bg, inbox(toindices(obj)))`:**  Fills the `inbox` of each object with the background color directly on the input grid.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcommon(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return paint(
      canvas(bg, shape(I)),
      mapply(compose(partial(recolor, bg), inbox, toindices), objs)
   )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcommon(I)`:** Identifies the background.
2. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Extracts objects.
3. **`paint(...)`:** Paints the final result.
    * **`canvas(bg, shape(I))`:**  Creates a background canvas.
    * **`mapply(...)`:** Applies a series of functions to each object and merges the results.
       * **`compose(...)`:** Chains functions together.
         * **`partial(recolor, bg)`:**  Creates a function that recolors a patch with the background.
         * **`inbox`:** Gets the inbox of a patch.
         * **`toindices`:** Converts a patch to indices.

This version uses function composition and `partial` application for a more functional programming style.
