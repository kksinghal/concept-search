## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to extract the outer frame of each object, removing any internal pixels. The frame retains the original color of the object. 

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input 0:** The object of '5's is reduced to a frame of '4's.
* **Input 1:** The large object of '5's and '6's is reduced to a frame of '6's.
* **Input 2:** Similar to Input 1, the object is reduced to its outer frame, retaining the color '9'.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)  # Find the background color
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Find all objects
  frame = lambda obj: box(obj) & toindices(obj) # Get the frame of the object
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(apply(compose(rbind(recolor, bg), frame), objs))) # Paint the frames onto a blank canvas
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Background:**  Identifies the most frequent color in the grid, assuming it's the background.
2. **Extract Objects:** Identifies all distinct objects within the grid.
3. **Get Frame:**  For each object, this lambda function calculates the intersection of its bounding box and its actual indices, effectively extracting the outer frame.
4. **Paint Frames:** Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background color. It then paints the extracted frames of each object onto this canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  frame = lambda obj:  sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda loc: len(dneighbors(loc) - toindices(obj)) > 0) #Finds cells with at least one direct neighbor outside the object
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(apply(compose(rbind(recolor, bg), frame), objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Background:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Extract Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
3. **Get Frame:** Identifies frame cells by checking if they have at least one direct neighbor that isn't part of the object.
4. **Paint Frames:** Similar to Version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  frame = lambda obj: obj - toobject(inbox(obj), I) #Removes inner cells by subtracting the 'inbox' area from the object
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(apply(frame, objs))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Background:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Extract Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
3. **Get Frame:**  Calculates the difference between the object and the object formed by its 'inbox' area, effectively removing internal pixels and leaving the frame.
4. **Paint Frames:** Similar to Version 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  filled = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), objects(I, T, T, T)) # Fills a blank canvas with all objects
  frame = lambda obj:  sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda loc: index(filled, add(loc, UP)) == 0 or index(filled, add(loc, DOWN)) == 0 or index(filled, add(loc, LEFT)) == 0 or index(filled, add(loc, RIGHT)) == 0) # Checks for empty cells in any of the four directions
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(apply(compose(rbind(recolor, bg), frame), objects(I, T, T, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Background:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Create Filled Canvas:** Creates a canvas filled with '0' and then paints all the objects onto it.
3. **Get Frame:** Iterates through each object's cells and checks if any of its direct neighbors on the 'filled' canvas are '0', indicating a frame cell.
4. **Paint Frames:** Similar to Version 1.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
    def get_frame(obj):
        obj_indices = toindices(obj)
        return frozenset((color(obj), loc) for loc in obj_indices if any(n not in obj_indices for n in dneighbors(loc)))
    return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(apply(get_frame, objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Background:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Extract Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
3. **Get Frame:** Defines a function `get_frame` to extract frame cells. It iterates through the object's indices, checking if any direct neighbor is not part of the object. If so, the cell is considered a frame cell.
4. **Paint Frames:** Similar to Version 1.
