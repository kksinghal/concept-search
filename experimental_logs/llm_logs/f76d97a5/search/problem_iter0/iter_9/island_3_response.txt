## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation replaces the inner cells of each object with the background color while preserving the outline of the object.

**Example:**

**Input:**

```
4 5 4
5 5 5
4 5 4
```

**Output:**

```
0 4 0
4 4 4
0 4 0 
```

Here, the inner '5' of the object formed by '5's is replaced by the background color '4'. The outline of the object remains unchanged.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcommon(I) # Identify background color
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Extract objects excluding background
  return paint(fill(canvas(bg, shape(I)), bg), # Create filled canvas
               merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), delta(toindices(obj))), objs))) # Paint merged outlines
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcommon(I)`**:  Identifies the background color in the input grid `I`.
2. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`**:  Extracts all objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
3. **`fill(canvas(bg, shape(I)), bg)`**: Creates a new canvas filled with the background color and having the same dimensions as the input grid.
4. **`lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), delta(toindices(obj)))`**: Defines a lambda function that takes an object as input and returns its outline with the object's original color.
5. **`merge(apply(..., objs))`**: Applies the lambda function to each object, obtaining their outlines, and merges them into a single set of cells.
6. **`paint(..., ...)`**:  Paints the merged outlines onto the background-filled canvas, resulting in the final output.


**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcommon(I)
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    outlines = frozenset()
    for obj in objs:
      outline = recolor(color(obj), delta(toindices(obj)))
      outlines = combine(outlines, outline)
    return paint(fill(canvas(bg, shape(I)), bg), outlines)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcommon(I)`**:  Identifies the background color in the input grid `I`.
2. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`**:  Extracts all objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
3. **`outlines = frozenset()`**: Initializes an empty set to store object outlines.
4. **`for obj in objs`**: Iterates through each identified object.
5. **`outline = recolor(color(obj), delta(toindices(obj)))`**: For each object, extracts its outline and colors it with the object's original color.
6. **`outlines = combine(outlines, outline)`**:  Adds the calculated outline to the `outlines` set.
7. **`paint(fill(canvas(bg, shape(I)), bg), outlines)`**: Creates a new canvas filled with the background color, paints the collected outlines on it, and returns the final output.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcommon(I) # Identify background color
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Extract objects excluding background
  return cellwise(I, paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)),  # Create canvas & paint objects
                            merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), toindices(obj)), objs))), 
                  bg) # Cellwise comparison with original, replacing non-matches with background
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcommon(I)`**: Identifies the background color in the input grid `I`.
2. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`**:  Extracts all objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
3. **`lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), toindices(obj))`**:  Defines a lambda function to recolor each object with its original color.
4. **`paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(apply(..., objs)))`**: Creates a background-filled canvas and paints the original objects onto it.
5. **`cellwise(I, ..., bg)`**: Performs a cell-by-cell comparison between the original input grid and the painted canvas. If the colors match, the original color is kept. Otherwise, the background color is used, effectively preserving only the object outlines from the input.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcommon(I) # Determine the background color.
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T) # Identify all objects, excluding the background.
  outlines = mapply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), delta(toindices(obj))), objs) # Extract object outlines.
  return paint(fill(canvas(bg, shape(I)), bg, asindices(I)), outlines) # Fill canvas with background and paint outlines.
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcommon(I)`**:  Identifies the background color in the input grid `I`.
2. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`**:  Extracts all objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
3. **`lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), delta(toindices(obj)))`**: Defines a lambda function to extract the outline of an object and recolor it with the object's original color.
4. **`outlines = mapply(..., objs)`**: Applies the lambda function to each object and merges the resulting outlines.
5. **`fill(canvas(bg, shape(I)), bg, asindices(I))`**: Creates a canvas filled with the background color, effectively overwriting the entire canvas.
6. **`paint(..., outlines)`**: Paints the merged object outlines onto the background-filled canvas, resulting in the final output.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcommon(I)  # Find the background color.
    return paint(
        fill(canvas(bg, shape(I)), bg, asindices(I)),  # Create a canvas filled with the background color.
        mapply(
            lambda obj: recolor(
                color(obj), 
                difference(box(obj), toindices(obj))  # Calculate the difference between the bounding box and the object itself, effectively finding the outline.
            ), 
            objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract all objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
        )
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcommon(I)`**:  Identifies the background color in the input grid `I`.
2. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`**:  Extracts all objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
3. **`lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), difference(box(obj), toindices(obj)))`**: Defines a lambda function to calculate the outline of an object by finding the difference between its bounding box and its actual cells. This outline is then recolored with the object's original color.
4. **`mapply(..., ...)`**: Applies the lambda function to each object and merges the resulting outlines.
5. **`fill(canvas(bg, shape(I)), bg, asindices(I))`**: Creates a canvas filled with the background color, effectively overwriting the entire canvas.
6. **`paint(..., ...)`**: Paints the merged object outlines onto the background-filled canvas, resulting in the final output.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
