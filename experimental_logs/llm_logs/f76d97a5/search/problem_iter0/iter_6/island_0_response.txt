## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

1. **Identify Non-Background Objects:** Identify all objects within the grid that are not the background color (the most frequently occurring color).

2. **Create Outlines:**  Generate an outline for each non-background object. The outline consists of the cells directly surrounding the object.

3. **Recolor Outlines:** Color the generated outlines with the color of their corresponding object.

4. **Replace Original Objects:** Replace the original object cells with the background color (or 0 in these examples).


## Program Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Identify non-background objects
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)

  # 2. Get the outline indices for each object
  outlines = mapply(box, objs)

  # 3. Recolor outlines with the color of their corresponding object 
  for obj in objs:
    O = fill(I, color(obj), outlines)

  # 4. Replace original object cells with 0
  O = fill(O, 0, merge(apply(toindices, objs))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. We identify the non-background objects using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. `mapply(box, objs)` applies the `box` function to each object in `objs`, generating a set of outline indices for each object. 
3. We iterate through each object and use `fill(I, color(obj), outlines)` to color the outline indices corresponding to that object with the object's color.
4. Finally, `fill(O, 0, merge(apply(toindices, objs)))` replaces all original object cells with 0.


## Program Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Identify non-background objects
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)

  # 2. Create outlines for each object and paint them
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    outline = box(toindices(obj))
    O = fill(O, color(obj), outline) 

  # 3. Replace original objects with 0
  O = fill(O, 0, merge(apply(toindices, objs)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Similar to version 1, we start by identifying non-background objects.
2. This version iterates through each object and directly calculates its outline using `box(toindices(obj))`. 
3. The outline is then filled with the object's color using `fill(O, color(obj), outline)`.
4. The final step replaces the original object cells with 0.


## Program Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Get the background color
  bg = mostcolor(I)

  # 2. Identify non-background objects and recolor their outlines
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    outline = delta(toindices(obj))
    O = underfill(O, color(obj), outline)

  # 3. Replace all non-background colors with 0
  O = replace(O, bg, 0)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. We begin by identifying the background color using `mostcolor(I)`.
2.  We iterate through each non-background object and use `delta(toindices(obj))` to get the outline indices, which excludes the object itself.
3. `underfill(O, color(obj), outline)` is used to color the outline only if the cell currently contains the background color.
4. In the end, we replace all occurrences of the background color with 0. 


## Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Create a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))

  # 2. Identify non-background objects 
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    # 3.  Paint the object outline onto the canvas
    O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), box(toindices(obj)))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  This version starts by creating a blank canvas filled with 0s using `canvas(0, shape(I))`.
2. We then iterate through each non-background object in the input grid.
3. For each object, `recolor(color(obj), box(toindices(obj)))` generates an outline object with the object's color, which is then painted onto the canvas using `paint`. 


## Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
 # 1. Get background color
 bg = mostcolor(I)

 # 2. Get all indices of non-background colors
 non_bg_indices = difference(asindices(I), ofcolor(I, bg))

 # 3. Create outlines around non-background indices
 outlines = mapply(dneighbors, non_bg_indices)

 # 4. Recolor outlines with corresponding non-background color
 O = I
 for idx in non_bg_indices:
   O = fill(O, index(I, idx), sfilter(outlines, lambda x: manhattan(x, idx) == 1))

 # 5. Replace original non-background colors with 0
 O = fill(O, 0, non_bg_indices)
 return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. We identify the background color.
2. We get all indices that are not the background color using set difference.
3. We create outlines around these indices by finding their direct neighbors.
4. For each non-background index, we recolor its neighboring outline cells with the original color at that index.
5. Finally, we replace the original non-background cells with 0.
