## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces the original object pixels with the background color and then draws a border around the object using the original object color. 

**Example:**

* **Input:** A grid with a '5' object surrounded by a '6' background.
* **Output:** The '5' object is replaced with '6', and a border of '5' is drawn around where the object used to be.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  filled = canvas(bg, shape(I))  # Create a canvas filled with the background color
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  outlines = mapply(box, objs)  # Extract outlines of all objects
  O = paint(filled, recolor(leastcolor(I), merge(outlines)))  # Paint the outlines onto the background canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:** Identifies the background color.
2. **`filled = canvas(bg, shape(I))`:** Creates a new grid filled entirely with the background color.
3. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Identifies all distinct objects within the input grid.
4. **`outlines = mapply(box, objs)`:**  Calculates the outline indices for each object.
5. **`O = paint(filled, recolor(leastcolor(I), merge(outlines)))`:** 
   - `merge(outlines)` combines all object outlines into a single set of indices.
   - `recolor(leastcolor(I), ...)` assigns the least frequent color (the original object color) to the outline indices.
   - `paint(filled, ...)` draws the recolored outlines onto the background-filled canvas.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  O = I  # Start with the original grid
  for obj in objs:
    O = cover(O, obj)  # Replace the object with background
    O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), box(toindices(obj))))  # Paint the outline
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, F)`:**  Identifies all distinct objects.
2. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid as a copy of the input.
3. **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterates through each identified object.
   -  **`O = cover(O, obj)`:**  Replaces the current object's pixels with the background color.
   -  **`O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), box(toindices(obj))))`:**
      -  `toindices(obj)`: Extracts the indices of the object's cells.
      -  `box(...)`: Calculates the outline indices of the object.
      -  `recolor(color(obj), ...)`: Assigns the original object's color to the outline indices.
      -  `paint(O, ...)`: Draws the colored outline onto the output grid.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I)) # Start with a background-filled canvas
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    outline = box(toindices(obj))  # Get the object's outline
    O = underpaint(O, recolor(color(obj), outline)) # Paint only if background
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:** Identifies the background color.
2. **`O = canvas(bg, shape(I))`:**  Creates a new grid filled with the background color.
3. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Iterates through each object in the input grid.
   -  **`outline = box(toindices(obj))`:**  Calculates the outline indices of the object.
   -  **`O = underpaint(O, recolor(color(obj), outline))`:**
      -  `recolor(color(obj), outline)`: Assigns the original object color to the outline indices.
      -  `underpaint(O, ...)`:  Paints the colored outline onto the canvas, but only where the canvas still has the background color. This prevents overwriting previously drawn outlines. 

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I  # Start with the input grid
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), toindices(obj))  # Fill object with background
    O = underfill(O, color(obj), box(toindices(obj)))  # Fill outline only if background
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output as a copy of the input grid.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Iterates through each object.
   -  **`O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), toindices(obj))`:** Replaces the object's pixels with the background color in the output grid.
   -  **`O = underfill(O, color(obj), box(toindices(obj)))`:** 
      -  `box(toindices(obj))` :  Gets the indices of the object's outline.
      -  `underfill(O, color(obj), ...)`: Fills the outline indices with the original object color, but only where the grid currently has the background color.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  outlines = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for idx in toindices(obj):
      if any(bordering(initset(n), I) for n in neighbors(idx)):
        outlines.add((color(obj), idx))  # Add outline with object color
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), frozenset(outlines)) # Paint on a blank canvas
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:** Identifies the background color.
2.  **`objs = objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Identifies all objects in the input grid.
3.  **`outlines = set()`:** Initializes an empty set to store outline cell data.
4.  **`for obj in objs:`:**  Iterates through each object.
    -   **`for idx in toindices(obj):`:** Iterates through each cell index of the object.
        -  **`if any(bordering(initset(n), I) for n in neighbors(idx)):`:** Checks if any neighboring cell of the current cell is on the border of the grid.
            -  **`outlines.add((color(obj), idx))`:** If a neighbor is on the border, add the current cell's index and the object's color to the `outlines` set.
5. **`return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), frozenset(outlines))`:** 
   -  `canvas(bg, shape(I))`: Creates a new grid filled with the background color.
   -  `paint(..., frozenset(outlines))`: Paints the collected outlines onto the blank canvas.


These five versions provide different approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing diversity in logic and DSL function usage.
