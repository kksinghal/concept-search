## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the most common color (background) in the input grid and a secondary color that forms connected shapes. The transformation then recolors all cells of the secondary color that are not on the outer perimeter of their respective shapes to the background color, essentially "hollowing out" the shapes.

**Input 0:**

* Background color: 5
* Secondary color: 4
* Transformation: The inner 4 is replaced with 5, leaving a hollow square.

**Input 1:**

* Background color: 6
* Secondary color: 5
* Transformation: The inner 5s are replaced with 6s, leaving a hollow diamond.

**Input 2:**

* Background color: 9
* Secondary color: 5
* Transformation:  The inner 5s are replaced with 9s, leaving a hollow shape.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each with a detailed explanation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)  # Identify the background color
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)  # Extract objects without background
  for obj in objs:
    outline = box(toindices(obj))  # Find the outline of each object
    to_fill = difference(toindices(obj), outline)  # Cells to fill are those inside the outline
    I = fill(I, bg, to_fill)  # Fill those cells with the background color
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background:**  `bg = mostcolor(I)` finds the most frequent color in the grid, representing the background.
2. **Extract objects:** `objs = objects(I, False, False, True)` extracts all connected components (objects) from the grid, excluding the background.
3. **Iterate and process:** For each object:
   - **Find outline:**  `outline = box(toindices(obj))`  calculates the indices forming the outer boundary of the object.
   - **Find cells to fill:** `to_fill = difference(toindices(obj), outline)` determines the indices of cells within the object but not on the outline.
   - **Fill with background:** `I = fill(I, bg, to_fill)` recolors the identified cells to the background color.
4. **Return modified grid:** The function returns the transformed grid.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  hollow_objs = apply(lambda obj: recolor(bg, difference(toindices(obj), box(toindices(obj)))), objs)
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(hollow_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background & objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Create hollow objects:** `hollow_objs = apply(...)` applies a lambda function to each object:
    - `recolor(bg, ...)` recolors the object with the background color.
    - `difference(toindices(obj), box(toindices(obj)))` selects the cells to recolor, which are those inside the object's bounding box but not part of the box itself. 
3. **Paint on canvas:**
    - `canvas(bg, shape(I))` creates a blank canvas filled with the background color and the same size as the input grid.
    - `paint(..., merge(hollow_objs))` paints the combined set of hollow objects onto the canvas.
4. **Return modified grid:** Returns the transformed grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
    return cellwise(
        I, 
        paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), box(toindices(obj))), objs))),
        bg
    )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background & objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Create outlines:** `apply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), box(toindices(obj))), objs)` creates outlines for each object:
    - `recolor(color(obj), ...)` recolors the outline with the object's original color.
    - `box(toindices(obj))` gets the indices of the object's bounding box.
3. **Paint outlines on canvas:** Similar to Version 2, outlines are painted onto a blank canvas filled with the background color.
4. **Cellwise combination:**  `cellwise(I, ..., bg)` combines the original grid (I) with the canvas containing outlines:
    - If a cell in I matches the corresponding cell on the canvas, the cell's value is kept.
    - Otherwise, the cell is filled with the background color (bg).
5. **Return modified grid:** Returns the transformed grid. 


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    filled_cells = mfilter(objects(I, False, False, True), lambda obj: size(difference(toindices(obj), box(toindices(obj)))) > 0)
    return fill(I, bg, merge(apply(lambda obj: difference(toindices(obj), box(toindices(obj))), filled_cells)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Find objects with fillable cells:** 
    - `filled_cells = mfilter(...)` filters and merges objects based on a condition.
    - `lambda obj: size(difference(toindices(obj), box(toindices(obj)))) > 0` checks if an object has cells within its bounding box that are not part of the box itself.
3. **Find cells to fill:** Similar to Version 1, but only for objects with fillable cells.
4. **Fill cells:** `fill(I, bg, ...)` fills the identified cells with the background color. 
5. **Return modified grid:** Returns the transformed grid. 


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda ind: any(n in delta(toindices(obj)) for n in neighbors(ind)))), objs))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background & objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Identify outline cells:** `apply(lambda obj: ..., objs)` iterates through objects and applies a lambda function:
    - `sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda ind: ...)` filters the object's indices.
    - `lambda ind: any(n in delta(toindices(obj)) for n in neighbors(ind))` checks if any neighbor of an index is part of the object's delta (outside the object but within its bounding box). If so, the index is considered an outline cell.
3. **Recolor outline cells:** `recolor(color(obj), ...)` recolors the identified outline cells with the object's original color.
4. **Paint on canvas:** Similar to Version 2, the recoloured outlines are painted onto a blank canvas filled with the background color.
5. **Return modified grid:** Returns the transformed grid.
