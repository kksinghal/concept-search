## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all three input-output examples involves identifying the most common element (acting as the background), then creating a hollow box around each non-background object using the background element. 

**Input_0:**

- The most common element is '5'.
- A hollow box of '0's is created around the '4' object.

**Input_1:**

- The most common element is '6'.
- A hollow box of '0's is created around the '5' object.

**Input_2:**

- The most common element is '9'.
- A hollow box of '0's is created around the '5' object.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    bg = mostcommon(I)  # Identify the background element
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract non-background objects
    result = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), objs)  # Create a canvas filled with background and paint the objects
    for obj in objs:
        for i, j in box(toindices(obj)):  # Iterate over the outline of each object
            if 0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0]):
                result = fill(result, bg, {(i, j)})  # Fill the outline with the background element
    return result
```

**Explanation:**

1. `bg = mostcommon(I)`: Determines the most common element, which is the background.
2. `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`: Extracts all non-background objects from the grid.
3. `result = paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), objs)`: Creates a canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background element, and paints the extracted objects onto it.
4. The nested loop iterates over each cell on the outline (`box`) of each object.
5. `if 0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0])`: Ensures the cell is within the grid boundaries.
6. `result = fill(result, bg, {(i, j)})`: Fills the current outline cell with the background element.


**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
    bg = mostcommon(I)
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    hollow_objs = frozenset(frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if (i, j) not in inbox(toindices(obj))) for obj in objs)
    return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), hollow_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. Similar to Version 1, we identify the background element and extract non-background objects.
2. `hollow_objs = ...`: This line generates new objects where each object contains only cells not part of its `inbox`. Effectively, this removes the inner cells of each object, making them hollow.
3. Finally, we create a background-filled canvas and paint the hollow objects onto it.


**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    bg = mostcommon(I)
    return fill(I, bg, mapply(box, objects(I, T, F, T)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. We determine the background element.
2. `mapply(box, objects(I, T, F, T))`: This extracts all non-background objects and finds the outline ('box') of each object, merging the results into a single set of indices.
3. Finally, `fill` is used to directly replace the values at the identified outline indices with the background element.


**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    bg = mostcommon(I)
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), mapply(compose(partial(fill, v=bg), box), objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. Determine the background element and extract non-background objects.
2. `compose(partial(fill, v=bg), box)`: This creates a new function that first calculates the 'box' of a given patch and then applies the 'fill' function with the background element to those indices.
3. `mapply` applies this new function to each object, resulting in a set of objects with their outlines filled with the background element.
4. Finally, we paint these modified objects onto a background-filled canvas.


**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    bg = mostcommon(I)
    return cellwise(I, paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), objects(I, T, F, T)), bg)
```

**Explanation:**

1. Identify the background element.
2. `paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), objects(I, T, F, T))`: Creates a canvas with the background element and paints all non-background objects onto it.
3. `cellwise(I, ..., bg)`: Compares the original input grid with the canvas containing only the objects. For matching cells, the original value is kept; for non-matching cells (which are the outlines), the background element is used.


These are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated", each utilizing different approaches and function combinations from the DSL to achieve the desired hollow-box transformation.
