## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently replaces the central element of each object with the background color (most common color) while keeping the outline of the object intact.

**Input_0:** The central '5' in the object of '5's is replaced by '4' (background color).

**Input_1:** The central '5' in the diamond shape of '5's is replaced by '6' (background color).

**Input_2:** The central '5' in the object of '5's is replaced by '9' (background color).


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcommon(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), 
               frozenset(
                 frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if (i, j) in box(toindices(obj)))
                 for obj in objs
               )
             )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background color:** `bg = mostcommon(I)` finds the most common color in the grid.
2. **Extract objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies all objects in the grid (excluding the background).
3. **Create outline objects:** For each object, a new object is created containing only the cells that lie on the outline of the original object. This is done by iterating through the object's cells and checking if they belong to the object's box (outline):
   - `frozenset((v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if (i, j) in box(toindices(obj)))`
4. **Paint outlines:** `paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), ...)` creates a canvas filled with the background color and then paints the outline objects onto it.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcommon(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  hollowed_objs = frozenset(
      recolor(bg, inbox(toindices(obj))) for obj in objs
  )
  return paint(I, hollowed_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background color and objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Create hollow objects:** For each object, a new object is created by recoloring the cells within the object's inbox (inner area) to the background color: 
   - `recolor(bg, inbox(toindices(obj)))`
3. **Paint over original grid:** `paint(I, hollowed_objs)` directly paints the hollow objects onto the original input grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcommon(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return cellwise(
      I, 
      paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), mapply(box, objs)), 
      bg
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background color and objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Create outline grid:** A new grid is created with outlines of all objects drawn on a background canvas: 
   - `paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), mapply(box, objs))`
3. **Combine with original grid:** `cellwise(I, ..., bg)` compares each cell of the original grid with the outline grid. If they match, the original cell value is kept; otherwise, the background color is used.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcommon(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    I = fill(I, bg, inbox(toindices(obj)))
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background color and objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Iterative filling:**  Iterates through each object and directly modifies the input grid by filling its inbox (inner area) with the background color:
   - `I = fill(I, bg, inbox(toindices(obj)))` 
3. **Return modified grid:** The modified input grid is returned as the output.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcommon(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return paint(
      canvas(bg, shape(I)),
      frozenset(recolor(bg, inbox(toindices(obj))) for obj in objs)
   )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background color and objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Generate hollow objects:** Creates a set of "hollow" objects where the inner area (inbox) of each object is filled with the background color.
   - `frozenset(recolor(bg, inbox(toindices(obj))) for obj in objs)`
3. **Paint onto a blank canvas:** A blank canvas of the same size as the input is created and filled with the background color.
    - `canvas(bg, shape(I))`
4. **Paint the hollow objects:** The hollow objects are then painted onto the canvas.
    - `paint(canvas(...), ...)`


Each version employs a different strategy to achieve the same outcome, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
