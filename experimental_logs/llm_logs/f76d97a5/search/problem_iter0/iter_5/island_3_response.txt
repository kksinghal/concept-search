## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on highlighting the outline of objects within the grid while replacing the interior with the background color. Let's break down each example:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The object consisting of '5's is identified.
* The interior '5's are replaced with the background color '4'.
* The outline of the object is preserved, creating a hollow shape.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The object consisting of '5's is identified.
* Interior '5's are replaced with the background color '6'.
* The outline of the object is preserved.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The object consisting of '5's is identified.
* Interior '5's are replaced with the background color '9'.
* The outline is preserved.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcommon(I)  # Identify the background color
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Extract objects, excluding the background
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)),  # Create a canvas filled with background
               mapply(lambda obj: toobject(box(obj), I), objs))  # Paint object outlines with original colors
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify background:** `bg = mostcommon(I)` determines the most frequent color, which represents the background.
2. **Extract objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` isolates objects within the grid, excluding the background.
3. **Create canvas:** `canvas(bg, shape(I))` generates a new grid filled entirely with the background color and having the same dimensions as the input grid.
4. **Outline extraction:** For each object:
   - `box(obj)` identifies the indices forming the object's outline.
   - `toobject(box(obj), I)` retrieves the original colors of those outline indices from the input grid.
5. **Paint outlines:** `mapply` applies the outline extraction process to all objects and merges the results. Finally, `paint` draws these outlines onto the background canvas.

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcommon(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  return cellwise(I, paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), mapply(box, objs)), bg)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Background and Objects:** Similar to Version 1, we find the background color and extract objects.
2. **Outline Canvas:**  We create a canvas filled with the background color and draw the outlines of all objects on it using `paint(canvas(...), mapply(box, objs))`.
3. **Selective Replacement:**  `cellwise` compares the original grid (I) with the outline canvas. If the colors match (meaning it's an outline cell), the original color is kept. Otherwise, the background color is used, effectively erasing the object's interior.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcommon(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    I = fill(I, bg, delta(obj))  # Fill the delta of each object with the background color
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Background and Objects:** Same as Version 1 and 2.
2. **Iterative Filling:** We iterate through each identified object. For each object:
   -  `delta(obj)`  calculates the indices inside the object's bounding box but not part of the outline.
   -  `fill(I, bg, delta(obj))` fills those "delta" indices with the background color, effectively hollowing out the object.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcommon(I)
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), 
                 merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), box(obj)), objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Preparation:** Similar to previous versions, we identify the background color and extract objects.
2. **Outline Recoloring:** For each object: 
   - `color(obj)` gets the object's color.
   - `box(obj)` determines the outline indices.
   - `recolor(color(obj), box(obj))` creates a new object representing the outline, filled with the object's original color.
3. **Merging & Painting:** `apply` applies the recoloring to all objects. `merge` combines the resulting outlines. Finally, `paint` draws them onto the background canvas.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcommon(I)
    objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
    return fill(I, bg, merge(apply(lambda obj: difference(backdrop(obj), box(obj)), objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Background and Objects:**  We find the background and extract the objects.
2. **Interior Identification:** For each object:
   - `backdrop(obj)` gets all indices within the object's bounding box.
   - `box(obj)` gets the indices of the outline.
   - `difference(backdrop(obj), box(obj))` finds the indices inside the object but not on the outline.
3. **Filling the Interior:** `merge` combines the interior indices from all objects.  Finally, `fill` uses these combined indices to replace the interior colors with the background color.
