## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the "frame" of each connected object in the grid and replacing the object's interior with the background color. 

**Example:**

Input:

```
1 1 1 0
1 0 1 0
1 1 1 0
```

Output:

```
0 1 0 0
1 0 1 0
0 1 0 0
```

Here, the '1's form a single connected object. The transformation identifies its outer boundary (the frame) and replaces the inner '1' with the background color '0'.


## Code Generation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)  # Identify background color
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Identify all connected objects
  frames = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: box(obj) - toindices(obj)) # Extract frame of each object
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(frames)) # Paint frames onto blank canvas
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`bg = mostcolor(I)`**: Determines the background color by identifying the most frequent color in the grid.
2.  **`objs = objects(I, T, T, T)`**:  Identifies all connected objects in the grid, considering diagonal connections and excluding the background.
3. **`frames = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: box(obj) - toindices(obj))`**:  For each object, this calculates the difference between its bounding box (`box(obj)`) and its actual cell indices (`toindices(obj)`), effectively extracting the frame. 
4.  **`return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(frames))`**: Creates a blank canvas (`canvas(bg, shape(I))`) filled with the background color and paints the merged frames (`merge(frames)`) onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  def is_frame(obj):
    return sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda loc: any(index(I, n) != bg for n in neighbors(loc) if 0 <= n[0] < len(I) and 0 <= n[1] < len(I[0])))
  frames = mfilter(objs, is_frame)
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(frames)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`bg = mostcolor(I)`**:  Determines the background color.
2.  **`objs = objects(I, T, T, T)`**:  Identifies all connected objects.
3.  **`def is_frame(obj): ...`**:  This function determines if a cell within an object is part of its frame. It checks if any of the cell's neighbors have a different color than the object's color.
4.  **`frames = mfilter(objs, is_frame)`**: Applies the `is_frame` function to each object to extract its frame.
5.  **`return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(frames))`**:  Paints the extracted frames onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
    frames = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: sfilter(obj, lambda cell: len({index(I, n) for n in neighbors(cell[1]) if 0 <= n[0] < len(I) and 0 <= n[1] < len(I[0])}) > 1))
    return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(frames))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`**:  Determines the background color.
2. **`objs = objects(I, T, T, T)`**:  Identifies all connected objects.
3. **`frames = mfilter(objs, lambda obj: ...)`**: This line extracts the frame of each object by filtering for cells that have neighbors with different colors. It does this by:
    -  Iterating through each cell in the object (`lambda cell: ...`).
    -  Getting the colors of its neighboring cells (`index(I, n) for n in neighbors(cell[1])`).
    -  Checking if there are more than one unique color among the neighbors (`len({...}) > 1`).
4. **`return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(frames))`**:  Paints the extracted frames onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  filled = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), objects(I, T, T, T))  # Reconstruct objects on blank canvas
  frames = objects(cellwise(I, filled, bg), T, T, T)  # Find differences as potential frames
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(frames))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`**: Determines the background color.
2. **`filled = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), objects(I, T, T, T))`**: Creates a blank canvas and paints all connected objects onto it, effectively reconstructing the objects without any background interference.
3. **`frames = objects(cellwise(I, filled, bg), T, T, T)`**:  Compares the original grid (`I`) with the reconstructed grid (`filled`) cell by cell. If the colors match, it uses the background color (`bg`), highlighting the differences which represent the frames. 
4. **`return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(frames))`**: Paints the identified frames onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
    def is_frame(obj):
        return {(color(obj), loc) for loc in delta(toindices(obj))}
    frames = mapply(is_frame, objs)
    return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), frames)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`**: Determines the background color.
2. **`objs = objects(I, T, T, T)`**: Identifies all connected objects.
3. **`def is_frame(obj): ...`**:  This function, for a given object:
    - Calculates the indices surrounding the object (`delta(toindices(obj))`).
    - Creates a set of tuples where each tuple represents a frame cell: (object color, location).
4. **`frames = mapply(is_frame, objs)`**:  Applies `is_frame` to each object to get its frame, and merges the results.
5. **`return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), frames)`**: Paints the combined frames onto a blank canvas.
