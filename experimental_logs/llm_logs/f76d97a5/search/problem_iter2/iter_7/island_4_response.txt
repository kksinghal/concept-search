## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in all examples follows this logic:

1. **Identify Objects:** Treat each group of connected digits with the same value as a distinct object.
2. **Create a Frame:**  Construct a frame around each object. The frame occupies the cells immediately outside the object's boundary.
3. **Paint the Frame:** Fill the frame cells with the background color (most common color in the grid). Leave the original object untouched.

**Example:**

Input_0:
```
4 8 4
8 8 8
4 8 4
```

Transformation:

- Objects: Two objects, one of '4's and one of '8's.
- Frames: A frame is created around each object.
- Painting: The frame cells are painted with the background color, which is '8'.

Output_0:
```
0 4 0
4 4 4
0 4 0 
```

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))  # Create canvas with background color
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True): # Iterate through objects
    frame = difference(outbox(toindices(obj)),toindices(obj)) # Define the frame indices
    O = paint(O, toobject(frame, I)) # Paint the frame with background color
  return paint(O,asobject(I)) # Paint the original objects back onto the canvas
```

**Explanation:**

1. `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`: Creates a new grid filled with the background color and the same dimensions as the input.
2. `for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):`: Iterates over each object identified in the input grid.
3. `frame = difference(outbox(toindices(obj)),toindices(obj))`: Calculates the frame indices by finding the difference between the outbox and the object itself.
4. `O = paint(O, toobject(frame, I))`: Paints the frame onto the canvas using the background color.
5. `return paint(O,asobject(I))`: Paints the original objects back onto the canvas, ensuring they are not overwritten by the frame.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), difference(outbox(toindices(obj)),toindices(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objs = objects(I, True, False, True)`: Identifies all objects within the input grid.
2. `O = I`: Initializes the output grid as a copy of the input.
3. `for obj in objs:`:  Iterates through each identified object.
4. `O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), difference(outbox(toindices(obj)),toindices(obj)))`:  For each object, it calculates the 'outbox' (the perimeter surrounding the object), then subtracts the object's indices to get only the frame. Finally, it fills these frame indices with the background color in the output grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    O = underpaint(paint(O, obj), difference(outbox(toindices(obj)),toindices(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`: Initializes the output grid (`O`) as a blank canvas filled with the most common color from the input grid (`I`).
2. `for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):`: Iterates over each object detected in the input grid.
3. `O = underpaint(paint(O, obj), difference(outbox(toindices(obj)),toindices(obj)))`: This line performs the core logic:
    - `paint(O, obj)`: First, the current object is painted onto the canvas (`O`).
    - `difference(outbox(toindices(obj)),toindices(obj))`:  This calculates the frame around the object by finding the difference between the object's 'outbox' and the object itself.
    - `underpaint(..., ...)`: Finally, `underpaint` is used to paint the calculated frame with the background color, but only where the canvas is currently filled with the background color. This ensures that the object itself is not overwritten.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  background = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(background, shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    indices = toindices(obj)
    for i, j in indices:
      for di, dj in ((-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)):
        new_i, new_j = i + di, j + dj
        if (new_i, new_j) not in indices and 0 <= new_i < len(I) and 0 <= new_j < len(I[0]):
          O = fill(O, background, {(new_i, new_j)})
  return paint(O,asobject(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `background = mostcolor(I)`: Stores the background color for later use.
   - `O = canvas(background, shape(I))`: Creates a canvas of the same size as the input, filled with the background color.
2. **Object Iteration**: `for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):`:  Loops through each distinct object in the input.
3. **Frame Drawing**:
   - `indices = toindices(obj)`: Gets the coordinates of all cells belonging to the current object.
   - `for i, j in indices:`:  Iterates over each cell of the object.
   - `for di, dj in ((-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)):`:  Checks the four immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) of each cell.
   - `new_i, new_j = i + di, j + dj`: Calculates the neighbor's coordinates.
   - `if (new_i, new_j) not in indices and 0 <= new_i < len(I) and 0 <= new_j < len(I[0]):`: Checks if the neighbor is:
     - Not part of the object.
     - Within the grid's boundaries.
   - `O = fill(O, background, {(new_i, new_j)})`: If all conditions are met, the neighbor cell is filled with the background color, effectively creating the frame.
4. **Object Restoration**: `return paint(O,asobject(I))` :  The original object from the input is painted back onto the canvas, ensuring it is not overwritten by the frame.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for cell in obj:
      i, j = cell[1]
      for di in range(-1, 2):
        for dj in range(-1, 2):
          if (di != 0 or dj != 0) and 0 <= i + di < len(I) and 0 <= j + dj < len(I[0]) and (I[i + di][j + dj] == mostcolor(I) or (i+di,j+dj) not in toindices(obj)):
            O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(i + di, j + dj)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objs = objects(I, True, False, True)`:  Identifies all distinct objects in the input grid.
2. `O = I`:  Initializes the output grid (`O`) as a copy of the input grid (`I`).
3. `for obj in objs:`: Iterates through each identified object.
4. `for cell in obj:`:  Iterates through each cell belonging to the current object.
5. `i, j = cell[1]`: Extracts the row (`i`) and column (`j`) indices of the current cell.
6. `for di in range(-1, 2):`:  Loops from -1 to 1 (representing offsets in the row direction).
7. `for dj in range(-1, 2):`:  Loops from -1 to 1 (representing offsets in the column direction).
8. `if (di != 0 or dj != 0) and 0 <= i + di < len(I) and 0 <= j + dj < len(I[0]) and (I[i + di][j + dj] == mostcolor(I) or (i+di,j+dj) not in toindices(obj)):`:  This complex condition checks:
    - If the current offset (`di`, `dj`) is not (0, 0) (i.e., not the cell itself).
    - If applying the offset results in valid row and column indices within the grid boundaries.
    - If the neighboring cell at the calculated offset is either the background color or does not belong to the current object.
9.  `O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(i + di, j + dj)})`: If all conditions are met, it fills the neighboring cell with the background color. This effectively creates the frame around the object.
10. `return O`: Returns the modified grid as the output.
