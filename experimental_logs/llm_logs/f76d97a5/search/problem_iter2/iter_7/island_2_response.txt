## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to be performing the following:

1. **Identify objects:** It identifies connected regions of the same digit within the grid. 
2. **Create a "border" around objects:** For each object, it constructs a border of 0s around the object, essentially outlining it. 
3. **Retain only the border:** The final output only contains the constructed 0-border, while the original object digits are removed.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Initialize output grid with 0s
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), delta(obj))) # Paint the delta (border) of each object with its original color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize output:** `canvas(0, shape(I))` creates an output grid of the same size as the input, filled with 0s.
2. **Iterate over objects:** `for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):` iterates over each object (connected region of the same digit) in the input grid.
3. **Paint the border:** `paint(O, recolor(color(obj), delta(obj)))` does the following:
    - `delta(obj)` calculates the indices forming the border of the current object.
    - `recolor(color(obj), delta(obj))` creates a new object representing the border, using the original object's color.
    - `paint(O, ...)` paints this border object onto the output grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    O = fill(O, 0, toindices(obj)) # Fill the object itself with 0s
    O = underfill(O, color(obj), box(obj)) # Fill the bounding box with object color, but only where it was originally background
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over objects:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Fill object with 0s:** `fill(O, 0, toindices(obj))` replaces the object itself with 0s in the output grid.
3. **Fill bounding box conditionally:** `underfill(O, color(obj), box(obj))` fills the bounding box of the object with the object's color. However, `underfill` only paints over cells that were originally the background color, effectively creating the border. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    for other_obj in objs:
      if other_obj != obj and adjacent(obj, other_obj):
        O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), intersection(box(obj), delta(other_obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects and initialize output:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Iterate over object pairs:** Nested loops iterate over all pairs of distinct objects.
3. **Conditional border painting:** For each object pair, if they are adjacent:
    - `intersection(box(obj), delta(other_obj))` finds the border indices of the second object that overlap with the bounding box of the first object.
    - It then recolors this overlapping border with the first object's color and paints it onto the output.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    surrounding = difference(neighbors(centerofmass(obj)), toindices(obj)) # Find neighboring indices not part of the object
    O = fill(O, 0, toindices(obj)) # Replace object with 0s
    O = underfill(O, color(obj), surrounding) # Fill surrounding cells with object's color if they were originally background
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Find surrounding cells:** `difference(neighbors(centerofmass(obj)), toindices(obj))` identifies cells directly adjacent to the object but not part of it.
3. **Fill object and surrounding:** Similar to version 2, it first replaces the object with 0s and then uses `underfill` to conditionally color the surrounding cells, effectively creating the border. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)) # Initialize output with background color
  for obj in objects(I, T, T, T):
    border = difference(box(obj), toindices(obj)) # Find border indices
    for i, j in border:
      if any((i + di, j + dj) in toindices(obj) for di, dj in [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0)]): # Check if the border cell is adjacent to the object
        O = paint(O, {(color(obj), (i, j))}) # Paint the border cell only if adjacent to the object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize output with background:** `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates the output grid filled with the input's background color.
2. **Iterate over objects and border cells:** Similar to previous versions, it iterates over objects. Then, for each object, it iterates over its border cells.
3. **Conditional painting:** It checks if each border cell is directly adjacent to the object. Only if it is, the border cell is painted with the object's color.
