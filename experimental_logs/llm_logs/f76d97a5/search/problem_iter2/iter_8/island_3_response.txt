## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected components) within the input grid and outlining them by replacing the background cells surrounding each object with zeros. 

**Input_0:**
- The central "8" object is surrounded by "4"s, which are replaced by "0"s.

**Input_1:**
- The "8" object in the center is surrounded by "6"s, which are replaced by "0"s.

**Input_2:**
- The "8" object is surrounded by "9"s, which are replaced by "0"s.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)  # Identify the background color
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(0, delta(toindices(obj))), objects(I, False, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `mostcolor(I)`: Identifies the background color.
2. `objects(I, False, False, True)`: Extracts all objects (excluding the background) from the input grid.
3. `apply(lambda obj: recolor(0, delta(toindices(obj))), ...)`: For each object:
    - `toindices(obj)`: Gets the indices of the object's cells.
    - `delta(...)`:  Finds the indices surrounding the object.
    - `recolor(0, ...)`: Colors these surrounding indices with 0.
4. `merge(...)`: Merges the outlines of all objects.
5. `canvas(bg, shape(I))`: Creates a canvas filled with the background color and the same shape as the input grid.
6. `paint(..., ...)`: Paints the merged outlines onto the canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return apply(lambda i_row: tuple(0 if any((i_row[0], j) in apply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), objects(I, False, False, True))) else v for j, v in enumerate(i_row[1])), enumerate(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, False, False, True)`: Extracts all objects (excluding the background).
2. `apply(lambda obj: delta(toindices(obj)), ...)`: For each object, it finds the surrounding indices.
3. The outer `apply` iterates through each row and cell, replacing the cell with "0" if its index is present in any of the objects' surrounding indices.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(0, difference(outbox(toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))), objects(I, False, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, False, False, True)`: Extracts all objects.
2. `apply(lambda obj: ..., ...)`: For each object:
   - `outbox(toindices(obj))`: Finds indices forming a bounding box around the object, including the object itself.
   - `difference(..., toindices(obj))`: Removes the object's indices, leaving only the surrounding outline indices.
   - `recolor(0, ...)`: Colors the outline indices with 0.
3. `merge(...)`: Merges outlines of all objects.
4. `paint(I, ...)`: Paints the merged outlines onto the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return apply(lambda row_index, row: tuple(0 if any(index(I, (ni, nj)) != mostcolor(I) and (ni, nj) != (row_index, col_index) for ni, nj in neighbors((row_index, col_index))) else cell for col_index, cell in enumerate(row)), enumerate(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. This program iterates through each cell in the grid using nested `apply` functions.
2. `neighbors((row_index, col_index))`: For each cell, it gets the indices of its neighboring cells.
3. For each neighbor, it checks if its value is different from the background color and if the neighbor's index is not the same as the current cell's index.
4. If both conditions are true for any neighbor, it means the current cell is bordering an object, and it's replaced with "0".

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)
  return tuple(tuple(0 if any((i,j) in delta(toindices(obj)) for obj in objs) else I[i][j] for j in range(width(I))) for i in range(height(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, False, False, True)`: Extracts all objects from the grid.
2. It iterates through each cell in the grid using nested loops.
3. `delta(toindices(obj))`: For each object, it gets the indices surrounding the object.
4. It checks if the current cell's index is present in any of the objects' surrounding indices.
5. If the index is found, the cell is replaced with "0"; otherwise, it retains its original value from the input grid.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformation using various DSL functions and logic. Each version offers a unique combination of functions, showcasing the flexibility and diversity of the DSL.
