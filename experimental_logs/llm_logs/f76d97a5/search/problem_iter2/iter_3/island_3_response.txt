## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

**For each cell in the grid:**

1. **Check its direct neighbors (up, down, left, right).** 
2. **If ANY neighbor has the same value as the background color, keep the cell's original color.**
3. **If ALL neighbors have a different color than the background, change the cell's color to the background color.**

Essentially, the transformation highlights cells that are on the "edge" of their respective objects by keeping their original color, while cells fully enclosed within their object are replaced with the background color.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct program versions ("Program_to_be_generated") in the provided DSL, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  return cellwise(I, apply(lambda row: tuple(bg if all(index(I, ((i + k) % len(I), j)) != bg for k in [-1, 0, 1] if 0 <= i + k < len(I)) else row[j] for j in range(len(row))), enumerate(I)), bg)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:**  Identifies the background color.
2. **`enumerate(I)`:** Iterates through each row of the input grid `I` with its index.
3. **`apply(lambda row: ...)`:** Applies a function to each row.
4. **`for j in range(len(row))`:**  Iterates through each cell in the row.
5. **`index(I, ((i + k) % len(I), j)) != bg ...)`:** Checks if all vertical neighbors within the grid boundaries are different from the background color. 
6. **`bg if ... else row[j]`:**  If all neighbors differ from the background, set the cell to the background color; otherwise, keep the original cell color.
7. **`cellwise(I, ..., bg)`:** Constructs the final grid by comparing the original grid `I` with the transformed grid, using the background color as the fallback value.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), asobject(apply(lambda row: tuple((v, (i, j)) for j, v in enumerate(row) if any(index(I, ((i + k) % len(I), j)) == bg for k in [-1, 0, 1] if 0 <= i + k < len(I))), enumerate(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:** Identifies the background color.
2. **`enumerate(I)`:**  Iterates through each row with its index.
3. **`apply(lambda row: ...)`:** Applies a function to each row.
4. **`for j, v in enumerate(row)`:** Iterates through each cell with its value.
5. **`index(I, ((i + k) % len(I), j)) == bg ...)`:**  Checks if any vertical neighbor within grid boundaries has the background color.
6. **`(v, (i, j)) if ...`:**  Keeps the cell's color and index if any neighbor matches the background.
7. **`asobject(...)`:**  Converts the collected cells into an object.
8. **`paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), ...)`:** Creates a canvas filled with the background color and paints the extracted object onto it. 


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    return paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(color(obj), sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda ind: any(n in delta(toindices(obj)) for n in dneighbors(ind)))), objects(I, False, False, True))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:**  Identifies the background color.
2. **`objects(I, False, False, True)`:** Extracts objects from the grid, excluding the background.
3. **`apply(lambda obj: ...)`:**  Applies a function to each object.
4. **`sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda ind: ...)`:** Filters indices of the object.
5. **`any(n in delta(toindices(obj)) for n in dneighbors(ind))`:** Checks if any direct neighbor of the index is outside the object's boundary.
6. **`recolor(color(obj), ...)`:**  Recolors the filtered indices with the object's original color.
7. **`merge(...)`:**  Merges the transformed objects.
8. **`paint(canvas(bg, shape(I)), ...)`:**  Creates a canvas filled with the background and paints the merged objects onto it.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    return cellwise(I, apply(lambda row: tuple(v if any((i == 0) or (i == len(I) - 1) or (j == 0) or (j == len(row) - 1) or (index(I, (i + k, j)) == bg) or (index(I, (i, j + l)) == bg) for k in [-1, 1] for l in [-1, 1]) else bg for j, v in enumerate(row)), enumerate(I)), bg)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:** Identifies the background color.
2.  **`enumerate(I)`:** Iterates through rows with indices.
3.  **`apply(lambda row: ...)`:** Applies a function to each row.
4.  **`for j, v in enumerate(row)`:** Iterates through each cell with its value and column index.
5.  **`any((i == 0) or ...)`:**  Checks if the cell is on the grid border or if any horizontal or vertical neighbor matches the background color.
6.  **`v if ... else bg`:** Keeps the original cell value if on the edge or near the background, otherwise changes it to the background color.
7.  **`cellwise(I, ..., bg)`:**  Constructs the final grid by comparing the original with the transformed grid, using the background color as fallback.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  return tuple(tuple(bg if all((0 < i < h - 1) and (0 < j < w - 1) and I[i+k][j] != bg and I[i][j+l] != bg for k in [-1, 1] for l in [-1, 1]) else I[i][j] for j in range(w)) for i in range(h))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:** Identifies the background color.
2.  **`h, w = len(I), len(I[0])`:**  Gets the height and width of the grid.
3.  **`for i in range(h)`:** Iterates through rows.
4.  **`for j in range(w)`:** Iterates through columns.
5.  **`all((0 < i < h - 1) and ...)`:**  Checks if the cell is not on any border and all its horizontal and vertical neighbors have a different color than the background. 
6.  **`bg if ... else I[i][j]`:**  If all conditions are met, set the cell to the background color; otherwise, retain the original cell color.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
