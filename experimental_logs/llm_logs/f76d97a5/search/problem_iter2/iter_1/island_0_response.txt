## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to highlight the 'cross' shape formed by the least frequent color in the input grid, replacing all other colors with the most frequent (background) color.

**Input_0:**
- The least frequent color is '8'. 
- The transformation replaces all '4's with '0' (most frequent), while keeping the '8's to highlight the cross shape.

**Input_1 & Input_2:**
-  Follow the same logic. The least frequent colors ('6' and '9' respectively) form the cross shape, and all other colors are replaced by the most frequent color ('8'). 


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return replace(replace(I, mostcolor(I), 0), leastcolor(I), mostcolor(I)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background and Least Frequent Colors:**  `mostcolor(I)` and `leastcolor(I)` identify the most and least frequent colors respectively.
2. **Temporary Replacement:**  `replace(I, mostcolor(I), 0)` replaces the background color with '0' temporarily. This ensures that the least frequent color, if it was the background initially, doesn't get replaced in the next step.
3. **Highlight the Cross:** `replace(..., leastcolor(I), mostcolor(I))` replaces all values except the least frequent color (now easily identifiable) with the original background color, effectively highlighting the cross.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = partition(I)  # Partition grid into objects based on color
  cross = argmin(objs, size) # Find the object with the smallest size (the cross)
  return paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), cross) # Paint the cross on a canvas of the background color
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition into Objects:** `partition(I)` divides the grid into objects, grouping cells with the same color.
2. **Identify the Cross:** `argmin(objs, size)` finds the object with the fewest cells, representing the cross formed by the least frequent color.
3. **Create a Blank Canvas:** `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` generates a grid of the background color with the same dimensions as the input.
4. **Paint the Cross:** `paint(..., cross)` overlays the identified cross object onto the blank canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  lc = leastcolor(I) # Identify the least common color
  return tuple(tuple(v if v == lc else mostcolor(I) for v in row) for row in I) # Replace all non-cross colors row by row
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Least Frequent Color:** `leastcolor(I)` identifies the color forming the cross.
2. **Iterate and Replace:** The code iterates through each row and cell, replacing any value that doesn't match the least frequent color with the background color.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), leastcolor(I), ofcolor(I, leastcolor(I)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Background and Cross Colors:** `mostcolor(I)` and `leastcolor(I)` find the most and least frequent colors.
2. **Create Background Canvas:** `canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))` creates a grid filled with the background color.
3. **Find Cross Indices:** `ofcolor(I, leastcolor(I))` gets the indices of all cells with the least frequent color (the cross).
4. **Fill the Cross:** `fill(..., leastcolor(I), ...)` fills the background canvas with the least frequent color at the identified cross indices.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  lc = leastcolor(I)
  return tuple(tuple(lc if (i, j) in ofcolor(I, lc) else mostcolor(I) for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(I))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Least Frequent Color:**  `lc = leastcolor(I)` stores the least frequent color.
2. **Iterate and Compare:** The code iterates through each cell, checking if its index is present in the set of indices obtained from  `ofcolor(I, lc)`. If the index is present, it means the cell is part of the cross and retains its original color (lc). Otherwise, it's replaced with the background color.

These five versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and power of the provided DSL.
