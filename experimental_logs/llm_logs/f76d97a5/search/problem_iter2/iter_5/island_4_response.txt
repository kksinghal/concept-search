## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

**General Rule:** The transformation aims to isolate the "corners" of each connected object in the grid. A corner is defined as a cell belonging to an object that is only connected to one other cell of the same object.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The input shows a single object (represented by the digit '8') with four corner cells. The output correctly identifies and keeps these corner cells while replacing the rest with the background color ('0').

* **Input_1:** This input presents a more complex object with multiple corners. Again, the output accurately identifies and retains only the corner cells of this object.

* **Input_2:** Similar to Input_1, this example features a complex object with several corners. The transformation successfully isolates these corners while replacing non-corner cells with the background color.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions that achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve_corner_isolation(I):
    objs = objects(I, F, F, T)
    corners = mapply(lambda obj: sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda loc: len(intersection(toindices(obj), dneighbors(loc))) == 1), objs)
    O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), merge(corners))
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, F, F, T)`**: Identifies all distinct objects in the input grid (`I`) excluding the background.
2. **`corners = mapply(...)`**: 
    - For each object (`obj`) in `objs`, it finds the indices of its corner cells. 
    - A corner cell is defined as having only one directly adjacent neighbor (`dneighbors`) belonging to the same object.
3. **`O = paint(canvas(...), ...)`**: 
    - Creates a blank canvas (`canvas`) of the same size and background color as the input grid.
    - Paints the merged set of corner indices (`merge(corners)`) onto this canvas.
4. **`return O`**: Returns the output grid with only the corner cells painted.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve_corner_isolation(I):
    O = I
    for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):
        for i, j in toindices(obj):
            if len(intersection(toindices(obj), dneighbors((i, j)))) == 1:
                continue
            else:
                O = fill(O, mostcolor(I), {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`**: Initializes the output grid (`O`) as a copy of the input grid (`I`).
2. **`for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):`**: Iterates through each object (excluding background) in the input grid.
3. **`for i, j in toindices(obj):`**: Iterates through each cell within the current object.
4. **`if len(intersection(toindices(obj), dneighbors((i, j)))) == 1:`**: Checks if the cell has only one neighbor belonging to the same object (i.e., it's a corner). If true, it skips to the next iteration.
5. **`else:`**: If the cell is not a corner, it fills that cell in the output grid (`O`) with the background color (`mostcolor(I)`).
6. **`return O`**: Returns the modified output grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve_corner_isolation(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):
    for loc in toindices(obj):
      if sum((loc in toindices(obj) for loc in dneighbors(loc))) == 1:
        O = paint(O, {(index(I, loc), loc)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`**: Creates a blank canvas (`O`) with the same dimensions and background color as the input grid (`I`).
2. **`for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):`**: Iterates over each object in the input grid, excluding the background.
3. **`for loc in toindices(obj):`**: Iterates over each cell location within the current object.
4. **`if sum((loc in toindices(obj) for loc in dneighbors(loc))) == 1:`**:  This line checks if the current cell is a corner by counting the number of its direct neighbors that also belong to the same object. If the sum is 1, it means the cell is a corner. 
5. **`O = paint(O, {(index(I, loc), loc)})`**: If the cell is a corner, it paints the corner cell onto the output canvas `O` using its original color from the input grid (`index(I, loc)`).
6. **`return O`**: Returns the final output canvas `O`, which will contain only the corner cells of the objects.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve_corner_isolation(I):
  corners = set()
  for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):
    corner_candidates = toindices(obj)
    for loc in corner_candidates:
      if sum((loc in toindices(obj) for loc in dneighbors(loc))) != 1:
        corner_candidates = corner_candidates - {loc}
    corners.update(corner_candidates)
  O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), {(index(I, loc), loc) for loc in corners})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`corners = set()`**: Initializes an empty set `corners` to store the corner cell locations.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):`**: Iterates over each object in the input grid, excluding the background.
3. **`corner_candidates = toindices(obj)`**:  Stores all cell indices of the current object in the `corner_candidates` set.
4. **`for loc in corner_candidates:`**: Iterates through each cell location in the `corner_candidates` set.
5. **`if sum((loc in toindices(obj) for loc in dneighbors(loc))) != 1:`**: This condition checks if the cell at the current location is *not* a corner (i.e., it has more than one neighbor belonging to the same object).
6. **`corner_candidates = corner_candidates - {loc}`**: If the cell is not a corner, it is removed from the `corner_candidates` set.
7. **`corners.update(corner_candidates)`**: After processing all cell locations within an object, the remaining locations in `corner_candidates` (which are confirmed corners) are added to the `corners` set.
8. **`O = paint(canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I)), {(index(I, loc), loc) for loc in corners})`**:  
   - Creates a blank canvas (`canvas`) with the same size and background color as the input grid.
   - Paints the confirmed `corners` onto the canvas with their original colors from the input grid (`index(I, loc)`).
9. **`return O`**: Returns the final output canvas `O`.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve_corner_isolation(I):
    def is_corner(obj, loc):
        return len(intersection(toindices(obj), dneighbors(loc))) == 1
    
    O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):
        for loc in toindices(obj):
            if is_corner(obj, loc):
                O = paint(O, {(index(I, loc), loc)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def is_corner(obj, loc): ...`**: Defines a helper function `is_corner` to check if a given cell location (`loc`) within an object (`obj`) is a corner.
2. **`O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`**:  Creates a blank canvas (`O`) of the same dimensions and background color as the input grid (`I`).
3. **`for obj in objects(I, F, F, T):`**: Iterates over each object in the input grid (excluding the background).
4. **`for loc in toindices(obj):`**: Iterates over each cell location within the current object.
5. **`if is_corner(obj, loc):`**: Calls the `is_corner` function to check if the current cell is a corner. 
6. **`O = paint(O, {(index(I, loc), loc)})`**:  If the cell is a corner, it paints it onto the output canvas (`O`) with its original color from the input grid (`index(I, loc)`). 
7. **`return O`**: Returns the final output canvas (`O`).

These five program versions all implement the corner isolation transformation, showcasing different approaches and function combinations possible within the DSL. Each version aims for clarity and efficiency while demonstrating the flexibility of the provided DSL for spatial reasoning tasks.
