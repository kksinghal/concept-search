## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

1. **Identify the non-background color:** Determine the color that represents the object in the grid (i.e., the color that is not the background color).
2. **Outline the object:** Create an outline around the object by identifying the outermost layer of cells with the object color.
3. **Fill the outline with background color:**  Replace the original object cells with the background color, leaving only the outline intact. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Version 1 (Inspired by Program_B's iterative approach but using `delta` for efficiency):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(grid, other(palette(grid), bg)), grid)
  outline = toindices(obj)
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(grid)), recolor(bg, outline.union(delta(outline))))

```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(grid)`:**  Identifies the background color.
2. **`obj = toobject(ofcolor(grid, other(palette(grid), bg)), grid)`:** Extracts the object (non-background color) from the grid.
3. **`outline = toindices(obj)`:**  Gets the indices of the object's cells.
4. **`return paint(canvas(bg, shape(grid)), recolor(bg, outline.union(delta(outline))))`:** Creates a new grid filled with the background color and paints the outline (and the cells inside the object) with the background color.

**Version 2 (Using `objects` and filtering for objects adjacent to background):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  objs = objects(grid, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  outline_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: adjacent(obj, toobject(ofcolor(grid, bg), grid)))
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(grid)), merge(outline_objs))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(grid)`:**  Identifies the background color.
2. **`objs = objects(grid, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)`:**  Extracts all objects from the grid (excluding the background).
3. **`outline_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: adjacent(obj, toobject(ofcolor(grid, bg), grid)))`:** Filters for objects directly adjacent to the background, which represents the outline.
4. **`return paint(canvas(bg, shape(grid)), merge(outline_objs))`:** Creates a new grid filled with the background color and paints only the outline objects.

**Version 3 (Leveraging `box` for direct outline extraction):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(grid, other(palette(grid), bg)), grid)
  outline = box(obj)
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(grid)), recolor(bg, outline)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(grid)`:**  Identifies the background color.
2. **`obj = toobject(ofcolor(grid, other(palette(grid), bg)), grid)`:**  Extracts the object from the grid.
3. **`outline = box(obj)`:** Directly extracts the outline of the object using the `box` function.
4. **`return paint(canvas(bg, shape(grid)), recolor(bg, outline))`:** Creates a new grid filled with the background color and paints the outline with the background color. 

**Version 4 (Exploiting the difference between `backdrop` and object indices):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  obj = toobject(ofcolor(grid, other(palette(grid), bg)), grid)
  outline = backdrop(obj) - toindices(obj)
  return paint(canvas(bg, shape(grid)), recolor(bg, outline)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(grid)`:**  Identifies the background color.
2. **`obj = toobject(ofcolor(grid, other(palette(grid), bg)), grid)`:**  Extracts the object from the grid.
3. **`outline = backdrop(obj) - toindices(obj)`:**  Calculates the outline by finding the difference between the object's bounding box (`backdrop`) and the object's actual indices. 
4. **`return paint(canvas(bg, shape(grid)), recolor(bg, outline))`:** Creates a new grid filled with the background color and paints the outline with the background color.

**Version 5 (Using `cellwise` to conditionally change cell color):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  obj_color = other(palette(grid), bg)
  return cellwise(grid, paint(canvas(bg, shape(grid)), toobject(box(ofcolor(grid, obj_color)), grid)), grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(grid)`:**  Identifies the background color.
2. **`obj_color = other(palette(grid), bg)`:**  Identifies the object color.
3. **`cellwise(grid, paint(canvas(bg, shape(grid)), toobject(box(ofcolor(grid, obj_color)), grid)), grid)`:** Uses `cellwise` to compare the original grid with a temporary grid where only the object's outline is painted. If the cell colors match in both grids, the original color is kept; otherwise, the background color is used.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, each with its own strengths and weaknesses in terms of readability, efficiency, and function usage.
