## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation extracts a specific object from the input grid and creates a cross shape using the color of the extracted object, placed at the object's original location on a blank canvas. Here's a breakdown:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
1. **Object Extraction:**  The central object consisting of the digit '4' is extracted.
2. **Cross Formation:** A cross shape is formed using the digit '4'.
3. **Placement:** The cross is placed at the center of the original object's location.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
1. **Object Extraction:** The central object consisting of the digit '6' is extracted.
2. **Cross Formation:** A cross shape is formed using the digit '6'.
3. **Placement:** The cross is placed at the center of the original object's location.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**
1. **Object Extraction:** The central object consisting of the digit '9' is extracted.
2. **Cross Formation:** A cross shape is formed using the digit '9'.
3. **Placement:** The cross is placed at the center of the original object's location.


## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T)  # Extract all objects
  x2 = mostcommon(totuple(palette(x1))) # Find the most common object color
  x3 = extract(x1, lambda obj: color(obj) == x2) # Find the object with the most common color
  x4 = centerofmass(x3) # Get the center of mass of the object
  x5 = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Create a blank canvas
  x6 = connect((x4[0], 0), (x4[0], shape(I)[1]-1)) # Create a horizontal line through the center
  x7 = connect((0, x4[1]), (shape(I)[0]-1, x4[1])) # Create a vertical line through the center
  O = paint(x5, recolor(color(x3), x6 | x7)) # Paint the combined lines on the canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects (x1):**  All objects in the input grid are extracted using `objects(I, T, T, T)`.
2. **Find Most Common Color (x2):** The color of the most common object is determined using `mostcommon(totuple(palette(x1)))`.
3. **Extract Target Object (x3):** The object with the most common color is extracted using `extract(x1, lambda obj: color(obj) == x2)`.
4. **Find Center of Mass (x4):** The center of mass of the target object is calculated using `centerofmass(x3)`.
5. **Create Blank Canvas (x5):** A blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid is created using `canvas(0, shape(I))`.
6. **Create Horizontal Line (x6):** A horizontal line spanning the width of the canvas and passing through the center of mass is created using `connect((x4[0], 0), (x4[0], shape(I)[1]-1))`.
7. **Create Vertical Line (x7):** A vertical line spanning the height of the canvas and passing through the center of mass is created using `connect((0, x4[1]), (shape(I)[0]-1, x4[1]))`.
8. **Paint the Cross (O):** The combined horizontal and vertical lines are re-colored to the color of the target object using `recolor(color(x3), x6 | x7)` and painted onto the blank canvas using `paint(x5, ...)`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = mostcommon(totuple(palette(I))) # Find the most common color
  x2 = objects(I, T, T, T) # Extract all objects
  x3 = extract(x2, lambda obj: color(obj) == x1) # Find the object with the most common color
  x4 = center(toindices(x3)) # Find the center of the object
  x5 = hline(recolor(x1, {x4}))  # Create a horizontal line at the center with the object's color
  x6 = vline(recolor(x1, {x4}))  # Create a vertical line at the center with the object's color
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), x5 | x6) # Paint the combined lines on a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Most Common Color (x1):** Identifies the most common color in the input grid using `mostcommon(totuple(palette(I)))`.
2. **Extract Objects (x2):** Extracts all objects from the input grid using `objects(I, T, T, T)`.
3. **Extract Target Object (x3):** Extracts the object that has the most common color determined in step 1 using `extract(x2, lambda obj: color(obj) == x1)`.
4. **Find Object Center (x4):** Calculates the central coordinates of the target object using `center(toindices(x3))`.
5. **Create Horizontal Line (x5):** Generates a horizontal line of length 1 at the object's center using `hline(recolor(x1, {x4}))`.
6. **Create Vertical Line (x6):** Generates a vertical line of length 1 at the object's center using `vline(recolor(x1, {x4}))`.
7. **Paint Cross on Canvas (O):** Creates a blank canvas of the same dimensions as the input grid and paints the combined horizontal and vertical lines (forming the cross) onto it using `paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), x5 | x6)`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = objects(I, T, T, T) # Extract all objects 
  x2 = mostcommon(totuple(apply(color, x1))) # Find the most common object color
  x3 = extract(x1, lambda obj: color(obj) == x2) # Find the object with the most common color
  x4 = centerofmass(x3) # Get the center of mass of the object
  x5 = toindices(x3) # Get the indices of the object
  x6 = {(i, x4[1]) for i, j in x5} # Keep only indices with same column index as center 
  x7 = {(x4[0], j) for i, j in x5} # Keep only indices with same row index as center
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(x2, x6 | x7)) # Paint the cross on a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects (x1):** Extracts all objects in the input grid using `objects(I, T, T, T)`.
2. **Find Most Common Color (x2):**  Determines the most frequent object color using `mostcommon(totuple(apply(color, x1)))`.
3. **Extract Target Object (x3):** Extracts the object matching the most common color using `extract(x1, lambda obj: color(obj) == x2)`.
4. **Get Center of Mass (x4):**  Calculates the center of mass coordinates of the extracted object using `centerofmass(x3)`.
5. **Get Object Indices (x5):**  Retrieves all indices belonging to the target object using `toindices(x3)`.
6. **Filter Vertical Line Indices (x6):** Filters the object indices to keep only those that share the same column index as the center of mass, effectively creating the indices for the vertical line of the cross using `{(i, x4[1]) for i, j in x5}`.
7. **Filter Horizontal Line Indices (x7):** Filters the object indices to keep only those that share the same row index as the center of mass, effectively creating the indices for the horizontal line of the cross using `{(x4[0], j) for i, j in x5}`.
8. **Paint Cross (O):**  Paints the cross onto a blank canvas. It uses the indices from steps 6 and 7, recolors them with the most common color using `recolor(x2, x6 | x7)`, and paints them onto the canvas generated using `canvas(0, shape(I))`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  c = mostcommon(totuple(palette(I))) # Find the most common color
  objs = objects(I, T, T, T) # Extract all objects
  obj = extract(objs, lambda o: color(o) == c) # Extract the object with the most common color
  center_i, center_j = centerofmass(obj)  # Get the center coordinates of the object
  cross_indices = ((center_i, j) for j in range(len(I[0]))) | ((i, center_j) for i in range(len(I))) # Generate cross indices
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(c, frozenset(cross_indices))) # Paint the cross onto a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Most Common Color (c):**  Identifies the most frequent color in the input grid using `mostcommon(totuple(palette(I)))`.
2. **Extract Objects (objs):** Extracts all distinct objects from the input grid using `objects(I, T, T, T)`.
3. **Extract Target Object (obj):**  Isolates the object that possesses the most common color determined in step 1 using `extract(objs, lambda o: color(o) == c)`.
4. **Calculate Center Coordinates (center_i, center_j):** Computes the central row and column indices of the target object using `centerofmass(obj)`.
5. **Generate Cross Indices (cross_indices):**  Generates the indices that form a horizontal and vertical line intersecting at the object's center using generator expressions `((center_i, j) for j in range(len(I[0])))` and `((i, center_j) for i in range(len(I)))`.
6. **Paint Cross (O):** Creates a blank canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid and paints the cross onto it. It recolors the generated cross indices with the most common color from step 1 using `recolor(c, frozenset(cross_indices))` and then paints them onto the canvas created using `canvas(0, shape(I))`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  x1 = mostcommon(totuple(palette(I)))  # Find the most common color
  x2 = objects(I, T, T, T) # Extract all objects
  x3 = extract(x2, lambda obj: color(obj) == x1) # Find the object with the most common color
  x4 = toindices(x3) # Get all indices of the object
  x5 = centerofmass(x3) # Find the center of mass of the object
  x6 = sfilter(x4, lambda ij: ij[0] == x5[0]) # Keep indices with the same row as the center
  x7 = sfilter(x4, lambda ij: ij[1] == x5[1]) # Keep indices with the same column as the center
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(x1, x6 | x7))  # Paint on a blank canvas
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Most Common Color (x1):**  Determines the most frequent color present in the input grid using `mostcommon(totuple(palette(I)))`.
2. **Extract Objects (x2):** Extracts all individual objects present in the input grid using `objects(I, T, T, T)`.
3. **Extract Target Object (x3):**  Selects the object that matches the most common color identified in step 1 using `extract(x2, lambda obj: color(obj) == x1)`.
4. **Get Object Indices (x4):** Retrieves all the indices that constitute the target object using `toindices(x3)`.
5. **Find Center of Mass (x5):**  Calculates the center of mass coordinates for the target object using `centerofmass(x3)`.
6. **Filter Horizontal Line Indices (x6):** From all object indices, it retains only those indices where the row index matches the row index of the center of mass. This creates a horizontal line segment for the cross using `sfilter(x4, lambda ij: ij[0] == x5[0])`.
7. **Filter Vertical Line Indices (x7):**  Similarly, it filters the object indices to keep only those where the column index is the same as the column index of the center of mass, resulting in a vertical line segment for the cross using `sfilter(x4, lambda ij: ij[1] == x5[1])`.
8. **Paint Cross (O):**  Generates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid. It recolors the combined horizontal and vertical line segments (the cross) with the most common color determined earlier using `recolor(x1, x6 | x7)` and paints it onto the canvas created with `canvas(0, shape(I))`.
