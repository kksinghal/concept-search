## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the 'non-background' color in the grid and outlining its occurrences with that color, effectively creating a bounding box around each connected component of the non-background color. The background color remains unchanged.

**Example:**

Input:
```
4 5 4
5 5 5
4 5 4
```

Output:
```
0 4 0
4 4 4
0 4 0
```

Here, '5' is the background color. '4' is the non-background color. The output outlines the connected component of '4's with a bounding box of '4's.


## Program Versions & Explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  obj_color = other(palette(grid), bg)
  return fill(grid, obj_color, box(ofcolor(grid, obj_color)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(grid)`:**  Identifies the background color as the most frequent color in the grid.
2. **`obj_color = other(palette(grid), bg)`:**  Identifies the non-background color by finding the other color in the grid's palette apart from the background color.
3. **`fill(grid, obj_color, box(ofcolor(grid, obj_color)))`:** 
   - `ofcolor(grid, obj_color)`: Finds the indices of all cells containing the non-background color.
   - `box(...)`: Computes the indices forming the bounding box around these non-background color cells.
   - `fill(grid, obj_color, ...)`: Fills the grid with the non-background color at the bounding box indices, effectively outlining the original non-background color component.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  return cellwise(grid, fill(canvas(bg, shape(grid)), other(palette(grid), bg), box(ofcolor(grid, other(palette(grid), bg)))), grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(grid)`:** Identifies the background color.
2. **`canvas(bg, shape(grid))`:** Creates a new grid filled entirely with the background color and having the same dimensions as the input grid.
3. **`other(palette(grid), bg)`:**  Extracts the non-background color.
4. **`fill(..., other(palette(grid), bg), box(ofcolor(grid, other(palette(grid), bg))))`:**  Fills the new canvas with the non-background color at the bounding box indices of the non-background color component from the original grid.
5. **`cellwise(grid, ..., grid)`:**  Performs a cell-wise comparison between the original grid, the modified canvas, and the original grid. This retains the original grid's values unless the modified canvas has a non-background color at that cell, effectively outlining the non-background color component on the original grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  obj_indices = ofcolor(grid, other(palette(grid), bg))
  return tuple(
      tuple(
        other(palette(grid), bg) if (i,j) in box(obj_indices) else grid[i][j]
        for j in range(len(grid[0]))
      )
      for i in range(len(grid))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`bg = mostcolor(grid)`:** Determines the background color.
2.  **`obj_indices = ofcolor(grid, other(palette(grid), bg))`:** Extracts the indices of the non-background color.
3.  The nested loops iterate through each cell of the grid:
    -   **`(i,j) in box(obj_indices)`:** Checks if the current cell index is part of the bounding box surrounding the non-background color component.
    -   If true, it assigns the non-background color to the output grid at that cell.
    -   If false, it retains the original color from the input grid at that cell.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  obj_color = other(palette(grid), bg)
  outlined_grid = canvas(bg, shape(grid))
  for i, row in enumerate(grid):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == obj_color:
        for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
          outlined_grid = fill(outlined_grid, obj_color, {(i+di, j+dj)})
  return outlined_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`bg = mostcolor(grid)`:**  Gets the background color.
2.  **`obj_color = other(palette(grid), bg)`:**  Gets the non-background color.
3.  **`outlined_grid = canvas(bg, shape(grid))`:** Creates a new grid filled with the background color.
4.  **Nested loops**: Iterates over each cell in the original grid.
    -   If the cell contains the non-background color, it fills its four neighboring cells in the `outlined_grid` with the non-background color.
5.  Returns the `outlined_grid`, which effectively outlines the non-background color components.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  bg = mostcolor(grid)
  obj_color = other(palette(grid), bg)
  return tuple(
      tuple(
        obj_color if any(grid[max(0,i+di)][max(0,j+dj)] == obj_color 
        for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]) else bg
        for j in range(len(grid[0]))
      )
      for i in range(len(grid))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(grid)`:** Identifies the background color.
2. **`obj_color = other(palette(grid), bg)`:**  Gets the non-background color.
3. **Nested loops:** Iterates through each cell in the grid.
4. **`any(...)`:** Checks if any of the current cell's four neighbors contain the non-background color. 
    - If true, it assigns the non-background color to the output grid at that cell.
    - If false, it assigns the background color to the output grid at that cell.

This logic effectively outlines the non-background color components.

**Note:** Each program version presented achieves the same transformation using different approaches and combinations of DSL functions.
