## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the most common color (background) and the objects formed by other colors. For each object, it:

1. **Identifies the bounding box.**
2. **Fills the bounding box with the background color.**
3. **Draws the outline of the object using the object's color.** 

This effectively "hollows out" the objects and leaves only their outlines on a background-filled grid.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Get all objects, excluding background.
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  
  # 2. Fill the grid with background color.
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  
  # 3. Draw outline for each object.
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), box(toindices(obj))))
  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Extracts all objects from the input grid (`I`) excluding the background.
2. **`O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates a new grid (`O`) of the same size as input, filled with the background color.
3. **`for obj in objs:`:** Iterates over each identified object.
    * **`O = paint(O, recolor(color(obj), box(toindices(obj))))`:** Calculates the bounding box of the object (`box(toindices(obj))`), recolors it with the object's color, and paints it onto the output grid (`O`).

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Create an empty canvas.
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) 
  
  # 2. Get all non-background colors.
  colors = palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}
  
  # 3. Draw outline for each color.
  for c in colors:
    O = paint(O, recolor(c, box(ofcolor(I, c))))
  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(0, shape(I))`:**  Creates an empty grid (`O`) of the same size as input.
2. **`colors = palette(I) - {mostcolor(I)}`:** Extracts all unique colors in the input except the background color.
3. **`for c in colors:`:**  Iterates through each non-background color.
    * **`O = paint(O, recolor(c, box(ofcolor(I, c))))`:** Finds all indices of the current color (`ofcolor(I, c)`), calculates their bounding box, recolors the box with the current color, and paints it on the output grid (`O`).

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Get background color.
  bg = mostcolor(I)

  # 2. Iterate through grid cells and draw outlines.
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != bg and any(I[i+di][j+dj] == bg for di,dj in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)] if 0<=i+di<len(I) and 0<=j+dj<len(I[0])):
        O[i][j] = I[i][j]
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:**  Identifies the background color of the input grid.
2. **`O = canvas(bg, shape(I))`:**  Creates a new grid (`O`) filled with the background color and same dimensions as input.
3. **`for i in range(len(I)):`:** Iterates through rows.
    * **`for j in range(len(I[0])):`:** Iterates through columns.
        * **`if I[i][j] != bg and ...`:**  Checks if current cell is not background and is adjacent to a background cell. If true, it's an outline cell.
            * **`O[i][j] = I[i][j]`:** Paints the current cell's color onto the output grid at the same position. 

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Create a function to check if a cell is on the border of an object.
  def is_border(i, j):
    if I[i][j] == mostcolor(I):
      return F
    for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
      ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
      if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]) and I[ni][nj] == mostcolor(I):
        return T
    return F

  # 2. Create output grid by applying is_border to each cell.
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if is_border(i, j):
        O[i][j] = I[i][j]
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def is_border(i, j):`:** Defines a helper function to check if a cell is on the border of an object. It returns `True` if the cell is not background and has at least one adjacent background cell. 
2. **`O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:**  Creates a new grid (`O`) filled with the background color and same dimensions as input.
3. **`for i in range(len(I)):`:** Iterates through rows.
    * **`for j in range(len(I[0])):`:** Iterates through columns.
        * **`if is_border(i, j):`:** If the current cell is a border cell:
            * **`O[i][j] = I[i][j]`:**  Paint the current cell's color onto the output grid.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # 1. Create a function to get neighboring cells.
  def get_neighbors(i, j):
    neighbors = []
    for di, dj in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
      ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
      if 0 <= ni < len(I) and 0 <= nj < len(I[0]):
        neighbors.append((ni, nj))
    return neighbors
  
  # 2. Create output grid by checking cell neighbors.
  bg = mostcolor(I)
  O = canvas(bg, shape(I))
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] != bg and any(I[ni][nj] == bg for ni, nj in get_neighbors(i, j)):
        O[i][j] = I[i][j]
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def get_neighbors(i, j):`:** Defines a helper function to get valid neighboring cell coordinates for a given cell. 
2. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:** Identifies the background color.
3. **`O = canvas(bg, shape(I))`:** Creates a new grid (`O`) filled with the background color and same dimensions as input.
4. **`for i in range(len(I)):`:** Iterates through rows.
    * **`for j in range(len(I[0])):`:** Iterates through columns.
        * **`if I[i][j] != bg and ...`:**  Checks if the current cell is not background and has at least one neighboring background cell using the `get_neighbors` function.
            * **`O[i][j] = I[i][j]`:** Paints the current cell's color onto the output grid.
