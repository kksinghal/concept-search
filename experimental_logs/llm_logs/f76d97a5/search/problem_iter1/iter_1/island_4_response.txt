## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation applied to the input grids can be described as follows:

1. **Identify the background color:** This is the most frequent color in the grid.
2. **Create a frame around each object:**  The frame encompasses the outer boundary of each object, excluding the background. 
3. **Fill the frame and the object with the background color:** This essentially erases the original object while highlighting its outline.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each using different DSL functions and logic:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)  # Identify background color
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)  # Extract objects
  expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: delta(obj) | toindices(obj), objs) # Expand each object by its delta
  O = fill(I, bg, merge(expanded_objs))  # Fill expanded objects with bg
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:**  Finds the most frequent color in the input grid `I`.
2.  **`objs = objects(I, False, False, True)`:**  Extracts all objects from the input grid, excluding the background.
3.  **`expanded_objs = mapply(lambda obj: delta(obj) | toindices(obj), objs)`:**  For each object, this line calculates the 'delta' - the cells directly surrounding the object - and combines it with the object's own indices. This creates an outline that includes the original object.
4.  **`O = fill(I, bg, merge(expanded_objs))`:** Fills all cells within the `expanded_objs` with the background color (`bg`), effectively erasing the objects and leaving only the frame.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    bg = mostcolor(I) # Identify background color
    objs = objects(I, False, False, True) # Extract objects
    frames = mapply(lambda obj: box(obj), objs)  # Get the outline (box) of each object
    O = fill(I, bg, merge(frames))  # Fill the outline with the background color
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:**  Identifies the background color.
2. **`objs = objects(I, False, False, True)`:** Extracts objects, excluding the background.
3. **`frames = mapply(lambda obj: box(obj), objs)`:** Computes the bounding box for each object, which represents its outline.
4. **`O = fill(I, bg, merge(frames))`:**  Fills the cells belonging to the outline (`frames`) with the background color, creating the desired effect.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)  # Identify the background color
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)  # Extract the objects
  shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset.union({shift(obj, d) for d in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]}), objs)  # Shift objects
  O = fill(I, bg, merge(shifted_objs))  # Fill shifted objects with background
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:** Finds the background color.
2. **`objs = objects(I, False, False, True)`:** Extracts objects, excluding the background.
3. **`shifted_objs = mapply(lambda obj: frozenset.union({shift(obj, d) for d in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]}), objs)`:**  Shifts each object up, down, left, and right by one unit, creating a "shadow" around the original object. The `frozenset.union` ensures a single frozenset is returned.
4. **`O = fill(I, bg, merge(shifted_objs))`:**  Fills the cells covered by the shifted objects with the background color, leaving only the original object's outline.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I) # Identify the background color
  objs = partition(I) # Partition the grid based on color
  filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) != bg)  # Filter out background objects
  framed_objs = mapply(lambda obj: outbox(obj), filtered_objs)  # Create outlines for non-background objects
  O = fill(I, bg, merge(framed_objs))  # Fill the outlines with the background color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:**  Determines the background color.
2. **`objs = partition(I)`:** Divides the grid into separate objects based on their color.
3. **`filtered_objs = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) != bg)`:**  Excludes objects that have the same color as the background.
4. **`framed_objs = mapply(lambda obj: outbox(obj), filtered_objs)`:** Generates the outer frame for each remaining object using `outbox`.
5. **`O = fill(I, bg, merge(framed_objs))`:** Fills the area covered by the frames with the background color, effectively creating outlines of the original objects. 

**Program Version 5:** 

```python 
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  bg = mostcolor(I)  # Identify the background color
  objs = objects(I, False, False, True)  # Extract objects (excluding background)
  def outline_object(obj):
    shifted_objs = {shift(obj, d) for d in [UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT]}  # Shift object in all four directions
    return reduce(lambda a, b: a | b, shifted_objs) - toindices(obj)  # Combine shifted objects and remove original object's indices
  outlined_objs = mapply(outline_object, objs)  # Apply outline_object to each object
  O = fill(I, bg, merge(outlined_objs))  # Fill the outlines with the background color
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`bg = mostcolor(I)`:**  Determines the background color.
2. **`objs = objects(I, False, False, True)`:**  Extracts objects from the input, excluding the background.
3. **`outline_object(obj)`:**  This nested function takes an object as input and:
    - Shifts the object in all four directions (up, down, left, right).
    - Combines the shifted objects using `reduce` and the set union operation (`|`).
    - Subtracts the original object's indices from the combined set, leaving only the outline.
4. **`outlined_objs = mapply(outline_object, objs)`:** Applies the `outline_object` function to each object extracted in step 2.
5. **`O = fill(I, bg, merge(outlined_objs))`:** Fills the cells corresponding to the outlines with the background color, generating the final output grid.

These five program versions showcase distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation, demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version leverages different functions and combinations of logic, making them diverse solutions rather than simple variations.
