## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the input grid and then drawing a border around them. The border's color depends on the size of the object:

* **Largest Object:** The inbox of the largest object is filled with '2', and its outbox is filled with '4'.
* **Other Objects:** The inbox of other objects is filled with '1', and their outbox is filled with '4'.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  largest_obj = argmax(objs, size)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(paint(O, recolor(4, outbox(obj))), recolor(2 if obj == largest_obj else 1, inbox(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objs = objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **Find Largest Object:** `largest_obj = argmax(objs, size)` finds the object with the largest size.
3. **Iterate and Paint:**  The code iterates through each object (`obj` in `objs`):
    * `paint(O, recolor(4, outbox(obj)))`: Paints the outbox of the current object with '4'.
    * `recolor(2 if obj == largest_obj else 1, inbox(obj))`:  Fills the inbox with '2' if it's the largest object, otherwise with '1'.
    * `paint(..., ...)`: Paints the filled inbox onto the output grid `O`.
4. **Return Output:** Returns the transformed grid `O`.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  largest_size = size(argmax(objs, size))
  return paint(paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(4, outbox(obj)), objs))), 
               merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(2 if size(obj) == largest_size else 1, inbox(obj)), objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects & Largest Size:** Similar to Version 1, it identifies objects and finds the largest size.
2. **Paint Outboxes:** `paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(4, outbox(obj)), objs)))` paints the outboxes of all objects with '4' in one go using `apply` and `merge`.
3. **Paint Inboxes:**  `merge(apply(lambda obj: recolor(2 if size(obj) == largest_size else 1, inbox(obj)), objs))`: This part paints the inboxes of all objects based on their size comparison with the largest size, again using `apply` and `merge` for efficiency.
4. **Return Output:** Returns the transformed grid.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  largest_obj = argmax(objs, size)
  return paint(
    paint(I, recolor(4, merge(apply(outbox, objs)))),
    recolor(2, inbox(largest_obj)) | recolor(1, merge(apply(inbox, remove(largest_obj, objs))))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects & Largest Object:**  Identifies objects and the largest object.
2. **Paint All Outboxes:** `paint(I, recolor(4, merge(apply(outbox, objs))))`:  Paints all outboxes with '4' using a combination of `apply`, `merge`, and `recolor`.
3. **Paint Inboxes Separately:**
    * `recolor(2, inbox(largest_obj))`:  Paints the inbox of the largest object with '2'.
    * `recolor(1, merge(apply(inbox, remove(largest_obj, objs))))`:  Paints the inboxes of all other objects with '1' after removing the largest object.
4. **Combine and Return:** Combines the painted inboxes and returns the final grid.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  def process_obj(obj, largest_size):
    return paint(
        recolor(4, outbox(obj)), 
        recolor(2 if size(obj) == largest_size else 1, inbox(obj))
    )

  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  largest_size = size(argmax(objs, size))
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: process_obj(obj, largest_size), objs)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`process_obj` Function:** Defines a helper function `process_obj` that takes an object and the largest size as input and returns the object with its outbox painted '4' and inbox painted based on size comparison.
2. **Identify Objects & Largest Size:**  Identifies objects and the largest object's size.
3. **Apply and Merge:** Applies the `process_obj` function to each object using `apply`, merges the results using `merge`, and paints the combined result onto the input grid.
4. **Return Output:** Returns the transformed grid.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  largest_obj = argmax(objs, size)
  other_objs = remove(largest_obj, objs)
  return paint(
      paint(I, recolor(4, merge(apply(outbox, objs)))), 
      recolor(2, inbox(largest_obj)) | recolor(1, merge(apply(inbox, other_objs)))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects, Largest & Others:**  Identifies objects, the largest object, and stores other objects separately.
2. **Paint All Outboxes:** Similar to previous versions, it paints all outboxes with '4'.
3. **Paint Inboxes Separately:**  Paints the inbox of the largest object with '2' and inboxes of other objects with '1'.
4. **Combine and Return:** Combines the painted inboxes and returns the final grid. 

These five versions provide distinct ways to achieve the same transformation using the DSL, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the language. Each version employs different combinations of functions and logic, offering a range of solutions with varying levels of efficiency and readability.
