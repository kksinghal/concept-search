## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the primary object in the grid and then coloring its inner and outer layers with specific colors. 

**Logic:**

1. **Identify the primary object:** This is the object formed by the digits that are not the background color (0).
2. **Determine inner layer color:** If the primary object contains the digit 1, the inner layer is colored with 1; otherwise, it's colored with 2.
3. **Identify outer layer:** The outer layer consists of cells within the primary object that have at least one direct neighbor (up, down, left, right) outside the object.
4. **Color the layers:** 
    - The inner layer (excluding the outer layer) is filled with the determined inner color.
    - The outer layer is colored with 4.

**Example:**

- **Input 0:** The primary object consists of the digit "1"s. Since it contains the digit "1", the inner layer is colored with 1. The outer layer is identified as the perimeter of the object and colored with 4.
- **Input 1:** The primary object consists of the digit "1"s. Since it contains the digit "1", the inner layer is colored with 1. The outer layer is identified and colored with 4.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))  # Extract the primary object
  inner_value = 1 if 1 in palette(obj) else 2  # Determine inner layer color
  outer = sfilter(lambda loc: any(n not in toindices(obj) for n in dneighbors(loc)), toindices(obj))  # Identify outer layer
  O = paint(fill(I, inner_value, obj), recolor(4, toobject(outer, I)))  # Color inner and outer layers
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))`**: Extracts the primary object from the input grid `I`.
2. **`inner_value = 1 if 1 in palette(obj) else 2`**: Determines the color of the inner layer based on the presence of the digit "1" in the object.
3. **`outer = sfilter(lambda loc: any(n not in toindices(obj) for n in dneighbors(loc)), toindices(obj))`**: Identifies the outer layer cells by checking if any of their direct neighbors lie outside the object.
4. **`O = paint(fill(I, inner_value, obj), recolor(4, toobject(outer, I)))`**: 
    - `fill(I, inner_value, obj)`: Creates a grid where the primary object is filled with the `inner_value`.
    - `recolor(4, toobject(outer, I))`: Creates an object representing the outer layer with color 4.
    - `paint(...)`: Combines the two by painting the outer layer onto the filled grid.
5. **`return O`**: Returns the transformed grid.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))  # Extract the primary object
  inner_value = 1 if colorcount(obj, 1) > 0 else 2  # Determine inner layer color
  outer = toindices(obj) - sfilter(lambda loc: all(n in toindices(obj) for n in dneighbors(loc)), toindices(obj))  # Identify outer layer
  O = paint(fill(I, inner_value, obj), recolor(4, toobject(outer, I)))  # Color inner and outer layers
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version is similar to version 1, but it determines the inner layer color by counting the occurrences of "1" in the object using `colorcount`.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))  # Extract the primary object
  inner = sfilter(lambda loc: all(n in toindices(obj) for n in dneighbors(loc)), toindices(obj))  # Identify inner layer
  outer = toindices(obj) - inner # Identify outer layer
  inner_value = 1 if any(index(I, loc) == 1 for loc in inner) else 2  # Determine inner layer color
  O = paint(fill(I, inner_value, inner), recolor(4, toobject(outer, I)))  # Color inner and outer layers
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version explicitly identifies the inner layer first by selecting cells whose direct neighbors all belong to the object. The outer layer is then defined as the remaining cells of the object.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))  # Extract the primary object
  inner_value = 1 if (1, next(iter(toindices(obj)))) in obj else 2 # Determine inner layer color
  outer =  toindices(obj) - sfilter(lambda loc: all(n in toindices(obj) for n in dneighbors(loc)), toindices(obj)) # Identify outer layer
  O = paint(fill(I, 4, outer), recolor(inner_value, toobject(toindices(obj)-outer, I))) # Color inner and outer layers
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

- This version determines the `inner_value` by checking if the first cell of the object has a value of 1. It then calculates the `outer` layer and uses it to fill the outer layer with 4 and the rest of the object with the `inner_value`.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))  # Extract the primary object
  inner_value = 2 - (1 in (index(I, loc) for loc in toindices(obj)))  # Determine inner layer color
  outer = sfilter(lambda loc: len({index(I, n) for n in neighbors(loc)}) > 1, toindices(obj))  # Identify outer layer
  O = paint(fill(I, inner_value, obj), recolor(4, toobject(outer, I)))  # Color inner and outer layers
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

- This version calculates `inner_value` by subtracting the boolean value of "1" being present in the object from 2. It identifies the outer layer by checking if a cell has neighbors with more than one unique color.

These five program versions showcase different ways to achieve the same transformation using various DSL functions and logical approaches. Each version provides a unique solution path, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
