## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in both examples involves identifying distinct objects (connected regions of the same digit) within the input grid and applying specific modifications based on their properties. Here's a breakdown:

**Common Features:**

* **Inbox Highlighting:** The core transformation involves highlighting the "inbox" of each object.  The inbox consists of the cells within the object's bounding box, excluding the outermost layer of cells. 
* **Color Coding:** The inbox is filled with a specific digit:
    *  `4` if the inbox is the smallest among all object inboxes.
    *  `1` if the inbox is not the smallest. 
* **Original Object Retention:** The original object's cells within the highlighted inbox are preserved.

**Example Specifics:**

* **Example 0:**  The larger object's inbox is filled with `4`, and its original cells (`1`) remain. The smaller object's inbox is filled with `2`, and its original cells (`1`) are also retained.
* **Example 1:** Similar to Example 0, the larger object's inbox is filled with `4` and the smaller with `1`, preserving the original digits within.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, True, False, True), key=len)
  O = I
  for i, obj in enumerate(objs):
    value = 4 if i == 0 else 1 
    O = paint(O, recolor(value, inbox(toindices(obj))))
    O = underpaint(O, obj)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Sorting:**  Sorts the objects found in the input grid (`I`) by size (number of cells) in ascending order.
2. **Iteration and Filling:** Iterates through each sorted object (`obj`):
   - If it's the smallest object (`i == 0`), fills its inbox with `4`.
   - If it's not the smallest object, fills its inbox with `1`.
   - Overlays the original object back onto the grid to preserve the digits within the inbox. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  min_size = len(argmin(objects(I, True, False, True), len))
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    O = paint(O, recolor(4 if len(obj) == min_size else 1, inbox(toindices(obj))))
    O = underpaint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Minimum Size Calculation:** Determines the size of the smallest object in the grid.
2. **Iteration and Conditional Filling:** Iterates through each object:
   - If the object's size matches the minimum size, fills its inbox with `4`.
   - If not, fills its inbox with `1`.
   - Overlays the original object to preserve the digits.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  min_obj = argmin(objs, len)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, recolor(4 if obj == min_obj else 1, difference(backdrop(toindices(obj)), box(toindices(obj)))))
    O = underpaint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object and Minimum Identification:** Finds all objects and identifies the smallest one (`min_obj`).
2. **Iteration and Comparison:** Iterates through the objects:
   - Compares each object to the `min_obj`.
   - If they match, fills the inbox with `4`; otherwise, fills it with `1`. 
   - Uses `difference` to calculate the inbox directly.
   - Re-paints the original object.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  sm_obj = argmin(objects(I, True, False, True), len)
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    inbox_indices = difference(backdrop(toindices(obj)), box(toindices(obj)))
    fill_value = 4 if len(inbox_indices) == len(inbox(toindices(sm_obj))) else 1
    O = paint(O, recolor(fill_value, inbox_indices))
    O = underpaint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Smallest Object Identification:** Identifies the smallest object (`sm_obj`).
2. **Iteration and Inbox Sizing:** Iterates through each object:
   - Calculates the inbox indices for the current object.
   - Calculates the inbox size for the smallest object.
   - Compares the two inbox sizes and fills with `4` if they match, and `1` otherwise. 
   - Overwrites with the original object.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  obj_sizes = apply(len, objects(I, True, False, True))
  min_size = minimum(obj_sizes)
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    fill_value =  4 if len(obj) == min_size else 1
    O = paint(O, recolor(fill_value, difference(backdrop(toindices(obj)), box(toindices(obj)))))
    O = underpaint(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Size Extraction and Minimum:** Extracts the sizes of all objects and finds the minimum size.
2. **Iteration and Size Comparison:**  Iterates through objects: 
   - Compares each object's size to the minimum size.
   - If they match, fills the inbox with `4`; otherwise, fills with `1`.
   - Uses `difference` to compute the inbox directly.
   - Re-applies the original object to maintain the digits.

These programs showcase different approaches to achieving the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility of the DSL.
