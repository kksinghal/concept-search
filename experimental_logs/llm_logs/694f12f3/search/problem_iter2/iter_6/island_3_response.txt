## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to highlight the two distinct objects present in the input grid. The smaller object is outlined and filled with color '4', while its interior is filled with color '1'. The larger object is also outlined and filled with color '4', but its interior is filled with color '2'.

**Input_0 & Output_0:**

1. **Object Identification:** Two objects are identified: one with five '1's and another with fifteen '1's.
2. **Smaller Object Transformation:** The smaller object (five '1's) is outlined with '4's, and its interior is filled with '1's.
3. **Larger Object Transformation:** The larger object (fifteen '1's) is outlined with '4's, and its interior is filled with '2's.

**Input_1 & Output_1:**

This transformation follows the same logic as the previous one, but with different object sizes.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions for the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_version_1(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, True, False, True), key=len)
  small_obj = objs[0]
  large_obj = objs[1]
  return paint(
      paint(
          paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(4, small_obj)),
          recolor(4, box(small_obj))
      ),
      paint(
          paint(recolor(4, large_obj), recolor(2, delta(inbox(toindices(large_obj))))),
          recolor(1, crop(I, add(ulcorner(large_obj), (1, 1)), (height(large_obj) - 2, 2)))
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  We identify and sort the objects by size using `objects` and `sorted`.
2. **Create Base Canvas:** A blank canvas is created with `canvas`.
3. **Transform Smaller Object:**
    - Fill the smaller object with color '4' using `recolor`.
    - Outline the smaller object with color '4' using `box` and `recolor`.
4. **Transform Larger Object:**
    - Fill the larger object with color '4' using `recolor`.
    - Fill the interior of the larger object (excluding its border) with color '2' using `delta`, `inbox`, `toindices`, and `recolor`.
    - Overwrite a specific region inside the larger object with color '1' using `crop`, `add`, `ulcorner`, `height`, and `recolor`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_version_2(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  small_obj = argmin(objs, len)
  large_obj = argmax(objs, len)
  return paint(
      paint(canvas(0, shape(I)),
          paint(recolor(4, box(small_obj)), recolor(4, small_obj))
      ),
      paint(
          paint(recolor(4, large_obj), recolor(2, delta(inbox(toindices(large_obj))))),
          recolor(1, crop(I, (uppermost(large_obj) + 1, leftmost(large_obj) + 1), (height(large_obj) - 2, 2)))
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 1, but instead of sorting objects, it directly retrieves the smallest and largest objects using `argmin` and `argmax`. This results in a slightly more concise code.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_version_3(I):
  small_obj = argmin(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: len(obj))
  large_obj = argmax(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: len(obj))
  return paint(
      paint(
          paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(4, box(toindices(small_obj)))), 
          recolor(4, small_obj)
      ),
      paint(
          paint(recolor(4, large_obj), recolor(2, delta(inbox(toindices(large_obj))))),
          recolor(1, crop(I, (uppermost(large_obj) + 1, leftmost(large_obj) + 1), (height(large_obj) - 2, 2)))
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version further refines the object selection by using lambda functions within `argmin` and `argmax` to directly compare object sizes.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_version_4(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  s = lambda x: size(x)
  small_obj = argmin(objs, s)
  large_obj = argmax(objs, s)
  return paint(
      paint(
          paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(4, toobject(box(small_obj), I))),
          recolor(4, small_obj)
      ),
      paint(
          paint(recolor(4, large_obj), recolor(2, toobject(delta(inbox(toindices(large_obj))), I))),
          recolor(1, crop(I, (uppermost(large_obj) + 1, leftmost(large_obj) + 1), (height(large_obj) - 2, 2)))
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version separates the `size` function for better readability and utilizes `toobject` function for consistency in handling object representation.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_version_5(I):
  objs = sorted(objects(I, True, False, True), key=lambda x: len(x))
  return paint(
      paint(
          canvas(0, shape(I)),
          paint(recolor(4, objs[0]), recolor(4, box(objs[0])))
      ),
      paint(
          paint(recolor(4, objs[1]), recolor(2, delta(inbox(toindices(objs[1]))))),
          recolor(1, crop(I, (uppermost(objs[1]) + 1, leftmost(objs[1]) + 1), subtract(shape(objs[1]), (2, width(objs[1]) - 2))))
      )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version optimizes the code by directly using the sorted object list and applying transformations without explicitly assigning them to separate variables. It also utilizes `subtract` and `width` functions for a concise representation of crop dimensions.

These five program versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL, showcasing diverse logic and function combinations.
