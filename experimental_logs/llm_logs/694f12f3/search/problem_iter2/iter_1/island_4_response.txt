## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Recolor:** The primary object (the '1's) is recolored to '4'.
2. **Framing:**  A "frame" of '2's is added around the recolored object, specifically in the cells corresponding to the object's inbox. 
3. **Inner Recolor:** The innermost cells of the recolored object are changed back to '1'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

This transformation follows the same logic as the previous one, applying the recolor, framing, and inner recolor steps to the primary object in the input grid.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL from `dsl.py`:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  recolored = recolor(4, obj)
  framed = paint(I, recolored)
  inner = sfilter(lambda loc: all(n in toindices(obj) for n in dneighbors(loc)), toindices(obj))
  O = paint(framed, recolor(1, inner))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))`:** Identifies the first object (connected '1's) in the input grid.
2. **`recolored = recolor(4, obj)`:**  Recolors the object to '4'.
3. **`framed = paint(I, recolored)`:** Paints the recolored object onto a copy of the input grid.
4. **`inner = sfilter(...)`:**  Finds the inner cells of the object, defined as cells where all directly adjacent neighbors are also part of the object.
5. **`O = paint(framed, recolor(1, inner))`:** Recolors the inner cells back to '1' on the framed grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  O = paint(fill(I, 2, inbox(obj)), recolor(4, difference(obj,  sfilter(lambda loc: all(n in toindices(obj) for n in dneighbors(loc)), toindices(obj)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))`:** Extracts the first object from the input grid.
2. **`... sfilter(...) ...`:** Identifies the inner cells of the object.
3. **`... difference(...)`:**  Calculates the difference between the object and its inner cells, essentially getting the "outline" of the object.
4. **`... recolor(...)`:** Recolors the outline to '4'.
5. **`O = paint(fill(I, 2, inbox(obj)), ...)`:**  Creates the frame with '2's and paints the recolored outline onto it.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  outer = inbox(obj)
  inner = sfilter(lambda loc: all(n in toindices(obj) for n in dneighbors(loc)), toindices(obj))
  O = paint(paint(fill(I, 2, outer), recolor(4, obj)), recolor(1, inner))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = ...`, `outer = ...`, `inner = ...`:**  Extracts the object, its inbox (for the frame), and its inner cells.
2. **`... fill(I, 2, outer)`:** Creates the frame with '2's.
3. **`... paint(..., recolor(4, obj))`:** Paints the recolored object onto the framed grid.
4. **`O = paint(..., recolor(1, inner))`:** Recolors the inner cells back to '1'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = toindices(first(objects(I, T, F, T)))
  outer_frame = inbox(obj)
  inner_cells = sfilter(lambda loc: all(neighbor in obj for neighbor in dneighbors(loc)), obj)
  O = fill(fill(fill(I, 2, outer_frame), 4, obj), 1, inner_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`obj = toindices(...)`:**  Extracts the object's indices.
2.  **`outer_frame = ...`, `inner_cells = ...`:** Identifies the outer frame and inner cells using inbox and neighbor checking.
3.  **`O = fill(... fill(... fill(...) ...) ...)`:**  Uses nested `fill` operations to first create the frame, then paint the object, and finally recolor the inner cells.

**Program Version 5:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))
  O = paint(fill(I, 2, inbox(obj)), recolor(1, paint(recolor(4, obj), recolor(2, sfilter(lambda loc: all(n in toindices(obj) for n in dneighbors(loc)), toindices(obj)))))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = ...`**: Identifies the first object.
2. **`... sfilter(...) ...`:**  Determines the inner cells of the object.
3. **`... recolor(2, ...) ...`:** Temporarily recolors the inner cells to '2' to differentiate them.
4. **`... paint(recolor(4, obj), ...)`:** Paints the recolored object (now with '2' for inner cells) onto a blank canvas.
5. **`... recolor(1, ...)`:** Recolors the temporary '2's (inner cells) back to '1'.
6. **`O = paint(fill(I, 2, inbox(obj)), ...)`:**  Combines the frame creation and object painting into a single operation.

These five programs demonstrate different ways to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL. Each version leverages distinct combinations of functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL and offering diverse solutions to the problem.
