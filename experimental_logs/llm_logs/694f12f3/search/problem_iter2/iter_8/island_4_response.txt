## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes a grid and highlights the outline of the main object with the color "4".  Additionally, it creates an inner border within the object. Let's break down the specifics for each example:

**Input 0 -> Output 0:** 
- The "1" object's outline becomes "4". 
- An inner border of "4" is added, leaving a single "1" cell gap from the outer "4" border. 
- The inner area within the "4" border is filled with "2".

**Input 1 -> Output 1:**
- Similar to Input 0, the "1" object's outline becomes "4".
- An inner border of "4" is added. However, due to the object's shape, some parts of the inner border are directly adjacent to the outer border.
- The inner area is filled with "2", except for the cell at the center of the bottom row, which is filled with "1". 

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" function, leveraging the DSL functions to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))  # Extract the primary object
  outer = toindices(obj) - sfilter(lambda loc: all(n in toindices(obj) for n in dneighbors(loc)), toindices(obj))  # Identify outer layer
  inner = outer - sfilter(lambda loc: any(n in outer for n in dneighbors(loc)), toindices(obj)) # Identify inner layer
  inner_value = mostcommon([index(I, loc) for loc in inner])  # Determine inner layer color
  O = paint(fill(I, inner_value, inner), recolor(4, toobject(outer, I)))  # Color inner and outer layers
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))`**:  Identifies the primary object in the grid (the connected group of non-zero digits).
2. **`outer = toindices(obj) - sfilter(lambda loc: all(n in toindices(obj) for n in dneighbors(loc)), toindices(obj))`**:  Determines the outer border of the object by finding cells where at least one directly adjacent neighbor is not part of the object.
3. **`inner = outer - sfilter(lambda loc: any(n in outer for n in dneighbors(loc)), toindices(obj))`**: Finds the inner border by selecting cells within the object that are adjacent to the outer border.
4. **`inner_value = mostcommon([index(I, loc) for loc in inner])`**: Extracts the most frequent color within the inner border.
5. **`O = paint(fill(I, inner_value, inner), recolor(4, toobject(outer, I)))`**: Creates the output grid by first filling the inner border with the `inner_value`, and then painting the outer border with the color "4".

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))  # Extract the primary object
  outer = delta(obj) & toindices(obj) # Identify outer layer
  inner = delta(outer) & toindices(obj) # Identify inner layer
  inner_value = mostcommon([index(I, loc) for loc in inner])  # Determine inner layer color
  O = paint(fill(I, inner_value, inner), recolor(4, toobject(outer, I)))  # Color inner and outer layers
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))`**: Extracts the primary object.
2. **`outer = delta(obj) & toindices(obj)`**:  Identifies the outer border as the intersection of the object's indices and the indices of its delta (surrounding empty cells).
3. **`inner = delta(outer) & toindices(obj)`**:  Determines the inner border by finding the intersection of the outer border's delta and the object's indices.
4. **`inner_value = mostcommon([index(I, loc) for loc in inner])`**:  Finds the most common color within the inner border.
5. **`O = paint(fill(I, inner_value, inner), recolor(4, toobject(outer, I)))`**: Constructs the output grid by filling the inner border with `inner_value` and coloring the outer border with "4".

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))  # Extract the primary object
    outer = toindices(obj) - sfilter(lambda loc: all(n in toindices(obj) for n in dneighbors(loc)), toindices(obj))  # Identify outer layer
    inner = toindices(obj) - sfilter(lambda loc: all(n not in outer for n in dneighbors(loc)), toindices(obj)) # Identify inner layer
    inner_value = mostcommon([index(I, loc) for loc in inner])  # Determine inner layer color
    O = paint(fill(I, inner_value, inner), recolor(4, toobject(outer, I)))  # Color inner and outer layers
    return O
```
**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))`**:  Extracts the primary object.
2. **`outer = toindices(obj) - sfilter(lambda loc: all(n in toindices(obj) for n in dneighbors(loc)), toindices(obj))`**:  Finds the outer border by selecting cells in the object that have at least one direct neighbor outside the object.
3. **`inner = toindices(obj) - sfilter(lambda loc: all(n not in outer for n in dneighbors(loc)), toindices(obj))`**: Identifies the inner border by excluding cells within the object whose direct neighbors are all not part of the outer border. 
4. **`inner_value = mostcommon([index(I, loc) for loc in inner])`**:  Determines the most common color in the inner border.
5. **`O = paint(fill(I, inner_value, inner), recolor(4, toobject(outer, I)))`**:  Builds the output by filling the inner border with `inner_value` and the outer border with "4". 


**Program Version 4** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))  # Extract the primary object
    outer =  toindices(obj) - sfilter(lambda loc: all(n in toindices(obj) for n in dneighbors(loc)), toindices(obj)) # Identify outer layer
    inner =  sfilter(lambda loc: any(n in outer for n in dneighbors(loc)), toindices(obj)) # Identify inner layer
    inner_value = mostcommon([index(I, loc) for loc in inner]) # Determine inner layer color
    O = paint(fill(I, 4, outer), recolor(inner_value, toobject(inner, I))) # Color inner and outer layers
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))`**:  Extracts the primary object.
2. **`outer =  toindices(obj) - sfilter(lambda loc: all(n in toindices(obj) for n in dneighbors(loc)), toindices(obj))`**:  Finds the outer border by selecting cells in the object that have at least one direct neighbor outside the object.
3. **`inner =  sfilter(lambda loc: any(n in outer for n in dneighbors(loc)), toindices(obj))`**: Identifies the inner border by choosing cells within the object that are directly adjacent to at least one cell in the outer border.
4. **`inner_value = mostcommon([index(I, loc) for loc in inner])`**:  Determine the most common color within the inner border. 
5. **`O = paint(fill(I, 4, outer), recolor(inner_value, toobject(inner, I)))`**:  Generates the output grid by first coloring the outer border with "4" and then filling the inner border with the `inner_value`.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))  # Extract the primary object
  outer = toindices(obj) - sfilter(lambda loc: len({index(I, n) for n in neighbors(loc)}) == 1, toindices(obj))  # Identify outer layer
  inner = outer - sfilter(lambda loc: any(n in outer for n in dneighbors(loc)), toindices(obj)) # Identify inner layer
  inner_value = mostcommon([index(I, loc) for loc in inner])  # Determine inner layer color
  O = paint(fill(I, inner_value, inner), recolor(4, toobject(outer, I)))  # Color inner and outer layers
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj = first(objects(I, T, F, T))`**: Extracts the primary object from the grid.
2. **`outer = toindices(obj) - sfilter(lambda loc: len({index(I, n) for n in neighbors(loc)}) == 1, toindices(obj))`**:  Identifies the outer border by removing cells from the object's indices that have only one unique color in their neighborhood (including diagonals). 
3. **`inner = outer - sfilter(lambda loc: any(n in outer for n in dneighbors(loc)), toindices(obj))`**:  Finds the inner border by selecting cells within the object that are adjacent to the outer border.
4. **`inner_value = mostcommon([index(I, loc) for loc in inner])`**:  Extracts the most frequent color within the inner border.
5. **`O = paint(fill(I, inner_value, inner), recolor(4, toobject(outer, I)))`**: Creates the output grid by first filling the inner border with the `inner_value`, and then painting the outer border with the color "4". 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to identifying the outer and inner borders of the object within the DSL's constraints. By carefully analyzing the input-output relationships, it's possible to craft diverse solutions that achieve the desired transformation.
