## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on recoloring the inner cells of objects within the grid. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The smaller object (top) has its inner cells (excluding the border) recolored to `1`.
- The larger object (bottom) has its inner cells recolored to `2`.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- The smaller object (bottom) has its inner cells recolored to `1`.
- The larger object (top) has its inner cells recolored to `2`.

Essentially, the transformation identifies the two distinct objects in the grid (excluding the background `0`) and recolors the inner cells based on the object's size. Smaller objects get an inner color of `1`, and larger objects get an inner color of `2`.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  obj1 = first(objs)
  obj2 = other(objs, obj1)
  smaller_obj = argmin({obj1, obj2}, len)
  larger_obj = argmax({obj1, obj2}, len)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(1, toindices(smaller_obj)-box(toindices(smaller_obj))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, toindices(larger_obj)-box(toindices(larger_obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:**  Uses `objects(I, True, False, True)` to get a set of distinct objects, excluding the background.
2. **Determine Smaller/Larger:**  Finds the smaller and larger objects based on their size using `argmin` and `argmax` with the `len` function.
3. **Recolor Inner Cells:** Utilizes `recolor` to change the color of cells within the `toindices` of each object, excluding the object's `box` (border).
4. **Paint on Canvas:** Employs `paint` to apply the recolored objects onto a blank canvas created with `canvas`.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, True):
    value = 1 if len(obj) == valmin(objects(I, True, False, True), len) else 2
    O = paint(O, recolor(value, toindices(obj)-box(toindices(obj))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate Through Objects:**  Iterates through each object identified by `objects(I, True, False, True)`.
2. **Determine Color:** Assigns a color value (1 or 2) based on whether the current object's size matches the smallest object's size using `valmin` and `len`.
3. **Recolor and Paint:** Similar to Version 1, it recolors the inner cells and paints them back onto the grid.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  smalls = sizefilter(objs, valmin(objs, len))
  larges = sizefilter(objs, valmax(objs, len))
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(1, merge(apply(toindices, smalls)) - merge(apply(box, apply(toindices, smalls)))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, merge(apply(toindices, larges)) - merge(apply(box, apply(toindices, larges)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Filter by Size:**  Instead of finding individual objects, this version first filters objects into `smalls` and `larges` sets based on their sizes using `sizefilter`, `valmin`, and `valmax`.
2. **Recolor and Paint:** Similar to previous versions, it recolors inner cells, but it uses `merge` and `apply` to efficiently handle sets of objects.

**Version 4:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value != 0:
        obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda x: contained((value, (i, j)), x))
        is_small = len(obj) == valmin(objects(I, True, False, True), len)
        O = fill(O, 1 if is_small else 2, {(i, j)} - box(toindices(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate Through Cells:** Iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. **Find Corresponding Object:** If a cell is not background (`0`), it finds the object to which the cell belongs using `extract`, `objects`, and `contained`.
3. **Determine Size and Recolor:** Similar to previous versions, it recolors the cell based on its object's size, filling only if the cell is not part of the object's border.

**Version 5:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  small_color = 1
  large_color = 2
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    color_to_use = small_color if len(obj) == valmin(objs, len) else large_color
    for cell in toindices(obj):
      if not contained(cell, box(toindices(obj))):
        O = fill(O, color_to_use, {cell})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialization:**  Starts with a blank canvas and defines colors for smaller and larger objects.
2. **Iterate Through Objects and Cells:** Iterates through each object and then through each cell within the object's `toindices`.
3. **Conditional Recoloring:**  Recolors a cell only if it's not part of the object's border and uses the appropriate color based on the object's size.

These five versions provide diverse approaches to achieving the desired transformation, showcasing different logic and combinations of DSL functions.
