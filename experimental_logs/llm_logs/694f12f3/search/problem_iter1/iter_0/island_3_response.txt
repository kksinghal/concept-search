## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects within the input grid and selectively recoloring cells within those objects based on their size and position.

**Input 0:**

* Two objects are identified: one with 20 cells and one with 16 cells.
* In the larger object, all cells except the leftmost and rightmost columns are recolored to '1'.
* In the smaller object, all cells except the leftmost and rightmost columns are recolored to '2'.

**Input 1:**

* Two objects are identified: one with 24 cells and one with 16 cells.
* In the larger object, the three central columns are recolored to '2'.
* In the smaller object, the three central columns are recolored to '1'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  obj1 = argmax(objs, size)
  obj2 = other(objs, obj1)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i in range(uppermost(obj) + 1, lowermost(obj)):
      for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj)):
        if (i, j) in toindices(obj):
          O = fill(O, 2 if obj == obj1 else 1, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find all objects in the input grid (`objs`).
2. **Determine Larger Object:**  Find the largest object (`obj1`) based on the number of cells. 
3. **Iterate through Objects:** Loop through each object (`obj`).
4. **Iterate through Inner Cells:** Loop through the inner cells of each object (excluding the outermost rows and columns).
5. **Conditional Recoloring:** If the current cell belongs to the larger object (`obj1`), recolor it to '2'; otherwise, recolor it to '1'.

**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  obj1 = argmax(objs, size)
  obj2 = other(objs, obj1)
  O = paint(I, recolor(2, inbox(obj1)))
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, inbox(obj2)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Determine Larger Object:** Similar to Version 1.
3. **Recolor Larger Object:** Paint the 'inbox' (inner rectangle) of the larger object (`obj1`) with the color '2'.
4. **Recolor Smaller Object:** Paint the 'inbox' of the smaller object (`obj2`) with the color '1'.

**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for n, obj in enumerate(objs):
    inner = difference(toindices(obj), box(obj))
    O = paint(O, recolor(n + 1, inner))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** Loop through each object (`obj`).
3. **Find Inner Cells:** Calculate the difference between the object's indices and its bounding box to obtain the inner cells.
4. **Recolor Inner Cells:** Recolor the inner cells of each object with a unique color (n+1, where n is the object index).

**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    if square(obj):
      O = paint(O, recolor(2 if size(obj) == 20 else 1, center(obj)))
    else:
      O = paint(O, recolor(2 if size(obj) == 20 else 1, inbox(obj)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** Loop through each object (`obj`).
3. **Distinguish Square Objects:** If the object is a square, recolor its center cell based on its size (2 if size is 20, else 1).
4. **Recolor Non-Square Objects:** If the object is not a square, recolor its 'inbox' based on its size (2 if size is 20, else 1).

**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(1, height(I)-1):
    for j in range(1, width(I)-1):
      if I[i][j] != 0:
        obj = extract(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: (i,j) in toindices(obj))
        O = fill(O, 2 if size(obj) >= 20 else 1, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through Inner Cells:** Loop through the inner cells of the input grid (excluding the outermost rows and columns).
2. **Find Corresponding Object:** For each cell, find the object it belongs to.
3. **Conditional Recoloring:** Recolor the cell based on the size of its corresponding object (2 if size is 20 or greater, else 1).
