## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:** 
1. **Identify objects:** The input has two distinct objects (excluding the background): one with value '4' at the top and another with value '4' at the bottom.
2. **Recolor smaller object:** The smaller '4'-valued object at the top is recolored to value '1'.
3. **Shrink larger object:** The larger '4'-valued object at the bottom is shrunk horizontally, removing the leftmost and rightmost columns. The newly revealed cells maintain the background value '0'. The shrunk object is then recolored to value '2'.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**
1. **Identify objects:**  The input has two distinct objects (excluding the background): one with value '4' at the top and another with value '4' at the bottom.
2. **Shrink larger object:** The larger '4'-valued object at the top is shrunk horizontally, removing the leftmost and rightmost columns. The newly revealed cells maintain the background value '0'. The shrunk object is then recolored to value '2'. 
3. **Shrink smaller object:** The smaller '4'-valued object at the bottom is shrunk horizontally, removing the leftmost and rightmost columns. The newly revealed cells maintain the background value '0'. The shrunk object is then recolored to value '1'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_e5062a87(I):
  obj1 = first(objects(I, True, False, True))
  obj2 = other(objects(I, True, False, True), obj1)
  smaller_obj = obj1 if len(obj1) < len(obj2) else obj2
  larger_obj = obj2 if len(obj1) < len(obj2) else obj1

  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(1, toindices(smaller_obj)))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, toindices(shift(crop(togrid(larger_obj), (0, 1), (height(larger_obj), width(larger_obj) - 2)), (0, 1)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  `obj1` and `obj2` are assigned the two objects found in the grid using `objects`.
2. **Determine smaller and larger objects:** `smaller_obj` and `larger_obj` are determined by comparing the sizes of `obj1` and `obj2`.
3. **Recolor smaller object:** The `smaller_obj` is recolored to '1' and painted onto a blank canvas.
4. **Shrink and recolor larger object:**  The `larger_obj` is:
    * Converted to a grid using `togrid` (not defined in DSL but can be implemented).
    * Cropped using `crop` to remove leftmost and rightmost columns.
    * Shifted using `shift` to maintain original position.
    * Recolored to '2' and painted onto the canvas.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_e5062a87(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  obj1 = argmax(objs, size)
  obj2 = argmin(objs, size)

  O = paint(I, recolor(1, toindices(obj2)))
  O = underpaint(O, recolor(2, toindices(shift(crop(togrid(obj1), (0, 1), (height(obj1), width(obj1) - 2)), (0, 1)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objs` is assigned all objects in the grid.
2. **Find largest and smallest objects:** `argmax` and `argmin` are used with the `size` function to determine the largest (`obj1`) and smallest (`obj2`) objects, respectively.
3. **Recolor smaller object:** The `obj2` is recolored to '1' and painted onto the input grid `I`.
4. **Shrink and recolor larger object:**  The `obj1` is:
    * Converted to a grid.
    * Cropped.
    * Shifted.
    * Recolored to '2'.
    * Painted onto the grid using `underpaint` to only affect the background.


**Program Version 3:** 

```python
def solve_e5062a87(I):
  objs = order(objects(I, True, False, True), size)
  smaller_obj = objs[0]
  larger_obj = objs[1]

  O = I
  for i, j in toindices(smaller_obj):
    O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
  for i in range(uppermost(larger_obj), lowermost(larger_obj) + 1):
    for j in range(leftmost(larger_obj) + 1, rightmost(larger_obj)):
      O = fill(O, 2, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and order objects:**  `objs` is assigned all objects, ordered by size using `order` and `size`.
2. **Recolor smaller object:** Iterate through indices of `smaller_obj` and fill each cell with '1'.
3. **Shrink and recolor larger object:** Iterate through indices of `larger_obj` (excluding leftmost and rightmost columns) and fill each cell with '2'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_e5062a87(I):
  obj1 = first(objects(I, True, False, True))
  obj2 = other(objects(I, True, False, True), obj1)
  smaller_obj = obj1 if len(obj1) < len(obj2) else obj2
  larger_obj = obj2 if len(obj1) < len(obj2) else obj1
  
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(1, toindices(smaller_obj)))
  O = underpaint(O, recolor(2, toindices(hconcat( (tuple(),), hconcat(crop(togrid(larger_obj), (0, 1), (height(larger_obj), width(larger_obj) - 2)), (tuple(),))))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Recolor smaller object:** Similar to Version 1.
3. **Shrink and recolor larger object:** The `larger_obj` is:
    * Converted to a grid.
    * Cropped to remove the leftmost and rightmost columns.
    * Horizontally concatenated with empty tuples using `hconcat` to create the shrunk grid.
    * Recolored to '2' and underpainted onto the canvas.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_e5062a87(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
    obj1 = first(objs)
    obj2 = other(objs, obj1)
    O = I
    for i in range(height(I)):
      for j in range(width(I)):
        if (i, j) in toindices(obj1) and j not in (leftmost(obj1), rightmost(obj1)):
          O = fill(O, 2 if len(obj1) > len(obj2) else 1, {(i, j)})
        elif (i, j) in toindices(obj2) and j not in (leftmost(obj2), rightmost(obj2)):
          O = fill(O, 2 if len(obj2) > len(obj1) else 1, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  Retrieve objects from the grid.
2. **Iterate through grid:** Go through each cell of the grid.
3. **Conditionally recolor:** If the cell belongs to an object and is not on the object's leftmost or rightmost edge, recolor it based on the object's size relative to the other object.


These are just a few examples, and you can explore other combinations of DSL functions to achieve the desired transformation. The key is to break down the transformation into smaller steps and then find the appropriate DSL functions to implement those steps.
