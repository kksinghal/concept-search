## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying two distinct objects (clusters of non-background digits) in the input grid and marking their centers. The object encountered first in the code gets its center marked with '1's and the second object gets its center marked with '2's. The size of the center marking depends on the shape of the object:

* **Square objects:** The center is marked with a single digit (a 1x1 square).
* **Non-square objects:** The center is marked with a 2x2 square of the corresponding digit.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj1 = first(objects(I, True, False, True))
  obj2 = other(objects(I, True, False, True), obj1)

  O = I
  for i in range(center(obj1)[0] - (not square(obj1)), center(obj1)[0] + (not square(obj1)) + 1):
    for j in range(center(obj1)[1] - (not square(obj1)), center(obj1)[1] + (not square(obj1)) + 1):
      O = paint(O, {(1, (i, j))})

  for i in range(center(obj2)[0] - (not square(obj2)), center(obj2)[0] + (not square(obj2)) + 1):
    for j in range(center(obj2)[1] - (not square(obj2)), center(obj2)[1] + (not square(obj2)) + 1):
      O = paint(O, {(2, (i, j))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version simplifies the logic by using the `center` function directly.  We iterate through a 1x1 or 2x2 area around the center depending on the object's shape using `(not square(obj))` which evaluates to 1 if the object is not square and 0 otherwise.


## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj1 = first(objects(I, True, False, True))
  obj2 = other(objects(I, True, False, True), obj1)

  O = I
  O = paint(O, recolor(1, crop(canvas(0, shape(obj1)), subtract(center(obj1), (not square(obj1), not square(obj1))), (2 * (not square(obj1)) + 1, 2 * (not square(obj1)) + 1))))
  O = paint(O, recolor(2, crop(canvas(0, shape(obj2)), subtract(center(obj2), (not square(obj2), not square(obj2))), (2 * (not square(obj2)) + 1, 2 * (not square(obj2)) + 1))))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages `crop`, `canvas`, and `recolor` functions to achieve the transformation in a more concise way. It calculates the starting point and dimensions of the center marking dynamically based on the object's shape.


## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program(I):
  obj1 = first(objects(I, True, False, True))
  obj2 = other(objects(I, True, False, True), obj1)

  O = I
  mark_center = lambda obj, val: paint(O, {(val, (i, j)) for i in range(center(obj)[0] - (not square(obj)), center(obj)[0] + (not square(obj)) + 1) for j in range(center(obj)[1] - (not square(obj)), center(obj)[1] + (not square(obj)) + 1)})
  O = mark_center(obj1, 1)
  O = mark_center(obj2, 2)

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a helper function `mark_center` to avoid code repetition. The helper function encapsulates the logic for marking the center of an object with a specific value based on its shape. 


## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  O = I
  for n, obj in enumerate(objs):
    O = paint(O, recolor(n + 1, crop(canvas(0, shape(obj)), subtract(center(obj), (not square(obj), not square(obj))), (2 * (not square(obj)) + 1, 2 * (not square(obj)) + 1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version generalizes the code to handle any number of objects in the input grid. It iterates through each object, determining the marking value dynamically based on the object's index in the `objs` set.


## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program(I):
  O = I
  for n, obj in enumerate(objects(I, True, False, True)):
    O = branch(
        square(obj), 
        paint(O, {(n + 1, center(obj))}), 
        paint(O, recolor(n + 1, crop(canvas(0, shape(obj)), subtract(center(obj), UNITY), astuple(2, 2)))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the `branch` function to decide between painting a single cell or a 2x2 square based on the object's shape. It avoids explicit loops for marking the center, further improving code conciseness.
