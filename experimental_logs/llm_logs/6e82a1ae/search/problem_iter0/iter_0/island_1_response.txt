## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying distinct objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid and recoloring them based on their original color. The recoloring scheme is as follows:

* **Object Color 1:** Recolored to 1, 2, or 3 in the output grids.
* **Object Color 2:** Recolored to 2, 3, or 1 in the output grids.
* **Object Color 3:** Recolored to 3, 1, or 2 in the output grids.
* **Object Color 5:** Recolored to 1, 2, or 3 in the output grids.

The exact recoloring for each object seems to depend on its position relative to other objects within the grid. 

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  obj1 = first(objs)
  obj2 = first(remove(obj1, objs))
  obj3 = first(remove(obj2, remove(obj1, objs)))
  p1 = position(obj1, obj2)
  p2 = position(obj2, obj3)
  O = paint(paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(1, obj1) if p1[0] >= 0 else recolor(3, obj1)), recolor(2, obj2) if p2[1] <= 0 else recolor(1, obj2)), recolor(3, obj3) if p1[1] <= 0 else recolor(2, obj3))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** `objects(I, T, F, F)` identifies all connected objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Isolate Objects:** We isolate the first three objects into `obj1`, `obj2`, and `obj3`.
3. **Determine Relative Positions:** `position(obj1, obj2)` and `position(obj2, obj3)` calculate the relative positions of the objects.
4. **Conditional Recoloring:** Based on the relative positions, we recolor the objects. 
    - If `obj1` is above or at the same level as `obj2`, it's recolored to 1, else 3.
    - If `obj2` is to the left or at the same column as `obj3`, it's recolored to 2, else 1.
    - If `obj1` is to the left or at the same column as `obj3`, it's recolored to 3, else 2.
5. **Paint Objects:** A blank canvas is created, and the recolored objects are painted onto it.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  obj1 = argmax(objs, size)
  objs = remove(obj1, objs)
  obj2 = argmax(objs, size)
  objs = remove(obj2, objs)
  obj3 = argmax(objs, size)
  cond1 = uppermost(obj1) < uppermost(obj2)
  cond2 = leftmost(obj2) < leftmost(obj3)
  O = paint(paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(1 if cond1 else 3, obj1)), recolor(2 if cond2 else 1, obj2)), recolor(3 if cond1 else 2, obj3))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify & Sort Objects:** Identify objects and sort them by size using `argmax(objs, size)`.
2. **Isolate Objects:** Similar to Version 1, we extract the three largest objects.
3. **Determine Relative Positions:** Compare the uppermost row of `obj1` and `obj2` and the leftmost column of `obj2` and `obj3` to infer their relative positions.
4. **Conditional Recoloring:** Recolor objects based on the conditions:
    - If `obj1` is above `obj2`, recolor it to 1, else 3.
    - If `obj2` is to the left of `obj3`, recolor it to 2, else 1.
    - Recolor `obj3` to 3 if `obj1` is above `obj2`, else 2.
5. **Paint Objects:** Paint the recolored objects onto a blank canvas.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  obj1 = argmax(objs, lambda obj: colorcount(obj, 5))
  rest = remove(obj1, objs)
  obj2 = argmax(rest, lambda obj: colorcount(obj, 5))
  obj3 = first(remove(obj2, rest))
  O = paint(paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(branch(uppermost(obj1) < uppermost(obj2), 1, 3), obj1)), recolor(branch(leftmost(obj2) < leftmost(obj3), 2, 1), obj2)), recolor(branch(uppermost(obj1) < uppermost(obj3), 3, 2), obj3))
  return O

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects & Prioritize Color 5:** Identify objects and prioritize those with the most occurrences of the digit '5' using `argmax` and `colorcount`.
2. **Isolate Objects:** Extract the top two objects with the most '5's and the remaining object.
3. **Determine Relative Positions & Recolor:** Determine relative positions by comparing the uppermost row or leftmost column and use `branch` for concise conditional recoloring based on these comparisons.
4. **Paint Objects:** Paint the recolored objects onto a blank canvas.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  sorted_objs = order(objs, lambda obj: (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)))
  obj1, obj2, obj3 = sorted_objs
  O = paint(paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(1 if uppermost(obj1) < uppermost(obj2) else 3, obj1)), recolor(2 if leftmost(obj2) < leftmost(obj3) else 1, obj2)), recolor(3 if uppermost(obj1) < uppermost(obj3) else 2, obj3))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify & Sort Objects:** Identify objects and sort them based on their top-left corner position (uppermost row first, then leftmost column) using `order`.
2. **Extract Objects:** Extract the first three sorted objects.
3. **Determine Relative Positions & Recolor:** Recoloring logic is similar to previous versions, relying on the relative vertical positions of `obj1` and `obj2`, and the relative horizontal positions of `obj2` and `obj3`.
4. **Paint Objects:** Paint the recolored objects onto a blank canvas.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  obj1 = min(objs, key=lambda obj: (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)))
  rest = remove(obj1, objs)
  obj2 = min(rest, key=lambda obj: (uppermost(obj), leftmost(obj)))
  obj3 = first(remove(obj2, rest))
  O = paint(paint(paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), recolor(3 if obj1 == obj3 else 1, obj1)), recolor(2 if obj2 == obj3 else 1, obj2)), recolor(3 if obj1 == obj2 else 2, obj3))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify & Sort Objects:** Identify objects and find the one with the smallest top-left corner position using `min`.
2. **Isolate Objects:** Extract the top-leftmost object (`obj1`), then repeat the process for the remaining objects to find `obj2`. 
3. **Determine Relative Positions & Recolor:**  Instead of directly comparing positions, this version checks if the objects are the same to determine relative positioning and apply the recoloring logic.
4. **Paint Objects:** Paint the recolored objects onto a blank canvas. 

These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation by leveraging different DSL functions and logic. They showcase the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL in tackling the spatial reasoning task.
