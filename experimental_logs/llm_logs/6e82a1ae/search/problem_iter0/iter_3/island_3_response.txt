## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying connected components (objects) in the input grid and relabeling them with unique identifiers in the output grid. The background (0) remains unchanged. 

**Logic:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find all connected regions of non-zero values in the input grid. Two cells are considered connected if they share a side (not diagonally).
2. **Label Objects:** Assign a unique label (starting from 1) to each identified object. 
3. **Create Output:** Generate an output grid of the same size as the input, filled with zeros. Replace the cells corresponding to each object with its assigned label.


## Program Version 1: (Inspired by Flood Fill)

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def flood_fill(i, j, label):
    if 0 <= i < height(I) and 0 <= j < width(I) and I[i][j] != ZERO and (i, j) not in visited:
      visited.add((i, j))
      O[i][j] = label  # Directly paint the grid
      for ni, nj in dneighbors((i, j)):
        flood_fill(ni, nj, label)
    return O
  
  O = [[0 for _ in range(width(I))] for _ in range(height(I))] # Initialize O as a 2D list
  visited = set()
  label = 1
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != ZERO and (i, j) not in visited:
        O = flood_fill(i, j, label)
        label += 1
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O) # Convert O back to a tuple of tuples
```

**Explanation:**

* Uses a recursive flood fill algorithm to identify connected components.
* `flood_fill` function recursively explores neighboring cells of the same value, marking them as visited and assigning the current `label`.
* The main loop iterates through each cell in the input grid, initiating a flood fill if the cell is non-zero and not visited.
* Directly modifies the `O` grid within the `flood_fill` function for efficiency.
* Converts the `O` grid from a list of lists back to a tuple of tuples before returning.

## Program Version 2: (Inspired by Objects and Recolor)

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  label = 1
  for obj in objs:
    O = paint(O, recolor(label, obj))
    label += 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* Uses the `objects` function to directly extract connected components (objects) from the input grid.
* `objects` function is set to consider only directly connected neighbors (diagonal=False) and exclude the background (without_bg=True).
* Iterates through each extracted object and uses `recolor` to assign a unique `label`.
* Uses `paint` to draw the relabeled object onto the output grid `O`.

## Program Version 3: (Iterative Approach)

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = [[0 for _ in range(width(I))] for _ in range(height(I))]
  visited = set()
  label = 1
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if I[i][j] != ZERO and (i, j) not in visited:
        stack = [(i, j)]
        while stack:
          ci, cj = stack.pop()
          if 0 <= ci < height(I) and 0 <= cj < width(I) and I[ci][cj] != ZERO and (ci, cj) not in visited:
            visited.add((ci, cj))
            O[ci][cj] = label
            for ni, nj in dneighbors((ci, cj)):
              stack.append((ni, nj))
        label += 1
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**

* Employs an iterative depth-first search (DFS) using a stack to identify connected components.
* Similar to flood fill but avoids recursion.
* Iterates through each cell and initiates a DFS if the cell is non-zero and not visited.
* Directly modifies the `O` grid within the loop for efficiency.
* Converts the `O` grid from a list of lists back to a tuple of tuples before returning.

## Program Version 4: (Optimized Objects and Recolor)

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for label, obj in enumerate(objs, 1): # Directly iterate with labels
    O = paint(O, recolor(label, obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version is a more concise and optimized form of Program Version 2.
* It directly uses the `enumerate` function to assign labels to objects while iterating over them, eliminating the need for a separate `label` variable.

## Program Version 5: (Using Partition and Replace)

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
  objs = fgpartition(I)  # Use fgpartition to get objects without background
  for label, obj in enumerate(objs, 1):
    O = paint(O, recolor(label, obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

* This version leverages the `fgpartition` function, which directly generates objects without the background. 
* It iterates through the objects from `fgpartition`, assigns a unique label using `enumerate`, and paints them onto the output grid `O`. This provides a slightly more efficient solution compared to using `objects` and filtering the background.

These five program versions demonstrate distinct approaches and function combinations within the provided DSL to achieve the desired connected component labeling transformation.
