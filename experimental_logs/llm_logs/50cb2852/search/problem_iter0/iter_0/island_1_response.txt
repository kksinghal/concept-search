## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (contiguous regions of the same digit) within the input grid and then modifying these objects based on their shape and position. Specifically:

* **Horizontal Objects:** Objects that are wider than they are tall have their inner cells replaced with the digit '8'. 
* **Vertical Objects:** Objects that are taller than they are wide have their inner cells replaced with the digit '8'.
* **Square Objects:**  Square objects remain unchanged.
* **Single-cell Objects:** Single-cell objects remain unchanged.

**Examples:**

* **Input 0:** The horizontal '2' object and the '3' object have their inner cells changed to '8'. The vertical '1' object has its inner cell changed to '8'.
* **Input 1:** The horizontal '2' object and the horizontal '1' object have their inner cells changed to '8'.
* **Input 2:** The horizontal '2' object and the horizontal '1' object have their inner cells changed to '8'. The vertical '3' object has its inner cells changed to '8'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the DSL provided:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  for obj in objs:
    if height(obj) != width(obj) and size(obj) > 1:
      I = fill(I, EIGHT, shift(toindices(obj), (1,1)))
      I = fill(I, EIGHT, shift(toindices(obj), (-1,-1)))
      I = fill(I, EIGHT, shift(toindices(obj), (1,-1)))
      I = fill(I, EIGHT, shift(toindices(obj), (-1,1)))
      I = fill(I, EIGHT, shift(toindices(obj), (1,0)))
      I = fill(I, EIGHT, shift(toindices(obj), (-1,0)))
      I = fill(I, EIGHT, shift(toindices(obj), (0,1)))
      I = fill(I, EIGHT, shift(toindices(obj), (0,-1)))
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  Uses `objects` to find all contiguous objects in the grid.
2. **Filter Non-Square Objects:** Iterates through each object and checks if it's non-square and has more than one cell.
3. **Fill Inner Cells:** For qualifying objects, fills the cells surrounding each cell of the object with '8'.
4. **Return Modified Grid:** Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  for obj in objs:
    if height(obj) != width(obj) and size(obj) > 1:
      for i in range(1, height(obj) - 1):
        for j in range(1, width(obj) - 1):
          I = fill(I, EIGHT, shift(toindices(obj), (i,j)))
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Uses `objects` to find all contiguous objects in the grid.
2. **Filter Non-Square Objects:** Iterates through each object and checks if it's non-square and has more than one cell.
3. **Fill Inner Cells:**  For qualifying objects, directly fills the inner cells with '8' by iterating over the object's dimensions, excluding the border cells.
4. **Return Modified Grid:** Returns the modified grid.


**Program Version 3**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
    for obj in objs:
        if not square(obj) and size(obj) > 1:
            I = fill(I, EIGHT, difference(backdrop(obj), box(obj)))
    O = I
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Uses `objects` to find all contiguous objects in the grid.
2. **Filter Non-Square Objects:** Checks if the object is not a square and has more than one cell.
3. **Fill Inner Cells:**  Calculates the difference between the object's backdrop and its outline (box). This identifies the inner cells. Then it fills those cells with '8'.
4. **Return Modified Grid:** Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
    for obj in objs:
        if (hline(obj) or vline(obj)) and size(obj) > 1: 
            I = fill(I, EIGHT, shift(toindices(obj), (1,1)))
            I = fill(I, EIGHT, shift(toindices(obj), (-1,-1)))
            I = fill(I, EIGHT, shift(toindices(obj), (1,-1)))
            I = fill(I, EIGHT, shift(toindices(obj), (-1,1)))
            I = fill(I, EIGHT, shift(toindices(obj), (1,0)))
            I = fill(I, EIGHT, shift(toindices(obj), (-1,0)))
            I = fill(I, EIGHT, shift(toindices(obj), (0,1)))
            I = fill(I, EIGHT, shift(toindices(obj), (0,-1)))
        elif not square(obj) and size(obj) > 1:
            for i in range(1, height(obj) - 1):
                for j in range(1, width(obj) - 1):
                    I = fill(I, EIGHT, shift(toindices(obj), (i,j)))
    O = I
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Uses `objects` to find all contiguous objects in the grid.
2. **Filter Non-Square Objects:**  Checks if the object is a horizontal or vertical line and has more than one cell, or if it's a non-square object with more than one cell.
3. **Fill Inner Cells:** If the object is a line, fills cells surrounding its cells with '8'. If the object is non-square and not a line, directly fills its inner cells with '8'. 
4. **Return Modified Grid:** Returns the modified grid.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
    for obj in objs:
        if size(obj) > 1 and (height(obj) > 1 or width(obj) > 1):
            if not square(obj):
                I = underfill(I, EIGHT, inbox(obj)) 
    O = I
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Uses `objects` to find all contiguous objects in the grid.
2. **Filter Multi-cell Objects:** Checks if the object has more than one cell and is not a single-cell object (by checking height or width).
3. **Filter Non-Square Objects:**  For multi-cell objects, checks if the object is not a square.
4. **Fill Inner Cells:** For qualifying objects, it uses `underfill` to fill the cells within the object's inbox with '8'. The `inbox` function cleverly identifies the inner region of the object. 
5. **Return Modified Grid:** Returns the modified grid.
