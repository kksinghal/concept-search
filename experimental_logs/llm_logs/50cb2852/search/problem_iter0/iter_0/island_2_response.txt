## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying connected components (objects) in the input grid and replacing a portion of each object with the digit '8'.  The portion to be replaced seems to be the inner cells of the object, leaving a one-cell border around the perimeter.

**Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:**

**Input_0:**
* The '2' objects and the '3' object have their inner cells replaced with '8', retaining a one-cell border of the original digit.

**Input_1:**
* Similar to Input_0, the '2' object and the '1' object have their inner cells replaced by '8'.

**Input_2:**
* The pattern continues, with inner cells of the '2', '3', and '1' objects replaced by '8'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)  # Find all connected objects
    for obj in objs:
        for value, (i, j) in obj:
            if (i, j) not in box(obj):  # Check if the cell is not on the object's border
                I = fill(I, 8, {(i, j)})  # Replace with '8' if not on the border
    O = I
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Objects:** Identify all connected components (objects) in the grid.
2. **Iterate through Objects:**  Loop through each object found.
3. **Iterate through Cells:** For each cell in an object:
    * **Check for Border:** Determine if the cell lies on the object's border.
    * **Replace Inner Cells:** If the cell is not on the border, replace its value with '8'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  for obj in objs:
    indices = toindices(obj)
    border = box(indices)
    inner_cells = indices - border
    I = fill(I, 8, inner_cells)
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find all connected objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** Loop through each found object.
3. **Calculate Border and Inner Cells:** Determine the object's border indices and calculate the set of inner cell indices.
4. **Replace Inner Cells:** Fill all inner cell indices with '8'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(1, height(I)-1):
    for j in range(1, width(I)-1):
      if index(I,(i,j)) != index(I,(i-1,j)) and index(I,(i,j)) != index(I,(i+1,j)) and index(I,(i,j)) != index(I,(i,j-1)) and index(I,(i,j)) != index(I,(i,j+1)):
        O = fill(O, 8, {(i,j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Iterate Through Inner Cells:** This program directly iterates through the grid, skipping the border rows and columns.
2. **Check Neighbors:** For each inner cell, it checks if all four of its direct neighbors (up, down, left, right) have different values.
3. **Fill If Inner:** If all neighbors are different, the cell is considered an "inner cell" and its value is replaced by '8'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
    bg = mostcolor(I)
    for obj in objs:
        if color(obj) != bg:  # Skip background object if it exists
            border = box(obj)
            for i in range(uppermost(obj) + 1, lowermost(obj)):
                for j in range(leftmost(obj) + 1, rightmost(obj)):
                    if (i, j) not in border:
                        I = fill(I, 8, {(i, j)})
    O = I
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Objects (Excluding Background):** Identify connected components, potentially excluding the background color if it forms an object.
2. **Iterate through Objects:** Loop through each object.
3. **Calculate Bounding Box:** Determine the object's bounding box.
4. **Iterate within Bounding Box:** Loop through cells within the bounding box, excluding the border cells.
5. **Replace Inner Cells:** Replace the value of each inner cell with '8'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    if size(obj) > 4:
      center_i, center_j = centerofmass(obj)
      O = fill(O, 8, {(center_i, center_j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Objects:** Identify all connected components (objects) in the grid.
2. **Iterate Through Objects:** Loop through each object.
3. **Check Size and Fill Center:** If the object size is greater than 4, calculate its center of mass and fill that single cell with '8'.

Each of these program versions presents a different approach to achieve the same transformation.
