## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the "tail" of the object with color 8 and changing its color to 1. The tail is defined as the cell within the object that is farthest from the object's center of mass. If there are multiple cells equidistant from the center of mass, the rightmost cell among them is considered the tail. 

**Input 0:**
- The tail of the '8' object is at location (4,1).
- The transformation recolors this cell to '1'.

**Input 1:**
- The tail of the '8' object is at location (5,3).
- The transformation recolors this cell to '1'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions for the given transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(grid):
  def find_tail(obj):
    cm = centerofmass(obj)
    def dist_func(cell):
      return manhattan(cell[1], cm), cell[1][1]
    tail = last(sorted(obj, key=dist_func))
    return tail[1]

  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  tail = find_tail(obj_8)
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, {tail}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`find_tail(obj)` function:**
    - Calculates the center of mass (`cm`) of the input object.
    - Defines a `dist_func` to compute the distance of a cell from `cm` and prioritize rightmost cells.
    - Sorts the object cells using `dist_func` and retrieves the last (farthest & rightmost) cell as the tail.
    - Returns the index (i, j) of the tail cell.
2. **Main program:**
    - Extracts the object with color 8 (`obj_8`).
    - Finds the tail of `obj_8` using `find_tail` function.
    - Recolors the tail cell to 1 and paints it back onto the grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(grid):
  def find_tail(obj):
    cm = centerofmass(obj)
    max_dist = 0
    tail = None
    for value, (i, j) in obj:
      dist = manhattan((i, j), cm)
      if dist > max_dist:
        max_dist = dist
        tail = (i, j)
      elif dist == max_dist and j > tail[1]:
        tail = (i, j)
    return tail

  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  tail = find_tail(obj_8)
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, {tail}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`find_tail(obj)` function:**
    - Calculates the center of mass (`cm`) of the input object.
    - Iterates through each cell of the object, calculating its Manhattan distance to `cm`.
    - Updates the `tail` if a cell is found with a greater distance or an equal distance but a larger column index (j).
2. **Main program:**
    - Extracts the object with color 8 (`obj_8`).
    - Finds the tail of `obj_8` using `find_tail` function.
    - Recolors the tail cell to 1 and paints it back onto the grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(grid):
  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  cm = centerofmass(obj_8)
  tail = max(obj_8, key=lambda cell: (manhattan(cell[1], cm), cell[1][1]))[1]
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, {tail}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Main program:**
    - Extracts the object with color 8 (`obj_8`).
    - Calculates the center of mass (`cm`) of `obj_8`.
    - Finds the tail cell directly using `max` function with a key function that prioritizes cells farther from `cm` and with larger column index (j).
    - Recolors the tail cell to 1 and paints it back onto the grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(grid):
  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  cm = centerofmass(obj_8)
  def dist_and_j(cell):
    return manhattan(cell[1], cm) * 100 + cell[1][1]
  tail = max(obj_8, key=dist_and_j)[1]
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, {tail}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Main program:**
    - Extracts the object with color 8 (`obj_8`).
    - Calculates the center of mass (`cm`) of `obj_8`.
    - Defines a `dist_and_j` function that combines Manhattan distance and column index (j) for effective comparison.
    - Finds the tail cell directly using `max` function with the `dist_and_j` key function.
    - Recolors the tail cell to 1 and paints it back onto the grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(grid):
  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  cm = centerofmass(obj_8)
  max_dist = max(manhattan((i, j), cm) for _, (i, j) in obj_8)
  tail = next((i, j) for _, (i, j) in obj_8 if manhattan((i, j), cm) == max_dist and (i, j) == max(((i, j) for _, (i, j) in obj_8 if manhattan((i, j), cm) == max_dist), key=lambda x: x[1]))
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, {tail}))
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Main program:**
    - Extracts the object with color 8 (`obj_8`).
    - Calculates the center of mass (`cm`) of `obj_8`.
    - Finds the maximum Manhattan distance (`max_dist`) from `cm` among all cells in `obj_8`.
    - Uses a generator expression to find the tail: 
       - It iterates through each cell and checks if its Manhattan distance equals `max_dist`. 
       - If it does, it ensures that this cell has the maximum column index (`j`) among all cells with `max_dist` by using another nested generator expression and the `max` function with `key=lambda x: x[1]`.
    - Recolors the tail cell to 1 and paints it back onto the grid.

These five program versions showcase different approaches to finding the tail cell, including sorting, iterating, and utilizing built-in functions like `max` with custom key functions. Each version ultimately achieves the desired transformation by identifying the farthest rightmost cell of the '8' object and changing its color to 1.
