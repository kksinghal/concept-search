## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify the rightmost cell of each distinct object (connected group of same-colored cells) in the input grid and change its color to '1'.  

Let's analyze this with the provided examples:

**Input_0:** The object consisting of '8's has its rightmost cell at (4,5). The transformation correctly identifies this cell and changes its value to '1' in the output.

**Input_1:** This input has three separate objects formed by the digit '8'. The transformation accurately identifies the rightmost cell in each object – (0,5), (3,1), and (6,3) – and modifies their values to '1' in the output.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Identify all distinct objects in the input grid.
  rightmost_cells = mapply(lambda obj: argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1]), objs)  # Find the rightmost cell within each object based on the column index.
  return fill(I, 1, mapply(lambda x: x[1], rightmost_cells))  #  Replace the values at the indices of rightmost cells with '1'. 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`**: Identifies distinct objects within the input grid `I`. Each object represents a group of connected cells with the same value.
2. **`mapply(lambda obj: argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1]), objs)`**:  For each object identified, it finds the cell with the highest column index (rightmost cell) using `argmax` and returns a set of these rightmost cells.
3. **`fill(I, 1, mapply(lambda x: x[1], rightmost_cells))`**: Modifies the input grid `I` by replacing the values at the indices of the rightmost cells (extracted from the previous step) with the value '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  O = I  # Initialize output grid as a copy of the input grid.
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):  # Iterate over each identified object.
    rightmost_index = lrcorner(toindices(obj))  # Directly find the lower-right corner index of the object, which also represents the rightmost cell.
    O = fill(O, 1, {rightmost_index})  # Replace the value at the rightmost index with '1' in the output grid.
  return O  # Return the modified output grid.
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`**: Creates a copy of the input grid `I` and assigns it to `O`, which will be our output grid.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):`**: Iterates through each individual object detected within the input grid.
3. **`rightmost_index = lrcorner(toindices(obj))`**:  For each object, it utilizes the `lrcorner` function to directly determine the index of the lower-right corner, effectively identifying the rightmost cell.
4. **`O = fill(O, 1, {rightmost_index})`**:  The output grid `O` is then modified using the `fill` function to replace the value at the identified `rightmost_index` with '1'.
5. **`return O`**: Finally, the modified output grid `O` is returned.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  def update_cell(cell):
    value, (i, j) = cell  # Extract value and index from the cell tuple.
    return (1 if j == rightmost(obj) else value, (i, j)) # If it's the rightmost cell, change value to 1, otherwise keep the original value. 
  
  O = I  # Initialize the output grid O as a copy of the input grid I.
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):  # Iterate over each object found in the input grid I.
    O = paint(O, frozenset(map(update_cell, obj)))  # Apply the update_cell function to each cell in the object and paint the result onto the output grid O.
  return O  # Return the modified output grid O.
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`update_cell(cell)` function**: Takes a cell (a tuple containing the cell's value and its index) as input. It then checks if the cell's column index (`j`) is the same as the column index of the rightmost cell in the object (`rightmost(obj)`). If they match, indicating it's the rightmost cell, the function returns a new cell tuple with the value changed to '1'. Otherwise, it returns the original cell tuple, preserving its value.
2. **`O = I`**:  Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
3. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):`**: Iterates over each object in the input grid.
4. **`O = paint(O, frozenset(map(update_cell, obj)))`**:  Applies the `update_cell` function to each cell within the current `obj`. This maps the function to each cell, potentially modifying the rightmost cell's value to '1' while keeping other cells unchanged. The resulting set of potentially modified cells is then used to 'paint' onto the output grid `O`.
5. **`return O`**: Finally, the modified output grid `O` is returned.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
    def process_row(row, row_index):
      max_col_index = argmax(range(len(row)), lambda j: (row[j], j))  # Find the column index with the highest value in the row.
      return tuple(1 if j == max_col_index and row[j] != mostcolor(I) else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) # If it's the rightmost non-background cell, change value to 1, otherwise keep the original value. 
    
    return tuple(process_row(row, i) for i, row in enumerate(I))  # Apply process_row to each row in the input grid and return the resulting grid.
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`process_row(row, row_index)` function**: Takes a row from the grid and its index as input. It first identifies the column index (`max_col_index`) holding the maximum value within that row. 
2.  Then, it iterates through each cell in the row. If a cell's column index matches `max_col_index` and its value is not the background color (`mostcolor(I)`), indicating it's the rightmost non-background cell, its value is changed to '1'. Otherwise, the original cell value is retained. The function returns the modified row.
3. **`return tuple(process_row(row, i) for i, row in enumerate(I))`**: Applies the `process_row` function to each row in the input grid `I` and constructs a new grid with the modified rows. This new grid is then returned as the output.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  def rightmost_cell_in_object(obj):
    return argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1])[1] # Find the index of the rightmost cell in the object.

  return paint(I, frozenset((1, rightmost_cell_in_object(obj)) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T))) # Paint '1' at the index of the rightmost cell of each object in the input grid I.
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`rightmost_cell_in_object(obj)` function**:  This function takes an object as input and uses `argmax` to determine the index of the rightmost cell within that object. 
2.  **`paint(I, frozenset((1, rightmost_cell_in_object(obj)) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T)))`**: Identifies all distinct objects in the input grid `I`. Then, for each object, it calls the `rightmost_cell_in_object` function to get the index of its rightmost cell. It then paints the value '1' at those identified rightmost cell indices in the input grid `I`. The modified grid is then returned as the final output.

These are five distinct program versions that achieve the desired transformation using different logic and combinations of DSL functions. They illustrate the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for solving this spatial reasoning task.
