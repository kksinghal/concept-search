## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently identifies the "tail" of the object with color 8 and changes the color of the cell adjacent to the tail to 1. The tail is determined as the cell furthest from the object's center of mass, with a bias towards cells with higher column indices (further to the right) when distances are equal.

**Output_0:** The tail of the 8-colored object is identified as the bottommost '8' in the rightmost column. The cell directly above this tail has its color changed to 1.

**Output_1:** Similarly, the tail is identified as the bottommost '8' in its respective column. The cell above it is then recolored to 1.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  cm = centerofmass(toindices(obj_8))
  def dist_j(cell):
    i, j = cell[1]
    return manhattan((i, j), cm), j
  tail = last(order(totuple(obj_8), dist_j))[1]
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, {(tail[0] - 1, tail[1])}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)`:** Extracts the object with color 8.
2. **`cm = centerofmass(toindices(obj_8))`:**  Calculates the center of mass of the extracted object.
3. **`def dist_j(cell): ... return manhattan((i, j), cm), j`:** Defines a function to calculate the distance of a cell from the center of mass and its column index.
4. **`tail = last(order(totuple(obj_8), dist_j))[1]`:**  Orders the cells of the object based on distance and column index, then selects the last one (furthest with right bias) as the tail.
5. **`return paint(grid, recolor(1, {(tail[0] - 1, tail[1])}))`:** Recolors the cell above the tail to 1.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  cm = centerofmass(obj_8)
  def dist_j(i, j):
    return manhattan((i, j), cm), j
  tail = argmax(toindices(obj_8), lambda loc: dist_j(*loc))
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, {(tail[0] - 1, tail[1])}))
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses `argmax` directly on the indices with a custom function for distance and column index comparison, simplifying the logic compared to version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  cm = centerofmass(toindices(obj_8))
  tail = max(toindices(obj_8), key=lambda loc: (manhattan(loc, cm), loc[1]))
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, {(tail[0] - 1, tail[1])})) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes the `key` argument in `max` to find the tail based on distance and column index, further streamlining the code.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  cm = centerofmass(toindices(obj_8))
  max_dist, tail = 0, None
  for i, j in toindices(obj_8):
    dist = manhattan((i, j), cm)
    if (dist, j) > (max_dist, tail[1] if tail else -1):
      max_dist, tail = dist, (i, j)
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, {(tail[0] - 1, tail[1])}))
```

**Explanation:**

This version iterates through the object's cells, keeping track of the maximum distance and corresponding cell (tail) with a bias towards higher column indices.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def find_tail(obj):
    cm = centerofmass(toindices(obj))
    def dist_and_j(i, j):
      return manhattan((i, j), cm) * 100 + j
    return max(toindices(obj), key=lambda loc: dist_and_j(*loc))

  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  tail = find_tail(obj_8)
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, {(tail[0] - 1, tail[1])})) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version encapsulates the tail-finding logic within the `find_tail` function, improving code readability and modularity. It also scales the distance by 100 and adds the column index for efficient comparison in `max`.

All five versions achieve the desired transformation by identifying the "tail" of the 8-colored object and recoloring the cell above it to 1. Each version employs a distinct approach for finding the tail, showcasing diverse DSL function combinations and logic.
