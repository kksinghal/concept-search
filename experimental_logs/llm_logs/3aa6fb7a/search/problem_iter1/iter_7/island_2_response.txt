## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify the second rightmost cell of each connected object (considering only direct neighbors, not diagonals) and recolor it to '1'. The background color remains unchanged.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The '8' object has its second rightmost cell changed to '1'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

*  The '8' object, now in a different configuration, still has its second rightmost cell in each connected component changed to '1'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def second_rightmost_cell(obj):
    rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
    second_rightmost_indices = frozenset((i, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j == rightmost_j - 1)
    return {(color(obj), index) for index in second_rightmost_indices}

  return paint(I, merge(apply(second_rightmost_cell, objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`second_rightmost_cell(obj)` function:**
    * Finds the column index (`rightmost_j`) of the rightmost cell in the object.
    * Collects indices of cells in the object that are one position to the left of the rightmost column (`rightmost_j - 1`).
    * Returns a set of cells with the object's color and the calculated second rightmost indices. 

2. **Main Program:**
    * Identifies all connected objects in the input grid `I` using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
    * Applies the `second_rightmost_cell` function to each object using `apply`.
    * Merges the resulting sets of cells using `merge`.
    * Paints the collected cells onto the input grid `I` using `paint`, effectively changing the color of the second rightmost cells to '1'.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def mark_second_rightmost(obj):
    rightmost_cells =  frozenset((i, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j == rightmost(obj))
    shifted_obj = shift(obj, (0, -1))
    return {(color(obj), (i, j)) for i, j in toindices(shifted_obj) if (i, j) in rightmost_cells}

  return paint(I, merge(apply(mark_second_rightmost, objects(I, T, F, T)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mark_second_rightmost(obj)` function:**
    * Finds the indices of the rightmost cells in the object.
    * Shifts the object one position to the left.
    * Returns a set containing the cells from the shifted object that were originally the rightmost cells (effectively selecting the second rightmost cells).

2. **Main Program:**
    * Identifies all objects.
    * Applies `mark_second_rightmost` to each object.
    * Merges the results.
    * Paints the merged cells onto the input grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  rightmost_cells = mapply(lambda obj: {(color(obj), (i, rightmost(obj) - 1)) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j == rightmost(obj)}, objs)
  return paint(I, rightmost_cells) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Lambda function inside `mapply`:**
    * For each object, it finds the indices of rightmost cells.
    * Creates a set of tuples, where each tuple contains the object's color and the index of the cell to the left of the rightmost cell.

2. **Main Program:**
    * Finds all objects.
    * Uses `mapply` to apply the lambda function to each object and merges the results into `rightmost_cells`.
    * Paints the `rightmost_cells` onto the input grid.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def rightmost_indices(obj):
    return frozenset((i, rightmost(obj)) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j == rightmost(obj))
  
  def second_rightmost(obj):
    return shift(rightmost_indices(obj), (0, -1))

  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: {(color(obj), index) for index in second_rightmost(obj)}, objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`rightmost_indices(obj)` function:** Returns indices of the rightmost cells in an object.
2. **`second_rightmost(obj)` function:** Shifts the rightmost indices one position to the left. 
3. **Main Program:**
    * Finds all objects.
    * Applies a lambda function to each object, which:
        * Finds the second rightmost indices using `second_rightmost`.
        * Creates a set of tuples containing the object's color and the second rightmost indices.
    * Merges the results and paints them onto the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def shifted_rightmost(obj):
    return {(color(obj), (i, j - 1)) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j == rightmost(obj)}
  
  return paint(I, merge(apply(shifted_rightmost, objects(I, T, F, T)))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_rightmost(obj)` function:**
    *  Directly calculates the indices of cells to the left of the rightmost cells within each object.
    * Returns a set of cells with the object's color and the calculated indices.

2. **Main Program:**
    * Finds all objects in the input grid.
    * Applies the `shifted_rightmost` function to each object.
    * Merges the resulting sets.
    * Paints the merged set onto the input grid. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic.
