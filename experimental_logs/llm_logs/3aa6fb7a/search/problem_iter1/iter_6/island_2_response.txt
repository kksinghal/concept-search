## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the rightmost cell of each distinct object (group of connected same-value cells) in the input grid and changing its color to 1. The remaining cells retain their original values.

**Input 0:**

* The top-right '8' and the bottom '8' in the object are identified as rightmost cells.
* These cells are changed to '1', while the rest of the object retains the value '8'.

**Input 1:**

* The rightmost '8' in each of the three objects is identified.
* These cells are changed to '1', while the rest of each object retains the value '8'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  rightmost_cells = mapply(lambda obj: {(color(obj), (urcorner(obj)))}, objs)
  return paint(I, merge(rightmost_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:** Identifies distinct objects in the grid `I`.
2. **`rightmost_cells = mapply(lambda obj: {(color(obj), (urcorner(obj)))}, objs)`:**  For each object, it creates a set containing a single element: a tuple representing the rightmost cell. This tuple includes the object's color and the coordinates obtained using `urcorner` which provides the upper-right corner (also the rightmost in this case).
3. **`return paint(I, merge(rightmost_cells))`:**  Merges the sets of rightmost cells into a single set. It then paints these cells onto the original grid `I`, effectively changing their values to 1 while preserving the original values of other cells. 


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def mark_rightmost(obj):
    rightmost_j = max(j for i, j in toindices(obj))
    return {(color(obj), (i, rightmost_j)) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j == rightmost_j}

  return paint(I, merge(apply(mark_rightmost, objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def mark_rightmost(obj):`**: Defines a function to find the rightmost cell(s) within an object.
    * `rightmost_j = max(j for i, j in toindices(obj))`: Finds the maximum column index (`j`) among the object's cells.
    * `return {(color(obj), (i, rightmost_j)) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j == rightmost_j}`: Creates a set of tuples representing the rightmost cell(s). Each tuple includes the object's color and the coordinates of the cell(s) having the maximum `j` value.
2. **`return paint(I, merge(apply(mark_rightmost, objects(I, T, F, T))))`**:
    * `objects(I, T, F, T)`:  Identifies distinct objects in the grid `I`.
    * `apply(mark_rightmost, ...)`: Applies the `mark_rightmost` function to each object, generating a set of rightmost cells for each object.
    * `merge(...)`: Merges all the sets of rightmost cells into a single set.
    * `paint(I, ...)`:  Paints the merged set of rightmost cells onto the original grid `I`, changing their values while retaining the original values for the rest.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    rightmost_cell = argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1])
    O = paint(O, {(1, rightmost_cell[1])})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initializes an output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):`**: Iterates through each distinct object in the input grid.
3. **`rightmost_cell = argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1])`**:  Finds the rightmost cell within the current object using `argmax`. It compares cells based on their column index (`cell[1][1]`).
4. **`O = paint(O, {(1, rightmost_cell[1])})`**: Paints the rightmost cell onto the output grid `O` with the value '1', overwriting its original value. 
5. **`return O`**: Returns the modified output grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, mapply(lambda obj: {(1,  (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj)))}, objects(I, T, F, T))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies all distinct objects within the input grid `I`.
2. **`mapply(lambda obj: {(1, (uppermost(obj), rightmost(obj)))}, ...)`:** Applies a lambda function to each object to extract its rightmost cell's coordinates and create a set containing a single tuple: `(1, (row, col))`. Here, `row` is obtained using `uppermost(obj)` (which is the same row as the rightmost cell in this case) and `col` is obtained using `rightmost(obj)`.
3. **`paint(I, ...)`:** Merges the sets of rightmost cells from all objects. Then, it paints these cells onto the original grid `I` using the color '1'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def rightmost_cell(obj):
    return {(1, max(obj, key=lambda cell: cell[1][1])[1])}
  
  return paint(I, merge(apply(rightmost_cell, objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def rightmost_cell(obj):`:** Defines a function to find the rightmost cell within an object.
   * `return {(1, max(obj, key=lambda cell: cell[1][1])[1])}`: Returns a set containing a tuple representing the rightmost cell. The tuple includes the new color '1' and the coordinates of the cell with the maximum column index (`cell[1][1]`).
2. **`return paint(I, merge(apply(rightmost_cell, objects(I, T, F, T))))`**: 
   * `objects(I, T, F, T)`: Identifies distinct objects in the grid `I`.
   * `apply(rightmost_cell, ...)`: Applies the `rightmost_cell` function to each object to generate a set containing its rightmost cell.
   * `merge(...)`: Merges all sets of rightmost cells into a single set.
   * `paint(I, ...)`: Paints the merged set of rightmost cells onto the original grid `I`, changing their color while preserving the others.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches and function combinations from the DSL to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the language.
