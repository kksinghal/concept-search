## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the object with color '8' and aims to recolor specific cells within this object to '1'. The recoloring pattern suggests identifying the "tail" of the object, where the tail is defined as the furthest cell from the object's center of mass, prioritizing cells with higher column indices in case of ties. 

**Input 0:**

- The tail of the '8' object is at (4, 5).
- The transformation recolors the cell at (4, 5) and (1, 2) to '1'. 

**Input 1:**

- The tail of the '8' object is at (6, 3).
- The transformation recolors the cell at (6, 3), (3, 2), (5, 1) and (1, 4) to '1'.

**Observations:**

- The program identifies the '8' object and calculates its center of mass.
- It then determines the 'tail' cell as the farthest cell from the center of mass, breaking ties by selecting the cell with a higher column index.
-  Finally, the program recolors the 'tail' cell and the cell with i index 1 and j index of tail to '1'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code that achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:** Using `order` and `last`

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  cm = centerofmass(toindices(obj_8))
  def dist_j(cell):
    i, j = cell[1]
    return manhattan((i, j), cm), j
  tail = last(order(totuple(obj_8), dist_j))[1]
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, {(1, tail[1]) , (tail[0], tail[1])}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)`:** Extracts the object with color '8' from the grid.
2. **`cm = centerofmass(toindices(obj_8))`:** Calculates the center of mass of the extracted object.
3. **`def dist_j(cell): ... return manhattan((i, j), cm), j`:** Defines a function to calculate the Manhattan distance of a cell from the center of mass and its column index.
4. **`tail = last(order(totuple(obj_8), dist_j))[1]`:** Orders the cells of the object based on distance from the center of mass (larger distances first) and column index (larger indices first), then selects the last cell (the tail) and extracts its index.
5. **`return paint(grid, recolor(1, {(1, tail[1]) , (tail[0], tail[1])})))`:** Recolors the 'tail' cell and the cell with i index 1 and j index of tail  to '1' on the original grid.

**Version 2:** Using `argmax`

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  cm = centerofmass(toindices(obj_8))
  def dist_j(cell):
    i, j = cell[1]
    return (manhattan((i, j), cm), j)
  tail = argmax(obj_8, dist_j)[1]
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, {(1, tail[1]), (tail[0], tail[1])}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)`:** Extracts the object with color '8' from the grid.
2. **`cm = centerofmass(toindices(obj_8))`:** Calculates the center of mass of the extracted object.
3. **`def dist_j(cell): ... return (manhattan((i, j), cm), j)`:** Defines a function to calculate the Manhattan distance of a cell from the center of mass and its column index as a tuple.
4. **`tail = argmax(obj_8, dist_j)[1]`:**  Finds the cell in the object that maximizes the `dist_j` function (effectively finding the tail) and extracts its index.
5. **`return paint(grid, recolor(1, {(1, tail[1]), (tail[0], tail[1])}))`:** Recolors the 'tail' cell and the cell with i index 1 and j index of tail to '1' on the original grid.

**Version 3:** Using a loop and conditional updates

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  cm = centerofmass(toindices(obj_8))
  max_dist = 0
  tail = None
  for _, (i, j) in obj_8:
    dist = manhattan((i, j), cm)
    if dist > max_dist:
      max_dist = dist
      tail = (i, j)
    elif dist == max_dist and j > tail[1]:
      tail = (i, j)
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, {(1, tail[1]), (tail[0], tail[1])}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)`:** Extracts the object with color '8' from the grid.
2. **`cm = centerofmass(toindices(obj_8))`:** Calculates the center of mass of the extracted object.
3. **`max_dist = 0; tail = None`:** Initializes variables to track the maximum distance and the corresponding cell (tail).
4. **`for _, (i, j) in obj_8: ...`:** Iterates through each cell in the object.
5. **`dist = manhattan((i, j), cm)`:** Calculates the Manhattan distance of the current cell from the center of mass.
6. **`if dist > max_dist: ... elif dist == max_dist and j > tail[1]: ...`:** Updates `max_dist` and `tail` if a cell is found that is farther from the center of mass or at the same distance but with a higher column index.
7. **`return paint(grid, recolor(1, {(1, tail[1]), (tail[0], tail[1])}))`:**  Recolors the 'tail' cell and the cell with i index 1 and j index of tail to '1' on the original grid.

**Version 4:** Using `max` with a custom key function

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  cm = centerofmass(toindices(obj_8))
  tail = max(obj_8, key=lambda cell: (manhattan(cell[1], cm), cell[1][1]))[1]
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, {(1, tail[1]), (tail[0], tail[1])})) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)`:** Extracts the object with color '8' from the grid.
2. **`cm = centerofmass(toindices(obj_8))`:** Calculates the center of mass of the extracted object.
3. **`tail = max(obj_8, key=lambda cell: (manhattan(cell[1], cm), cell[1][1]))[1]`:** Finds the cell in the object that maximizes a tuple containing the Manhattan distance from the center of mass and the column index, then extracts its index.
4. **`return paint(grid, recolor(1, {(1, tail[1]), (tail[0], tail[1])}))`:** Recolors the 'tail' cell and the cell with i index 1 and j index of tail to '1' on the original grid.

**Version 5:** Combining distance and column index into a single value

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def find_tail(obj):
    cm = centerofmass(toindices(obj))
    def dist_and_j(cell):
      i, j = cell[1]
      return manhattan((i, j), cm) * 100 + j
    tail = max(obj, key=dist_and_j)[1]
    return tail

  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  tail = find_tail(obj_8)
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, {(1, tail[1]), (tail[0], tail[1])})) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def find_tail(obj): ...`:** Defines a function to find the tail cell of an object.
2. **`cm = centerofmass(toindices(obj))`:** Calculates the center of mass of the input object.
3. **`def dist_and_j(cell): ... return manhattan((i, j), cm) * 100 + j`:** Defines a function that combines the Manhattan distance of a cell from the center of mass with its column index into a single value (multiplying the distance by 100 ensures that distance takes priority).
4. **`tail = max(obj, key=dist_and_j)[1]`:** Finds the cell in the object that maximizes the `dist_and_j` function (effectively finding the tail) and extracts its index.
5. **`obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)`:** Extracts the object with color '8' from the grid.
6. **`tail = find_tail(obj_8)`:**  Finds the tail cell of the extracted object.
7. **`return paint(grid, recolor(1, {(1, tail[1]), (tail[0], tail[1])}))`:** Recolors the 'tail' cell and the cell with i index 1 and j index of tail to '1' on the original grid.


These are just five examples of how you could write the "Program_to_be_generated" code. There are many other valid solutions using different DSL functions and logic. The key is to understand the desired transformation and then use the available DSL functions to express that transformation in code.
