## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the rightmost cell of each connected object (considering only directly adjacent cells, not diagonals) in the input grid and changing its value to '1'. 

**Let's break it down:**

1. **Object Detection:** The code needs to identify individual objects in the grid. An object is defined as a group of connected cells with the same value, where connectivity is determined by direct adjacency (up, down, left, right).

2. **Finding the Rightmost Cell:** For each identified object, the code needs to determine the cell with the highest column index (i.e., the rightmost cell).

3. **Value Replacement:** Finally, the code should replace the value of the rightmost cell in each object with '1' while keeping other cells unchanged. 

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program that achieve the desired transformation:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Find all objects
  rightmost_cells = mapply(lambda obj: argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1]), objs) # Find rightmost cell in each object
  O = fill(I, 1, mapply(lambda x: x[1], rightmost_cells)) # Replace with '1'
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  This line identifies all connected objects in the input grid `I`. `T, F, T` arguments ensure we consider objects with the same value, only direct neighbors, and exclude the background. 
2. **`rightmost_cells = mapply(lambda obj: argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1]), objs)`:**  This line finds the rightmost cell in each object. `argmax` is used to find the cell within each object that maximizes the second element of its index (column index). `mapply` applies this logic to all objects.
3. **`O = fill(I, 1, mapply(lambda x: x[1], rightmost_cells))`:** This line fills the input grid `I` with '1' at the indices of the rightmost cells. 

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
    rightmost_cell = argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1])
    O = fill(O, 1, {rightmost_cell[1]})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initialize output grid `O` with input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):`:**  Iterate over each object in the input grid.
3. **`rightmost_cell = argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1])`:** Find the rightmost cell within the current object.
4. **`O = fill(O, 1, {rightmost_cell[1]})`:** Update the output grid `O` by filling the rightmost cell with '1'.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
    def rightmost_index(obj):
        return max(obj, key=lambda cell: cell[1][1])[1]
    right_indices = apply(rightmost_index, objects(I, T, F, T))
    return fill(I, 1, right_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def rightmost_index(obj)`:**  Defines a helper function to get the index of the rightmost cell in an object.
2. **`right_indices = apply(rightmost_index, objects(I, T, F, T))`:** Applies the `rightmost_index` function to each object to get a set of rightmost cell indices.
3. **`return fill(I, 1, right_indices)`:** Fills the input grid with '1' at the identified rightmost indices.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):
      rightmost_cell = argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1])
      O = paint(O, {(1, rightmost_cell[1])})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(mostcolor(I), shape(I))`:** Creates an empty canvas `O` of the same size and background color as the input grid.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):`:**  Iterates over each object in the input grid.
3. **`rightmost_cell = argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1])`:** Finds the rightmost cell within each object.
4. **`O = paint(O, {(1, rightmost_cell[1])})`:**  Paints the rightmost cell on the canvas `O` with value '1'.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
    def process_row(row):
        obj = None
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if obj is None and val != mostcolor(I):
                obj = (val, j)
            elif obj is not None and val != obj[0]:
                row = row[:obj[1]] + (1,) + row[obj[1] + 1:]
                obj = None
        if obj is not None:
            row = row[:obj[1]] + (1,) + row[obj[1] + 1:]
        return row
    return tuple(process_row(row) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def process_row(row)`:** Defines a helper function to process each row and replace the rightmost cell of each object with '1'.
2. **`return tuple(process_row(row) for row in I)`:**  Applies the `process_row` function to each row in the input grid and returns the modified grid.

These five versions provide diverse implementations using different DSL functions and logic while achieving the same desired transformation.
