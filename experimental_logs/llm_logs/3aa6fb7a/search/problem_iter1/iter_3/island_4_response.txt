## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation in both examples involves identifying the "tail" of the object with color 8 and recoloring it to color 1. 

* **Tail Definition:** The tail is determined by finding the cell furthest from the object's center of mass. If multiple cells share the maximum distance, the tail is the rightmost cell among them.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. The tail of the '8'-colored object is identified at location (4, 5).
2. This tail cell is recolored to '1'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. The tail of the '8'-colored object is identified at location (5, 3).
2. This tail cell is recolored to '1'.


## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using different approaches and DSL functions:

**Version 1: Iterative Approach**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def find_tail(obj):
    cm = centerofmass(obj)
    max_dist = 0
    tail = None
    for value, (i, j) in obj:
      dist = manhattan((i, j), cm)
      if dist > max_dist:
        max_dist = dist
        tail = (i, j)
      elif dist == max_dist and j > tail[1]:
        tail = (i, j)
    return tail

  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  tail = find_tail(obj_8)
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, {tail}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`find_tail(obj)` function:** 
   - Calculates the center of mass (`cm`) of the input object.
   - Iterates through each cell (`i`, `j`) of the object.
   - Calculates the Manhattan distance (`dist`) of the cell from the center of mass.
   - Updates the `max_dist` and `tail` if a cell with a larger distance is found or if the distances are equal, but the current cell is further to the right (larger `j`).
   - Returns the coordinates of the tail cell.

2. **Main function:**
   - Extracts the object with color 8 (`obj_8`).
   - Finds the tail of the extracted object using `find_tail(obj_8)`.
   - Recolors the tail cell to 1 and paints it back onto the grid.

**Version 2: Using `argmax` and Custom Key**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  cm = centerofmass(obj_8)
  def dist_func(cell):
    value, (i, j) = cell
    return -manhattan((i, j), cm), -j 
  tail = argmax(obj_8, key=dist_func)
  tail_idx = tail[1]
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, {tail_idx}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`dist_func(cell)` function:**
   - Calculates the Manhattan distance from the center of mass and negates it to find the maximum distance with `argmax`.
   - Uses the negative column index (`-j`) as a secondary key to prioritize rightmost cells.

2. **Main function:**
   - Finds the `obj_8` and its `cm` as in Version 1.
   - Uses `argmax` with the custom `dist_func` to find the tail cell directly within the object.
   - Extracts the tail index and recolors it to 1. 

**Version 3: Sorting Based Approach**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  cm = centerofmass(obj_8)
  sorted_cells = sorted(obj_8, key=lambda cell: (-manhattan(cell[1], cm), -cell[1][1]))
  tail = sorted_cells[0][1]
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, {tail}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Main function:**
   - Extracts the object with color 8 and its center of mass.
   - Sorts the cells in the object based on their Manhattan distance from the center of mass (descending) and column index (descending) using a custom sorting key.
   - The tail is the first element in the sorted list.
   - Recolors the tail to 1 and paints it back onto the grid.

**Version 4: Using `maximum` and Custom Key**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  cm = centerofmass(obj_8)
  def dist_func(cell):
    value, (i, j) = cell
    return manhattan((i, j), cm) * 100 + j 
  tail = maximum(obj_8, key=dist_func)[1]
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, {tail}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`dist_func(cell)` function:**
   - Calculates a combined value based on the Manhattan distance (multiplied by 100 for prioritization) and the column index.
   - This ensures that cells further from the center of mass have higher values, and among them, the rightmost cell is chosen. 

2. **Main function:**
   - Extracts the object with color 8 and its center of mass.
   - Uses `maximum` with the custom `dist_func` to directly find the tail cell.
   - Recolors the tail to 1 and paints it back onto the grid.

**Version 5: Filtering and Maximum**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  cm = centerofmass(obj_8)
  max_dist = valmax(obj_8, lambda cell: manhattan(cell[1], cm))
  tail_candidates = sfilter(obj_8, lambda cell: manhattan(cell[1], cm) == max_dist)
  tail = maximum(tail_candidates, key=lambda cell: cell[1][1])[1]
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, {tail}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Main function:**
   - Extracts the object with color 8 and its center of mass.
   - Finds the maximum distance (`max_dist`) of any cell from the center of mass.
   - Filters the object to keep only cells at the `max_dist`.
   - Finds the rightmost cell among the filtered cells using `maximum` with a custom key that prioritizes higher column indices. 
   - Recolors the tail to 1 and paints it back onto the grid. 

These are five distinct solutions to the problem, each utilizing different functions and strategies within the DSL. They demonstrate the flexibility and expressive power of the DSL for solving spatial reasoning tasks.
