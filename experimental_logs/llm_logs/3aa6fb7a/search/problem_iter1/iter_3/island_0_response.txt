## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the cells directly above and below the digit '8' and changing their values to '1'. 

**Input_0:**

- The '8's at (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), and (4,5) result in '1's being placed at (0,1), (2,4), (3,1), (4,4), (4,5).

**Input_1:**

- The '8's at (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3), (5,3), (6,3), and (6,4) result in '1's being placed at (1,4), (2,5), (1,2), (3,5), (2,2), (4,3), (5,2), and (6,5).


## Program Versions & Explanations:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  up_shifted = shift(ofcolor(I, 8), UP)
  down_shifted = shift(ofcolor(I, 8), DOWN)
  target_indices = up_shifted | down_shifted
  O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`up_shifted = shift(ofcolor(I, 8), UP)`:** This line identifies the indices of all '8's in the input grid (`ofcolor(I, 8)`) and then shifts them one cell upwards (`shift(..., UP)`).
2. **`down_shifted = shift(ofcolor(I, 8), DOWN)`:** Similar to the previous line, this identifies the indices of '8's and shifts them one cell downwards.
3. **`target_indices = up_shifted | down_shifted`:** This combines the indices from both `up_shifted` and `down_shifted`, resulting in a set of all indices that need to be changed to '1'.
4. **`O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)`:** Finally, this line takes the input grid (`I`) and fills the `target_indices` with the value '1', generating the output grid (`O`).

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_indices = mapply(lambda d: shift(ofcolor(I, 8), d), [UP, DOWN])
  O = fill(I, 1, shifted_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_indices = mapply(lambda d: shift(ofcolor(I, 8), d), [UP, DOWN])`:** This line utilizes `mapply` to apply a lambda function to each direction in the list `[UP, DOWN]`. The lambda function takes a direction (`d`) and shifts the indices of '8's in that direction. Finally, `mapply` merges the results into a single set.
2. **`O = fill(I, 1, shifted_indices)`:** This line fills the `shifted_indices` in the input grid (`I`) with the value '1' to produce the output grid (`O`).

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for d in [UP, DOWN]:
    O = fill(O, 1, shift(ofcolor(I, 8), d))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** This line initializes the output grid (`O`) as a copy of the input grid (`I`).
2. **`for d in [UP, DOWN]:`**: This loop iterates through the directions 'UP' and 'DOWN'.
3. **`O = fill(O, 1, shift(ofcolor(I, 8), d))`:** For each direction, it fills the output grid (`O`) with the value '1' at the shifted indices of '8's.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: any(n in ofcolor(I, 8) for n in [(loc[0] + 1, loc[1]), (loc[0] - 1, loc[1])]))
  O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`target_indices = ...`**: This line finds the indices of cells that are directly above or below a cell containing the digit '8'. It does this by:
    - Getting all indices in the grid (`asindices(I)`).
    - Filtering the indices using `mfilter` to keep only those where the lambda function returns `True`.
    - The lambda function checks if any of the neighboring cells in the up or down direction (`(loc[0] + 1, loc[1])`, `(loc[0] - 1, loc[1])`) contain the digit '8' (`n in ofcolor(I, 8)`).
2. **`O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)`:** Fills the `target_indices` in the input grid (`I`) with '1' to produce the output grid (`O`).

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  one_neighbors = mapply(lambda loc: dneighbors(loc) & asindices(I), ofcolor(I, 8))
  target_indices =  one_neighbors - ofcolor(I, 8)
  O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`one_neighbors = ...`:** This line finds all direct neighbors of cells containing '8'. It does this by:
    - Getting the indices of all '8's (`ofcolor(I, 8)`).
    - Using `mapply` to apply a lambda function to each '8' index.
    - The lambda function finds the direct neighbors of the current '8' index using `dneighbors(loc)` and keeps only those neighbors that are within the grid boundaries (`& asindices(I)`).
2. **`target_indices =  one_neighbors - ofcolor(I, 8)`:** Removes the indices of the '8's themselves from the set of their neighbors, leaving only the indices of the target cells.
3. **`O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)`:** Fills the `target_indices` in the input grid (`I`) with '1' to produce the output grid (`O`).
