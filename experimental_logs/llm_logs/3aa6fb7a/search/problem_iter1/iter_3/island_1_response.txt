## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify the "corner" cells of each connected object (considering only directly adjacent cells, not diagonal) and recolor them to '1'. The background color remains unchanged. 

* **Input_0:** The object formed by '8's has its top-left and bottom-right corners recolored to '1'.
* **Input_1:**  Similarly, the top-right and bottom-left corners of the '8' object are recolored. 


## Program Version 1: 

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  corner_indices = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for c, (i, j) in obj:
      neighbors_same = [(ni, nj) for (nc, (ni, nj)) in obj if (ni, nj) in dneighbors((i, j))]
      if len(neighbors_same) < 2:
        corner_indices.add((i, j))
  O = fill(I, 1, corner_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` finds all connected objects (without diagonals) in the input grid `I`, excluding the background.
2. **Find Corners:**  The code iterates through each cell of each object. For each cell, it checks how many of its directly adjacent neighbors belong to the same object using `neighbors_same`. If the count is less than 2, it's considered a corner and added to `corner_indices`.
3. **Recolor:** Finally, the `fill` function recolors the cells in `corner_indices` to '1'.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    for i, j in toindices(obj):
      if len(set(index(I, (i+di, j+dj)) for di, dj in [(0,1), (1,0)]) & set(index(I, (i+di, j+dj)) for di, dj in [(0,-1), (-1,0)])) == 0:
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to version 1, `objs = objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies the objects.
2. **Corner Check:** For every cell in each object, it checks if both its right/bottom neighbors and its left/top neighbors are part of the same object. If not, it indicates a corner.
3. **Recolor:** The `fill` function recolors the identified corner cells to '1'.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I)):
      if index(I, (i, j)) != mostcolor(I) and len(set(index(I, (i+di, j+dj)) for di, dj in [(0,1), (1,0)]) & set(index(I, (i+di, j+dj)) for di, dj in [(0,-1), (-1,0)])) == 0:
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate Cells:** This version directly iterates through every cell in the grid.
2. **Corner Check:**  For each non-background cell, it performs the same right/bottom and left/top neighbor check as version 2 to identify corners.
3. **Recolor:** It uses `fill` to recolor identified corner cells.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  corner_indices = set()
  for obj in objs:
    for c, (i, j) in obj:
      if len(dneighbors((i, j)) & toindices(obj)) < 4:
        corner_indices.add((i, j))
  return fill(I, 1, corner_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Corner Check:**  For each cell in an object, it checks if the number of directly adjacent neighbors belonging to the same object is less than 4. This condition holds true only for corner cells.
3. **Recolor:**  The `fill` function is used for recoloring.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    indices = toindices(obj)
    for i, j in indices:
      if not ( any((i-1, j) in indices, (i+1, j) in indices) and any((i, j-1) in indices, (i, j+1) in indices) ):
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
  return O
```
**Explanation:**
1. **Identify Objects:**  Uses `objects` function to get a set of objects from the input grid.
2. **Iterate through Objects and Cells:** Iterates over each object and then each cell within that object.
3. **Corner Check:** For each cell, it verifies if it's a corner by checking the presence of adjacent cells (top/bottom and left/right) belonging to the same object.
4. **Recolor Corners:**  If a cell is identified as a corner, it's recolored to '1' in the output grid.

All five versions achieve the same corner recoloring transformation but employ different logic and DSL function combinations.
