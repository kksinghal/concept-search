## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation modifies the input grid by identifying the second-to-last cell of each object (connected group of same-valued digits excluding the background) along the horizontal axis. This cell's value is then changed to '1', while the rest of the grid remains unchanged.

**Example:**

- **Input_0:** The second-to-last '8' in the top object is changed to '1'. Similarly, the second-to-last '8' in the bottom object is changed to '1'.
- **Input_1:**  The second-to-last '8' in each of the three objects is changed to '1'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program:

**Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def second_rightmost(obj):
    return frozenset((i, j - 1) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j == rightmost(obj))

  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: {(color(obj), index) for index in second_rightmost(obj)}, objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`second_rightmost(obj)` function:** This function takes an object as input and returns a frozenset containing the indices of the second-rightmost cells in that object.
2. **`objects(I, T, F, T)`:** This function identifies all objects in the input grid `I`, considering objects with connected cells (T), not allowing diagonal connections (F), and excluding the background (T).
3. **`apply(...)`:**  For each object obtained in the previous step, this applies a lambda function that:
    - Extracts the color of the object using `color(obj)`.
    - Calls the `second_rightmost(obj)` function to get the indices of the second-rightmost cells.
    - Creates a set of tuples, where each tuple contains the object's color and the index of a second-rightmost cell.
4. **`merge(...)`:** This merges all the sets generated in the previous step into a single frozenset containing tuples of (color, index) for all second-rightmost cells.
5. **`paint(I, ...)`:** This function paints the input grid `I` by setting the cells at the indices from the previous step to the corresponding color (which is '1' in this case).

**Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def mark_second_rightmost(obj):
    rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
    return frozenset({(color(obj), (i, j - 1)) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j == rightmost_j and (i, j - 1) in toindices(obj)})

  return paint(I, merge(apply(mark_second_rightmost, objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 1, but it ensures that the second-rightmost cell actually exists within the object's boundaries before including it.

**Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: {(color(obj), (i, rightmost(obj) - 1)) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j == rightmost(obj) and 0 <= rightmost(obj) - 1 < len(I[0])}, objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version integrates the second-rightmost cell identification and boundary check directly within the lambda function, resulting in a more concise code structure.

**Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def second_rightmost_cells(obj):
    rm_col = rightmost(obj)
    return frozenset({(color(obj), (i, rm_col - 1)) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j == rm_col and (i, rm_col - 1) in toindices(obj)})

  return paint(I, merge(apply(second_rightmost_cells, objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version defines a separate function `second_rightmost_cells` to encapsulate the logic of finding the second-rightmost cells within an object, making the code more modular.

**Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def rightmost_indices(obj):
    return frozenset((i, j) for i, j in toindices(obj) if j == rightmost(obj))
  
  def shift_left(indices):
    return frozenset((i, j - 1) for i, j in indices if (i, j - 1) in toindices(obj))

  return paint(I, merge(apply(lambda obj: {(color(obj), index) for index in shift_left(rightmost_indices(obj))}, objects(I, T, F, T))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version breaks down the logic into two separate functions: `rightmost_indices` to find the rightmost indices and `shift_left` to shift them one position to the left. This further modularizes the code, enhancing readability and maintainability.
