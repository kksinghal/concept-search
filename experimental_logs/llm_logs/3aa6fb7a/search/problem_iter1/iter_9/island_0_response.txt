## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation consistently targets cells directly adjacent to the '8' objects and fills them with '1's, but only if those cells are initially '0's. It operates under the constraint of not altering the '8' object itself. 

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

* The cells to the right of the top two '8's and below the rightmost '8' are filled with '1's.
* Other cells adjacent to the '8' object remain unchanged because they are not '0's.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

* Similarly, cells to the right of the top two '8's and below the three rightmost '8's are filled with '1's.
* Again, pre-existing non-zero values adjacent to the '8' object remain untouched.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_indices = mfilter(
      merge(
          apply(lambda loc: {(loc[0] + 1, loc[1])}, ofcolor(I, 8)),  # Downward neighbors
          apply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + 1)}, ofcolor(I, 8))   # Rightward neighbors
      ),
      lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0                                   # Filter for '0's
  )
  O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)                                     # Fill with '1's
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '8' neighbors:**  Find indices of cells directly below and to the right of every '8' in the input grid.
2. **Filter for '0's:** Keep only those neighbor indices where the original input grid has a '0'.
3. **Fill with '1's:** Create the output grid by filling the selected indices with '1's while leaving the rest of the input grid unchanged.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_indices = ofcolor(I, 8)                                  # Indices of '8's
  right_neighbors = mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0], loc[1] + 1)}, obj_indices)
  down_neighbors = mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0] + 1, loc[1])}, obj_indices)
  target_indices = sfilter(right_neighbors | down_neighbors, lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 0)
  O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '8' indices:** Get the indices of all '8's in the grid.
2. **Calculate neighbor indices:** Separately calculate indices of right and down neighbors for each '8'.
3. **Combine and filter:** Merge neighbor sets and filter to keep only those with '0' in the input.
4. **Fill:**  Fill the selected neighbor indices in the output grid with '1's.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I) - 1):
      for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1):
          if I[i][j] == 8 and I[i][j+1] == 0:
              O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j+1)})
          if I[i][j] == 8 and I[i+1][j] == 0:
              O = fill(O, 1, {(i+1, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and Check:** Iterates through each cell, checking if it's an '8' and if its right or down neighbor is a '0'.
2. **Fill if Condition Met:** If the conditions are met, it fills the corresponding neighbor cell in the output grid with a '1'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  padded_I = ((0,) * (len(I[0]) + 2),) + tuple((0,) + row + (0,) for row in I) + ((0,) * (len(I[0]) + 2),)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i in range(1, len(padded_I) - 1):
      for j in range(1, len(padded_I[0]) - 1):
          if padded_I[i][j] == 8 and padded_I[i][j + 1] == 0:
              O = fill(O, 1, {(i - 1, j)})
          if padded_I[i][j] == 8 and padded_I[i + 1][j] == 0:
              O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j - 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Padding:** Creates a padded version of the input grid to avoid boundary checks.
2. **Iterate and Check:** Iterates through the padded grid, checking if a cell is '8' and its right or down neighbor is '0'.
3. **Fill with Adjustment:** If the condition is met, it fills the corresponding neighbor cell in the output grid with '1', adjusting the indices to account for padding.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_right = shift(asobject(I), RIGHT)
  shifted_down = shift(asobject(I), DOWN)
  filtered_right = sfilter(shifted_right, lambda cell: cell[0] == 0 and (cell[1][0] - 1, cell[1][1]) in ofcolor(I, 8))
  filtered_down = sfilter(shifted_down, lambda cell: cell[0] == 0 and (cell[1][0], cell[1][1] - 1) in ofcolor(I, 8))
  O = paint(paint(I, recolor(1, toindices(filtered_right))), recolor(1, toindices(filtered_down)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift and Filter:** Shifts the entire grid right and down, then filters for cells that were initially '0' and are now adjacent to an '8'.
2. **Paint Twice:** Paints the output grid twice, once for each shifted and filtered set, effectively filling the target cells with '1's.
