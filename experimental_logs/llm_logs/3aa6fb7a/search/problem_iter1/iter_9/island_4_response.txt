## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects with the color '8'. The goal is to find the 'tail' of each '8' object and replace the cell adjacent to the tail with a '1'. 

**Definition of a Tail:** A tail is defined as the cell within an object furthest from the object's center of mass. In cases of multiple cells with the same distance, the rightmost cell is chosen.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. The tail of the top-left '8' object is identified at (2,1). The adjacent cell (2,2) remains unchanged because it is already part of the same '8' object. 
2. The tail of the bottom-right '8' object is identified at (4,6). The adjacent cell (4,5) is replaced with '1'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

1. The tail of the top-right '8' object is identified at (1,6). The adjacent cell (1,5) is replaced with '1'.
2. The tail of the bottom-left '8' object is identified at (6,1). The adjacent cell (6,2) remains unchanged because it is already part of the same '8' object.
3. The tail of the middle '8' object is identified at (3,2). The adjacent cell (3,1) is replaced with '1'.
4. The tail of the isolated bottom '8' object is identified at (5,4). The adjacent cell (5,3) is replaced with '1'.

## Program_to_be_generated:

### Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(grid):
  def find_tail(obj):
    cm = centerofmass(toindices(obj))
    def dist_and_j(cell):
      i, j = cell[1]
      return manhattan((i, j), cm), j
    return last(order(obj, dist_and_j))[1]

  def find_adjacent_8(grid, tail):
    i, j = tail
    neighbors = {(i - 1, j), (i + 1, j), (i, j - 1), (i, j + 1)}
    for loc in neighbors:
      if 0 <= loc[0] < len(grid) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(grid[0]) and grid[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 0:
        return loc
    return None
  
  new_grid = grid
  for obj in objects(grid, False, True, True):
    if color(obj) == 8:
      tail = find_tail(obj)
      adjacent_8 = find_adjacent_8(grid, tail)
      if adjacent_8:
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, recolor(1, {adjacent_8}))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`find_tail(obj)`:** This function remains the same, identifying the tail cell of an object.
2. **`find_adjacent_8(grid, tail)`:** This function now iterates through the neighbors and returns the first neighbor that has the value '0'. 
3. The main loop iterates through objects, finding the tail and replacing the adjacent '0' cell with '1'.

**Improvements:**

- **Efficiency:** Instead of extracting the object with color '8' repeatedly, the program now iterates through all objects only once.
- **Clarity:** The code is more concise and easier to follow.
