## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the 'tail' of each connected component of 8s in the grid and replacing the 8 adjacent to the tail with a 1. The tail is defined as the 8 furthest away from the center of mass of the connected component, with a bias towards higher column indices in case of a tie.

**Input_0:**

- The connected component of 8s is L-shaped. 
- The center of mass is approximately at (2, 2).
- The tail is the 8 at (4,1) (furthest from the center of mass, with a higher column index compared to the 8 at (1,2)).
- The 8 adjacent to the tail at (3,1) is replaced by 1.

**Input_1:**

- There are two connected components of 8s.
- For the upper component, the tail is at (5,1) and the adjacent 8 at (5,0) is replaced by 1.
- For the lower component, the tail is at (6,1) and the adjacent 8 at (6,0) is replaced by 1.

## Program to be generated:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def find_tail(obj):
    cm = centerofmass(toindices(obj))
    def dist_and_j(cell):
      i, j = cell[1]
      return manhattan((i, j), cm), j
    return last(order(obj, dist_and_j))[1]

  def find_adjacent_8(grid, tail):
    i, j = tail
    neighbors = {(i - 1, j), (i + 1, j), (i, j - 1), (i, j + 1)}
    return extract(neighbors, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(grid) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(grid[0]) and grid[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 8)
  
  new_grid = grid
  for obj in objects(grid, False, True, True):
    if color(obj) == 8:
      tail = find_tail(obj)
      adjacent_8 = find_adjacent_8(grid, tail)
      if adjacent_8:
        new_grid = paint(new_grid, recolor(1, {adjacent_8}))
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`find_tail(obj)`:**
   - Calculates the center of mass (`cm`) of the object using `centerofmass`.
   - Defines a helper function `dist_and_j` to calculate the Manhattan distance of a cell from the `cm` and prioritize cells with higher `j` (column index) in case of a tie.
   - Uses `order` to sort the object's cells based on `dist_and_j`.
   - Returns the cell with the highest `dist_and_j` value, which represents the tail.

2. **`find_adjacent_8(grid, tail)`:**
   - Finds the four neighbor indices of the `tail` cell.
   - Uses `extract` to find the first neighbor that falls within the grid boundaries and has a value of 8.
   - Returns the index of the adjacent 8.

3. **Main function:**
   - Iterates through each connected component (`obj`) in the grid using `objects`.
   - If the `color` of the object is 8:
     - Finds the `tail` of the object using `find_tail`.
     - Finds the index of the `adjacent_8` using `find_adjacent_8`.
     - If an `adjacent_8` is found, `paint`s the grid by `recolor`ing the `adjacent_8` to 1.
   - Returns the modified grid.
