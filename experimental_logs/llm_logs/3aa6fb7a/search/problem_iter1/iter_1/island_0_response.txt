## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects with the color '8' and then filling the cells directly above and below the '8' cells with the color '1'. 

**Input 0:**

* Objects with color '8' are identified.
* Cells directly above and below these objects are filled with '1'.

**Input 1:**

* Same logic as Input 0 is applied. 

## Program to be Generated:

**Version 1:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False) # Find all connected objects
  eights = sfilter(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 8) # Filter objects with color 8
  target_indices = merge(apply(lambda obj: mapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0] - 1, loc[1]), (loc[0] + 1, loc[1])}, toindices(obj)), eights)) # Generate indices above and below each 8
  O = fill(I, 1, target_indices) # Fill those indices with 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** We find all connected objects in the input grid using `objects(I, True, False, False)`.
2. **Filter by color:** We use `sfilter` to keep only the objects that have color '8'.
3. **Generate target indices:** For each object with color '8', we use `mapply` twice:
    * First, we iterate over the indices of the object using `toindices`.
    * Second, for each index `(i, j)`, we generate a set containing indices directly above and below: `{(i - 1, j), (i + 1, j)}`.
    * Finally, `mapply` merges all generated sets into a single set of target indices.
4. **Fill target cells:** We use `fill` to fill all target indices with color '1' on the input grid.


**Version 2:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  indices_eight = ofcolor(I, 8) # Get indices of all cells with color 8
  target_indices = mpapply(lambda loc: {(loc[0] - 1, loc[1]), (loc[0] + 1, loc[1])}, indices_eight, indices_eight) # Generate indices above and below each 8
  O = fill(I, 1, target_indices) # Fill those indices with 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find '8' cells:** We directly identify the indices of all cells containing the color '8' using `ofcolor(I, 8)`.
2. **Generate target indices:**  We use `mpapply` to:
   * Iterate over each index in `indices_eight`.
   * For each index `(i, j)`, generate a set of indices directly above and below: `{(i - 1, j), (i + 1, j)}`.
   * Merge all the generated sets into a single set of target indices.
3. **Fill target cells:** We use `fill` to fill all target indices with the color '1'.


**Version 3:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  shifted_up = shift(recolor(8, ofcolor(I, 8)), (-1, 0)) # Shift 8s upward and recolor to 1
  shifted_down = shift(recolor(8, ofcolor(I, 8)), (1, 0)) # Shift 8s downward and recolor to 1
  target_indices = toindices(shifted_up) | toindices(shifted_down) # Combine the shifted indices
  O = underfill(I, 1, target_indices) # Fill the target indices with 1 only if they were initially background
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift and recolor:**
    * We identify the indices of all '8' cells using `ofcolor(I, 8)`.
    * We create two shifted sets of indices: one shifted up `(-1, 0)` and one shifted down `(1, 0)`.
    * We recolor these shifted indices to '1' using `recolor`.
2. **Combine indices:** We combine the indices from both shifted sets using the union operator `|`.
3. **Fill target cells:** We use `underfill` to fill the target indices with '1' only if they were originally background color.


**Version 4:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  new_grid = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Create a blank canvas with the same shape as the input
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 8: # If the cell is 8
        if i > 0:
          new_grid = fill(new_grid, 1, {(i - 1, j)}) # Fill the cell above with 1
        if i < len(I) - 1:
          new_grid = fill(new_grid, 1, {(i + 1, j)}) # Fill the cell below with 1
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create blank canvas:** A new grid of the same size as the input, filled with '0', is created using `canvas(0, shape(I))`.
2. **Iterate and fill:**
   * The code iterates through each cell of the input grid.
   * If a cell contains '8', it fills the cell above and below (if they exist) in the new grid with '1'.
3. **Return new grid:** The modified `new_grid` is returned as the output.


**Version 5:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  return tuple(
      tuple(
          1 if (i > 0 and I[i - 1][j] == 8) or (i < len(I) - 1 and I[i + 1][j] == 8) else val
          for j, val in enumerate(row)
      )
      for i, row in enumerate(I)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Nested loop with conditional filling:** This version uses nested loops to iterate through the input grid. 
2. **Inline conditional:** For each cell, it checks if the cell above or below contains '8'. If true, the current cell is filled with '1'; otherwise, it retains its original value. 
3. **Return modified grid:** The modified grid is returned as the output.

Each version utilizes different DSL functions and approaches to achieve the desired outcome, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL and providing diverse solutions to the problem.
