## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify the "tail" of the object composed of the digit '8' and replace the tail cell with the digit '1'. The tail is defined as the furthest cell from the object's center of mass that can be reached by moving only within the '8' object cells. 

Let's analyze each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

**Output_0:**

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 1 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 1 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Here, the '8' object's tail is at positions (1,2) and (4,1). Both are replaced with '1'.

**Input_1:**

```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```

**Output_1:**

```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 1 8 0
0 0 8 1 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```

Similarly, the tail cells at positions (1,5), (2,3), and (5,3) are replaced with '1'.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the `Program_to_be_generated` to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def replace_tail(grid, i, j, visited):
    visited.add((i, j))
    neighbors_list = [(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)]
    for ni, nj in neighbors_list:
      if 0 <= ni < len(grid) and 0 <= nj < len(grid[0]) and grid[ni][nj] == 8 and (ni, nj) not in visited:
        grid = replace_tail(grid, ni, nj, visited)
    if sum(1 for ni, nj in neighbors_list if 0 <= ni < len(grid) and 0 <= nj < len(grid[0]) and grid[ni][nj] == 8) == 1:
      grid = fill(grid, 1, {(i, j)})
    return grid

  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  start_point = argmax(toindices(obj_8), lambda x: manhattan(x, centerofmass(obj_8)))
  visited = set()
  grid = replace_tail(grid, start_point[0], start_point[1], visited)
  return grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`replace_tail(grid, i, j, visited)` Function:** This recursive function explores the '8' object starting from a given cell (i, j), marking visited cells. It identifies and replaces the 'tail' cells, defined as cells having only one '8' neighbor within the object.
2. **Main Program:** 
   - Extracts the object containing '8'.
   - Finds the furthest point from the center of mass as the starting point.
   - Calls `replace_tail` to replace tail cells with '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def is_tail(grid, i, j):
    if grid[i][j] != 8:
      return False
    neighbors_list = [(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)]
    return sum(1 for ni, nj in neighbors_list if 0 <= ni < len(grid) and 0 <= nj < len(grid[0]) and grid[ni][nj] == 8) == 1

  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  indices_to_replace = frozenset(loc for loc in toindices(obj_8) if is_tail(grid, loc[0], loc[1]))
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, indices_to_replace))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_tail(grid, i, j)` Function:** Checks if a cell at (i, j) is a tail cell by verifying if it contains '8' and has only one '8' neighbor.
2. **Main Program:**
   - Extracts the object containing '8'.
   - Identifies tail cells using `is_tail`.
   - Replaces tail cells with '1' using `recolor` and `paint`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  distances = tuple(manhattan(index, centerofmass(obj_8)) for index in toindices(obj_8))
  max_distance = max(distances)
  tail_indices = frozenset(index for i, index in enumerate(toindices(obj_8)) if distances[i] == max_distance)
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, tail_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Calculate Distances:**  Calculates the Manhattan distance of each cell in the '8' object to the center of mass.
2. **Identify Tail:** Finds cells with the maximum distance, representing the tail.
3. **Replace:** Replaces the tail cells with '1'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def find_tail(grid, start, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
      visited = set()
    visited.add(start)
    neighbors_list = [(start[0]-1, start[1]), (start[0]+1, start[1]), (start[0], start[1]-1), (start[0], start[1]+1)]
    valid_neighbors = [(ni, nj) for ni, nj in neighbors_list if 0 <= ni < len(grid) and 0 <= nj < len(grid[0]) and grid[ni][nj] == 8 and (ni, nj) not in visited]
    if not valid_neighbors:
      return start
    return find_tail(grid, valid_neighbors[0], visited)

  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  start_point = argmax(toindices(obj_8), lambda x: manhattan(x, centerofmass(obj_8)))
  tail = find_tail(grid, start_point)
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, {tail}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`find_tail(grid, start, visited)` Function:**  This recursive function starts from a given cell and moves to a neighboring '8' cell until it reaches a dead-end, representing the tail.
2. **Main Program:**
   - Extracts the '8' object.
   - Finds the starting point (furthest from the center of mass).
   - Uses `find_tail` to locate the tail cell.
   - Replaces the tail cell with '1'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
    obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
    cm = centerofmass(obj_8)
    def dist_func(idx):
        return -manhattan(idx, cm), idx[0], idx[1]
    tail_idx = max(toindices(obj_8), key=dist_func)
    return paint(grid, recolor(1, {tail_idx}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`dist_func(idx)` Function:** Defines a custom function to be used as the key for sorting. It prioritizes distance from the center of mass, then row index, then column index.
2. **Main Program:**
   - Extracts the '8' object.
   - Calculates the center of mass.
   - Uses `max` with the custom `dist_func` to find the tail index.
   - Replaces the cell at the tail index with '1'.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to identifying and replacing the tail cell, showcasing the flexibility and power of the provided DSL. Each version offers a different combination of functions and logic to achieve the same transformation goal.
