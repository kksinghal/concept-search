## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying the "corner" cells of the 8-objects and replacing them with the digit 1. Let's break down each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The upper-left corner 8 in the object is replaced by 1.
* The lower-right corner 8 in the object is replaced by 1. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The top-most and bottom-most 8s in the first object are replaced by 1s.
* The left-most and right-most 8s in the second object are replaced by 1s.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    uppermost_row = uppermost(obj)
    lowermost_row = lowermost(obj)
    leftmost_col = leftmost(obj)
    rightmost_col = rightmost(obj)
    for c, (i, j) in obj:
      if (i == uppermost_row or i == lowermost_row) or (j == leftmost_col or j == rightmost_col):
        I = fill(I, 1, {(i, j)})
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  We find all objects made of 8s excluding the background using `objects(I, T, F, T)`.
2. **Find extreme cells:** For each object, we determine the row and column indices of the uppermost, lowermost, leftmost, and rightmost cells.
3. **Replace with 1:**  We iterate through each cell of the object and check if it's an extreme cell. If it is, we replace its value with 1 in the grid. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  corner_indices = set()
  for obj in objs:
    corner_indices.update(corners(obj))
  O = fill(I, 1, corner_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Similar to version 1, we first find all 8-objects.
2. **Find corner indices:**  We iterate through each object and use `corners(obj)` to get a set of its corner indices. We collect all corner indices.
3. **Replace with 1:**  We directly use `fill(I, 1, corner_indices)` to replace all identified corner cells with 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  for obj in objs:
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
      for j, value in enumerate(row):
        if (i, j) in toindices(obj) and ((i == uppermost(obj) or i == lowermost(obj)) or (j == leftmost(obj) or j == rightmost(obj))):
          I = paint(I, {(1, (i, j))})
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** We find all 8-objects.
2. **Iterate and replace:** We iterate through each cell in the grid. If a cell belongs to an object and is an extreme cell (top, bottom, left, or right), we paint it with the value 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = I
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, value in enumerate(row):
      if value == 8 and any((i in (uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj)) or j in (leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj))) for obj in objects(I, T, F, T) if (i, j) in toindices(obj)):
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate through cells:**  We iterate through each cell of the input grid.
2. **Check for 8 and extreme:** For each cell with value 8, we check if it's an extreme cell of any 8-object using a generator expression. If it is, we fill that cell with 1 in the output grid. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  to_replace = set()
  for obj in objs:
    to_replace.update((1, (i, j)) for i in (uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj)) for j in range(leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj) + 1) if (i, j) in toindices(obj))
    to_replace.update((1, (i, j)) for j in (leftmost(obj), rightmost(obj)) for i in range(uppermost(obj), lowermost(obj) + 1) if (i, j) in toindices(obj))
  O = paint(I, to_replace)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** We locate all 8-objects.
2. **Collect cells to replace:** For each object, we iterate through its potential extreme cell coordinates (top/bottom rows, left/right columns) and check if those cells are actually part of the object. If they are, we add them to a set of cells to be replaced with value 1. 
3. **Paint the replacements:** Finally, we use `paint` to efficiently replace all the identified cells in the grid with the value 1. 

These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieving the desired transformation using the provided DSL functions. Each version leverages different combinations of object detection, cell manipulation, and conditional logic to solve the problem.
