## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the rightmost cell of each connected object of the digit '8' (excluding the background) and replacing it with the digit '1'. All other cells retain their original values. 

## Program Version 1

**Code:**

```python
def agdfdbffejicedbaaicdcaeedabeegge(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)  # Find all '8' objects
  rightmost_cells = mapply(lambda obj: argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1]), objs) # Find rightmost cell in each object
  O = fill(I, 1, toindices(rightmost_cells)) # Replace with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(I, T, F, T)`:**  Identifies all connected objects formed by the digit '8', excluding the background.
2. **`rightmost_cells = mapply(lambda obj: argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1]), objs)`:**  For each object, it finds the cell with the maximum column index (rightmost cell) using `argmax` and a custom lambda function. 
3. **`O = fill(I, 1, toindices(rightmost_cells))`:** Fills the identified rightmost cells with the digit '1' in the original grid `I` to generate the output grid `O`.

This version directly uses the `fill` function with the correct argument type which was the issue in the original code.

## Program Version 2

**Code:**

```python
def agdfdbffejicedbaaicdcaeedabeegge(I):
  O = I  # Initialize output as input
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T): # Iterate over '8' objects
    rightmost_cell = argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1]) # Find the rightmost cell
    i, j = rightmost_cell[1] # Extract indices
    O = paint(O, {(1, (i, j))}) # Replace with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:**  Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):`:** Iterates over each identified '8' object.
3. **`rightmost_cell = argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1])`:**  Finds the rightmost cell within the current object.
4. **`i, j = rightmost_cell[1]`:** Extracts the row and column indices (i, j) of the rightmost cell.
5. **`O = paint(O, {(1, (i, j))})`:**  Paints the identified rightmost cell with '1' on the output grid `O`.

This version iteratively modifies the output grid by painting each rightmost cell individually.

## Program Version 3

**Code:**

```python
def agdfdbffejicedbaaicdcaeedabeegge(I):
  rightmost_indices = set() # Initialize an empty set to store indices
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, T): # Iterate over '8' objects
    rightmost_cell = argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1]) # Find the rightmost cell
    rightmost_indices.add(rightmost_cell[1]) # Add its indices to the set
  O = fill(I, 1, frozenset(rightmost_indices)) # Replace with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`rightmost_indices = set()`:**  Initializes an empty set to store the indices of the rightmost cells.
2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, T):`:** Iterates over each '8' object.
3. **`rightmost_cell = argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1])`:** Finds the rightmost cell in the current object.
4. **`rightmost_indices.add(rightmost_cell[1])`:** Adds the indices of the rightmost cell to the set.
5. **`O = fill(I, 1, frozenset(rightmost_indices))`:** Replaces the cells at the collected indices with '1' in the original grid `I` to generate the output `O`.

This version first collects all rightmost cell indices and then uses `fill` to modify the grid in one go.


## Program Version 4

**Code:**

```python
def agdfdbffejicedbaaicdcaeedabeegge(I):
    O = I
    for i, row in enumerate(I): # Iterate over rows
        for j, val in enumerate(row): # Iterate over columns
            if val == 8 and (j == len(row) - 1 or I[i][j+1] != 8): # Check if rightmost '8'
                O = paint(O, {(1, (i, j))}) # Replace with '1'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:**  Initializes the output grid `O` as a copy of the input grid `I`.
2. **`for i, row in enumerate(I):`:** Iterates over each row of the grid.
3. **`for j, val in enumerate(row):`:** Iterates over each cell in the current row.
4. **`if val == 8 and (j == len(row) - 1 or I[i][j+1] != 8):`:** Checks if the current cell contains '8' and is the rightmost '8' in its connected object. 
5. **`O = paint(O, {(1, (i, j))})`:**  Paints the identified rightmost '8' cell with '1' on the output grid `O`.

This version directly iterates over the grid, identifying and modifying the rightmost '8' cells without explicitly using the `objects` function.

## Program Version 5

**Code:**

```python
def agdfdbffejicedbaaicdcaeedabeegge(I):
    rightmost_cells = set()
    for i, j in asindices(I): # Iterate over all indices
        if I[i][j] == 8 and (j == len(I[0]) - 1 or I[i][j+1] != 8): # Check if rightmost '8'
            rightmost_cells.add((i, j)) # Add its indices to the set
    O = fill(I, 1, frozenset(rightmost_cells)) # Replace with '1'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`rightmost_cells = set()`:**  Initializes an empty set to store the indices of the rightmost '8' cells.
2. **`for i, j in asindices(I):`:** Iterates over all cell indices of the input grid.
3. **`if I[i][j] == 8 and (j == len(I[0]) - 1 or I[i][j+1] != 8):`:**  Checks if the current cell contains '8' and is the rightmost '8' in its connected object.
4. **`rightmost_cells.add((i, j))`:** Adds the indices of the identified rightmost '8' cell to the set. 
5. **`O = fill(I, 1, frozenset(rightmost_cells))`:** Replaces the cells at the collected indices with '1' in the original grid `I` to generate the output `O`.

This version is similar to version 3 but identifies the rightmost '8' cells directly by iterating over all indices without using the `objects` function.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieving the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
