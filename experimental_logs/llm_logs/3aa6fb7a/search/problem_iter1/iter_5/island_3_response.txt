## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying each connected object (group of adjacent non-zero digits) and changing the color of the cell one position down and one position right from the object's upper left corner to '1'.

**Input_0:**

- Two '8' objects are present.
- The top left corner of the first object is at (1,1). The target cell is (2,2), which gets changed to '1'.
- The top left corner of the second object is at (3,4). The target cell is (4,5), which gets changed to '1'.

**Input_1:**

- Three '8' objects are present.
- The top left corners and corresponding target cells that are changed to '1' are:
    - (0,4) -> (1,5)
    - (2,2) -> (3,3)
    - (5,3) -> (6,4)


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modify_object(obj):
    ul = ulcorner(obj)
    target_index = (ul[0] + 1, ul[1] + 1)
    return frozenset((1, (i, j)) if (i, j) == target_index else (v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj)
  
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  new_objs = frozenset(modify_object(obj) for obj in objs)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), new_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`modify_object(obj)`:** This function takes an object and modifies it. 
    - It calculates the target index to be modified.
    - It iterates through the object and changes the value to '1' if the index matches the target index, else keeps the original value.
2. **`objects(...)`:** Extracts all objects from the input grid.
3. **`frozenset(modify_object(obj) for obj in objs)`:** Applies `modify_object` to each object and creates a new frozenset of modified objects.
4. **`paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), new_objs)`:** Creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input and paints the modified objects onto it.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def get_target_cell(obj):
    return add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1))

  def modify_grid(grid, obj):
    target = get_target_cell(obj)
    h, w = shape(grid)
    if 0 <= target[0] < h and 0 <= target[1] < w:
      grid = fill(grid, 1, {target})
    return grid

  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) 
  for obj in objs:
    O = modify_grid(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`get_target_cell(obj)`:** Calculates the target cell to be modified based on the object's upper left corner.
2. **`modify_grid(grid, obj)`:** This function takes the grid and an object as input:
    - It retrieves the target cell for the object.
    - It checks if the target cell lies within the grid boundaries.
    - If within bounds, it fills the target cell with '1'.
3. The program iterates through each object, modifies a blank canvas based on the object's target cell, and returns the final modified canvas. 

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def shifted_indices(obj):
    return shift(toindices(obj), (1, 1))
  
  def modify_grid(grid, indices):
    h, w = shape(grid)
    for i, j in indices:
      if 0 <= i < h and 0 <= j < w:
        grid = fill(grid, 1, {(i, j)})
    return grid

  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for obj in objs:
    O = modify_grid(O, shifted_indices(obj))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_indices(obj)`:** Extracts the indices of an object and shifts them one position down and one position right.
2. **`modify_grid(grid, indices)`:**  Iterates through the shifted indices:
    - If an index is within the grid boundaries, it fills that cell in the grid with '1'.
3. The program iterates over each object, gets its shifted indices, and modifies a blank canvas accordingly.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def modify_grid(grid, obj):
    ul = ulcorner(obj)
    target = (ul[0] + 1, ul[1] + 1)
    return tuple(
      tuple(
        1 if (i, j) == target else v 
        for j, v in enumerate(row)
      ) 
      for i, row in enumerate(grid)
    )

  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    O = modify_grid(O, obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`modify_grid(grid, obj)`:** This function directly modifies the input grid:
    - It calculates the target cell to be modified.
    - It iterates through the grid, cell by cell, and replaces the cell's value with '1' if the cell's index matches the target index. 
2. The program iterates through each object and modifies the input grid based on the object's target cell.

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def get_target_indices(objs):
    return frozenset(add(ulcorner(obj), (1, 1)) for obj in objs)
  
  def paint_targets(grid, targets):
    h, w = shape(grid)
    return tuple(
      tuple(
        1 if (i, j) in targets else v 
        for j, v in enumerate(row)
      ) 
      for i, row in enumerate(grid)
    )
  
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  target_indices = get_target_indices(objs)
  return paint_targets(I, target_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`get_target_indices(objs)`:** This function takes all objects and calculates the target cell indices for each object.
2. **`paint_targets(grid, targets)`:** Takes the grid and target indices:
    - It iterates through the grid and changes the cell's value to '1' if the cell's index is present in the target indices.
3. The program first extracts all objects, calculates target indices, and then modifies the input grid based on these target indices.
