## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify the "tail" of the object composed of the digit '8' and recolor it to '1'.  The tail is defined as:

* **Furthest from the Center of Mass:** The cell of the '8' object that is furthest away from the object's center of mass.
* **Rightmost Priority:** If multiple cells share the maximum distance, the rightmost cell (highest 'j' coordinate) is considered the tail.

**Example:**

* **Input_0:** The bottom '8' in the vertical segment is furthest from the center of mass and is therefore the tail. 
* **Input_1:** The '8' at coordinate (1, 5) is the tail, as it's furthest from the center of mass and positioned to the right of the '8' at (2, 4), which shares the same distance.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, leveraging the DSL functions:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def find_tail(obj):
    cm = centerofmass(toindices(obj))
    def dist_func(cell):
      i, j = cell[1] 
      return manhattan((i, j), cm), j
    tail = last(order(totuple(obj), dist_func))
    return tail[1]

  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  tail = find_tail(obj_8)
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, {(1, tail)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`find_tail(obj)`:** This function first calculates the center of mass (`cm`) of the input object. It then iterates through each cell of the object, calculating its Manhattan distance to `cm` and using the cell's column index ('j') as a secondary sorting key.  The function returns the coordinates of the tail cell.
2. **`obj_8 = extract(...)`:** This line extracts the object composed of '8's from the grid.
3. **`tail = find_tail(obj_8)`:**  The tail coordinates are determined using the previously defined function.
4. **`return paint(...)`:**  The grid is painted, replacing the color at the tail coordinate with '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  cm = centerofmass(toindices(obj_8))
  
  def dist_j(cell):
    i, j = cell[1]
    return (manhattan((i, j), cm), j)

  tail = argmax(obj_8, dist_j)[1]
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, {(1, tail)})) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj_8` and `cm` :** Similar to version 1, we extract the object of '8's and calculate its center of mass.
2. **`dist_j(cell)`:** This function calculates the Manhattan distance between a cell's coordinates and the center of mass, combining it with the cell's column index ('j') for secondary sorting.
3. **`tail = argmax(...)`:**  The `argmax` function is used to find the cell in `obj_8` that maximizes the `dist_j` function, effectively identifying the tail.
4. **`return paint(...)`:**  The grid is painted with the tail cell recolored to '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  cm = centerofmass(toindices(obj_8))

  def find_tail(obj, cm):
    max_dist = 0
    tail = None
    for _, (i, j) in obj:
      dist = manhattan((i, j), cm)
      if dist > max_dist:
        max_dist = dist
        tail = (i, j)
      elif dist == max_dist and j > tail[1]:
        tail = (i, j)
    return tail

  tail = find_tail(obj_8, cm)
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, {(1, tail)})) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`obj_8` and `cm` :** Similar to previous versions.
2. **`find_tail(obj, cm)`:** This function iterates through each cell of the object. It keeps track of the maximum encountered distance (`max_dist`) and the corresponding cell (`tail`). If a cell has a greater distance or a cell with the same distance but a higher 'j' coordinate is found, `tail` is updated. 
3. **`tail = find_tail(...)`:**  The tail is determined by iterating through the object.
4. **`return paint(...)`:**  The grid is painted, recoloring the tail cell.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  cm = centerofmass(toindices(obj_8))
  tail = max(obj_8, key=lambda cell: (manhattan(cell[1], cm), cell[1][1]))[1]
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, {(1, tail)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`obj_8` and `cm` :** Similar to previous versions.
2.  **`tail = max(...)`:** This line uses the `max` function with a custom key to directly find the tail cell within the `obj_8` set. The lambda function calculates the Manhattan distance of each cell to the center of mass and incorporates the cell's column index ('j') for secondary sorting.  The `[1]` at the end extracts the coordinates from the returned cell tuple. 
3.  **`return paint(...)`:**  The grid is painted with the identified tail cell recolored.

**Program Version 5:** 

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(grid):
  def find_tail(obj):
      cm = centerofmass(toindices(obj))
      def dist_and_j(cell):
          i, j = cell[1]
          return manhattan((i, j), cm) * 100 + j
      tail = max(obj, key=dist_and_j)[1]
      return tail

  obj_8 = extract(objects(grid, False, True, True), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  tail = find_tail(obj_8)
  return paint(grid, recolor(1, {(1, tail)})) 
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`find_tail(obj)`:** Similar to other versions but implements a scaling approach. The `dist_and_j` function combines the Manhattan distance with the column index, scaled by 100. This ensures that the distance plays a more significant role in the comparison than the column index. 
2.  **`obj_8` and `tail`:**  Standard extraction of the '8' object and tail finding.
3.  **`return paint(...)`:**  The grid is painted, recoloring the tail cell. 

These five programs demonstrate different strategies for finding the tail cell using the provided DSL functions. Each version aims for efficiency and readability while accurately implementing the desired transformation.
