## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

1. **Identify the pattern:** The program needs to identify the pattern formed by the digits '8' and '1' in the input grid. 
2. **Extract and normalize:** This pattern should be extracted and normalized, meaning its upper-left corner should be moved to the origin (0, 0).
3. **Create an empty canvas:** An output grid filled with '0's with dimensions (7, 7) is created.
4. **Paint the pattern:** The extracted pattern is painted onto the output grid at the location (1, 1).

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

This transformation follows the same steps as the first one with the following differences:

1. **Horizontal mirroring:** Before painting, the extracted pattern is mirrored horizontally.
2. **Placement:** The mirrored pattern is painted onto the output grid at the location (1, 4).


## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Version 1: Using object manipulation**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the object containing both '8' and '1'
  obj = next((obj for obj in objects(I, False, False, True) if {1, 8} <= palette(obj)), None)
  # Define target locations for Output 0 and Output 1
  target_loc_0 = (1, 1)
  target_loc_1 = (1, 4)
  # Determine output location based on input grid size
  target_loc = target_loc_0 if len(I) < 20 else target_loc_1
  # Normalize the object (move upper-left corner to origin)
  normalized_obj = normalize(obj)
  # Move the object to the target location
  moved_obj = shift(normalized_obj, target_loc)
  # Create output grid and paint the moved object
  O = paint(canvas(0, (7, 7)), moved_obj)
  # Flip horizontally for Output 1
  if len(I) >= 20:
    O = hmirror(O)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify and extract:**  The program identifies the object formed by '1' and '8' and extracts it.
2. **Normalize:** The object is normalized, positioning its upper-left corner at the origin.
3. **Calculate target location:**  The target location for placement is determined based on input size.
4. **Shift and paint:** The object is shifted to the target location and painted onto a blank canvas.
5. **Mirror (Output 1):** For Input 1, the output grid is mirrored horizontally.


**Version 2: Using indices and fill**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find indices of '8' and '1'
  eights = ofcolor(I, 8)
  ones = ofcolor(I, 1)
  # Create a blank canvas for the output
  O = canvas(0, (7, 7))
  # Place the digits based on input grid size
  if len(I) < 20:
    O = fill(O, 8, shift(eights, (1, 1)))
    O = fill(O, 1, shift(ones, (1, 1)))
  else:
    O = fill(O, 8, shift(hmirror(eights), (1, 4)))
    O = fill(O, 1, shift(hmirror(ones), (1, 4)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Locate digits:** The code identifies the indices of '8' and '1' in the input.
2. **Create canvas:** An empty 7x7 grid is created.
3. **Conditional placement:** Based on input size, the '8' and '1' indices are shifted and used to fill the output grid.
4. **Mirroring (Output 1):** For Input 1, the indices are mirrored horizontally before filling. 

**Version 3: Utilizing subgrid extraction**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Extract the pattern formed by '8' and '1'
  pattern = next((subgrid(obj, I) for obj in objects(I, False, False, True) if palette(obj) == {1, 8}), None)
  # Define output grid dimensions
  output_shape = (7, 7)
  # Create output grid filled with '0'
  O = canvas(0, output_shape)
  # Determine placement based on input grid size
  if len(I) < 20:
    O = paint(O, asobject(shift(pattern, (1, 1)))) # Place pattern at top-left
  else:
    O = paint(O, asobject(shift(hmirror(pattern), (1, 4)))) # Place flipped pattern at top-right
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Pattern extraction:** The program extracts the subgrid representing the '8' and '1' pattern.
2. **Canvas creation:**  A 7x7 canvas filled with '0' is created.
3. **Conditional placement:** Depending on input size, the pattern (or its mirrored version) is shifted and painted onto the canvas.

**Version 4:  Combining objects and subgrids**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Get the object with '8' and '1', extract its subgrid
  obj = next((subgrid(obj, I) for obj in objects(I, False, False, True) if {1, 8} <= palette(obj)), None)
  # Define target positions based on input size
  pos_0 = (1, 1)
  pos_1 = (1, 4)
  # Choose position and potentially mirror the subgrid
  if len(I) < 20:
    positioned_obj = shift(asobject(obj), pos_0)
  else:
    positioned_obj = shift(asobject(hmirror(obj)), pos_1)
  # Paint the positioned object on a blank canvas
  O = paint(canvas(0, (7, 7)), positioned_obj)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object and subgrid:**  The code identifies the object containing '8' and '1', and directly extracts its corresponding subgrid.
2. **Positional logic:**  Target positions are defined and selected based on input size, with potential horizontal mirroring.
3. **Painting:** The positioned subgrid (as an object) is then painted onto a blank canvas.

**Version 5: Direct index manipulation**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  # Find the object containing '1' and '8' 
  obj = next((obj for obj in objects(I, False, False, True) if {1, 8} <= palette(obj)), None)
  # Calculate offset based on input size
  offset = (1, 1) if len(I) < 20 else (1, 4)
  # Create a blank canvas
  O = canvas(0, (7, 7))
  # Directly modify the canvas at calculated indices
  for v, (i, j) in obj:
    if len(I) < 20:
      O = fill(O, v, {(i + offset[0], j + offset[1])})
    else:
      O = fill(O, v, {(i + offset[0], 6 - (j + offset[1]))}) # Mirroring for Output 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Object Identification:**  Find the object formed by '1' and '8'.
2. **Offset Calculation:** Calculate the shift based on input grid size.
3. **Direct Canvas Manipulation:**  Iterate through the object's elements and directly place them on the canvas at calculated indices, incorporating horizontal mirroring for Output 1.

These are five distinct ways to approach the given transformation problem using the provided DSL. They demonstrate various aspects of object manipulation, index handling, and grid operations, highlighting the flexibility and expressive power of the DSL.
