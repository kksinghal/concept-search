## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to extract the object containing the colors 1 and 8 from the input grid, normalize its position to the upper-left corner, and then paint it onto a blank 7x7 canvas. The position on the canvas depends on the size of the input grid:

* **Small Input Grid (height < 20):** The object is placed at position (1, 1) on the canvas.
* **Large Input Grid (height >= 20):** The object is horizontally mirrored and then placed at position (1, 4) on the canvas.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    obj = next((obj for obj in objects(I, False, False, True) if {1, 8} == palette(obj)), None)
    target_loc = (1, 1) if len(I) < 20 else (1, 4)
    O = canvas(0, (7, 7))
    if obj is not None:
      obj = normalize(toindices(obj))
      if len(I) >= 20:
        obj = hmirror(obj)
      O = paint(O, toobject(shift(obj, target_loc), I))
    return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Object:** The program first extracts the object containing colors 1 and 8 using `objects` (without background) and checks if it exists.
2. **Determine Target Location:** It determines the target location on the canvas based on input grid size.
3. **Create Canvas:**  A blank 7x7 canvas is created.
4. **Normalize and Mirror:** The extracted object's indices are normalized and horizontally mirrored if the input grid is large. 
5. **Shift and Paint:** The normalized object is shifted to the target location and painted onto the canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    obj = next((toindices(obj) for obj in objects(I, False, False, True) if {1, 8} == palette(obj)), None)
    O = canvas(0, (7, 7))
    if obj is not None:
      obj = normalize(obj)
      for i, j in obj:
        if len(I) < 20:
          O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i + 1, j + 1)})
        else:
          O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i + 1, 6 - (j + 1))})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract and Normalize:** Extract the object's indices directly and normalize them.
2. **Iterate and Fill:** Iterate over each cell of the normalized object. Depending on the input size, fill the corresponding cell on the canvas with the original color from the input grid, applying horizontal mirroring for large grids.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_loc = (1, 1) if len(I) < 20 else (1, 4)
  O = canvas(0, (7, 7))
  for obj in objects(I, False, False, True):
    if {1, 8} == palette(obj):
      for v, (i, j) in obj:
        if len(I) < 20:
          O = fill(O, v, {(i + target_loc[0], j + target_loc[1])})
        else:
          O = fill(O, v, {(i + target_loc[0], 6 - (j + target_loc[1]))})
      break  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate over Objects:**  Iterate through each object in the input, checking for the presence of colors 1 and 8.
2. **Directly Fill:** If the desired object is found, directly fill the corresponding cells on the canvas based on input size and mirroring.
3. **Break Loop:** Stop iterating once the desired object is processed.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = next((subgrid(obj, I) for obj in objects(I, False, False, True) if {1, 8} == palette(obj)), None)
  O = canvas(0, (7, 7))
  if obj is not None:
    if len(I) < 20:
      O = paint(O, asobject(shift(obj, (1, 1))))
    else:
      O = paint(O, asobject(shift(hmirror(obj), (1, 4))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Subgrid:** Directly extract the subgrid containing the target object using `subgrid`.
2. **Conditional Painting:** Based on input size, paint the extracted subgrid onto the canvas at the appropriate location with or without mirroring.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  eights = normalize(toindices(next((obj for obj in objects(I, False, False, True) if color(obj) == 8), None)))
  ones = normalize(toindices(next((obj for obj in objects(I, False, False, True) if color(obj) == 1), None)))
  target_loc = (1, 1) if len(I) < 20 else (1, 4)
  O = canvas(0, (7, 7))
  if len(eights) > 0 and len(ones) > 0:
    if len(I) < 20:
      O = fill(O, 8, shift(eights, target_loc))
      O = fill(O, 1, shift(ones, target_loc))
    else:
      O = fill(O, 8, shift(hmirror(eights), target_loc))
      O = fill(O, 1, shift(hmirror(ones), target_loc))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Individual Objects:** Extract objects of color 8 and 1 separately, normalize and get their indices. 
2. **Conditional Filling:**  Similar to previous versions, conditionally fill the canvas with colors 8 and 1 at the appropriate locations based on input size and apply mirroring for large grids. 

These five versions showcase diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing different combinations of DSL functions and logic. They highlight the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for solving spatial reasoning tasks.
