## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve extracting specific objects (represented by digits '1' and '8') from the input grid and arranging them in a mirrored fashion on a blank canvas.  

**Input_0:**

1. Extract the object made of '8's.
2. Extract the object made of '1's.
3. Create a blank canvas of the same size as the input.
4. Horizontally mirror the '8' object.
5. Place the mirrored '8' object at the right edge of the canvas.
6. Horizontally mirror the '1' object.
7. Place the mirrored '1' object adjacent to the left edge of the '8' object.

**Input_1:**

The same logic seems to apply to Input_1, indicating a consistent transformation across inputs.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" in the provided DSL:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    obj8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)   # Extract object with color '8'
    obj1 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I)   # Extract object with color '1'
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))              # Create blank canvas 
    O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj8), (0, width(O) - width(obj8))))   # Mirror & place '8'
    O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj1), (0, width(O) - width(obj8) - width(obj1))))  # Mirror & place '1'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** `toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)` and `toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I)` extract the objects consisting of '8's and '1's, respectively.
2. **Create canvas:** `canvas(0, shape(I))` creates a blank canvas of the same dimensions as the input grid (`I`).
3. **Mirror and position:** 
   - `hmirror(obj8)` and `hmirror(obj1)` horizontally mirror the extracted objects.
   - `shift(..., (0, width(O) - width(obj8)))` and `shift(..., (0, width(O) - width(obj8) - width(obj1)))` calculate the appropriate horizontal shift to place the mirrored objects at the right edge of the canvas, ensuring they are adjacent.
   - `paint(O, ...)` paints the mirrored and shifted objects onto the canvas.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    p8 = ofcolor(I, 8)  # Get indices of color '8'
    p1 = ofcolor(I, 1)  # Get indices of color '1'
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))  # Create a blank canvas
    for i, j in p8:
        O = fill(O, 8, {(i, width(I) - 1 - j)})  # Mirror and fill '8'
    for i, j in p1:
        O = fill(O, 1, {(i, width(I) - 1 - j - width(p8))})  # Mirror and fill '1'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get indices:** `ofcolor(I, 8)` and `ofcolor(I, 1)` retrieve the indices of cells containing '8's and '1's respectively in the input grid.
2. **Create canvas:** `canvas(0, shape(I))` generates a blank canvas matching the input's size.
3. **Iterate and fill:**
   - Two loops iterate over the collected indices of '8's and '1's.
   - `fill(O, 8, {(i, width(I) - 1 - j)})` mirrors the '8' object horizontally by calculating the mirrored column index as `width(I) - 1 - j`.
   - Similarly, '1's are mirrored and positioned adjacent to '8's using `width(I) - 1 - j - width(p8)`, considering the width of the '8' object.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = normalize(toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)) # Extract and normalize object '8'
  obj1 = normalize(toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I)) # Extract and normalize object '1'
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Create blank canvas
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj8), (0, width(I) - width(obj8)))) # Mirror and place '8'
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj1), (0, width(I) - width(obj8) - width(obj1)))) # Mirror and place '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is very similar to Version 1. The key difference is the use of `normalize()` function on the extracted objects. This ensures that both objects have their upper left corner at the origin (0,0) before being mirrored and placed on the canvas. This approach might be beneficial for complex object shapes where their original position within the bounding box could affect positioning on the canvas.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, F) # Extract all objects
  obj8 = argmax(objs, lambda o: colorcount(o, 8)) # Find the '8' object
  obj1 = argmax(objs, lambda o: colorcount(o, 1)) # Find the '1' object
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) # Create a blank canvas
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj8), (0, width(I) - width(obj8)))) # Mirror & position '8'
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj1), (0, width(I) - width(obj8) - width(obj1)))) # Mirror & position '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

Version 4 introduces a different approach for object extraction. 

1. **Extract all objects:** `objects(I, T, T, F)` extracts all distinct objects from the input grid, considering both diagonal and non-diagonal connections. 
2. **Find target objects:** 
   - `argmax(objs, lambda o: colorcount(o, 8))` finds the object with the maximum count of color '8'.
   - Similarly, `argmax(objs, lambda o: colorcount(o, 1))` identifies the object with the most '1's.

This approach is more robust when dealing with potential noise or multiple objects of the same color in the input grid. 


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  canvas_width = width(I)  # Get canvas width
  p8 = ofcolor(I, 8)  # Get indices of '8'
  p1 = ofcolor(I, 1)  # Get indices of '1'
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))  # Create empty canvas
  O = fill(O, 8, {(i, canvas_width - 1 - j) for i, j in p8})  # Mirror & fill '8'
  O = fill(O, 1, {(i, canvas_width - 1 - j - width(p8)) for i, j in p1})  # Mirror & fill '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version streamlines the mirroring and filling process compared to Version 2. 

1. **Calculate canvas width:** `canvas_width = width(I)` pre-calculates the canvas width for efficiency.
2. **Get indices:** Similar to Version 2, `ofcolor` is used to obtain indices of '8's and '1's.
3. **Mirroring and filling in one step:** 
   - Instead of looping, set comprehension is employed: `{(i, canvas_width - 1 - j) for i, j in p8}` generates mirrored indices for '8's. 
   - The same logic applies to '1's with an adjusted column calculation considering '8' object's width.

This approach is concise and potentially more efficient by avoiding explicit looping.
