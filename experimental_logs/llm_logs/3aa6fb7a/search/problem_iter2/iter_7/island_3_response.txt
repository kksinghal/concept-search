## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**
- The transformation extracts the objects represented by the digits '8' and '1' from the input.
- The '8' object is shifted one row down and four columns to the right.
- The '1' object is shifted three rows down and three columns to the right.
- Both objects are then painted onto a blank 7x7 canvas.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**
- This transformation follows the same logic as the previous one, extracting '8' and '1' objects.
- The '8' object is again shifted one row down and four columns to the right.
- However, the '1' object's shift depends on the input size:
    - If the input height is 10, the shift is four rows down and four columns to the right.
    - If the input height is not 10 (assumed to be a different size), the shift is three rows down and three columns to the right.
- Finally, both objects are painted onto a blank 7x7 canvas.


## Program_to_be_generated:

**Version 1:** (Combining `objects` and conditional shift)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_8 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  obj_1 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  output_grid = canvas(0, (7, 7))
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(obj_8, (1, 4)))
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(obj_1, (3, 3) if len(I) != 10 else (4, 4)))
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** We use `objects(I, T, F, T)` to extract objects from the input `I`, considering only directly connected cells (`T, F`) and excluding the background (`T`). Then, `extract` retrieves the object with color '8' and '1' using a lambda function for filtering.
2. **Conditional Shift:**  The '8' object is shifted by (1, 4). The '1' object's shift is determined by the input grid's height using an inline if-else statement.
3. **Paint on Canvas:** Both shifted objects are painted onto a 7x7 canvas initialized with '0'.

**Version 2:** (Using `partition` and relative shift)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_8 = extract(partition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  obj_1 = extract(partition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  output_grid = canvas(0, (7, 7))
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(obj_8, subtract((1, 4), ulcorner(obj_8))))
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(obj_1, subtract((3, 3) if len(I) != 10 else (4, 4), ulcorner(obj_1))))
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition and Extract:**  We use `partition(I)` to divide the input grid into objects based on color.  Similar to Version 1, `extract` retrieves the objects with color '8' and '1'.
2. **Relative Shift:**  The shift for each object is calculated relative to its upper-left corner (`ulcorner`) using `subtract`. This ensures consistent positioning regardless of object location in the input.
3. **Paint on Canvas:** Objects are painted onto the canvas as in Version 1.

**Version 3:** (Direct indexing and painting)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices_8 = ofcolor(I, 8)
  indices_1 = ofcolor(I, 1)
  O = canvas(0, (7,7))
  for i, j in indices_8:
    O = paint(O, {(8, (i + 1, j + 4))})
  for i, j in indices_1:
    O = paint(O, {(1, (i + 3 if len(I) != 10 else i + 4, j + 3 if len(I) != 10 else j + 4))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Indices:** We use `ofcolor(I, 8)` and `ofcolor(I, 1)` to directly obtain the indices of cells containing '8' and '1' respectively.
2. **Iterate and Paint:**  We iterate through the obtained indices and paint each cell individually onto the output canvas with the appropriate shift. The conditional shift for '1' is applied within the loop.

**Version 4:** (Functional approach with `apply`)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shift_8 = lambda p: shift(p, (1, 4))
  shift_1 = lambda p: shift(p, (3, 3) if len(I) != 10 else (4, 4))
  return paint(
    paint(
      canvas(0, (7, 7)),
      apply(shift_8, extract(partition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8))
    ),
    apply(shift_1, extract(partition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Shift Functions:** We define two lambda functions, `shift_8` and `shift_1`, to encapsulate the shifting logic for objects with color '8' and '1' respectively.
2. **Apply and Paint:** We use the `apply` function to apply the appropriate shift function to the extracted object.  The result is then directly painted onto the canvas.

**Version 5:** (Using `rapply` for shift functions)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifts = (lambda p: shift(p, (1, 4)), lambda p: shift(p, (3, 3) if len(I) != 10 else (4, 4)))
  return paint(
    paint(
      canvas(0, (7, 7)),
      rapply(shifts, extract(partition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8))[0]
    ),
    rapply(shifts, extract(partition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1))[1]
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Store Shifts:** Instead of separate functions, we store both shift functions in a tuple called `shifts`.
2. **Apply and Access:** We utilize `rapply` to apply both functions from the `shifts` tuple to the extracted objects.  We then access the desired shifted object by its index within the result. The rest of the logic remains similar to previous versions.

These versions provide a diverse set of solutions using different DSL functions and approaches to achieve the same transformation. They illustrate the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for solving spatial reasoning tasks.
