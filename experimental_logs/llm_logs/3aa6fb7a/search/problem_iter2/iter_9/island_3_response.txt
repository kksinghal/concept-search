## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extracting two objects from the input grid, one with the color 8 and the other with the color 1, and placing them at specific locations on a blank 7x7 output grid. 

**Specifics:**

* **Object 8:** The object with color 8 is always shifted one unit down and four units to the right. 
* **Object 1:** The object with color 1 has a conditional shift:
    * If the input grid's height is not 10, it's shifted three units down and three units to the right.
    * If the input grid's height is 10, it's shifted four units down and four units to the right.

## Program Versions:

**Program Version 1 (Inspired by Program_A - Direct Object Manipulation):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)
  obj_1 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I)
  output_grid = canvas(0, (7, 7))
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(obj_8, (1, 4)))
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(obj_1, (3, 3) if len(I) != 10 else (4, 4)))
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. Extracts the indices of cells with color 8 and 1 using `ofcolor`.
2. Converts the indices to objects using `toobject`.
3. Creates a blank 7x7 canvas using `canvas`.
4. Paints the object with color 8 onto the canvas, shifted by (1, 4) using `shift` and `paint`.
5. Paints the object with color 1 onto the canvas, shifted based on the input grid's height using a conditional expression within `shift` and `paint`. 

**Program Version 2 (Inspired by Program_B - Functional Approach):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shift_8 = lambda p: shift(p, (1, 4))
  shift_1 = lambda p: shift(p, (3, 3) if len(I) != 10 else (4, 4))
  return paint(
    paint(
      canvas(0, (7, 7)),
      apply(shift_8, toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I))
    ),
    apply(shift_1, toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. Defines two lambda functions, `shift_8` and `shift_1`, to handle the shifts of objects with colors 8 and 1, respectively.
2. Creates a blank 7x7 canvas using `canvas`.
3. Extracts and shifts the object with color 8 using a combination of `ofcolor`, `toobject`, `apply`, and `shift_8`. This shifted object is then painted onto the canvas using `paint`.
4. Similarly, extracts, shifts, and paints the object with color 1 using `ofcolor`, `toobject`, `apply`, `shift_1`, and `paint`.

**Program Version 3 (Combined Approach):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)
  obj_1 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I)
  return paint(
      paint(
          canvas(0, (7,7)),
          shift(obj_8, (1, 4))
      ),
      shift(obj_1, (3, 3) if len(I) != 10 else (4, 4))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. Extracts objects with colors 8 and 1 like in Version 1.
2. Creates a blank canvas.
3. Paints the shifted object 8 directly.
4. Paints the conditionally shifted object 1 directly.

**Program Version 4 (Using `fork` for shifting):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shift_amount = (3, 3) if len(I) != 10 else (4, 4)
  return paint(
    paint(
      canvas(0, (7, 7)), 
      fork(shift, identity, rbind(astuple, 1, 4))(toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I))
    ),
    fork(shift, identity, rbind(astuple, *shift_amount))(toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I))
  ) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. Defines `shift_amount` based on input height.
2. Creates a blank canvas.
3. Uses `fork` to apply `shift` with calculated shifts to both objects.
4. `identity` passes the object directly to the first argument of `shift`.
5. `rbind(astuple, ...)` constructs the shift tuple for the second argument of `shift`.
6. Paints both shifted objects onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5 (Generalized Approach):**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_object(color, shift_amount):
    return apply(lambda p: shift(p, shift_amount), toobject(ofcolor(I, color), I))
  return paint(
      paint(
          canvas(0, (7, 7)), 
          process_object(8, (1, 4))
      ),
      process_object(1, (3, 3) if len(I) != 10 else (4, 4))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. Defines an inner function `process_object` that encapsulates the logic of extracting an object of a specific color and shifting it by a given amount.
2. Uses this function to process both objects with colors 8 and 1, applying the appropriate shifts based on the input grid's height.
3. Paints the processed objects onto a blank 7x7 canvas.

These five versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the same transformation using the DSL, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided functions. Each version employs a distinct logic flow or combination of DSL functions, offering diverse solutions to the problem.
