## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

The transformation involves mirroring the digits "8" and "1" across both the horizontal and vertical axes of the grid. The original positions of these digits are replaced with "0"s. 

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

Similar to the first transformation, this also involves mirroring the digits "8" and "1" across both axes. However, there is an additional vertical shift applied to the mirrored elements, resulting in their positions being one row lower than their mirrored counterparts in Output_0.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions utilizing the provided DSL to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  mirrored_objs = frozenset()
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) in (1, 8): # Mirror both '1' and '8'
      if uppermost(obj) < height(I) // 2:
        mirrored_objs = insert(shift(hmirror(toindices(obj)), (height(obj), 0)), mirrored_objs) # Mirror downwards
      else:
        mirrored_objs = insert(shift(vmirror(toindices(obj)), (0, width(obj))), mirrored_objs) # Mirror to the right
  return fill(canvas(0, shape(I)), 8, merge(mirrored_objs)) # Create a blank canvas and paint mirrored objects
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:**  `objects(I, True, False, True)` extracts objects (connected components) from the input grid `I`, treating diagonal connections as separate, and ignoring the background.
2. **Iterate & Mirror:** The code iterates through each object. If the object's color is '1' or '8', it mirrors the object horizontally or vertically based on its position relative to the grid's center.
3. **Shift Mirrored Objects (Output_1):** The mirrored objects are then shifted to achieve the final positioning observed in Output_1.
4. **Paint:** Finally, it creates a blank canvas (`canvas(0, shape(I))`) and paints the mirrored objects onto it.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
      canvas(0, shape(I)),
      merge(
        (shift(hmirror(toindices(obj)), (height(obj), 0)) if uppermost(obj) < height(I) // 2 
         else shift(vmirror(toindices(obj)), (0, width(obj)))
         for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) in (1, 8))
  ))
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes a more compact approach with list comprehension:

1. **Mirroring Logic:** The core mirroring logic is embedded within the list comprehension, applying horizontal or vertical mirroring based on object position and color.
2. **Merging and Painting:** The mirrored objects are merged, and the resulting set is painted onto a blank canvas.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def mirror_obj(obj):
    return (shift(hmirror(toindices(obj)), (height(obj), 0)) if uppermost(obj) < height(I) // 2
            else shift(vmirror(toindices(obj)), (0, width(obj))))
  
  return paint(
    canvas(0, shape(I)),
    merge(mirror_obj(obj) for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) in (1, 8))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version extracts the mirroring logic into a separate function `mirror_obj` for improved readability:

1. **`mirror_obj` Function:** This function encapsulates the conditional mirroring logic based on object position and color.
2. **Applying `mirror_obj`:** The main function applies `mirror_obj` to each object and paints the merged result onto the canvas. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return paint(
    canvas(0, shape(I)),
    merge(
      shift(
        branch(uppermost(obj) < height(I) // 2, hmirror, vmirror)(toindices(obj)), # Branch for mirror type
        branch(uppermost(obj) < height(I) // 2, (height(obj), 0), (0, width(obj))) # Branch for shift amount
      )
      for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) in (1, 8)
    )
  )
```

**Explanation:**

This version leverages the `branch` function for a more functional approach:

1. **`branch` for Mirroring:**  The `branch` function selects the appropriate mirroring function (`hmirror` or `vmirror`) based on the object's vertical position.
2. **`branch` for Shifting:**  Another `branch` function determines the correct shift amount based on the mirroring type.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  mirrored = frozenset(
    shift(
      hmirror(toindices(obj)) if uppermost(obj) < height(I) // 2 else vmirror(toindices(obj)),
      (height(obj), 0) if uppermost(obj) < height(I) // 2 else (0, width(obj))
    ) 
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) in (1, 8)
  )
  return fill(canvas(0, shape(I)), 8, merge(mirrored)) 
```

**Explanation:**

This version constructs the set of mirrored objects directly using a generator expression:

1. **Generator Expression:** The core logic is encapsulated in a generator expression within `mirrored`, which applies the appropriate mirroring and shifting to each qualifying object. 
2. **Filling the Canvas:** The final step fills a blank canvas with the merged set of mirrored objects.

These five versions provide distinct approaches to solve the transformation, utilizing different DSL function combinations and logic flows while achieving the same desired output for both input grids.
