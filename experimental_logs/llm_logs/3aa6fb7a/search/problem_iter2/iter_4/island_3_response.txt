## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects of color '8' and '1' in the input grid, extracting them, and placing them at specific locations in a new 7x7 output grid. The background of the output grid is always '0'.

**Input 0 to Output 0:**
* The '8' object is shifted one row down and four columns right.
* The '1' object is shifted four rows down and four columns right.

**Input 1 to Output 1:**
* The '8' object is shifted four columns right.
* The '1' object is shifted four rows down and four columns right.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:** (Inspired by Program_A, but uses explicit shifts)

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_8 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  obj_1 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  
  output_grid = canvas(0, (7, 7))
  
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(obj_8, (1, 4)))
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(obj_1, (4, 4)))

  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Extract Objects:** Identifies and extracts objects of color '8' and '1' from the input grid.
2. **Create Canvas:** Creates a blank 7x7 output grid filled with '0'.
3. **Shift and Paint:** Shifts the '8' object by (1, 4) and the '1' object by (4, 4). Then paints these shifted objects onto the output grid.

**Program Version 2:** (Inspired by Program_A, but uses relative positioning)

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_8 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  obj_1 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)

  output_grid = canvas(0, (7, 7))
  
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(obj_8, subtract((1, 4), ulcorner(obj_8))))
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, subtract((4, 4), ulcorner(obj_1)))

  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Extract Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Create Canvas:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Calculate Relative Shift:** Computes the shift required to move the upper-left corner of each object to its target location (1, 4) for '8' and (4, 4) for '1'.
4. **Shift and Paint:**  Shifts and paints the objects based on the calculated relative shifts.

**Program Version 3:** (Inspired by Program_B, but uses object manipulation instead of grid splitting)

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_8 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  obj_1 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)

  output_grid = canvas(0, (7, 7))
  
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(obj_8, (1, 4)))
  temp_grid = paint(output_grid, obj_1)
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(bottomhalf(temp_grid), (4, 0)))

  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Extract Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Create Canvas:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Position '8' Object:** Shifts and paints the '8' object as in Version 1.
4. **Position '1' Object:**  Temporarily paints the '1' object onto the output grid. Then, extracts the bottom half of this temporary grid (containing the '1' object), shifts it four rows down, and paints it back onto the output grid.


**Program Version 4:** (Inspired by Program_A, but utilizes "occurrences" function)

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_8 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  obj_1 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)

  output_grid = canvas(0, (7, 7))

  for i, j in occurrences(I, obj_8):
    output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(obj_8, (1 - i, 4 - j)))
  for i, j in occurrences(I, obj_1):
    output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(obj_1, (4 - i, 4 - j)))

  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Extract Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Create Canvas:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Find Occurrences & Position:** Finds all occurrences of the '8' and '1' objects in the input grid. For each occurrence, calculates the shift needed to align it with the target location and paints the shifted object on the output grid.

**Program Version 5:** (Inspired by Program_A, utilizes "crop" for precise object extraction)

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_8 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  obj_1 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)

  output_grid = canvas(0, (7, 7))

  ul_8 = ulcorner(obj_8)
  ul_1 = ulcorner(obj_1)

  output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(crop(I, ul_8, shape(obj_8)), (1 - ul_8[0], 4 - ul_8[1])))
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(crop(I, ul_1, shape(obj_1)), (4 - ul_1[0], 4 - ul_1[1])))

  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Extract Objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Create Canvas:** Same as Version 1.
3. **Crop & Position:** Finds the upper-left corner and shape of each object. Then crops the input grid to extract the objects precisely. Finally, shifts the cropped objects to their target locations and paints them onto the output grid. 

These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing various DSL functions and logic. Remember to test each version thoroughly with different input grids to ensure they produce the desired output.
