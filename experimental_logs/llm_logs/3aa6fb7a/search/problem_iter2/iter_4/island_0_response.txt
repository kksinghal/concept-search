## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to extract specific objects (identified by digits 8 and 1) from the input grid and place them in a mirrored and shifted manner within a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid. Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. **Extraction:**  The digits '8' and '1' forming objects are extracted from the input grid.
2. **Mirroring:** Each extracted object is mirrored horizontally.
3. **Shifting & Placement:** The mirrored objects are then shifted to the right edge of the canvas.  The '8' object is placed first, followed by the '1' object, leaving no gap between them.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

The same transformation logic applies to Input_1 as described for Input_0. The only difference is the arrangement of '8' and '1' digits in the input grid, resulting in a different output arrangement. 

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct code versions that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)
  obj1 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj8), (0, width(I) - width(obj8))))
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj1), (0, width(I) - width(obj8) - width(obj1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** `toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)` and `toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I)` extract the objects formed by digits '8' and '1' respectively.
2. **Create Canvas:** `canvas(0, shape(I))` creates a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid (`I`) filled with zeros.
3. **Horizontal Mirroring:** `hmirror(obj8)` and `hmirror(obj1)` mirror the extracted objects horizontally.
4. **Calculate Shift:** `width(I) - width(obj8)` calculates the shift required to position the mirrored '8' object to the right edge of the canvas. For the '1' object, an additional shift of `-width(obj1)` is added to place it next to the '8' object.
5. **Shift and Paint:** `shift` function is used to move the mirrored objects by the calculated shift values. `paint` function then places these shifted objects onto the canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  p8 = ofcolor(I, 8)
  p1 = ofcolor(I, 1)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, j in p8:
    O = fill(O, 8, {(i, width(I) - 1 - j)})
  for i, j in p1:
    O = fill(O, 1, {(i, width(I) - 1 - j - width(p8))})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Indices:** `ofcolor(I, 8)` and `ofcolor(I, 1)` get the indices of digits '8' and '1' respectively.
2. **Create Canvas:** Similar to Version 1.
3. **Iterate and Fill:**  The program iterates through the extracted indices of '8' and '1'. For each index (i, j), it calculates the mirrored position on the canvas as `(i, width(I) - 1 - j)` and fills it with the corresponding digit using `fill`.  The '1' object is shifted further by `-width(p8)` to place it next to the '8' object.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = normalize(toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I))
  obj1 = normalize(toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I))
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj8), (0, width(I) - width(obj8))))
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj1), (height(obj8) - height(obj1), width(I) - width(obj8) - width(obj1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 1 but introduces `normalize` function to ensure objects are positioned based on their top-left corner, potentially simplifying the shifting logic in some scenarios.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, F)
  obj8 = argmax(objs, lambda o: colorcount(o, 8))
  obj1 = argmax(objs, lambda o: colorcount(o, 1))
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj8), (0, width(I) - width(obj8))))
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj1), (0, width(I) - width(obj8) - width(obj1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses `objects` function to extract all objects from the input grid and then selects the ones corresponding to digits '8' and '1' using `argmax` and `colorcount`, offering a more general approach for cases with potentially multiple objects.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  canvas_width = width(I)
  p8 = ofcolor(I, 8)
  p1 = ofcolor(I, 1)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  O = fill(O, 8, {(i, canvas_width - 1 - j) for i, j in p8})
  O = fill(O, 1, {(i, canvas_width - 1 - j - width(p8)) for i, j in p1})
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

This version pre-calculates the canvas width (`canvas_width`) and uses it for mirroring and shifting, potentially optimizing for performance in cases where the canvas width is used repeatedly.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the desired transformation by leveraging various DSL functions. Each version comes with its own advantages and potential drawbacks depending on the specific characteristics of the input grids and the overall goal of the transformation task.
