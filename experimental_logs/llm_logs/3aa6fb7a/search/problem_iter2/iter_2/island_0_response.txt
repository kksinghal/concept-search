## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

1. Identify the objects in the input grid, particularly the "8" and "1" objects.
2. Create a new canvas filled with "0"s, with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3. Horizontally mirror the "8" object.
4. Place the mirrored "8" object on the canvas, aligned to the right edge.
5. Place the "1" object to the left of the mirrored "8" object, leaving no space between them.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

This transformation follows the same logic as the previous one, with the difference being the initial position of the "8" and "1" objects in the input grid.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, each with an explanation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), 8))
  obj1 = first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), 1))
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj8), (0, width(I) - width(obj8))))
  O = paint(O, shift(obj1, (0, width(I) - width(obj8) - width(obj1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:**  The program first identifies and extracts the "8" object (`obj8`) and the "1" object (`obj1`) from the input grid `I` using `objects`, `colorfilter`, and `first`. 
2. **Create Canvas:** It then creates a blank canvas `O` filled with "0"s using `canvas` and `shape`, ensuring it has the same dimensions as the input grid.
3. **Mirror and Position:** The "8" object is mirrored horizontally using `hmirror`.  
4. **Paint Objects:**  The mirrored "8" object is then positioned at the right edge of the canvas and painted using `shift` and `paint`. The "1" object is positioned to the left of the mirrored "8", ensuring they touch, and painted onto the canvas.
5. **Return Output:** Finally, the transformed canvas `O` is returned as the output.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = argmax(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: colorcount(o, 8))
  obj1 = argmax(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: colorcount(o, 1))
  output_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(hmirror(obj8), (0, width(I) - width(obj8))))
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(obj1, (0, width(I) - width(obj8) - width(obj1))))
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

This version is very similar to Version 1 but uses `argmax` with a lambda function instead of `first` and `colorfilter` to find the objects with the maximum count of "8" and "1" respectively. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == 8)
  obj1 = extract(objects(I, T, T, T), lambda o: color(o) == 1)
  right_edge = width(I) 
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj8), (0, right_edge - width(obj8))))
  O = paint(O, shift(obj1, (0, right_edge - width(obj8) - width(obj1))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version is similar to Version 1, but it uses `extract` with a lambda function to find the objects with color "8" and "1" instead of `first` and `colorfilter`. It also explicitly calculates the right edge of the canvas.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  p8 = toindices(first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), 8)))
  p1 = toindices(first(colorfilter(objects(I, T, T, T), 1)))
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, j in p8:
    O = fill(O, 8, {(0, width(I) - 1 - j)})
  for i, j in p1:
    O = fill(O, 1, {(0, width(I) - 1 - j - width(p8))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses a different approach by working with indices directly. It extracts the indices of the "8" and "1" objects using `toindices`, iterates through them, mirrors their positions horizontally, and then fills the canvas `O` at the calculated positions using `fill`. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = first(colorfilter(fgpartition(I), 8))
  obj1 = first(colorfilter(fgpartition(I), 1))
  target_pos = (0, width(I) - width(obj8) - width(obj1))
  O = paint(fill(I, 0, asindices(I)), shift(hmirror(obj8), target_pos))
  O = paint(O, shift(obj1, (target_pos[0], target_pos[1] + width(obj8))))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes `fgpartition` to obtain objects without considering the background color. It calculates the target position once and reuses it while placing the objects. The rest of the logic is similar to Version 1, involving mirroring and positioning the objects on a canvas.

These five versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the same transformation using various functions and logic within the provided DSL.  Each version offers a unique approach, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for spatial reasoning tasks.
