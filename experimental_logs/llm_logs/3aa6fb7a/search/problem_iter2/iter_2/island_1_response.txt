## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects consisting of the digit '8' within the input grid and then creating a mirrored copy of these objects. The mirrored copy is then shifted either horizontally or vertically, depending on the original object's position relative to the grid's center. Finally, the original '8' objects are removed, and the mirrored and shifted objects are placed on the grid.

* **Horizontal Mirroring & Vertical Shift:** If the original '8' object's center of mass lies in the top half of the grid, it is mirrored horizontally and shifted downwards by a distance equal to the object's height.

* **Vertical Mirroring & Horizontal Shift:**  If the original '8' object's center of mass lies in the bottom half of the grid, it is mirrored vertically and shifted rightwards by a distance equal to the object's width.

## Program to be Generated:

**Version 1:** (Inspired by identifying objects and conditional mirroring)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8s = objects(I, True, False, True)  # Find connected '8' objects
  new_obj8s = frozenset()
  for obj in obj8s:
    if color(obj) == 8:
      if centerofmass(obj)[0] < len(I) // 2:
        new_obj8s = insert(shift(hmirror(obj), (height(obj), 0)), new_obj8s)
      else:
        new_obj8s = insert(shift(vmirror(obj), (0, width(obj))), new_obj8s)
  return paint(fill(I, 0, asindices(I)), new_obj8s)  # Clear grid and paint new objects
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '8' Objects:**  `objects(I, True, False, True)` identifies connected components of '8's, excluding the background. 
2. **Conditional Mirroring and Shifting:**  Iterate through each object. If it's an '8' object:
    - Determine its position relative to the grid's center using `centerofmass(obj)[0] < len(I) // 2`.
    - Apply `hmirror` and shift down, or `vmirror` and shift right, accordingly.
3. **Combine and Paint:**
    - `fill(I, 0, asindices(I))` creates a blank canvas from the input grid.
    - `paint` places the mirrored and shifted objects onto the blank canvas.

**Version 2:** (Focusing on individual cell manipulation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = canvas(0, (h, w))  # Create an empty output grid
  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == 8:  # If the cell is part of an '8' object
        if i < h // 2:
          O[i + h // 2][j] = 8  # Mirror down
        else:
          O[i][j + w // 2] = 8  # Mirror right
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Grid:**  `canvas(0, (h, w))` generates a grid of zeros with the same dimensions as the input.
2. **Iterate and Mirror:** Loop through each cell in the input grid. If the cell value is '8':
    - If the cell is in the top half, mirror its value to the corresponding cell in the bottom half.
    - If the cell is in the bottom half, mirror its value to the corresponding cell in the right half.

**Version 3:** (Leveraging set operations for efficient manipulation)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  eights = ofcolor(I, 8)
  top_eights = {(i, j) for i, j in eights if i < len(I) // 2}
  bottom_eights = eights - top_eights
  mirrored_top = {(i + len(I) // 2, j) for i, j in top_eights}
  mirrored_bottom = {(i, j + len(I[0]) // 2) for i, j in bottom_eights}
  return fill(I, 8, mirrored_top | mirrored_bottom)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '8' Cells:** `ofcolor(I, 8)` finds the indices of all cells containing '8'.
2. **Split Based on Position:** Divide the '8' indices into two sets: `top_eights` and `bottom_eights`.
3. **Mirror Indices:** Create new sets (`mirrored_top`, `mirrored_bottom`) containing the mirrored indices of the top and bottom '8' cells.
4. **Fill Grid:** Use `fill` to directly place '8's at the mirrored locations in the input grid.

**Version 4:** (Utilizing `apply` for a functional approach)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def transform_object(obj):
    if color(obj) == 8:
      if centerofmass(obj)[0] < len(I) // 2:
        return shift(hmirror(obj), (height(obj), 0))
      else:
        return shift(vmirror(obj), (0, width(obj)))
    return frozenset()  # Return an empty set if not an '8' object
  
  objects_8 = objects(I, True, False, True)
  transformed_objects = apply(transform_object, objects_8)
  return paint(fill(I, 0, asindices(I)), merge(transformed_objects))
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Define `transform_object` Function:** This function takes an object as input and applies the mirroring and shifting logic based on its color and position.
2.  **Apply Transformation:** Use the `apply` function to apply `transform_object` to each object identified in the input grid.
3. **Combine and Paint:** Similar to previous versions, combine the transformed objects and paint them onto a blank canvas.

**Version 5:** (Combining set operations and conditional logic)

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  all_indices = asindices(I)
  eights = ofcolor(I, 8)
  mirrored_indices = {(i + h // 2, j) if i < h // 2 else (i, j + w // 2) for i, j in eights}
  return fill(I, 8, mirrored_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get All Indices:**  `asindices(I)` retrieves all cell indices in the grid.
2. **Identify '8' Indices:**  `ofcolor(I, 8)` finds the indices of cells containing '8'.
3. **Calculate Mirrored Indices:** Use a set comprehension to calculate the mirrored indices for each '8' cell, considering its position.
4. **Fill Grid:**  `fill` places '8's at the calculated mirrored indices in the input grid.


Each version of the "Program_to_be_generated" provides a different approach to achieve the desired transformation, showcasing the flexibility and diversity of solutions possible within the DSL.
