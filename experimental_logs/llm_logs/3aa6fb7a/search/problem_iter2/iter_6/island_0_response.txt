## Transformation Analysis:

**Input_0 to Output_0:** The transformation involves extracting the '8' and '1' objects, horizontally mirroring them, and placing them on a blank canvas of the same size as the input. The '8' object is positioned at the right edge of the canvas, and the '1' object is placed to its left, adjacent to it.

**Input_1 to Output_1:** This transformation follows the same logic as the previous one. It extracts the '8' and '1' objects, mirrors them horizontally, and positions them on a blank canvas. The positioning ensures the '8' object touches the right edge and the '1' object sits to its left, directly beside it.

## Program_to_be_generated:

Here are five distinct program versions using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)  # Extract object of color '8'
  obj1 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I)  # Extract object of color '1'
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))             # Create a blank canvas
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj8), (0, width(O) - width(obj8)))) # Mirror and place '8' 
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj1), (0, width(O) - width(obj8) - width(obj1)))) # Mirror and place '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** The code begins by extracting the objects formed by digits '8' and '1' from the input grid 'I' and storing them in variables 'obj8' and 'obj1' respectively.
2. **Create Canvas:** A blank canvas 'O' is created with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with the value '0'.
3. **Mirror and Position '8':** The 'obj8' is horizontally mirrored using 'hmirror(obj8)'. Then, it is shifted to the right edge of the canvas using 'shift' with a calculated offset. The offset ensures the rightmost column of the mirrored '8' object aligns with the right edge of the canvas.
4. **Mirror and Position '1':**  Similar to 'obj8', 'obj1' is mirrored horizontally.  It's then shifted to be adjacent to the placed '8' object. The offset calculation considers the widths of both the canvas and the '8' object to ensure correct placement.
5. **Return Output:** Finally, the modified canvas 'O' containing the transformed objects is returned.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  p8 = ofcolor(I, 8)              # Get indices of color '8'
  p1 = ofcolor(I, 1)              # Get indices of color '1'
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))          # Create a blank canvas
  for i, j in p8:
    O = fill(O, 8, {(i, width(I) - 1 - j)})  # Mirror and fill '8'
  for i, j in p1:
    O = fill(O, 1, {(i, width(I) - 1 - j - width(p8))})  # Mirror and fill '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Get Indices:** This version focuses on cell indices instead of objects. 'p8' and 'p1' store the indices of cells containing '8' and '1' respectively.
2. **Create Canvas:** A blank canvas 'O' is created, similar to Version 1.
3. **Mirror and Fill '8':**  The code iterates through each index in 'p8'. For every (i, j) in 'p8', it calculates the mirrored index (i, width(I) - 1 - j) and fills the canvas 'O' with '8' at that mirrored location. 
4. **Mirror and Fill '1':** Similar to 'p8', it iterates through 'p1'.  The mirrored index calculation also incorporates the width of 'p8' to ensure the '1' object is placed directly to the left of the mirrored '8' object.
5. **Return Output:** The transformed canvas 'O' is returned. 

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = normalize(toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I))  # Extract and normalize '8'
  obj1 = normalize(toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I))  # Extract and normalize '1'
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))                        # Create a blank canvas
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj8), (0, width(I) - width(obj8))))  # Mirror & position '8'
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj1), (0, width(I) - width(obj8) - width(obj1))))  # Mirror & position '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

 This version is very similar to Version 1 but incorporates normalization using 'normalize' for the extracted objects 'obj8' and 'obj1'. This ensures consistent positioning regardless of the original object's location in the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, F)                 # Extract all objects
  obj8 = argmax(objs, lambda o: colorcount(o, 8))  # Find the '8' object 
  obj1 = argmax(objs, lambda o: colorcount(o, 1))  # Find the '1' object
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))                         # Create a blank canvas
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj8), (0, width(I) - width(obj8))))  # Mirror & position '8'
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj1), (0, width(I) - width(obj8) - width(obj1))))  # Mirror & position '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

 This version first extracts all objects from the input grid using 'objects'. Then, it utilizes 'argmax' with 'colorcount' to specifically identify the objects with the maximum count of '8' and '1', ensuring it selects the correct objects even if there are multiple disconnected components of the same color. The rest of the logic for mirroring and positioning remains the same as in Version 1.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  canvas_width = width(I)                     # Get canvas width
  p8 = ofcolor(I, 8)                         # Get indices of '8'
  p1 = ofcolor(I, 1)                         # Get indices of '1'
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))                      # Create empty canvas
  O = fill(O, 8, {(i, canvas_width - 1 - j) for i, j in p8})  # Mirror & fill '8'
  O = fill(O, 1, {(i, canvas_width - 1 - j - width(p8)) for i, j in p1})  # Mirror & fill '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

 This version is structurally very similar to Version 2. It pre-calculates the 'canvas_width' for efficiency and readability. Instead of calculating the width inside the loop for each cell, it uses the pre-calculated 'canvas_width', making the mirroring and filling logic slightly more concise.
