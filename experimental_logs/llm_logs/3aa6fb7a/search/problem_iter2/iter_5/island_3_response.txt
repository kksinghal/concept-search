## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation seems to involve identifying specific objects (colored patches) within the input grid and relocating them to predefined positions in the output grid. 

Let's analyze the input-output pairs to understand the specific logic:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* An object with color '8' is identified and moved one row down and four columns right.
* An object with color '1' is identified and moved four rows and four columns down.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* An object with color '8' is identified and moved four columns right.
* An object with color '1' is identified and moved three rows and four columns down.

## Code Improvement (x5):

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL to achieve the described transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_8 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  obj_1 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  
  output_grid = canvas(0, (7, 7))
  
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(obj_8, (1, 4)))
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(obj_1, (4, 4)))

  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** The program first identifies objects with color '8' and '1' using `objects` and `extract` functions.
2. **Create Canvas:** A blank canvas of size 7x7 is created using the `canvas` function.
3. **Relocate Objects:** The identified objects are shifted to their new positions using `shift` and painted onto the canvas using `paint`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  indices_8 = ofcolor(I, 8)
  indices_1 = ofcolor(I, 1)

  output_grid = canvas(0, (7, 7))

  output_grid = fill(output_grid, 8, shift(indices_8, (1, 4)))
  output_grid = fill(output_grid, 1, shift(indices_1, (4, 4)))

  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Indices:** The program identifies indices of cells with colors '8' and '1' using the `ofcolor` function.
2. **Create Canvas:** A blank canvas of size 7x7 is created using the `canvas` function.
3. **Fill Cells:** The identified indices are shifted to their new positions using `shift` and filled with the respective colors using `fill`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  output_grid = canvas(0, (7, 7))

  for i, r in enumerate(I):
    for j, v in enumerate(r):
      if v == 8:
        output_grid = paint(output_grid, {(v, (i + 1, j + 4))})
      elif v == 1:
        output_grid = paint(output_grid, {(v, (i + 4, j + 4))})

  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas:** A blank canvas of size 7x7 is created using the `canvas` function.
2. **Iterate and Paint:** The program iterates through each cell of the input grid. If the cell's value is '8' or '1', it creates a single-cell object and paints it onto the output grid at the specified offset. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_8 = extract(partition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  obj_1 = extract(partition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)

  output_grid = canvas(0, (7, 7))

  output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(obj_8, (1, 4)))
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(obj_1, (4, 4)))

  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition and Extract:** The program partitions the input grid into objects based on color using `partition` and extracts the objects with colors '8' and '1' using `extract`. 
2. **Create Canvas:** A blank canvas of size 7x7 is created using the `canvas` function.
3. **Relocate Objects:**  Similar to version 1, identified objects are shifted and painted onto the canvas.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  output_grid = apply(lambda row: apply(lambda v: 8 if (v == 8) else (1 if (v == 1) else 0), row), canvas(0, (7, 7)))

  output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(recolor(8, ofcolor(I, 8)), (1, 4)))
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(recolor(1, ofcolor(I, 1)), (4, 4)))

  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Canvas and Pre-fill:** A canvas of size 7x7 is created and pre-filled with '8' for cells corresponding to color '8' in the input and '1' for cells corresponding to color '1' in the input. 
2. **Identify Indices and Recolor:** The program identifies indices of cells with colors '8' and '1' using `ofcolor` and recolors them to their respective values using `recolor`.
3. **Shift and Paint:** The recolored indices are shifted and painted onto the pre-filled canvas. 

## Conclusion:

These five program versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the same transformation using the provided DSL. Each version utilizes various function combinations and logic, showcasing the flexibility and expressive power of the DSL.
