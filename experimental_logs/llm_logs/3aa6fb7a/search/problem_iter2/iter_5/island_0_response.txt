## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation appears to involve mirroring the '8' object and the '1' object horizontally within the grid, then placing them at the rightmost edge of the grid. The relative vertical positioning of the '8' and '1' objects is maintained after the transformation.

## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL:

**Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)  # Extract '8' object
  obj1 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I)  # Extract '1' object
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))             # Create empty canvas
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj8), (0, width(I) - width(obj8))))  # Mirror & position '8'
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj1), (0, width(I) - width(obj8) - width(obj1))))  # Mirror & position '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Extract the '8' and '1' objects from the input grid `I`.
2. Create an empty canvas `O` with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3. Mirror the '8' object horizontally (`hmirror`).
4. Shift the mirrored '8' object to the rightmost edge of the canvas (`shift`).
5. Paint the shifted and mirrored '8' object onto the canvas.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 for the '1' object, placing it to the left of the '8' object.

**Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  p8 = ofcolor(I, 8)                # Get indices of '8'
  p1 = ofcolor(I, 1)                # Get indices of '1'
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))             # Create empty canvas
  for i, j in p8:
    O = fill(O, 8, {(i, width(I) - 1 - j)})  # Mirror & fill '8'
  for i, j in p1:
    O = fill(O, 1, {(i, width(I) - 1 - j - width(p8))})  # Mirror & fill '1'
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. Obtain the indices of the '8' and '1' cells in the input grid.
2. Create an empty canvas with the same dimensions as the input.
3. Iterate through the indices of '8' cells and fill corresponding mirrored positions on the canvas with '8'.
4. Iterate through the indices of '1' cells and fill corresponding mirrored positions, offset by the width of the '8' object, with '1'.

**Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj8 = normalize(toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I))  # Extract and normalize '8'
  obj1 = normalize(toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I))  # Extract and normalize '1'
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))                        # Create empty canvas
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj8), (0, width(I) - width(obj8))))  # Mirror & position '8'
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj1), (height(obj8) - height(obj1), width(I) - width(obj8) - width(obj1))))  # Mirror & position '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Extract the '8' and '1' objects and normalize them to have their upper left corner at the origin.
2. Create an empty canvas with the same dimensions as the input.
3. Mirror the normalized '8' object horizontally and shift it to the rightmost edge of the canvas.
4. Paint the mirrored '8' object onto the canvas.
5. Mirror the normalized '1' object horizontally.
6. Shift the mirrored '1' object to the rightmost edge, aligning its top with the bottom of the '8' object.
7. Paint the mirrored and shifted '1' object onto the canvas.

**Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, F)                # Extract all objects
  obj8 = argmax(objs, lambda o: colorcount(o, 8))  # Find the '8' object
  obj1 = argmax(objs, lambda o: colorcount(o, 1))  # Find the '1' object
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))                         # Create empty canvas
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj8), (0, width(I) - width(obj8))))  # Mirror & position '8'
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj1), (0, width(I) - width(obj8) - width(obj1))))  # Mirror & position '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. Extract all objects from the input grid.
2. Find the objects corresponding to '8' and '1' by maximizing the count of their respective colors.
3. Create an empty canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid.
4. Mirror the '8' object horizontally and shift it to the rightmost edge.
5. Paint the mirrored and shifted '8' object onto the canvas.
6. Mirror the '1' object horizontally and shift it to the rightmost edge, placing it to the left of the '8' object.
7. Paint the mirrored and shifted '1' object onto the canvas.

**Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  canvas_width = width(I)                     # Get canvas width
  p8 = ofcolor(I, 8)                         # Get indices of '8'
  p1 = ofcolor(I, 1)                         # Get indices of '1'
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))                      # Create empty canvas
  O = fill(O, 8, {(i, canvas_width - 1 - j) for i, j in p8})  # Mirror & fill '8'
  O = fill(O, 1, {(i, canvas_width - 1 - j - width(p8)) for i, j in p1})  # Mirror & fill '1'
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. Obtain the width of the input grid.
2. Obtain the indices of the '8' and '1' cells in the input grid.
3. Create an empty canvas with the same dimensions as the input grid.
4. Iterate through the indices of '8' cells and fill corresponding mirrored positions on the canvas, calculated using the canvas width, with '8'.
5. Iterate through the indices of '1' cells and fill corresponding mirrored positions, offset by the width of the '8' object, with '1'.
