## Transformation Analysis:

**Input 0 to Output 0:**

The transformation extracts two objects from the input: the "8" object and the "1" object. These objects are then moved to specific locations in the output grid. The "8" object is positioned in the top-right corner, while the "1" object is placed below it. The remaining grid cells are filled with the background color "0".

**Input 1 to Output 1:**

Similar to the previous transformation, this one also extracts the "8" and "1" objects. However, this time, the "8" object is placed in the top-left corner, while the "1" object is positioned diagonally below it. Again, the rest of the grid is filled with the background color "0".


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct programs to achieve the desired transformations:

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F) 
  obj_8 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  obj_1 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  
  output_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(obj_8, (1, 4)))
  output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(obj_1, (4, 4)))
  
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract objects:** Identify the "8" and "1" objects from the input grid.
2. **Create blank canvas:** Generate an empty grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with the background color "0".
3. **Position objects:** Move and paint the "8" and "1" objects to their target locations on the output grid.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_8 = extract(partition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  obj_1 = extract(partition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  
  output_grid = canvas(0, (7,7))
  if uppermost(obj_1) < uppermost(obj_8):
    output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(obj_8, (0, 4)))
    output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(obj_1, (3, 4)))
  else:
    output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(obj_8, (1, 4)))
    output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(obj_1, (4, 4)))
  
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Partition and Extract:** Divide the input grid into individual objects based on color and extract the "8" and "1" objects.
2. **Conditional Positioning:** Determine the relative vertical positions of the objects in the input. Based on this, move and paint them onto a pre-defined 7x7 canvas filled with "0". 

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, F)
  obj_8 = argmax(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 8 and size(obj) > 1)
  obj_1 = argmax(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1 and size(obj) > 1)
  
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  if obj_8 is not None:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj_8, (1, 4)))
  if obj_1 is not None:
    O = paint(O, shift(obj_1, (4, 4)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extract all connected objects from the input grid.
2. **Filter Objects:** Find the largest object consisting of '8's and the largest object consisting of '1's.
3. **Create Canvas:** Create a canvas filled with '0's having the same shape as the input.
4. **Paint Objects:** Paint the extracted '8' object shifted to the right by 4 cells and the '1' object shifted down by 4 cells on the canvas.

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj_8 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  obj_1 = extract(objects(I, T, F, T), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  
  O = canvas(0, (7,7))
  
  O = paint(O, shift(obj_8, (1, 4)))
  O = paint(O, shift(obj_1, (4, 4)))

  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extract the connected objects containing '8's and '1's from the input grid, including diagonal connections.
2. **Create Canvas:** Create a 7x7 canvas filled with '0's.
3. **Paint Objects:** Paint the extracted '8' object shifted to the right by 4 cells and the '1' object shifted down by 4 cells on the canvas.

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    obj_8 = extract(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
    obj_1 = extract(fgpartition(I), lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)

    output_grid = canvas(0, shape(I))
    if obj_1 is not None and obj_8 is not None:
        if uppermost(obj_1) < uppermost(obj_8):
            output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(obj_8, (0, 4)))
            output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(obj_1, (3, 4)))
        else:
            output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(obj_8, (1, 4)))
            output_grid = paint(output_grid, shift(obj_1, (4, 4)))
    return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** Extract the '8' and '1' objects from the input, ignoring the background color.
2. **Create Canvas:** Create a canvas of the same size as the input, filled with '0's.
3. **Position Objects:** If both '8' and '1' objects exist, determine their relative positions in the input and paint them on the canvas accordingly. The '8' object is either placed in the top-right or top-left corner, and the '1' object is placed below it.


Each program version utilizes a different combination of DSL functions and logic, showcasing diverse approaches to achieve the same transformation.
