## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation takes the two objects on the input grid (corresponding to the digits '8' and '1') and mirrors them horizontally. The mirrored objects are then placed on a blank canvas of the same dimensions as the input grid. The '8' object is positioned at the right edge of the canvas, and the '1' object is placed to its left.


## Program Version 1:
**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I) 
  obj1 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I)
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))           
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj8), (0, width(O) - width(obj8)))) 
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj1), (0, width(O) - width(obj8) - width(obj1)))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Extract objects:**  `obj8 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)` and  `obj1 = toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I)` extract the objects composed of '8' and '1' from the input grid 'I'. 
2. **Create blank canvas:** `O = canvas(0, shape(I))` creates a blank canvas 'O' of the same size as the input grid 'I', filled with '0'.
3. **Mirror and position '8' object:** 
    - `hmirror(obj8)` mirrors the '8' object horizontally.
    - `(0, width(O) - width(obj8))` calculates the offset to place the mirrored '8' at the right edge of the canvas.
    - `shift(hmirror(obj8), (0, width(O) - width(obj8)))` shifts the mirrored '8' object to the calculated position.
    - `paint(O, ...)` paints the shifted object onto the canvas 'O'.
4. **Mirror and position '1' object:**  This follows the same logic as step 3, but the offset calculation also considers the width of the '8' object to position '1' correctly.
5. **Return output:** Finally, the modified canvas 'O' is returned as the output. 


## Program Version 2:
**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  p8 = ofcolor(I, 8)  
  p1 = ofcolor(I, 1) 
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, j in p8:
    O = fill(O, 8, {(i, width(I) - 1 - j)})  
  for i, j in p1:
    O = fill(O, 1, {(i, width(I) - 1 - j - width(p8))}) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Get indices:** `p8 = ofcolor(I, 8)` and `p1 = ofcolor(I, 1)` get the indices of cells containing '8' and '1' respectively.
2. **Create canvas:** `O = canvas(0, shape(I))` creates a blank canvas of the input's size.
3. **Mirror and fill '8':** 
    - The code iterates over each index `(i, j)` in `p8`.
    - `(i, width(I) - 1 - j)` calculates the mirrored index.
    - `fill(O, 8, {(i, width(I) - 1 - j)})` fills the canvas 'O' with '8' at the mirrored location.
4. **Mirror and fill '1':** Similar to step 3, but the mirrored index calculation considers the width of the '8' object to avoid overlap.
5. **Return Output:** Returns the modified canvas 'O'.

## Program Version 3:
**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj8 = normalize(toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I)) 
  obj1 = normalize(toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I)) 
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) 
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj8), (0, width(I) - width(obj8)))) 
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj1), (0, width(I) - width(obj8) - width(obj1)))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
This version is similar to version 1, but it introduces the `normalize` function:
1. **Normalize objects:** `obj8 = normalize(toobject(ofcolor(I, 8), I))` and `obj1 = normalize(toobject(ofcolor(I, 1), I))` extract the '8' and '1' objects and then normalize them, moving their upper-left corners to the origin (0,0). 
2. **Create canvas, mirror, position, and paint:** These steps are identical to version 1. 
Using `normalize` can simplify calculations in certain scenarios, though it's not strictly necessary for this specific transformation.

## Program Version 4:
**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, T, F) 
  obj8 = argmax(objs, lambda o: colorcount(o, 8))
  obj1 = argmax(objs, lambda o: colorcount(o, 1))
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) 
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj8), (0, width(I) - width(obj8)))) 
  O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj1), (0, width(I) - width(obj8) - width(obj1)))) 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
This version focuses on finding objects based on their color dominance:
1. **Extract all objects:** `objs = objects(I, T, T, F)` extracts all objects from the input grid, considering both diagonal and non-diagonal connections and including the background. 
2. **Find '8' and '1' objects:** 
    - `argmax(objs, lambda o: colorcount(o, 8))` finds the object in 'objs' with the maximum count of color '8'.
    - Similarly, `argmax(objs, lambda o: colorcount(o, 1))` finds the object with the maximum count of '1'.
3. **Create canvas, mirror, position, and paint:** These steps are identical to version 1.

## Program Version 5:
**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  canvas_width = width(I)  
  p8 = ofcolor(I, 8)  
  p1 = ofcolor(I, 1)  
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) 
  O = fill(O, 8, {(i, canvas_width - 1 - j) for i, j in p8}) 
  O = fill(O, 1, {(i, canvas_width - 1 - j - width(p8)) for i, j in p1})  
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
This version pre-calculates the canvas width for slight optimization:
1. **Get canvas width:** `canvas_width = width(I)` stores the width of the input grid for later use.
2. **Get indices, create canvas:** These steps are identical to version 2.
3. **Mirror and fill:**  This part is similar to version 2, but it uses the pre-calculated `canvas_width` instead of recalculating `width(I)` in each iteration.
4. **Return Output:** Returns the modified canvas.

These versions demonstrate various ways to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL. Each version utilizes different functions and logic, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL in solving this spatial reasoning task.
