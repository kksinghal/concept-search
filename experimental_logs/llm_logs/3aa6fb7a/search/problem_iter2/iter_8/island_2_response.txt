## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves extracting two specific objects from the input grid, one composed of the digit '1' and the other composed of the digit '8', and placing them onto a blank 7x7 canvas. The placement and orientation of these objects depend on the size of the input grid:

**For smaller input grids (len(I) < 20):**

1. **Extraction:** Both '1' and '8' objects are extracted.
2. **Placement:** The objects are moved to the top left corner of the canvas with an offset of (1, 1).
3. **Orientation:** The objects retain their original orientation.

**For larger input grids (len(I) >= 20):**

1. **Extraction:** Both '1' and '8' objects are extracted.
2. **Placement:** The objects are moved to the top center of the canvas with an offset of (1, 4).
3. **Orientation:** The objects are horizontally mirrored before placement.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj1 = next((obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) == 1), None)
  obj8 = next((obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) == 8), None)
  target_loc = (1, 1) if len(I) < 20 else (1, 4)
  O = canvas(0, (7, 7))
  if obj1 is not None and obj8 is not None:
    if len(I) < 20:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj1, target_loc))
      O = paint(O, shift(obj8, target_loc))
    else:
      O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj1), target_loc))
      O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj8), target_loc))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** We directly extract the objects composed of '1' and '8' using `objects`, `color`, and `next`.
2. **Determine Target Location:** The target location is determined based on the input size.
3. **Create Canvas:** A 7x7 canvas filled with '0' is created.
4. **Conditional Placement and Mirroring:** The objects are conditionally shifted and mirrored based on input size and painted onto the canvas.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, True)
  obj1 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 1)
  obj8 = extract(objs, lambda obj: color(obj) == 8)
  O = canvas(0, (7, 7))
  if obj1 is not None and obj8 is not None:
    target_loc = (1, 1) if len(I) < 20 else (1, 4)
    O = paint(O, shift(obj1, target_loc))
    O = paint(O, shift(obj8, target_loc))
    if len(I) >= 20:
      O = hmirror(O)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** We first extract all objects and then use `extract` to find the desired '1' and '8' objects.
2. **Determine Target Location:** Similar to Version 1.
3. **Create Canvas:** Similar to Version 1.
4. **Placement and Conditional Mirroring:** Objects are placed first and then the entire canvas is mirrored if the input size is large.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_loc = (1, 1) if len(I) < 20 else (1, 4)
  O = canvas(0, (7, 7))
  for v in [1, 8]:
    obj = next((obj for obj in objects(I, True, False, True) if color(obj) == v), None)
    if obj is not None:
      if len(I) < 20:
        O = paint(O, shift(obj, target_loc))
      else:
        O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj), target_loc))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Determine Target Location:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Create Canvas:** Similar to Version 1.
3. **Iterative Processing:** We iterate through colors '1' and '8', extract corresponding objects, and place them based on input size.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = mfilter(objects(I, True, False, True), lambda obj: color(obj) in {1, 8})
  target_loc = (1, 1) if len(I) < 20 else (1, 4)
  O = canvas(0, (7, 7))
  for obj in objs:
    if len(I) < 20:
      O = paint(O, shift(obj, target_loc))
    else:
      O = paint(O, shift(hmirror(obj), target_loc))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Extract Objects:** We extract all objects and filter for those with color '1' or '8' using `mfilter`.
2. **Determine Target Location:** Similar to Version 1.
3. **Create Canvas:** Similar to Version 1.
4. **Iterative Placement and Mirroring:** We iterate through extracted objects and place them based on input size.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_loc = (1, 1) if len(I) < 20 else (1, 4)
  O = canvas(0, (7, 7))
  for v, locs in [(1, ofcolor(I, 1)), (8, ofcolor(I, 8))]:
    if len(locs) > 0:
      if len(I) < 20:
        O = fill(O, v, shift(locs, target_loc))
      else:
        O = fill(O, v, shift(hmirror(locs), target_loc))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Determine Target Location:** Similar to Version 1.
2. **Create Canvas:** Similar to Version 1.
3. **Iterative Processing with Indices:**  We iterate through colors '1' and '8', find their indices in the input using `ofcolor`, and fill the canvas at appropriate locations based on input size.


These five versions demonstrate distinct approaches using different combinations of DSL functions to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL.
