## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on placing a '1' to the right of the top-leftmost '8' in each connected object within the grid. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

- The top-leftmost '8' in the first object (top-left) has a '1' placed to its right.
- The top-leftmost '8' in the second object (bottom-middle) has a '1' placed to its right.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

- The top-leftmost '8' in the first object (top-right) has a '1' placed to its right.
- The top-leftmost '8' in the second object (bottom-middle) has a '1' placed to its right.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  def find_target(obj):
    for _, (i, j) in sorted(obj): 
      if j + 1 < width(I) and (I[i][j+1] == 0 or (i, j+1) in toindices(obj)):
        return (i, j + 1)
    return None
  target_indices = mfilter(objs, find_target)
  O = fill(I, ONE, target_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** `objects(I, T, F, T)` identifies connected objects (8s) in the grid.
2. **Find target index:** `find_target(obj)` iterates through the sorted object coordinates and finds the index to the right of the top-leftmost '8' that's either empty or part of the same object.
3. **Collect target indices:** `mfilter(objs, find_target)` applies `find_target` to each object and merges the results.
4. **Fill target indices:** `fill(I, ONE, target_indices)` fills the target indices with '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  def get_target(obj):
    corner = ulcorner(obj)
    return (corner[0], corner[1] + 1) if corner[1] + 1 < width(I) else None
  O = I
  for obj in objs:
    target = get_target(obj)
    if target:
      O = fill(O, ONE, {target})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Get target index:** `get_target(obj)` calculates the index to the right of the upper-left corner of the object.
3. **Iterate and fill:** The program iterates through each object. If a valid target index exists, it fills it with '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def check_and_mark(i, j):
    if I[i][j] == 8 and j + 1 < width(I) and (I[i][j+1] == 0 or I[i][j+1] == 8):
      return (i, j + 1)
    return None
  indices = prapply(check_and_mark, range(height(I)), range(width(I)))
  O = fill(I, ONE, indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Check and mark:** `check_and_mark(i, j)` checks if a cell is '8' and has a valid empty or same-color cell to its right, returning the target index if true.
2. **Apply to all cells:** `prapply` applies `check_and_mark` to all cell indices in the grid.
3. **Fill target indices:** Same as Version 1.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(width(I) - 1):
      if I[i][j] == 8 and (I[i][j+1] == 0 or I[i][j+1] == 8):
        O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j+1)})
        break
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Iterate and check:** Iterates through each cell, checking if it's '8' and has a valid right neighbor.
2. **Fill and break:** If true, fills the right neighbor with '1' and breaks the inner loop to move to the next row, ensuring only one '1' per object per row.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def mark_right(obj):
    min_j = width(I)
    target_i = None
    for _, (i, j) in obj:
      if j < min_j:
        min_j = j
        target_i = i
    return (target_i, min_j + 1) if min_j + 1 < width(I) else None
  objs = objects(I, T, F, T)
  target_indices = mfilter(objs, mark_right)
  return fill(I, ONE, target_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:** Same as Version 1.
2. **Mark right:** `mark_right(obj)` finds the leftmost cell of the object and calculates the target index to its right.
3. **Collect target indices and fill:** Same as Version 1.


These five versions provide diverse approaches to achieve the desired transformation using different DSL function combinations and logic.
