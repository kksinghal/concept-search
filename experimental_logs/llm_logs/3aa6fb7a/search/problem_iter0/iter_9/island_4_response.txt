## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '8' in the input grid and placing a '1' at the position one cell diagonally down and to the right of the upper-right corner of each '8' object, provided that position is within the grid boundaries.

**Example Breakdown:**

* **Input_0:** The '8' object's upper-right corner is at (2, 2). One cell diagonally down and to the right is (3, 3), which is within the grid. Therefore, a '1' is placed at (3, 3).
* **Input_1:** There are two '8' objects. For the top object, the target location is (1, 6), which is within the grid, so a '1' is placed. For the bottom object, the target location is (6, 2), and a '1' is placed there as well.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def place_one(obj):
    target_loc = add(urcorner(toindices(obj)), DOWN_LEFT)
    return fill(I, ONE, {target_loc}) if contained(target_loc, asindices(I)) else I
  return functools.reduce(place_one, objects(I, T, F, F), I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`place_one(obj)`:** This function takes an object as input and calculates the target location (`target_loc`) where '1' needs to be placed. It then checks if `target_loc` is within the grid boundaries using `contained`. If it is, it uses `fill` to place a '1' at that location in the grid `I`. Otherwise, it returns the grid unchanged.

2. **`functools.reduce(place_one, objects(I, T, F, F), I)`:** This part first identifies all objects formed by any digit (not just '8') using `objects(I, T, F, F)`. It then iterates through each object, applying the `place_one` function. The `functools.reduce` function ensures that the grid is updated with each object's '1' placement. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def mark_location(grid, obj):
    target_loc = add(urcorner(toindices(obj)), DOWN_LEFT)
    return fill(grid, ONE, {target_loc}) if contained(target_loc, asindices(grid)) else grid
  return mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: mark_location(I, obj))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`mark_location(grid, obj)`:** Similar to `place_one` in version 1, this function calculates the `target_loc` and fills it with '1' if it's within bounds.

2. **`mfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), lambda obj: mark_location(I, obj))`:**  This applies `mark_location` to each object found in the grid using `objects` and merges the results using `mfilter`. This ensures all target locations are marked with '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_locations = mapply(lambda obj: add(urcorner(toindices(obj)), DOWN_LEFT), objects(I, T, F, F))
  valid_locations = intersection(target_locations, asindices(I))
  return fill(I, ONE, valid_locations)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`target_locations = ...`**: This line calculates all potential target locations by applying the location calculation logic (`add(urcorner(toindices(obj)), DOWN_LEFT)`) to each object using `mapply`.

2. **`valid_locations = ...`**: This filters the `target_locations`, keeping only those within the grid boundaries using `intersection`.

3. **`return fill(I, ONE, valid_locations)`**: This fills all the `valid_locations` with '1' in the input grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def get_target_and_fill(obj):
    target_loc = add(urcorner(toindices(obj)), DOWN_LEFT)
    return (ONE, target_loc) if contained(target_loc, asindices(I)) else None
  new_cells = frozenset(x for x in apply(get_target_and_fill, objects(I, T, F, F)) if x is not None)
  return paint(I, new_cells)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`get_target_and_fill(obj)`**: Calculates the `target_loc` and returns a tuple of (ONE, `target_loc`) if the location is valid, else returns None.

2. **`new_cells = ...`**: This line applies `get_target_and_fill` to each object, filters out None values, and stores valid (ONE, `target_loc`) tuples in `new_cells`.

3. **`return paint(I, new_cells)`**: Finally, it uses `paint` to directly paint the `new_cells` onto the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  new_grid = I
  for obj in objects(I, T, F, F):
    target_loc = add(urcorner(toindices(obj)), DOWN_LEFT)
    if contained(target_loc, asindices(I)):
      new_grid = fill(new_grid, ONE, {target_loc})
  return new_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`new_grid = I`**: Creates a copy of the input grid to avoid modifying the original.

2. **`for obj in objects(I, T, F, F)`**: Iterates through each object in the input grid.

3. **`target_loc = ...`**: Calculates the target location for each object.

4. **`if contained(target_loc, asindices(I))`**:  Checks if the calculated `target_loc` is within the grid.

5. **`new_grid = fill(new_grid, ONE, {target_loc})`**: If the `target_loc` is valid, fills that location with '1' in the `new_grid`.

6. **`return new_grid`**: Returns the modified grid.

These five program versions demonstrate different approaches and DSL function combinations to achieve the desired transformation while ensuring diversity in logic and structure.
