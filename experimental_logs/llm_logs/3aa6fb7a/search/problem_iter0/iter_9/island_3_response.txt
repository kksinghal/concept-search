## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify connected horizontal segments of the digit '8' and place a '1' to the right of each segment. Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* Two horizontal '8' segments are present: one in the second row and one in the fourth row.
* The transformation places a '1' to the right of each segment's rightmost '8'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* Four horizontal '8' segments exist, one in each of the first four rows and the last two rows.
* Similar to the previous example, a '1' is placed immediately to the right of the rightmost '8' in each segment.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the program "Program_to_be_generated" that can achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Finds horizontal segments of 8s and marks the cell to their right with a 1.

  Args:
    I: The input grid.

  Returns:
    The transformed grid.
  """
  target_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 8 and loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[loc[0]][loc[1] + 1] == 8)
  shifted_indices = apply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), target_indices)
  return fill(I, 1, shifted_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`target_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 8 and loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[loc[0]][loc[1] + 1] == 8)`**: This line finds all indices in the grid where an '8' is present, and it's followed by another '8' to its right. This identifies the rightmost '8' of each horizontal segment.
2. **`shifted_indices = apply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), target_indices)`**: This line shifts each of the identified indices one position to the right, targeting the cell where '1' needs to be placed.
3. **`return fill(I, 1, shifted_indices)`**: This line fills the grid 'I' with '1' at the `shifted_indices`, resulting in the transformed grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Identifies and marks the rightmost 8 of horizontal segments with a 1.

  Args:
    I: The input grid.

  Returns:
    The transformed grid.
  """
  def is_right_eight(loc):
    i, j = loc
    return I[i][j] == 8 and (j + 1 == len(I[0]) or I[i][j + 1] != 8)
  right_eights = mfilter(asindices(I), is_right_eight)
  shifted_right_eights = apply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), right_eights)
  return fill(I, 1, shifted_right_eights)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_right_eight(loc)` function**: This function checks if a given location in the grid contains an '8' that is the rightmost '8' of a horizontal segment.
2. **`right_eights = mfilter(asindices(I), is_right_eight)`**: This line finds all indices of the rightmost '8's in horizontal segments.
3. **`shifted_right_eights = apply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), right_eights)`**: Similar to Version 1, this shifts the identified indices one position to the right.
4. **`return fill(I, 1, shifted_right_eights)`**: This line fills the grid 'I' with '1' at the `shifted_right_eights`, resulting in the transformed grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Uses object detection to mark the cells adjacent to horizontal 8 segments.

  Args:
    I: The input grid.

  Returns:
    The transformed grid.
  """
  objects_8 = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  horizontal_segments = mfilter(objects_8, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1 and hline(obj))
  right_neighbors = mapply(lambda obj: {(v, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j + 1 < len(I[0])}, horizontal_segments)
  return paint(I, merge(right_neighbors))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects_8 = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)`**: This line detects all connected objects formed by the digit '8'.
2. **`horizontal_segments = mfilter(objects_8, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1 and hline(obj))`**: This filters out only the horizontal segments of '8's.
3. **`right_neighbors = mapply(lambda obj: {(v, (i, j + 1)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j + 1 < len(I[0])}, horizontal_segments)`**: For each horizontal segment, this identifies the cells immediately to the right of each '8' in the segment.
4. **`return paint(I, merge(right_neighbors))`**: This paints the identified right neighbor cells with '1' onto the input grid, resulting in the transformed grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Iterates through rows and places 1s after horizontal 8 segments.

  Args:
    I: The input grid.

  Returns:
    The transformed grid.
  """
  J = [list(row) for row in I]
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row[:-1]):
      if val == 8 and row[j + 1] == 8:
        J[i][j + 1] = 1
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in J)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`J = [list(row) for row in I]`**: This creates a mutable copy of the input grid.
2. **Nested loops**: This iterates through each cell in the grid except the last column.
3. **`if val == 8 and row[j + 1] == 8`**: This checks if the current cell and the cell to its right are both '8', indicating a horizontal segment.
4. **`J[i][j + 1] = 1`**: If a horizontal segment is found, this marks the cell to its right with '1' in the mutable copy of the grid.
5. **`return tuple(tuple(row) for row in J)`**: This converts the transformed mutable grid back to an immutable tuple and returns it.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  """
  Uses hconcat to reconstruct the grid after placing 1s.

  Args:
    I: The input grid.

  Returns:
    The transformed grid.
  """
  transformed_rows = []
  for row in I:
    new_row = list(row)
    for j in range(len(row)-1):
      if row[j] == 8 and row[j + 1] == 8:
        new_row[j + 1] = 1
    transformed_rows.append(tuple(new_row))
  return tuple(transformed_rows)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`transformed_rows = []`**: Initializes an empty list to store transformed rows.
2. **Outer loop**: Iterates through each row of the input grid.
3. **`new_row = list(row)`**: Creates a mutable copy of the current row.
4. **Inner loop**: Iterates through each cell in the row except the last one.
5. **`if row[j] == 8 and row[j + 1] == 8`**: Similar to Version 4, this identifies horizontal '8' segments.
6. **`new_row[j + 1] = 1`**: If a segment is found, this marks the cell to its right with '1' in the mutable copy of the row.
7. **`transformed_rows.append(tuple(new_row))`**: Appends the transformed row (converted back to an immutable tuple) to the `transformed_rows` list.
8. **`return tuple(transformed_rows)`**: Returns the transformed grid after converting the list of transformed rows to an immutable tuple.

These five versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation, utilizing various functions and logic from the provided DSL. Each version demonstrates the flexibility and power of the DSL in solving spatial reasoning tasks.
