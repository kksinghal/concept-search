## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by adjacent '8's in the input grid and placing a '1' to the right of the top-most '8' in each object. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The object formed by '8's in the top-center of the grid has a '1' placed to the right of the top-most '8'.
* The object formed by '8's at the bottom-center of the grid has a '1' placed to the right of the top-most '8'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* Three objects formed by '8's have a '1' placed to the right of their respective top-most '8's.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" using the DSL provided in `dsl.py`. Each version utilizes different logic or function combinations to achieve the desired transformation.

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve_6cf79266(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, False)  # Find connected objects of '8's
    indices = set()
    for obj in objs:
        uppermost_i = uppermost(obj)  # Get the row index of the top-most '8'
        for v, (i, j) in obj:
            if i == uppermost_i:
                indices.add((i, j + 1))  # Add index to the right of the top-most '8'
                break
    O = fill(I, ONE, frozenset(indices))  # Fill those indices with '1'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `objects(I, True, False, False)`: Identifies connected components of '8's in the grid.
2. The code iterates through each object and finds the row index of the top-most '8'.
3. It then iterates through the object again and marks the index to the right of the first encountered '8' in the top-most row.
4. Finally, it fills all marked indices in the grid with '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve_6cf79266(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))  # Create an empty canvas
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val == EIGHT and (i == 0 or I[i - 1][j] != EIGHT):  # Check for top-most '8'
                if j + 1 < len(row):
                    O[i][j + 1] = ONE  # Fill the cell to the right with '1'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1.  `canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`: Creates a new grid filled with '0's, having the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  The code iterates through each cell in the input grid.
3.  If a cell contains '8' and either it's in the first row or the cell above doesn't contain '8', it's considered a top-most '8'.
4.  The cell to the right of this top-most '8' is filled with '1' in the output grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve_6cf79266(I):
  objs = fgpartition(I)  # Partition the grid based on '8's excluding background
  indices = set()
  for obj in objs:
      if color(obj) == EIGHT:  # Only process objects made of '8's
          uppermost_row = min(i for i, j in toindices(obj))  # Find the top-most row
          indices.update({(uppermost_row, j + 1) for i, j in toindices(obj) if i == uppermost_row})  # Mark cells to the right in the top-most row
  O = fill(I, ONE, frozenset(indices))  # Fill marked cells with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `fgpartition(I)`: Partitions the input grid into objects based on connected '8's, excluding the background color.
2. It iterates through each object and checks if the object is composed of '8's.
3. For each object made of '8's, it determines the top-most row index.
4. It then identifies all cells within the object belonging to the top-most row and marks their right neighbors.
5. Finally, it fills all marked cells in the grid with '1'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve_6cf79266(I):
    O = I  # Initialize output as input
    for i in range(len(I)):
        for j in range(len(I[0]) - 1):
            if I[i][j] == EIGHT and (i == 0 or I[i-1][j] != EIGHT):  # Identify top-most '8'
                O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j+1)})  # Fill right cell with '1'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. The output grid is initialized as a copy of the input grid.
2. The code iterates through each cell of the input grid (except the last column).
3. It identifies the top-most '8' in each object by checking if the current cell contains '8' and either it's in the first row or the cell above it does not contain '8'.
4. If a top-most '8' is found, the cell to its right in the output grid is filled with '1'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve_6cf79266(I):
    eights = ofcolor(I, EIGHT)  # Get indices of all '8's
    shifted_right = shift(eights, RIGHT)  # Shift indices one position to the right
    to_fill = intersection(shifted_right, asindices(I))  # Find valid shifted indices within grid bounds
    O = fill(I, ONE, to_fill)  # Fill those indices with '1'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. `ofcolor(I, EIGHT)`: Identifies the indices of all cells containing '8' in the input grid.
2. `shift(eights, RIGHT)`: Shifts all identified indices one position to the right.
3. `intersection(shifted_right, asindices(I))`: Calculates the intersection between the shifted indices and the valid indices within the grid's boundaries. This ensures that '1' is only placed within the grid.
4. `fill(I, ONE, to_fill)`: Fills the cells at the valid, shifted indices with '1' in the input grid, effectively marking the cells to the right of all '8's. 

These five programs demonstrate diverse approaches to solve the given transformation task. Each leverages different DSL functions and logic, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL for spatial reasoning tasks.
