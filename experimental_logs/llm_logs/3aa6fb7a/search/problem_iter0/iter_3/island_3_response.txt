## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on objects made of the digit '8' and aims to change the color of specific cells within these objects to '1'. 

* **Target Cells:** The target cells for color change are the cells directly to the right of the leftmost '8' in each '8'-object. 

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* There are two '8'-objects in Input_0.
* In the top object, the leftmost '8' is at (2,1), so the target cell is (2,2).
* In the bottom object, the leftmost '8' is at (4,4), so the target cell is (4,5).
* The program successfully identifies these target cells and changes their values to '1' in Output_0.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* Input_1 also contains two '8'-objects.
* For the top object, the target cells are (1,4), (3,2) and (6,3).
* For the bottom object, the target cell is (5,3).
* Again, the program correctly identifies and modifies these target cells in Output_1.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program ("Program_to_be_generated") to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_leftmost_eight(loc):
    i, j = loc
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    return 0 <= i < h and 0 <= j < w and I[i][j] == 8 and (j == 0 or I[i][j-1] != 8)
  
  target_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), is_leftmost_eight)
  target_indices = frozenset((i, j+1) for i, j in target_indices) 
  O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_leftmost_eight(loc)` Function:** 
   - Takes a location `(i, j)` as input.
   - Checks if the location is within the grid bounds.
   - Checks if the value at the location is '8' and if it's the leftmost '8' in its row (either it's in the first column or the cell to its left is not '8').
   - Returns `True` if all conditions are met, otherwise `False`.

2. **`mfilter` and `asindices`:**
   - `asindices(I)` generates all indices of the input grid `I`.
   - `mfilter` applies the `is_leftmost_eight` function to each index and merges the results into a set, effectively collecting all locations of leftmost '8's.

3. **Shifting Indices:**
   - The code then shifts each collected index one position to the right: `(i, j+1)`, targeting the cell to the right of each leftmost '8'.

4. **`fill` Function:**
   - The `fill` function takes the input grid `I`, the value '1', and the set of shifted target indices. 
   - It creates a new grid `O` where the target indices are filled with '1', achieving the desired transformation.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def get_right_neighbor(obj):
    indices = toindices(obj)
    leftmost_j = leftmost(indices)
    return frozenset((i, j) for i, j in indices if j == leftmost_j + 1)

  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  target_cells = mfilter(objs, get_right_neighbor)
  O = fill(I, 1, target_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`get_right_neighbor(obj)` Function:**
   - This function identifies the cells immediately to the right of the leftmost cell in a given object.
   - It first finds the column index of the leftmost cell (`leftmost_j`) within the object's indices.
   - Then, it filters the object's indices, selecting only those cells whose column index is one greater than `leftmost_j`.

2. **`objects`, `mfilter`, and `fill`:**
   - Similar to Version 1, this version uses `objects` to get connected objects in the grid.
   - It then applies `mfilter` with the `get_right_neighbor` function to identify the target cells (right neighbors of leftmost cells) in each object.
   - Finally, it uses `fill` to change the value of those target cells to '1' in the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))  
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 8 and (j == 0 or I[i][j-1] != 8):
        if j+1 < len(row):
          O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j+1)}) 
      else:
        if 0 <= i < len(O) and 0 <= j < len(O[0]):
          O = fill(O, val, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Creates an empty canvas `O` of the same size as the input grid `I`, filled with '0's.
2. **Iteration:** Iterates through each cell (i, j) of the input grid `I`.
3. **Leftmost '8' Check:** If the current cell contains '8' and is the leftmost '8' in its row, it proceeds to mark its right neighbor.
4. **Marking Right Neighbor:** If the right neighbor is within grid bounds, it fills the corresponding cell in `O` with '1'.
5. **Handling Other Cells:** If the current cell is not the leftmost '8', it simply copies the value from `I` to `O`.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def shift_right_if_leftmost_eight(loc):
      i, j = loc
      h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
      if 0 <= i < h and 0 <= j < w and I[i][j] == 8 and (j == 0 or I[i][j - 1] != 8):
          return (i, j + 1) if j + 1 < w else (i, j)
      else:
          return (i, j)

  shifted_indices = apply(shift_right_if_leftmost_eight, asindices(I))
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, j in shifted_indices:
    if 0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0]) and I[i][j] == 8 and (j == 0 or I[i][j - 1] != 8):
      O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j)})
    else:
      O = fill(O, I[i][j], {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shift_right_if_leftmost_eight(loc)`:** Similar to previous versions, this function identifies leftmost '8's. If a cell is a leftmost '8', it returns the indices of its right neighbor (if it exists within the grid). Otherwise, it returns the original indices.
2. **Applying the Shift:** It uses `apply` to apply `shift_right_if_leftmost_eight` to all indices of the grid `I`, resulting in `shifted_indices`.
3. **Iterating and Filling:** It iterates through `shifted_indices`. For each index, if it originally pointed to a leftmost '8', the code fills the corresponding cell in the output grid `O` with '1'. Otherwise, it copies the value from the input grid.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
  O = [[0 for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(h)]

  for i in range(h):
    for j in range(w):
      if I[i][j] == 8:
        if j == 0 or I[i][j - 1] != 8:  # Leftmost '8'
          if j + 1 < w:
            O[i][j + 1] = 1
        O[i][j] = I[i][j]  # Copy '8' regardless
      else:
        O[i][j] = I[i][j]  # Copy other values
  return tuple(tuple(row) for row in O)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** Initializes an empty grid `O` of the same dimensions as the input grid `I`.
2. **Nested Loop Iteration:** Iterates through each cell `(i, j)` of the input grid `I`.
3. **Leftmost '8' Check:** For cells containing '8', it checks if it's the leftmost '8' in its row. If it is, and the right neighbor exists, it sets the right neighbor's value in `O` to '1'.
4. **Copying Values:** Regardless of whether the '8' is leftmost or not, it copies its value to the output grid `O`. Other values are directly copied from `I` to `O`.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, leveraging various DSL functions and logic constructs. Each version offers a unique perspective on how to solve the problem within the constraints of the DSL.
