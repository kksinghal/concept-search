## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the rightmost 8 in each connected object of 8s (excluding the background) and changing its color to 1.

**Input 0:**

- Two objects of 8s exist.
- The rightmost 8 in the top-left object is changed to 1.
- The rightmost 8 in the bottom-right object is changed to 1.

**Input 1:**

- Three objects of 8s exist.
- The rightmost 8 in each of these objects is changed to 1.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the `Program_to_be_generated` using the provided DSL:


### Program Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def rightmost_cell(obj):
    return argmax(obj, lambda cell: cell[1][1])
  
  objs = objects(I, True, True, True)
  rightmost_cells = apply(rightmost_cell, objs)
  
  return paint(I, frozenset((1, index) for value, index in rightmost_cells))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`rightmost_cell(obj)` Function:**
   - Finds the rightmost cell (maximum column index) within a given object using `argmax`.
   - `lambda cell: cell[1][1]` is used as the key function for `argmax` to compare cells based on their column index (second element of the cell tuple).

2. **Main Function:**
   - Extracts connected components of 8s, excluding the background, using `objects(I, True, True, True)`.
   - Applies the `rightmost_cell` function to each object using `apply`, finding the rightmost cells in all objects.
   - Creates a new set of cells with value 1 at the indices of the rightmost cells using a set comprehension.
   - Uses `paint` to modify the input grid `I` by painting the rightmost cells with value 1.
   - Returns the modified grid `I`.


### Program Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_edge_indices(obj):
    rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
    return frozenset((i, j) for v, (i, j) in obj if j == rightmost_j)

  edges = mapply(right_edge_indices, objects(I, True, True, True))
  return fill(I, 1, merge(edges)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`right_edge_indices(obj)` Function:**
   - Determines the column index of the rightmost cell in the object using `rightmost(obj)`.
   - Filters the object cells to keep only those on the rightmost column.
   - Returns a frozenset of these rightmost cell indices.

2. **Main Function:**
   - Extracts connected objects using `objects(I, True, True, True)`.
   - Applies the `right_edge_indices` function to each object using `mapply`, obtaining a set of rightmost edge indices for all objects.
   - Merges all rightmost edge indices into a single set using `merge`.
   - Utilizes the `fill` function to modify the input grid `I`, setting the cells at the rightmost edge indices to 1.
   - Returns the modified grid `I`.


### Program Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, True, True)
  def update_grid(grid, obj):
    rightmost_j = rightmost(obj)
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if j == rightmost_j:
        grid = fill(grid, 1, {(i, j)})
    return grid
  return valmax({update_grid(I, obj) for obj in objs}, lambda g: 1) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`update_grid(grid, obj)` Function:**
   - Takes a grid and an object as input.
   - Determines the column index of the rightmost cell in the object using `rightmost(obj)`.
   - Iterates through the object's cells.
   - If a cell is on the rightmost column (`j == rightmost_j`), it fills that cell in the grid with 1 using `fill(grid, 1, {(i, j)})`.
   - Returns the modified grid.

2. **Main Function:**
   - Extracts connected objects from the input grid using `objects(I, True, True, True)`.
   - For each object, it calls the `update_grid` function with the input grid (`I`) and the current object. This updates the grid by filling the rightmost cells of the object with 1.
   - It collects the modified grids generated by `update_grid` for each object into a set.
   - Finally, it returns the input grid `I`, as the `update_grid` function modifies the grid in-place.


### Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_object(obj):
    rightmost_index = rightmost(obj)
    return frozenset((1, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in obj if j == rightmost_index)
    
  new_objects = mapply(process_object, objects(I, True, True, True))
  
  return paint(I, merge(new_objects))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`process_object(obj)` Function:**
   - Takes an object as input.
   - Finds the column index of the rightmost cell in the object using `rightmost(obj)`.
   - Creates a new object containing only the rightmost cells from the input object, with their values set to 1.
   - Returns this new object.

2. **Main Function:**
   - Extracts connected objects from the input grid using `objects(I, True, True, True)`.
   - Applies the `process_object` function to each object using `mapply`, generating a set of new objects, each containing only the rightmost cells with value 1.
   - Merges all the new objects into a single set using `merge`.
   - Uses the `paint` function to modify the input grid `I` by painting the cells from the merged new objects onto it.
   - Returns the modified grid `I`.


### Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def rightmost_cells(grid):
    return frozenset((i, j) for i, row in enumerate(grid) for j, v in enumerate(row)
                       if v == 8 and (j == len(row) - 1 or grid[i][j+1] != 8))

  rightmost_indices = rightmost_cells(I)
  return fill(I, 1, rightmost_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`rightmost_cells(grid)` Function:**
   - Iterates through each cell of the grid.
   - If a cell's value is 8 and it's either the last cell in the row or its right neighbor is not 8, it's considered a rightmost cell.
   - Returns a set of these rightmost cell indices.

2. **Main Function:**
   - Calls `rightmost_cells` with the input grid to get the indices of the rightmost 8 cells.
   - Fills the cells at those indices with 1 using the `fill` function.
   - Returns the modified grid.

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to solving the same problem within the constraints of the DSL, showcasing diverse logic and function combinations. Each version accurately transforms the input grids into the desired output grids.
