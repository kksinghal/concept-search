## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '8' and placing a '1' diagonally adjacent to the top-right corner of each object. 

**Input 0:**

* The '8's form two objects.
* For the top object, a '1' is placed diagonally down and to the left of its top-right '8'.
* For the bottom object, a '1' is placed diagonally down and to the left of its top-right '8'.

**Input 1:**

* The '8's form three objects.
* For each object, a '1' is placed diagonally down and to the left of its top-right '8'.

## Program to be Generated:

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  def place_one(obj):
    tr = urcorner(toindices(obj))
    new_loc = add(tr, DOWN_LEFT)
    return fill(I, ONE, {new_loc}) if contained(new_loc, asindices(I)) else I
  return chain(lambda x: paint(x, obj), place_one, lambda x: colorfilter(objects(x, T, F, F), EIGHT))(I) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(x, T, F, F)`:** Identifies all objects in the grid formed by connected cells of the same value (including diagonals, excluding background).
2. **`colorfilter(..., EIGHT)`:** Filters the objects to keep only those with the color '8'.
3. **`chain(...)`:** Chains three functions together:
    - **`lambda x: colorfilter(objects(x, T, F, F), EIGHT)`:**  The first function in the chain, filters the objects based on color.
    - **`place_one`:** This function takes an object as input and places a '1' diagonally adjacent to its top-right corner.
    - **`lambda x: paint(x, obj)`:** The last function in the chain paints the modified object back onto the grid.
4. **`place_one(obj)`:** 
    - **`urcorner(toindices(obj))`:** Gets the indices of the top-right corner of the object.
    - **`add(tr, DOWN_LEFT)`:** Calculates the location to place the '1' (down and left of the top-right corner).
    - **`fill(I, ONE, {new_loc})`:** Fills the calculated location with a '1'.
    - **`contained(new_loc, asindices(I))`:**  Ensures the new location is within the grid bounds before filling.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  def mark_corner(grid, obj):
    corner = add(urcorner(toindices(obj)), DOWN_LEFT)
    return fill(grid, ONE, {corner}) if contained(corner, asindices(grid)) else grid
  return mapply(lambda obj: mark_corner(I, obj) if color(obj) == EIGHT else I, objects(I, T, F, F))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **`mapply(...)`:** Applies the `lambda` function to each object and merges the results.
3. **`lambda obj: mark_corner(I, obj) if color(obj) == EIGHT else I`:**  For each object:
    - If the object's color is '8', call the `mark_corner` function.
    - Otherwise, return the grid unchanged.
4. **`mark_corner(grid, obj)`:** 
    - **`add(urcorner(toindices(obj)), DOWN_LEFT)`:** Calculates the location of the cell diagonally down and left to the object's top-right corner.
    - **`fill(grid, ONE, {corner})`:**  Fills the calculated location with '1' if it's within the grid bounds.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  return apply(
      lambda obj: fill(
          I, 
          ONE, 
          {add(urcorner(toindices(obj)), DOWN_LEFT)}
      ) if contained(add(urcorner(toindices(obj)), DOWN_LEFT), asindices(I)) and color(obj) == EIGHT
      else I,
      objects(I, T, F, F)
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:**  Identifies all objects within the input grid.
2. **`apply(...)`:** Applies the `lambda` function to every identified object.
3. **`lambda obj: ...`:** This function processes each object:
    -  **`color(obj) == EIGHT`:** Checks if the object's color is '8'.
    -  **`add(urcorner(toindices(obj)), DOWN_LEFT)`:**  Calculates the target location for the '1' placement.
    -  **`contained(...)`:**  Verifies if the calculated target location is within the grid's boundaries.
    -  **`fill(I, ONE, {...})`:** If both conditions hold, fills the target location on the grid with a '1'.
    -  **`else I`:** Otherwise, the grid is returned unchanged.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_object(obj):
    tr = urcorner(toindices(obj)) 
    new_loc = add(tr, DOWN_LEFT) 
    return fill(I, ONE, {new_loc}) if contained(new_loc, asindices(I)) else I 
  filtered_objects = colorfilter(objects(I, T, F, F), EIGHT)
  output_grid = I 
  for obj in filtered_objects:
    output_grid = process_object(obj)
  return output_grid
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(I, T, F, F)`:** Identifies all objects in the grid.
2. **`colorfilter(..., EIGHT)`:** Filters the objects to keep only those with the color '8'.
3. **`process_object(obj)`:**
    -  **`urcorner(toindices(obj))`:**  Gets the indices of the top-right corner of the object.
    -  **`add(tr, DOWN_LEFT)`:**  Calculates the location to place the '1'.
    -  **`fill(I, ONE, {new_loc})`:** Fills the calculated location with a '1' if it is within the grid bounds.
4. **Loop:** Iterates through each filtered object and applies the `process_object` function.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def program_to_be_generated(I):
  def place_one(obj, grid):
    corner = add(urcorner(toindices(obj)), DOWN_LEFT)
    h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    if 0 <= corner[0] < h and 0 <= corner[1] < w:
      return fill(grid, ONE, {corner})
    return grid
  
  return chain(
      lambda grid: paint(grid, obj),
      lambda grid: place_one(obj, grid),
      lambda grid: colorfilter(objects(grid, T, F, F), EIGHT)
  )(I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects(grid, T, F, F)`:** Extracts all connected objects from the grid, considering diagonals and ignoring the background.
2. **`colorfilter(..., EIGHT)`:**  Filters the objects, keeping only those where the color is '8'.
3. **`chain(...)`:**  Chains three functions, passing the grid through each:
    -  **`lambda grid: colorfilter(...)`:** Applies the color filter to the grid.
    -  **`lambda grid: place_one(obj, grid)`:**  Calls the `place_one` function with the object and grid.
    -  **`lambda grid: paint(grid, obj)`:**  Paints the object onto the grid.
4. **`place_one(obj, grid)`:**
    -  **`add(urcorner(toindices(obj)), DOWN_LEFT)`:** Computes the target location for placing the '1'.
    -  **`0 <= corner[0] < h and 0 <= corner[1] < w`:**  Checks if the calculated location is within the grid boundaries.
    -  **`fill(grid, ONE, {corner})`:** If within bounds, fills the target location with '1'.
    -  **`return grid`:** Otherwise, returns the grid unmodified.


These five versions showcase different ways to achieve the same transformation, using various DSL functions and logic. Each version demonstrates a unique approach to identifying the target locations and modifying the grid accordingly.
