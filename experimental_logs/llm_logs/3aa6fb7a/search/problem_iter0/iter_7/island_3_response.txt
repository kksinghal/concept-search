## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify consecutive horizontal occurrences of the digit '8' and change the second '8' in each sequence to a '1'. 

**Input_0 Example:**

- In the second row, there is a sequence '8 8', and the second '8' is replaced by '1'.
- Similarly, in the fourth and fifth rows, the second '8' in the '8 8' sequences is changed to '1'.

**Input_1 Example:**

-  The same logic applies to Input_1; the second '8' in each horizontal '8 8' sequence is replaced with a '1'.


## Code Improvement (x5):

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

### **Program Version 1:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 8 and (j == 0 or I[i][j - 1] != 8):
        if j + 1 < len(row) and I[i][j+1] == 8:
          O = paint(O, {(1, (i, j + 1))})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:** A canvas `O` is created with the same shape as the input grid `I` and filled with '0'.
2. **Iteration:** The code iterates through each cell of the input grid `I`.
3. **Condition Check:** It checks if the current cell value is '8' and if it's the start of a consecutive sequence of '8's (either the first cell in the row or the previous cell is not '8').
4. **Target Identification:** If the condition holds and the next cell is also '8', it identifies the next cell as the target for replacement.
5. **Painting:** The target cell's value in the output grid `O` is set to '1' using the `paint` function.
6. **Output:** Finally, the modified grid `O` is returned.

### **Program Version 2:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    target_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 8 and loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[loc[0]][loc[1] + 1] == 8)
    shifted_indices = apply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), target_indices)
    return fill(I, 1, shifted_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Target Identification:** The code identifies all indices in `I` where the value is '8' and the next cell in the row is also '8' using `mfilter`.
2. **Index Shifting:** The identified indices are then shifted one position to the right using `apply`.
3. **Filling:** Finally, the grid `I` is modified by filling the shifted indices with '1' using `fill`.

### **Program Version 3:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_left_eight(loc):
    i, j = loc
    return I[i][j] == 8 and (j == 0 or I[i][j - 1] != 8)
  def mark_right(loc):
    i, j = loc
    if j + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j + 1] == 8:
      return (1, (i, j + 1))
    return (0, (0, 0))

  left_eights = mfilter(asindices(I), is_left_eight)
  target_cells = mapply(mark_right, left_eights)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), target_cells)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Helper Functions:** Two helper functions are defined:
    - `is_left_eight`: checks if a cell contains '8' and is at the beginning of a horizontal '8 8' sequence.
    - `mark_right`: if the next cell to the right also contains '8', it returns a tuple indicating a '1' should be painted at the next cell's location. 
2. **Finding Left Eights:** `mfilter` identifies all cells that satisfy `is_left_eight`.
3. **Marking Right Cells:** `mapply` applies `mark_right` to each identified left '8', generating a set of cells to be painted with '1'.
4. **Painting:**  A blank canvas is created, and the identified cells are painted with '1' using the `paint` function.

### **Program Version 4:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(tuple(1 if j > 0 and v == 8 and r[j-1] == 8 else v for j, v in enumerate(r)) for r in I)
```

**Explanation:**

This version utilizes nested list comprehensions for a concise solution:

1. **Outer Comprehension:** Iterates through each row `r` in the input grid `I`.
2. **Inner Comprehension:** For each cell `v` at index `j` in row `r`, it checks if the cell is '8' and the preceding cell is also '8'. If true, it replaces the cell with '1'; otherwise, it retains the original value.

### **Program Version 5:**

**Code:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    eights = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
    targets =  mfilter(eights, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1 and hline(obj), eights)
    shifted_targets = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, 1)), targets)
    return paint(I, merge(prapply(lambda v, loc: (1, loc), {1}, toindices(obj)) for obj in shifted_targets))
```

**Explanation:**

This version identifies '8' sequences as objects and then manipulates them:

1. **Object Identification:**  Identifies all objects (connected components) in the grid using `objects`.
2. **Target Filtering:** Filters the objects to keep only horizontal lines (`hline`) of '8's with size greater than 1.
3. **Target Shifting:** Shifts each target object one cell to the right using `shift`.
4. **Painting:**  Paints '1' at the indices of all shifted target objects on the input grid `I` using `paint`. 

These five program versions demonstrate diverse approaches to solve the given transformation task using the provided DSL. They utilize different function combinations, showcasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL for spatial reasoning tasks.
