## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify specific "corner" cells within objects formed by the digit '8' on the grid and fill their adjacent right and bottom neighbors with the digit '1'. 

**Details:**

* **Corner Identification:** A corner cell is an '8' which doesn't have another '8' directly above it or to its left. 
* **Neighbor Filling:** For each identified corner, both the cell to its right and the cell below it are filled with '1'.
* **Other Cells:** All other cells in the grid remain unchanged.

## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v1(I):
  def is_corner(loc):
    return index(I, loc) == 8 and index(I, add(loc, UP)) != 8 and index(I, add(loc, LEFT)) != 8
  
  def fill_neighbors(loc):
    return frozenset({add(loc, RIGHT), add(loc, DOWN)})
  
  corners = frozenset(loc for loc in asindices(I) if is_corner(loc))
  to_fill = merge(apply(fill_neighbors, corners))
  return fill(I, 1, to_fill)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_corner(loc)`:** This function checks if a given location `loc` is a corner cell as defined in the transformation analysis.
2. **`fill_neighbors(loc)`:**  This function takes a location `loc` and returns a frozenset containing the indices of its right and bottom neighbors.
3. **`corners`:**  This line finds all corner cells in the input grid `I` by iterating through all indices and using `is_corner` function.
4. **`to_fill`:** This line applies `fill_neighbors` to each corner cell to get a set of neighbors to be filled and then merges these sets into one.
5. **`fill(I, 1, to_fill)`:** Finally, the `fill` function is used to fill all the indices in `to_fill` with '1' on the input grid `I`.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v2(I):
  def change(loc):
    return frozenset({add(loc, RIGHT), add(loc, DOWN)}) if index(I, loc) == 8 and index(I, add(loc, UP)) != 8 and index(I, add(loc, LEFT)) != 8 else frozenset()
  
  return fill(I, 1, merge(apply(change, asindices(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`change(loc)`:** This function combines the corner check and neighbor finding logic into one. For each location, it checks if it's a corner. If it is, it returns a frozenset of its right and bottom neighbors, otherwise an empty frozenset.
2. **`merge(apply(change, asindices(I)))`:** This applies the `change` function to all indices of the input grid `I`. The results, which are frozensets of indices to be filled, are then merged into a single frozenset.
3. **`fill(I, 1, ...)`:** The final step remains the same as in version 1 â€“ filling the identified indices with '1'.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v3(I):
  def get_neighbors(loc):
    return frozenset({add(loc, RIGHT), add(loc, DOWN)})
  
  corner_indices = frozenset(loc for loc in asindices(I) if index(I, loc) == 8 and index(I, add(loc, UP)) != 8 and index(I, add(loc, LEFT)) != 8)
  return fill(I, 1, merge(apply(get_neighbors, corner_indices))) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`get_neighbors(loc)`:**  Similar to `fill_neighbors` in version 1, this function returns a frozenset of the right and bottom neighbors of a given location.
2. **`corner_indices`:** This line directly filters all indices of the input grid `I` to obtain a frozenset of corner indices using the corner check logic.
3. **`merge(apply(get_neighbors, corner_indices))`:** This applies `get_neighbors` to each corner index and merges the resulting frozensets into a single frozenset containing all indices to be filled. 
4. **`fill(I, 1, ...)`:** This step remains identical to previous versions.

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v4(I):
  return fill(I, 1, merge(apply(lambda loc: frozenset({add(loc, RIGHT), add(loc, DOWN)}) if index(I, loc) == 8 and index(I, add(loc, UP)) != 8 and index(I, add(loc, LEFT)) != 8 else frozenset(), asindices(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

This version compresses the entire logic into a single line by using a lambda function:

1. **`lambda loc: ...`**: This lambda function embodies the same corner checking and neighbor-finding logic as previous versions but within a single expression.
2. **`apply(lambda loc: ..., asindices(I))`**: The lambda function is applied to every index of the input grid.
3. **`merge(...)`**: The resulting frozensets of indices are merged.
4. **`fill(I, 1, ...)`**: The identified indices are filled with '1'. 

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def program_v5(I):
  def is_corner(loc):
    neighbors = {(add(loc, UP)), (add(loc, LEFT))} 
    return index(I, loc) == 8 and not any(index(I, n) == 8 for n in neighbors)
  
  corners = frozenset(loc for loc in asindices(I) if is_corner(loc))
  shifted_corners = merge(apply(lambda loc: frozenset({add(loc, RIGHT), add(loc, DOWN)}), corners))
  return fill(I, 1, shifted_corners)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_corner(loc)`:** This function checks for corner cells by first defining a set of neighbors (up and left) and then ensuring none of these neighbors have the value '8' while the current location does.
2. **`corners`:** Similar to previous versions, this identifies all corner cell indices.
3. **`shifted_corners`**:  This applies a lambda function to each corner to directly get a frozenset of its right and bottom neighbors. These sets are then merged.
4. **`fill(I, 1, shifted_corners)`**:  Finally, the identified neighbor indices are filled with '1'.

Each of these program versions implements the same core logic using different function combinations and structuring, showcasing the flexibility of the DSL.
