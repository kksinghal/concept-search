## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying horizontally connected pairs of '8's within the input grid. For each such pair, the digit to the right of the rightmost '8' is replaced with a '1'. 

**Example:**

In Input_0: 

- There is a horizontal pair of '8's at coordinates (2,1) and (2,2). The digit to the right of this pair is at (2,3), which is a '0'. This '0' is replaced by a '1' in the output.
- Similarly, the '8' at (4,5) is changed to '1' because of the '8' pair at (3,5) and (3,6).

**Code Generation:**

Here are five distinct program versions achieving the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 8 and loc[1] + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[loc[0]][loc[1] + 1] == 8)
  shifted_indices = apply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), target_indices)
  return fill(I, 1, shifted_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Target Indices:** `mfilter` finds all indices `(i, j)` where the cell contains an '8' and the cell to its right also contains an '8'.
2. **Shift Indices Right:** `apply` shifts each target index one position to the right.
3. **Fill with '1':** `fill` replaces the values at the shifted indices with '1' in the input grid.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_left_eight(loc):
    i, j = loc
    return I[i][j] == 8 and (j == 0 or I[i][j - 1] != 8)
  def mark_right(loc):
    i, j = loc
    if j + 1 < len(I[0]) and I[i][j + 1] == 8:
      return (1, (i, j + 1))
    return (0, (0, 0))

  left_eights = mfilter(asindices(I), is_left_eight)
  target_cells = mapply(mark_right, left_eights)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), target_cells)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Leftmost '8's:** `is_left_eight` checks if a cell contains an '8' and is either at the left edge or doesn't have an '8' to its left. `mfilter` uses this to find all leftmost '8's of horizontal pairs.
2. **Mark Cells to the Right:** `mark_right` takes a leftmost '8' index and returns a tuple `(1, (i, j+1))` if there's an '8' to its right, marking the cell to be changed to '1'. Otherwise, it returns `(0, (0, 0))`.
3. **Apply Changes:**  `mapply` applies `mark_right` to each leftmost '8' index. Finally, `paint` draws the identified '1' cells onto a blank canvas of the input's shape.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    eights = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
    targets = mfilter(eights, lambda obj: size(obj) > 1 and hline(obj))
    shifted_targets = mapply(lambda obj: shift(obj, (0, 1)), targets)
    return paint(I, merge(prapply(lambda v, loc: (1, loc), {1}, toindices(obj)) for obj in shifted_targets))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify '8' Objects:** `objects` extracts connected components of '8's from the grid.
2. **Filter Horizontal Pairs:** `mfilter` keeps only objects that are horizontal lines (`hline`) and have a size greater than 1 (meaning they are pairs).
3. **Shift and Mark:** `mapply` shifts each target object one position to the right. `prapply` is then used to mark the corresponding cells in the shifted objects with value '1'.
4. **Paint on Grid:** `merge` combines the marked cells, and `paint` draws them onto the original grid.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    new_grid = [[0 for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(h)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w - 1):
            if I[i][j] == 8 and I[i][j + 1] == 8:
                if j + 2 < w:
                  new_grid[i][j + 2] = 1
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create New Grid:** A new grid of the same size as the input is initialized with '0's.
2. **Iterate and Mark:** The program iterates through the grid, checking for horizontal pairs of '8's. If a pair is found, and the position two cells to the right is within the grid boundaries, it marks the corresponding cell in the new grid with '1'.
3. **Return Modified Grid:** The modified grid is returned as the output.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grid = shift(asobject(I), (0, -1))
  return tuple(
    tuple(
      1 if (i, j + 1) in toindices(shifted_grid) and I[i][j] == 8 and I[i][j + 1] == 8 else I[i][j]
      for j in range(len(I[0]))
    )
    for i in range(len(I))
  )
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Grid:** The input grid is converted to an object and shifted one position to the left.
2. **Iterate and Compare:** The program iterates through the original grid. For each cell, it checks if the corresponding cell in the shifted grid contains an '8' and if the current and next cell in the original grid both contain '8's. If true, it sets the current cell to '1'.
3. **Return Modified Grid:** The modified grid is returned as the output.

Each of these programs provides a distinct approach to achieving the desired transformation, utilizing different combinations of DSL functions and logic.
