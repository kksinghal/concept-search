## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects formed by the digit '8' in the input grid. For each such object, a '1' is placed to the right of the leftmost '8' in that object. 

**Example:**

In `Input_0`, the '8's form two objects:

- One in the top-left corner:
```
0 8 0
0 8 8 
0 0 0 
```
- Another on the right side:
```
0 8 8 0
0 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 
```

The output correctly places a '1' to the right of the leftmost '8' in each object.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_leftmost_eight(loc):
    i, j = loc
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    return 0 <= i < h and 0 <= j < w and I[i][j] == 8 and (j == 0 or I[i][j-1] != 8)
  
  target_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), is_leftmost_eight)
  target_indices = frozenset((i, j + 1) for i, j in target_indices if j + 1 < len(I[0]))
  O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_leftmost_eight(loc)` Function:** This function checks if a given location in the grid contains the leftmost '8' of an object. It does this by:
   - Checking if the location contains '8'.
   - Checking if it's the first column (`j == 0`) or if the cell to its left is not '8'.

2. **`mfilter` and `asindices`:**  These functions are used to get all indices in the grid where `is_leftmost_eight` returns True.

3. **Shifting Right:** The `target_indices` are then shifted one position to the right (`j + 1`).

4. **`fill`:** Finally, the grid is filled with '1' at the calculated `target_indices`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  new_objs = set()
  for obj in objs:
    if color(obj) == 8:
      leftmost_j = min(j for _, (i, j) in obj)
      new_obj = set()
      for v, (i, j) in obj:
        if j == leftmost_j + 1:
          new_obj.add((1, (i, j)))
        else:
          new_obj.add((v, (i, j)))
      new_objs.add(frozenset(new_obj))
    else:
      new_objs.add(obj)
  O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), frozenset(new_objs))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objects`:** Identifies all objects in the input grid.
2. **Iterate Objects:**  Iterates through each object. 
   - If the object's color is '8':
     - Find the column index (`leftmost_j`) of the leftmost '8'.
     - Create a new object where cells with `j == leftmost_j + 1` have their value changed to '1'.
     - Add this modified object to `new_objs`.
   - If the object's color is not '8', add it to `new_objs` directly.
3. **`paint`:** Create a blank canvas and paint the modified objects onto it.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 8 and (j == 0 or I[i][j - 1] != 8):
        if j + 1 < len(row):
          O[i][j + 1] = 1 
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Output Grid:** Creates an empty output grid (`O`) of the same size as the input.
2. **Iterate and Identify:** Iterates through the input grid, looking for cells containing '8' that are the leftmost '8' in their respective objects (similar logic to Version 1).
3. **Direct Modification:** Directly modifies the output grid (`O`) to place a '1' to the right of the identified '8's.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_object(obj):
    if color(obj) != 8:
      return obj
    leftmost_index = min(toindices(obj), key=lambda x: x[1])
    return insert((1, (leftmost_index[0], leftmost_index[1] + 1)), obj)

  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  modified_objs = frozenset(process_object(obj) for obj in objs)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), modified_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`process_object` Function:** Takes an object as input. If the object's color is not '8', it returns the object unchanged. Otherwise, it finds the index of the leftmost '8' and inserts a '1' to its right in the object. 
2. **Apply to Objects:** Uses `objects` to get all objects and then applies `process_object` to each object.
3. **Paint:** Creates a blank canvas and paints the modified objects onto it.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_eights = mfilter(
      asindices(I),
      lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 8 and (loc[1] == 0 or index(I, (loc[0], loc[1] - 1)) != 8)
  )
  target_indices = frozenset((i, j + 1) for i, j in shifted_eights if j + 1 < len(I[0]))
  return fill(I, 1, target_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_eights`:** Uses `mfilter`, `asindices`, and `index` functions to identify the indices of leftmost '8's in the grid.
2. **`target_indices`:** Shifts the found indices one position to the right.
3. **`fill`:** Fills the input grid with '1' at the calculated `target_indices`.

These five versions demonstrate different ways to achieve the desired transformation using the provided DSL, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the language.
