## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the '8' digits in the grid.  For each '8', it identifies if it's a specific type of corner, and if so, fills the cells to its right and bottom with '1's.

* **Corner Criteria:** The '8' must be a top-left corner of a group of '8's. This means there shouldn't be another '8' directly above or to its left.

Let's break down the transformation for each input-output pair:

**Input_0:**

* The '8' at (1,1) is a corner, so (1,2) and (2,1) are filled with '1's.
* The '8' at (2,2) is not a corner because it has an '8' to its left.
* The '8' at (3,5) is a corner, so (3,6) and (4,5) are filled with '1's. 

**Input_1:**

* The '8' at (0,4) is a corner, so (0,5) and (1,4) are filled with '1's.
* The '8' at (2,2) is a corner, so (2,3) and (3,2) are filled with '1's.
* The '8' at (5,3) is a corner, so (5,4) and (6,3) are filled with '1's.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_corner(loc):
    return index(I, loc) == 8 and index(I, add(loc, UP), 0) != 8 and index(I, add(loc, LEFT), 0) != 8
  
  def fill_neighbors(loc):
    return {add(loc, RIGHT), add(loc, DOWN)}
  
  corners = frozenset(loc for loc in asindices(I) if is_corner(loc))
  to_fill = mapply(fill_neighbors, corners)
  return fill(I, 1, to_fill)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_corner(loc)`:** This function checks if a given location `loc` in the grid `I` satisfies the corner criteria.
2. **`fill_neighbors(loc)`:** This function takes a location `loc` and returns a set containing the indices of its right and bottom neighbors.
3. **`corners`:**  Uses `asindices` to get all indices, then filters them using `is_corner` to get the corner indices.
4. **`to_fill`:**  Applies `fill_neighbors` to each corner in `corners` using `mapply`, resulting in a set of indices to be filled.
5. **Final Output:**  Uses `fill` to change the values at the identified indices (`to_fill`) to '1' in the input grid `I`.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def change(loc):
    return {add(loc, RIGHT), add(loc, DOWN)} if index(I, loc) == 8 and index(I, add(loc, UP), 0) != 8 and index(I, add(loc, LEFT), 0) != 8 else frozenset()
  
  return fill(I, 1, merge(apply(change, asindices(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`change(loc)`:**  For each location, it checks if it's a corner. If it is, it returns a set with the right and bottom neighbor indices; otherwise, an empty set.
2. **`apply(change, asindices(I))`:** Applies `change` to every index in the grid `I`.
3. **`merge(...)`:** Merges all the returned sets from the `apply` function into a single set of indices to be filled.
4. **Final Output:** Uses `fill` to fill the identified indices with '1' in the input grid `I`.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  to_fill = frozenset()
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if index(I, (i, j)) == 8 and index(I, (i - 1, j), 0) != 8 and index(I, (i, j - 1), 0) != 8:
        to_fill = to_fill | {(i, j + 1), (i + 1, j)}
  return fill(I, 1, to_fill)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`to_fill`:**  Initializes an empty set to store the indices to be filled.
2. **Nested Loop:** Iterates through each cell in the grid using nested loops.
3. **Conditional Filling:**  If a cell is a corner (value '8' and no '8' above or to the left), it adds the right and bottom neighbor indices to the `to_fill` set.
4. **Final Output:**  Uses `fill` to fill the identified indices with '1' in the input grid `I`. 


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, 1, merge(filter(None, map(lambda loc: {add(loc, RIGHT), add(loc, DOWN)} if index(I, loc) == 8 and index(I, add(loc, UP), 0) != 8 and index(I, add(loc, LEFT), 0) != 8 else None, asindices(I)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`lambda function`:** A lambda function checks if a location is a corner and returns the neighbors to fill or `None` if not.
2. **`map(...)`:** Applies the lambda function to each index in the grid.
3. **`filter(None, ...)`:** Removes all `None` values from the mapped result, keeping only sets of neighbors to fill.
4. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the remaining sets into a single set of indices.
5. **Final Output:**  Uses `fill` to fill the identified indices with '1' in the input grid `I`.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def get_neighbors(loc):
    return {add(loc, RIGHT), add(loc, DOWN)}

  return fill(I, 1, merge(apply(get_neighbors, sfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: index(I, loc) == 8 and index(I, add(loc, UP), 0) != 8 and index(I, add(loc, LEFT), 0) != 8))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`get_neighbors(loc)`:** Takes a location and returns a set of its right and bottom neighbors.
2. **`lambda function`:** Checks if a location is a corner.
3. **`sfilter(...)`:** Filters all indices, keeping only the corners.
4. **`apply(get_neighbors, ...)`:** Applies `get_neighbors` to each corner, getting sets of neighbors to fill.
5. **`merge(...)`:** Merges the neighbor sets into a single set.
6. **Final Output:** Uses `fill` to fill the identified indices with '1' in the input grid `I`. 


These are five different ways to achieve the desired transformation, each with its own logic and function combination. This showcases the flexibility and expressive power of the provided DSL.
