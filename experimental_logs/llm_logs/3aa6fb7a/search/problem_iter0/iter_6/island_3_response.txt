## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the leftmost '8' in each row of the input grid and changing the digit to its right to a '1'. If a leftmost '8' is on the last column of a row, no transformation occurs on that row. 

**Input_0 Example:**

* The '8' at (1,1) is the leftmost '8' in the second row. The digit to its right (1,2) is changed to '1'.
* The '8' at (4,4) is the leftmost '8' in the fifth row. The digit to its right (4,5) is changed to '1'. 

**Input_1 Example:**

* The logic is applied similarly to Input_1, resulting in '1's appearing to the right of the leftmost '8's in several rows.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct programs to achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I)) 
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 8 and (j == 0 or I[i][j - 1] != 8):
        if j + 1 < len(row):
          O[i][j + 1] = 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(0, shape(I))`**: Creates an output grid `O` filled with '0's, having the same shape as the input grid `I`.
2. **`for i, row in enumerate(I)`**: Iterates through each row `i` and its content `row` in the input grid `I`.
3. **`for j, val in enumerate(row)`**: Iterates through each column `j` and its value `val` within the current row.
4. **`if val == 8 and (j == 0 or I[i][j - 1] != 8)`**: Checks if the current value `val` is '8' and if it's the leftmost '8' in the row (either the first element or the element to its left is not '8').
5. **`if j + 1 < len(row)`**: Checks if there is a digit to the right of the current '8'.
6. **`O[i][j + 1] = 1`**: Sets the digit to the right of the leftmost '8' in the output grid `O` to '1'. 

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_leftmost_eight(loc):
    i, j = loc
    return I[i][j] == 8 and (j == 0 or I[i][j-1] != 8)

  target_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), is_leftmost_eight)
  shifted_indices = apply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), target_indices)
  valid_indices = sfilter(shifted_indices, lambda loc: loc[1] < len(I[0]))
  return fill(I, 1, valid_indices)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def is_leftmost_eight(loc)`**: Defines a helper function to check if a location `loc` in the grid corresponds to the leftmost '8' in a row.
2. **`target_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), is_leftmost_eight)`**: Finds the indices of all leftmost '8's in the grid.
3. **`shifted_indices = apply(lambda loc: (loc[0], loc[1] + 1), target_indices)`**: Shifts the obtained indices one position to the right.
4. **`valid_indices = sfilter(shifted_indices, lambda loc: loc[1] < len(I[0]))`**: Filters out any shifted indices that fall outside the grid boundaries.
5. **`return fill(I, 1, valid_indices)`**: Fills the input grid `I` with '1's at the `valid_indices`, effectively transforming the grid according to the rule.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def shift_right(obj):
    if color(obj) != 8:
      return obj
    leftmost_j = leftmost(obj)
    return frozenset((v, (i, j + 1 if j == leftmost_j else j)) for v, (i, j) in obj)

  objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
  shifted_objs = frozenset(shift_right(obj) for obj in objs if color(obj) == 8)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shifted_objs)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def shift_right(obj)`**: Defines a helper function to shift the indices of an object one position to the right if the object's color is 8.
2. **`objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)`**:  Identifies all objects in the input grid `I`.
3. **`shifted_objs = frozenset(shift_right(obj) for obj in objs if color(obj) == 8)`**: Applies `shift_right` to each object with color 8, creating a new set of shifted objects.
4. **`return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), shifted_objs)`**: Creates a new canvas and paints the shifted objects onto it.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_row(row):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == 8 and (j == 0 or row[j - 1] != 8):
        if j + 1 < len(row):
          row = row[:j+1] + (1,) + row[j+2:]
    return row

  return tuple(process_row(tuple(row)) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:** 

1. **`def process_row(row)`**: Defines a helper function to process each row individually.
2. **`for j, val in enumerate(row)`**: Iterates through each element and its index in the row.
3. **`if val == 8 and (j == 0 or row[j - 1] != 8)`**: Identifies the leftmost '8' in the row.
4. **`if j + 1 < len(row)`**: Checks if a right neighbor exists.
5. **`row = row[:j+1] + (1,) + row[j+2:]`**: Modifies the row by replacing the right neighbor with '1'.
6. **`return tuple(process_row(tuple(row)) for row in I)`**:  Applies the `process_row` function to each row in the input grid `I` and returns the modified grid.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def mark_right(loc):
    i, j = loc
    if j + 1 < len(I[0]):
      return (1, (i, j + 1))
    return (0, (0, 0))

  leftmost_eights = mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: I[loc[0]][loc[1]] == 8 and (loc[1] == 0 or I[loc[0]][loc[1] - 1] != 8))
  target_cells = mapply(mark_right, leftmost_eights)
  return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), target_cells) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`def mark_right(loc)`**: Defines a function that takes a location and returns a tuple representing the target value (1) and its intended position (one step to the right).
2. **`leftmost_eights = mfilter(...)`**:  Identifies the indices of all leftmost '8's in the grid.
3. **`target_cells = mapply(mark_right, leftmost_eights)`**:  Applies the `mark_right` function to each leftmost '8' location, generating a set of target cells.
4. **`return paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), target_cells)`**: Creates a new canvas and paints the target cells with the value '1'.

Each of these programs utilizes different DSL functions and logic flow, offering distinct approaches to solve the provided transformation task.
