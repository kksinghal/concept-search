## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation identifies the "outer corners" of objects formed by the digit '8' and replaces them with the digit '1'. An outer corner is a corner cell of an object that has only one diagonally adjacent cell belonging to the same object. 

**Example:**

In Input_0:
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

The cells marked with 'X' are the outer corners:
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 X 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 X 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 X 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 X 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

These corners are then replaced with '1' in the output:
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 1 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 1 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

## Program Versions:

### **Program Version 1:**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = objects(I, True, True, True)
  corner_indices = mapply(corners, obj)
  is_outer_corner = lambda c: size(intersection(ineighbors(c), corner_indices)) == 1
  outer_corners = sfilter(corner_indices, is_outer_corner)
  O = fill(I, 1, outer_corners)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify objects:** `obj = objects(I, True, True, True)` extracts all objects formed by non-background digits, considering diagonals.
2. **Find corner indices:** `corner_indices = mapply(corners, obj)` finds the corner indices of each object.
3. **Define outer corner condition:** `is_outer_corner` checks if a corner has only one diagonally adjacent cell within the set of all corner indices.
4. **Filter outer corners:** `outer_corners = sfilter(corner_indices, is_outer_corner)` filters the corners to keep only outer corners.
5. **Fill with '1':** `O = fill(I, 1, outer_corners)` replaces the outer corners with '1' in the input grid.

### **Program Version 2:**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = objects(I, True, True, True)
  def is_outer_corner(cell):
    return index(I, cell) == 8 and size(intersection(ineighbors(cell), toindices(obj))) == 1
  outer_corners = sfilter(asindices(I), is_outer_corner)
  O = fill(I, 1, outer_corners)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify objects:** Same as version 1.
2. **Define outer corner condition:** `is_outer_corner` checks if a cell contains '8' and has only one diagonally adjacent cell belonging to any object.
3. **Filter outer corners:** `outer_corners = sfilter(asindices(I), is_outer_corner)` filters all grid indices to find outer corners.
4. **Fill with '1':** Same as version 1.

### **Program Version 3:**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = objects(I, True, True, True)
  outer_corners = set()
  for corner_set in mapply(corners, obj):
    for corner in corner_set:
      if size(intersection(ineighbors(corner), toindices(obj))) == 1:
        outer_corners.add(corner)
  O = fill(I, 1, frozenset(outer_corners))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify objects:** Same as version 1.
2. **Iterate and filter:** This version iterates through each object's corners and checks the outer corner condition using `ineighbors` and `intersection`.
3. **Fill with '1':** Same as version 1.

### **Program Version 4:**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  obj = objects(I, True, True, True)
  def count_diagonal_neighbors(c):
    return sum(1 for d in ineighbors(c) if d in toindices(obj))
  outer_corners = sfilter(mapply(corners, obj), lambda c: count_diagonal_neighbors(c) == 1)
  O = fill(I, 1, outer_corners)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Identify objects:** Same as version 1.
2. **Count diagonal neighbors:** `count_diagonal_neighbors` function counts the number of diagonal neighbors belonging to any object for a given cell.
3. **Filter outer corners:**  `outer_corners` are identified by filtering corner cells having only one diagonal neighbor.
4. **Fill with '1':** Same as version 1.

### **Program Version 5:**

**Code:**
```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_outer_corner(cell):
    diag_neighbors = ineighbors(cell)
    neighbor_values = rapply(lambda d: index(I, d), diag_neighbors)
    return index(I, cell) == 8 and neighbor_values.count(8) == 1
  outer_corners = sfilter(asindices(I), is_outer_corner)
  O = fill(I, 1, outer_corners)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Define outer corner condition:** `is_outer_corner` checks if a cell contains '8' and has exactly one diagonal neighbor with the value '8'.
2. **Filter outer corners:** `outer_corners` are found by filtering all grid indices using the `is_outer_corner` condition.
3. **Fill with '1':** Same as version 1. 

Each of these programs implements the same logic of identifying and replacing outer corners using different combinations of DSL functions, providing diverse solutions for the given transformation.
