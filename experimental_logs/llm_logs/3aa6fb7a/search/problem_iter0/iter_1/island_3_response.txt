## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify specific cells within objects formed by the digit '8' and change their value to '1'.  The target cells are the topmost cells in the second-leftmost column of each '8' object. 

**Let's illustrate with examples:**

* **Input_0:** The top-left '8' object has no second column, so no change. The bottom '8' object has a second column with only one cell (row 4, column 5), which becomes '1'.
* **Input_1:** Three '8' objects have second columns, leading to three cells changing to '1'.


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct program versions for "Program_to_be_generated":

**Program Version 1**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def check_second_leftmost(obj):
    indices = toindices(obj)
    leftmost_j = leftmost(indices) # Find leftmost column index
    return frozenset((i, j) for i, j in indices if j == leftmost_j + 1)  # Get indices of the second column

  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  target_cells = mfilter(objs, check_second_leftmost)
  O = fill(I, 1, target_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`check_second_leftmost(obj)` Function:** 
   - This function takes an object as input.
   - `leftmost(indices)` finds the index of the leftmost column of the object.
   - It returns a new set of indices that belong to the second column from the left of the input object.

2. **Main Function:**
   - `objs = objects(I, True, False, False)`: Identifies connected objects formed by the same digit in the input grid `I`.
   - `target_cells = mfilter(objs, check_second_leftmost)`: Applies the `check_second_leftmost` function to each object and merges the results. This effectively gathers all target cell indices.
   - `O = fill(I, 1, target_cells)`: Fills the `target_cells` in the input grid `I` with the value '1' to produce the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def process_object(obj):
    if color(obj) != 8: 
        return frozenset()
    indices = toindices(obj)
    leftmost_j = min(j for i, j in indices)
    second_leftmost_cells = sorted((i, j) for i, j in indices if j == leftmost_j + 1)
    return frozenset({second_leftmost_cells[0]}) if second_leftmost_cells else frozenset()
    
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  target_cells = merge(apply(process_object, objs))
  O = fill(I, 1, target_cells)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`process_object(obj)` Function:** 
   - Takes an object as input and first checks if its color is '8'. If not, it returns an empty set.
   - Finds the leftmost column index (`leftmost_j`) of the object.
   - Collects all cell indices belonging to the second column from the left (`second_leftmost_cells`).
   - If the `second_leftmost_cells` list is not empty, it returns a set containing the topmost cell; otherwise, it returns an empty set.

2. **Main Function:**
   - `objs = objects(I, True, False, False)`:  Identifies connected objects.
   - `target_cells = merge(apply(process_object, objs))`: Applies the `process_object` function to each identified object and merges the resulting sets to obtain a set of all target cell indices.
   - `O = fill(I, 1, target_cells)`: Fills the target cells in the input grid `I` with '1' to generate the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 3**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    def is_target_cell(loc):
        i, j = loc
        h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
        if j == 0: return False  # Cells in the first column cannot be targets
        return 0 <= i < h and 0 <= j - 1 < w and I[i][j] == 8 and I[i][j - 1] == 8
    
    target_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), is_target_cell)
    O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_target_cell(loc)` Function:** 
   - Takes a cell location `loc` as input.
   - Immediately returns `False` if the cell is in the first column (`j == 0`).
   - Checks if the cell and its left neighbor are within the grid boundaries and both have the value '8'.
   - Returns `True` if all conditions are met, indicating a target cell.

2. **Main Function:**
   - `target_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), is_target_cell)`:  Applies `is_target_cell` to every cell index in the input grid `I` and merges the results, producing a set of target indices. 
   - `O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)`: Fills the target cells in the input grid with '1' to generate the output grid `O`. 

**Program Version 4**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def check_left(loc):
    i, j = loc
    return j > 0 and I[i][j - 1] == 8 and I[i][j] == 8 # Check if the left neighbor exists and if both cells are '8'

  target_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), check_left)  # Get all indices where the condition is met
  O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)  # Fill those indices with '1'
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`check_left(loc)` Function:**
    - Takes a cell location (`loc`) as input.
    - Verifies if a left neighbor exists (`j > 0`).
    - Checks if both the current cell and its left neighbor have the value '8'.
    - Returns `True` if all conditions are met, signaling a target cell.

2. **Main Function:**
   - `target_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), check_left)`: Applies `check_left` to each cell in the input grid `I`, identifying cells with a left neighbor that are both '8', and merges the results into `target_indices`.
   - `O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)`: Modifies the input grid by replacing the values at `target_indices` with '1' to create the output grid `O`. 

**Program Version 5**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    shifted_grid = shift(asobject(I), (0, 1)) # Shift all grid cells to the right
    def is_match(cell):
        v, (i, j) = cell
        h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
        return 0 <= i < h and 0 <= j < w and I[i][j] == 8 and v == 8 # Check for '8' match in original and shifted positions

    target_cells = sfilter(shifted_grid, is_match)  # Filter for cells matching the condition
    target_indices = toindices(target_cells) # Extract indices from the filtered cells
    O = fill(I, 1, target_indices) # Fill the target indices with '1' in the original grid
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_match(cell)` Function:** 
   - Takes a cell from the shifted grid as input.
   - Checks if the cell's original and shifted positions both contain '8' within the grid boundaries.
   - Returns `True` if both the original and shifted positions have '8', indicating a potential target. 

2. **Main Function:**
   - `shifted_grid = shift(asobject(I), (0, 1))`: Shifts every cell in the input grid `I` one position to the right, creating `shifted_grid`.
   - `target_cells = sfilter(shifted_grid, is_match)`: Filters the cells in the `shifted_grid` using `is_match` to keep only cells where both the original and shifted positions are '8'.
   - `target_indices = toindices(target_cells)`:  Extracts the indices from the filtered cells in `target_cells`.
   - `O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)`: Modifies the input grid by changing the values at the `target_indices` to '1', generating the output grid `O`.


These versions demonstrate various approaches to achieve the same transformation in the DSL.  Each leverages different functions and logic, showcasing diverse coding styles within the DSL's capabilities.
