## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying cells with the value '8' and then changing the value of the cell diagonally down and to the left to a '1'. If the diagonal cell is outside the grid boundaries, no change is made. 

**Example:**

* **Input_0:**  The '8' at (2,2) results in a '1' at (3,1). 
* **Input_1:** The '8' at (1,5) results in a '1' at (2,4).


## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_cells = ofcolor(I, EIGHT)  # Find all cells with value 8
  shifted_cells = mapply(lambda loc: (loc[0] + 1, loc[1] - 1), target_cells)  # Shift each cell down and left
  O = I
  for i, j in shifted_cells:
    if 0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0]):  # Check if new location is within grid bounds
      O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})  # Fill the shifted cell with value 1
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`target_cells = ofcolor(I, EIGHT)`:**  Identifies the indices of all cells in the input grid (`I`) that contain the value '8'.
2. **`shifted_cells = mapply(lambda loc: (loc[0] + 1, loc[1] - 1), target_cells)`:**  Applies a lambda function to each index in `target_cells`. The lambda function shifts the row index down by 1 (`loc[0] + 1`) and the column index left by 1 (`loc[1] - 1`). 
3. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid (`O`) as a copy of the input grid.
4. **Loop:** Iterates through each shifted index in `shifted_cells`.
   - **`if 0 <= i < len(I) and 0 <= j < len(I[0])`:** Checks if the shifted indices (i, j) are within the bounds of the grid.
   - **`O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})`:** If the indices are valid, the `fill` function replaces the value at the shifted location (i, j) in the output grid (`O`) with '1'.
5. **`return O`:** Returns the modified output grid. 


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if I[i][j] == EIGHT and i + 1 < len(I) and j - 1 >= 0:
        O = fill(O, ONE, {(i + 1, j - 1)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Initializes the output grid (`O`) as a copy of the input grid.
2. **Nested Loop:** Iterates through each cell in the input grid using nested loops.
   -  **`if I[i][j] == EIGHT and i + 1 < len(I) and j - 1 >= 0`:**  Checks if the current cell contains an '8' and if the diagonal cell down and to the left is within the grid's bounds.
   - **`O = fill(O, ONE, {(i + 1, j - 1)})`:** If both conditions are met, the `fill` function changes the value at the corresponding diagonal cell in the output grid (`O`) to '1'.
3. **`return O`:** Returns the modified output grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_indices = mpapply(lambda i, j: (i + 1, j - 1), range(len(I)), range(len(I[0])))
  valid_indices = sfilter(shifted_indices, lambda loc: 0 <= loc[0] < len(I) and 0 <= loc[1] < len(I[0]))
  target_indices = ofcolor(I, EIGHT)
  indices_to_fill = intersection(valid_indices, shifted_indices)
  O = I
  for i, j in indices_to_fill:
    if (i - 1, j + 1) in target_indices:
      O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_indices = ...`:** Generates a set of all indices shifted down and left from the input grid.
2. **`valid_indices = ...`:** Filters the `shifted_indices` to keep only valid indices within the grid's bounds.
3. **`target_indices = ofcolor(I, EIGHT)`:**  Finds indices of all '8' cells in the input grid.
4. **`indices_to_fill = intersection(valid_indices, shifted_indices)`:** Finds the intersection of the valid shifted indices and the indices of '8' cells. This ensures that only cells diagonally adjacent to '8' cells and within grid bounds are considered.
5. **Loop:** Iterates through each index in `indices_to_fill`.
   - **`if (i - 1, j + 1) in target_indices:`:** Checks if the cell diagonally up and right from the current index contains an '8'.
   - **`O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j)})`:** If the condition is met, fill the current cell in the output grid with '1'.
6. **`return O`:**  Returns the modified output grid. 


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val == EIGHT:
                if 0 <= i + 1 < len(I) and 0 <= j - 1 < len(row):
                    O = fill(O, ONE, {(i + 1, j - 1)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))`:** Creates an output grid (`O`) filled with '0's, with the same dimensions as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Nested Loops:** Iterates through each cell (value and its indices) in the input grid.
   - **`if val == EIGHT`:** Checks if the current cell value is '8'.
   - **`if 0 <= i + 1 < len(I) and 0 <= j - 1 < len(row)`:**  Checks if the diagonal cell down and left is within the grid's boundaries.
   -  **`O = fill(O, ONE, {(i + 1, j - 1)})`:** If both conditions are true, fills the corresponding diagonal cell in the output grid (`O`) with a '1'.
3. **`return O`:** Returns the modified output grid.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = I
    target_cells = ofcolor(I, EIGHT)
    for i, j in target_cells:
        new_i, new_j = i + 1, j - 1
        if 0 <= new_i < len(I) and 0 <= new_j < len(I[0]):
            O = fill(O, ONE, {(new_i, new_j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`O = I`:** Creates a copy of the input grid (`I`) and assigns it to the output grid (`O`).
2. **`target_cells = ofcolor(I, EIGHT)`:** Identifies the indices of cells in the input grid containing the value '8'.
3. **Loop:** Iterates through each cell index (i, j) in `target_cells`.
   - **`new_i, new_j = i + 1, j - 1`:** Calculates the indices of the target cell diagonally down and to the left.
   - **`if 0 <= new_i < len(I) and 0 <= new_j < len(I[0])`:** Checks if the calculated target indices are within the bounds of the grid.
   - **`O = fill(O, ONE, {(new_i, new_j)})`:** If the indices are valid, it uses the `fill` function to change the value at the target location (new_i, new_j) in the output grid (`O`) to '1'. 
4. **`return O`:** Returns the modified output grid.
