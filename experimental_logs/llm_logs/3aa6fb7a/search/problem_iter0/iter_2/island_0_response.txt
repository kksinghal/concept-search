## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify the bottom-right corner cells of objects (excluding the background) and fill their right and bottom neighbor cells with the value '1'. 

* **Input_0 to Output_0:** The bottom-right corner cells of the two '8' objects are identified.  The cells to their right and below are filled with '1'.
* **Input_1 to Output_1:**  Similar to the previous example, the transformation identifies the bottom-right corners of the '8' objects and fills their neighboring cells accordingly.


## Code Improvement:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" using the provided DSL:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def condition(loc):
    return index(I, loc) != 0 and index(I, add(loc, DOWN, )) == 0 and index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == 0
  return fill(I, 1, mapply(lambda loc: frozenset({add(loc, RIGHT), add(loc, DOWN)}), mfilter(asindices(I), condition)))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`condition(loc)`:** This function checks if a given location `loc` is a bottom-right corner of an object. It ensures the cell at `loc` is not background (value 0) and its right and bottom neighbors are background.
2. **`mfilter(asindices(I), condition)`:** This applies the `condition` to all indices of the input grid `I` and merges the results, effectively finding all bottom-right corner indices.
3. **`mapply(lambda loc: frozenset({add(loc, RIGHT), add(loc, DOWN)}), ...)`:**  For each identified corner index, it generates a frozenset containing its right and down neighbor indices.
4. **`fill(I, 1, ...)`:** This takes the original grid `I` and fills the identified neighbor indices with the value '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def change(loc):
    if index(I, loc) != 0 and index(I, add(loc, DOWN)) == 0 and index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == 0:
      return {add(loc, RIGHT), add(loc, DOWN)}
    else:
      return set()
  return fill(I, 1, frozenset(merge(apply(change, asindices(I)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`change(loc)`:** Similar to `condition` in Version 1, this function identifies bottom-right corner cells. If a cell is a corner, it returns a set containing its right and bottom neighbors; otherwise, it returns an empty set.
2. **`apply(change, asindices(I))`:** This applies the `change` function to every index in the grid `I`. 
3. **`merge(...)`:** This merges all the sets generated by `apply` into a single set containing all the neighbor indices to be filled.
4. **`fill(I, 1, frozenset(...))`:**  This fills the identified neighbor indices in the original grid `I` with the value '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def condition(loc):
    return index(I, loc) != 0 and index(I, add(loc, DOWN)) == 0 and index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == 0
  
  target_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), condition)
  right_neighbors = frozenset(mapply(lambda loc: add(loc, RIGHT), target_indices))
  down_neighbors = frozenset(mapply(lambda loc: add(loc, DOWN), target_indices))
  
  I = fill(I, 1, right_neighbors)
  I = fill(I, 1, down_neighbors)
  
  return I
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`condition(loc)`:** Similar to previous versions, identifies bottom-right corner cells.
2. **`target_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), condition)`:** Extracts all corner indices.
3. **`right_neighbors`, `down_neighbors`:** Generates frozensets containing the right and down neighbors of each corner index respectively.
4. **`I = fill(I, 1, right_neighbors)`:** Fills the right neighbors with '1'.
5. **`I = fill(I, 1, down_neighbors)`:**  Fills the down neighbors with '1'.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  objs = objects(I, univalued=False, diagonal=False, without_bg=True)
  to_fill = set()
  for obj in objs:
    corner = lrcorner(obj)
    to_fill.add(add(corner, RIGHT))
    to_fill.add(add(corner, DOWN))
  return fill(I, 1, frozenset(to_fill)) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(...)`:** Extracts all objects from the grid (excluding background).
2. **`to_fill = set()`:** Initializes an empty set to store the neighbor indices.
3. **Loop through `objs`:** For each object, it finds its bottom-right corner (`lrcorner`) and adds its right and bottom neighbors to the `to_fill` set.
4. **`return fill(I, 1, frozenset(to_fill))`:** Fills all identified neighbor indices in the original grid with '1'.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_corner(loc):
    return index(I, loc) != 0 and index(I, add(loc, RIGHT)) == 0 and index(I, add(loc, DOWN)) == 0
  
  neighbors_to_fill = set()
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if is_corner((i, j)):
        neighbors_to_fill.update({add((i, j), RIGHT), add((i, j), DOWN)})
  
  return fill(I, 1, frozenset(neighbors_to_fill))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_corner(loc)`:**  Checks if a location is a bottom-right corner.
2. **Nested loop:** Iterates through each cell in the grid.
3. **`if is_corner((i, j))`:** If a cell is a corner, its right and down neighbors are added to the `neighbors_to_fill` set.
4. **`return fill(I, 1, frozenset(neighbors_to_fill))`:**  Fills the identified neighbors in the original grid with '1'.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, showcasing the flexibility of the provided DSL.
