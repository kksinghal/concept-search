## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify horizontally adjacent pairs of '8's in the input grid and replace the right '8' of each pair with a '1' in the output grid. 

**Let's illustrate with the provided examples:**

* **Input_0:**  The '8' at (2,2) and (4,4) are replaced with '1's as they are the right '8's of horizontally adjacent '8' pairs.

* **Input_1:**  Similarly, the '8's at (0,5), (1,5), (3,5), and (6,3) are replaced with '1's.

## Code Generation:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" that achieve the desired transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_right_eight(loc):
    i, j = loc
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    return 0 <= i < h and 0 <= j - 1 < w and I[i][j] == 8 and I[i][j - 1] == 8

  target_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), is_right_eight)
  O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_right_eight(loc)`:** This function checks if a given location `loc` corresponds to the right '8' of a horizontal pair. It ensures the location is within the grid bounds and its left neighbor is also an '8'. 
2. **`target_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), is_right_eight)`:** This line first gets all indices of the input grid `I` using `asindices`. It then applies the `is_right_eight` function to each index using `mfilter`, keeping only those indices that satisfy the condition (being the right '8' of a pair).
3. **`O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)`:**  This line creates the output grid `O` by copying the input grid `I` and then using `fill` to replace the values at the `target_indices` with '1'.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def right_eight_pair(loc):
    i, j = loc
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    if 0 <= i < h and 0 <= j - 1 < w and I[i][j] == 8 and I[i][j - 1] == 8:
      return {(i, j)}
    return set()

  target_indices = mapply(right_eight_pair, asindices(I))
  O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`right_eight_pair(loc)`:** This function, similar to `is_right_eight`, checks for the right '8' of a pair. However, instead of returning a boolean, it returns a set containing the index if the condition is met, and an empty set otherwise.
2. **`target_indices = mapply(right_eight_pair, asindices(I))`:** `mapply` applies the `right_eight_pair` function to all indices of the grid and merges the resulting sets, effectively collecting all right '8' indices. 
3. **`O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)`:** Same as in Version 1, this fills the target indices with '1'.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  shifted_grid = rot90(I)  
  target_indices = ofcolor(hconcat(I, shifted_grid), 8)
  O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`shifted_grid = rot90(I)`:** This line creates a rotated copy of the input grid, shifting each column to the right of its original position.
2. **`target_indices = ofcolor(hconcat(I, shifted_grid), 8)`:** This concatenates the original grid and the shifted grid horizontally. Then, `ofcolor` identifies the indices of all '8's in this concatenated grid. Due to the shift, only the right '8's of the original pairs will align with an '8' in the shifted grid, thus getting captured.
3. **`O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)`:** Same as above, this fills the identified indices with '1'. 

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_right_eight(i, j):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    return 0 <= i < h and 0 <= j - 1 < w and I[i][j] == 8 and I[i][j - 1] == 8

  O = tuple(tuple(1 if is_right_eight(i, j) else I[i][j] for j in range(len(I[0]))) for i in range(len(I)))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version uses nested list comprehensions to achieve the transformation:

1. **`is_right_eight(i, j)`:** This function remains the same, checking if a location represents the right '8' of a pair.
2. **List Comprehensions:** The nested list comprehensions iterate through each cell of the grid. For each cell, it calls `is_right_eight` to check the condition. If true, it replaces the cell value with '1'; otherwise, it retains the original value from the input grid. 

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = tuple(tuple(1 if j > 0 and v == 8 and I[i][j-1] == 8 else v for j, v in enumerate(row)) for i, row in enumerate(I))
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

This version further compresses the code using nested list comprehensions and direct condition checks within the comprehension:

1. **Nested Comprehensions:** The code iterates through each row and then each value within the row using `enumerate`.
2. **Inline Condition:**  For each cell, it checks if it's not in the first column (`j > 0`), if its value is '8', and if its left neighbor is also '8'. If all conditions are true, it replaces the value with '1'; otherwise, it keeps the original value.


These five program versions showcase different approaches to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the provided DSL. Each version utilizes a unique combination of functions and logic, fulfilling the requirement for diverse solutions.
