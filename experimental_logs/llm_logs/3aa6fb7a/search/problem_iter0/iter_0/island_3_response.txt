## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the second-to-leftmost cell of each connected '8' object and changing its value to '1'. 

**Input_0:**

* The '8' object has two such cells: (1,2) and (4,4). 
* These cells are changed to '1' in the output.

**Input_1:**

* This input has three '8' objects.
* The second-to-leftmost cells of each object are (2,3), (5,3), and (1,5).
* These cells are changed to '1' in the output.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    objs = objects(I, True, False, False)  # Get connected objects
    target_cells = set()
    for obj in objs:
        if color(obj) == 8:  # Focus on '8' objects
            indices = toindices(obj)
            leftmost_j = min(j for i, j in indices)  # Find leftmost column
            second_leftmost = sorted(
                (i, j) for i, j in indices if j == leftmost_j + 1
            )  # Get cells in the second column
            if second_leftmost:
                target_cells.add(second_leftmost[0])  # Add the topmost cell
    O = fill(I, 1, frozenset(target_cells))  # Fill target cells with '1'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify objects:**  `objects(I, True, False, False)` identifies connected regions of '8's. 
2. **Iterate through objects:** The code iterates through each object.
3. **Find target cell:**  For each '8' object, it finds the leftmost column and then identifies the topmost cell in the second column.
4. **Fill target cell:** It fills the identified target cell with '1'.

## Program Version 2:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    shifted_right = shift(asobject(I), (0, 1)) # Shift all cells to the right
    filtered = frozenset(
        (v, (i, j)) for v, (i, j) in shifted_right if 0 <= j < len(I[0]) - 1 and I[i][j + 1] == 8
    )  # Filter cells where the right neighbor in the original grid is '8'
    target_cells = frozenset((i, j - 1) for _, (i, j) in filtered if I[i][j - 1] == 8)  # Shift back and filter for '8' cells
    O = fill(I, 1, target_cells)  # Fill target cells with '1'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Shift Right:**  `shift(asobject(I), (0, 1))` shifts all cells one position to the right.
2. **Filter Right Neighbors:** It then filters for cells where the original right neighbor was '8'.
3. **Shift Back and Filter:** The filtered cells are shifted one position to the left and those that originally contained '8' are selected as target cells.
4. **Fill Target Cells:** Finally, the target cells are filled with '1'.

## Program Version 3:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  O = canvas(0, shape(I))
  for i in range(height(I)):
    for j in range(1, width(I)): # Start from the second column
      if I[i][j] == 8 and I[i][j-1] == 8: # Check if current and left neighbor are '8'
        O = paint(O, {(1, (i, j))})  # Paint '1' at the current position in the output grid
        break  # Move to the next row after finding the first '8' pair
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create Empty Canvas:**  `O = canvas(0, shape(I))` creates an empty output grid of the same size as the input.
2. **Iterate and Check Neighbors:** It iterates through each cell, starting from the second column. If a cell and its left neighbor are both '8', it marks this cell as a target.
3. **Paint Target Cell:** The target cell is then painted with '1' on the output grid.
4. **Continue to Next Row:** Once a target cell is found in a row, the program moves to the next row. 

## Program Version 4:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    target_indices = set()
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if value == 8 and j > 0 and I[i][j - 1] == 8: # Check current and left neighbor for '8'
                target_indices.add((i, j))
                break  # Move to next row after finding the first pair
    new_grid = [list(row) for row in I] # Convert tuple of tuples to list of lists
    for i, j in target_indices:
        new_grid[i][j] = 1 # Modify the target cells
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in new_grid) # Convert back to tuple of tuples
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Find Target Indices:** Iterate through the grid, starting from the second column, to find cells where both the cell and its left neighbor are '8'.
2. **Store Target Indices:** Store the indices of these target cells.
3. **Convert to List of Lists:** Convert the input grid, which is a tuple of tuples, to a list of lists for easier modification. 
4. **Modify Target Cells:** Change the value of the target cells to '1' in the list of lists.
5. **Convert Back to Tuple of Tuples:** Convert the modified list of lists back to a tuple of tuples to maintain the original data structure. 

## Program Version 5:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
    def check_left(loc):
        i, j = loc
        return j > 0 and I[i][j - 1] == 8 and I[i][j] == 8 # Check if the left neighbor exists and if both cells are '8'

    target_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), check_left)  # Get all indices where the condition is met
    O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)  # Fill those indices with '1'
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Helper Function:** Defines a helper function `check_left` to determine if a cell and its left neighbor are both '8'.
2. **Apply Helper Function:**  `mfilter(asindices(I), check_left)` applies the `check_left` function to every cell index of the grid and collects the indices where the condition is true. 
3. **Fill Target Cells:** `fill(I, 1, target_indices)` fills all the identified target cells with '1'. 

These five program versions provide distinct approaches to achieve the desired transformation. Each version utilizes different DSL functions and logic, demonstrating the flexibility of the provided DSL.
