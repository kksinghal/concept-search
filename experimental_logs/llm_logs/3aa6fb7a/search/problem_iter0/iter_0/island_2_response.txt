## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying the 'outer corner' cells of the 8-objects in the grid and changing their value to 1. An outer corner cell is a cell belonging to the object that is only connected to one other cell of the object diagonally. 

**Example:**

In Input_0:

* The cell at (2,2) is NOT an outer corner because it connects to (1,1) and (3,3) diagonally.
* The cell at (1,2) IS an outer corner because it only connects to (2,1) diagonally.

**Input-Output Pair 1:**

1. **Input:**  The input grid contains an 8-object.
2. **Output:** The output grid has the outer corner cells of the 8-object from the input grid changed to 1.

**Input-Output Pair 2:**

1. **Input:** The input grid contains an 8-object in a different configuration.
2. **Output:** The output grid has the outer corner cells of this 8-object from the input grid changed to 1.


## Code Improvement (x5):

Here are five distinct versions of "Program_to_be_generated" to achieve this transformation:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = objects(I, True, True, True)
  corners = mapply(corners, obj)
  diag_neighbors = mapply(ineighbors, corners)
  outer_corners = sfilter(corners, lambda c: size(intersection(diag_neighbors, toindices(obj))) == 1)
  O = fill(I, 1, outer_corners)
  return O 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** We use `objects(I, True, True, True)` to find the objects in the grid.  
2. **Find corner cells:** `mapply(corners, obj)` finds the corner cells of the object.
3. **Identify diagonal neighbors:** `mapply(ineighbors, corners)` finds the diagonal neighbors of each corner cell.
4. **Filter for outer corners:** `sfilter` keeps only the corner cells that have only one diagonal neighbor within the object.
5. **Fill outer corners:** Finally, `fill(I, 1, outer_corners)` fills the identified outer corner cells with the value 1.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = objects(I, True, True, True)
  corner_neighbors = mapply(lambda c: intersection(ineighbors(c), toindices(obj)), toindices(obj))
  outer_corners = sfilter(toindices(obj), lambda c: size(corner_neighbors(c)) == 1)
  O = fill(I, 1, outer_corners)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** Similar to version 1.
2. **Find corner neighbors:** We iterate through each cell of the object and find the number of its diagonal neighbors that are also part of the object.
3. **Identify outer corners:** Cells with only one diagonal neighbor within the object are identified as outer corners.
4. **Fill outer corners:** Similar to version 1.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = objects(I, True, True, True)
  shifted_objects = mapply(lambda d: shift(obj, d), ineighbors(ORIGIN))
  outer_corners = intersection(*shifted_objects)
  O = fill(I, 1, outer_corners)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Shift and intersect:** We shift the object diagonally in all four directions and find the intersection of these shifted objects.
3. **Identify outer corners:** The intersection will contain only the cells that are common to the object and its diagonal shifts, which are the outer corners.
4. **Fill outer corners:** Similar to previous versions.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = objects(I, True, True, True)
  outer_corners = mfilter(toindices(obj), lambda c: size(intersection(dneighbors(c), toindices(obj))) < 4)
  O = fill(I, 1, outer_corners)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Filter by direct neighbors:** We iterate through each cell of the object and count its direct neighbors that are also part of the object. 
3. **Identify outer corners:** Corner cells will have less than four direct neighbors within the object.
4. **Fill outer corners:** Similar to previous versions.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def solve(I):
  obj = objects(I, True, True, True)
  def is_outer_corner(c):
    return sum(1 for d in ineighbors(c) if d in toindices(obj)) == 1
  outer_corners = sfilter(toindices(obj), is_outer_corner)
  O = fill(I, 1, outer_corners)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify the object:** Similar to previous versions.
2. **Define helper function:** We define a helper function `is_outer_corner` to check if a cell is an outer corner by counting its diagonal neighbors within the object.
3. **Filter using the helper function:** We use the `sfilter` function with `is_outer_corner` to find all outer corner cells within the object.
4. **Fill outer corners:** Similar to previous versions. 

These five versions demonstrate different approaches to identifying outer corner cells using the provided DSL functions. Each version provides a unique solution to the problem, showcasing the flexibility and power of the DSL.
