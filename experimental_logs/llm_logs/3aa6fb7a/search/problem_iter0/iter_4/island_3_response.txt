## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation taking place in these input-output pairs is as follows:

* **Identify leftmost '8's in each object:** The transformation targets objects made up of the digit '8'. Within each object, the leftmost '8' is identified.
* **Change the digit to the right of the leftmost '8' to '1':**  If there's a digit to the right of the leftmost '8' within the same object, that digit is changed to a '1'.

## Program_to_be_generated: 

Here are five distinct versions of the program to achieve the desired transformation, along with explanations:

**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_leftmost_eight(loc):
    i, j = loc
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    return 0 <= i < h and 0 <= j < w and I[i][j] == 8 and (j == 0 or I[i][j-1] != 8)
  
  target_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), is_leftmost_eight)
  target_indices = frozenset((i, j + 1) for i, j in target_indices if j + 1 < len(I[0]))
  O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_leftmost_eight(loc)`:** This helper function checks if a given location `loc` in the grid `I` contains the leftmost '8' of an object. 
2. **`target_indices = mfilter(asindices(I), is_leftmost_eight)`:**  This line finds the indices of all leftmost '8's in the grid using the `is_leftmost_eight` function.
3. **`target_indices = frozenset((i, j + 1) for i, j in target_indices if j + 1 < len(I[0]))`:** This line calculates the indices of the digits immediately to the right of each leftmost '8', ensuring we stay within the grid bounds.
4. **`O = fill(I, 1, target_indices)`:** Finally, we fill the grid `I` with the value '1' at the `target_indices` to produce the output grid `O`.

**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    objs = objects(I, univalued=True, diagonal=False, without_bg=False)
    new_objs = set()
    for obj in objs:
        if color(obj) == 8:
            leftmost_j = min(j for _, (i, j) in obj)
            new_obj = set()
            for v, (i, j) in obj:
                if j == leftmost_j + 1:
                    new_obj.add((1, (i, j)))
                else:
                    new_obj.add((v, (i, j)))
            new_objs.add(frozenset(new_obj))
        else:
            new_objs.add(obj)
    O = paint(canvas(0, shape(I)), frozenset(new_objs))
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`objs = objects(...)`:**  Identify all objects in the grid.
2. **Iterate over objects:**  Loop through each object (`obj`) in `objs`.
3. **Check for '8' objects:** If the object's color is '8', find the column index (`leftmost_j`) of the leftmost '8'.
4. **Modify '8' objects:** Create a new object (`new_obj`) where the cell to the right of the leftmost '8' is replaced with a '1'.
5. **Rebuild the grid:** Paint all modified and unmodified objects onto a blank canvas of the same size as the input grid.

**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(0, shape(I))
    for i, row in enumerate(I):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val == 8 and (j == 0 or I[i][j-1] != 8) and j + 1 < len(row):
                O = fill(O, 1, {(i, j+1)})
            else:
                O = fill(O, val, {(i, j)})
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create empty canvas:** Create a blank grid `O` of the same dimensions as the input `I`.
2. **Iterate through cells:** Loop through each cell in the input grid `I`.
3. **Identify leftmost '8's:**  Check if the current cell is a leftmost '8'.
4. **Fill accordingly:** If it's a leftmost '8' and there's a cell to its right, fill the corresponding cell in `O` with '1'. Otherwise, fill the corresponding cell in `O` with the original value.

**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    h, w = len(I), len(I[0])
    J = [[I[i][j] for j in range(w)] for i in range(h)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w-1):
            if I[i][j] == 8 and (j == 0 or I[i][j-1] != 8):
                J[i][j+1] = 1
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in J) 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Create a copy:** Make a deep copy `J` of the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate and modify:** Loop through `J`. If a cell is a leftmost '8' and has a right neighbor, change the right neighbor's value to '1'.
3. **Return modified grid:** Return the modified grid `J`.

**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    return tuple(tuple(1 if j > 0 and row[j-1] == 8 and (j == 1 or row[j-2] != 8) else val for j, val in enumerate(row)) for row in I)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Nested list comprehension:** Uses a nested list comprehension to concisely iterate through the grid and apply the transformation.
2. **Identify and modify:**  Within the comprehension, it checks for leftmost '8's and modifies the cell to the right, if applicable.
3. **Return modified grid:** Returns the transformed grid.
