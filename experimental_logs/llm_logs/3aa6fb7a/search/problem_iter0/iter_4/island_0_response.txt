## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation focuses on the upper-left corner cells of objects within the grid. It identifies cells with a value of 8 that are not connected to another 8 directly above or to their left. For these specific cells, it fills their immediate right and bottom neighbors with the value 1.

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* Two corner cells of the '8' object meet the criteria: (1,1) and (4,5).
* The right and bottom neighbors of these cells are filled with '1'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* Three corner cells meet the criteria: (0,5), (2,3), and (5,3).
* The right and bottom neighbors of these cells are filled with '1'.

## Code Generation:

### Program Version 1:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def change(loc):
    if index(I, loc) == 8 and index(I, add(loc, UP), 0) != 8 and index(I, add(loc, LEFT), 0) != 8:
      return frozenset({add(loc, RIGHT), add(loc, DOWN)})
  return fill(I, 1, merge(filter(None, map(change, asindices(I)))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`change(loc)` function:**
    - Checks if a cell at `loc` has value 8 and is not connected to 8 above or to its left.
    - If true, returns a set containing indices of its right and bottom neighbors.
2. **Main function:**
    - Applies `change` to each cell index using `map`.
    - Filters out `None` results (cells that didn't meet the condition).
    - Merges the remaining sets of neighbor indices using `merge`.
    - Uses `fill` to change the values at these neighbor indices to 1.

### Program Version 2:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def is_corner(loc):
    return index(I, loc) == 8 and index(I, add(loc, UP), 0) != 8 and index(I, add(loc, LEFT), 0) != 8

  return fill(I, 1, mfilter(asindices(I), lambda loc: is_corner(loc) and {add(loc, RIGHT), add(loc, DOWN)}))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`is_corner(loc)` function:** 
    - Checks if the cell at `loc` is a corner cell (value 8, no 8 above or left).
2. **Main function:**
    - Uses `mfilter` to filter and merge:
        - Iterates through all cell indices with `asindices`.
        - For each index, if `is_corner` is True, it includes its right and bottom neighbors in the merged set.
    - Uses `fill` to change the values at the collected indices to 1.

### Program Version 3:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  corners = frozenset(loc for loc in asindices(I) if index(I, loc) == 8 and index(I, add(loc, UP), 0) != 8 and index(I, add(loc, LEFT), 0) != 8)
  neighbors_to_fill = mapply(lambda loc: {add(loc, RIGHT), add(loc, DOWN)}, corners)
  return fill(I, 1, neighbors_to_fill)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`corners` variable:**
    - Uses a set comprehension to collect all corner cell indices.
2. **`neighbors_to_fill` variable:**
    - Uses `mapply` to apply a lambda function to each corner cell index:
        - The lambda function returns a set containing the right and bottom neighbors of the given cell.
    - Merges the resulting sets from each corner cell.
3. **Main function:**
    - Uses `fill` to change the values at the collected `neighbors_to_fill` indices to 1.

### Program Version 4:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  def change(loc):
    return frozenset({add(loc, RIGHT), add(loc, DOWN)}) if index(I, loc) == 8 and index(I, add(loc, UP), 0) != 8 and index(I, add(loc, LEFT), 0) != 8 else frozenset()

  return fill(I, 1, merge(apply(change, asindices(I))))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`change(loc)` function:**
    - Returns a set containing right and bottom neighbors if the cell at `loc` is a corner cell (value 8, no 8 above or left).
    - Otherwise, returns an empty set.
2. **Main function:**
    - Applies the `change` function to each cell index using `apply`.
    - Merges the resulting sets of neighbor indices using `merge`.
    - Uses `fill` to change the values at the collected indices to 1.


### Program Version 5:

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  to_fill = frozenset()
  for i in range(len(I)):
    for j in range(len(I[0])):
      if index(I, (i, j)) == 8 and index(I, (i - 1, j), 0) != 8 and index(I, (i, j - 1), 0) != 8:
        to_fill = to_fill | {(i, j + 1), (i + 1, j)}
  return fill(I, 1, to_fill)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`to_fill` variable:**
    - Initialized as an empty frozenset to store the indices to be filled with '1'.
2. **Nested loop:**
    - Iterates through each cell in the grid.
3. **Conditional statement:**
    - Checks if the current cell contains '8' and doesn't have '8' above or to its left.
    - If true, adds the indices of the right and bottom neighbors to the `to_fill` set.
4. **`fill` function:**
    - Fills the cells at the indices stored in `to_fill` with '1'.
5. **Return value:**
    - Returns the modified grid.

This version directly iterates over the grid and directly checks for the corner condition. While less concise than other versions, it might be more readable and easier to understand for some.
