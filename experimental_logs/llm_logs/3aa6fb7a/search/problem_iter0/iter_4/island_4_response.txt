## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation aims to identify the top-most '8' in each connected object of '8's within the input grid. Then, it places a '1' to the right of this top-most '8', provided the cell to the right exists within the grid boundaries.

**Input 0:**

- Two separate objects of '8's exist.
- For the top-left object, the top-most '8' is at (1,1), and a '1' is placed at (1,2).
- For the bottom-right object, the top-most '8' is at (3,4), and a '1' is placed at (3,5).

**Input 1:**

- Three separate objects of '8's exist.
- The transformation applies similarly, placing a '1' to the right of the top-most '8' in each object.


## Program Versions:

Here are five distinct versions of the "Program_to_be_generated" code:


**Program Version 1:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I)) # Create an empty canvas with the same shape as I
  for obj in objects(I, True, False, False): # Iterate through connected objects of '8's
    topmost_i = uppermost(obj) # Find row index of the uppermost '8' in the object
    for v, (i, j) in obj:
      if i == topmost_i and j + 1 < width(I): # Check if it's the top-most '8' and has space on the right
        O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j + 1)}) # Fill the right cell with '1'
        break # Move to the next object
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Create an empty canvas (`O`) with the same dimensions as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate through Objects:** Utilize `objects(I, True, False, False)` to find connected components of '8's.
3. **Find Topmost '8':** For each object, determine the row index (`topmost_i`) of the top-most '8'.
4. **Fill Right Cell:** Iterate through the object's cells. If a cell is the topmost '8' and has space on its right within the grid boundary, fill the cell to its right on the output canvas (`O`) with '1'.
5. **Return Output:** Return the modified output canvas.


**Program Version 2:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  O = I # Start with the input grid as the base
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == EIGHT and (i == 0 or I[i - 1][j] != EIGHT) and j + 1 < len(row):
        O = fill(O, ONE, {(i, j + 1)}) # Directly modify the grid at the desired location
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:**  Start with the input grid (`I`) as the output (`O`) to directly modify it.
2. **Iterate through Cells:** Traverse each cell in the input grid.
3. **Identify Topmost '8':** Check if the current cell contains an '8' and if it's a top-most '8' by looking at the cell above it. Also, ensure there's space to the right.
4. **Fill Right Cell:** If the conditions are met, fill the cell to the right with '1'.
5. **Return Output:** Return the modified grid.


**Program Version 3:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  target_indices = set()
  for i, row in enumerate(I):
    for j, val in enumerate(row):
      if val == EIGHT and (i == 0 or I[i - 1][j] != EIGHT) and j + 1 < len(row):
        target_indices.add((i, j + 1))
  return fill(I, ONE, frozenset(target_indices))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Target Indices:** Create an empty set (`target_indices`) to store the indices of cells to be filled with '1'.
2. **Iterate and Identify:**  Iterate through each cell in the input grid and identify those that need a '1' to their right, adding their indices to `target_indices`.
3. **Fill and Return:** Utilize the `fill` function to directly create the output grid by filling the `target_indices` with '1's in a copy of the input grid.


**Program Version 4:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
    O = canvas(ZERO, shape(I))
    for obj in objects(I, True, False, False):
        uppermost_row = min(i for i, j in toindices(obj))
        right_indices = {(uppermost_row, j + 1) for v, (i, j) in obj if i == uppermost_row and j + 1 < width(I)}
        O = fill(O, ONE, right_indices)
    return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialize Output:** Create an empty canvas (`O`) with the same dimensions as the input grid (`I`).
2. **Iterate through Objects:**  Iterate through connected objects of '8's.
3. **Find Topmost Row:** Find the minimum row index (`uppermost_row`) within the current object.
4. **Identify Right Indices:** Using a set comprehension, identify the indices of cells to the right of the topmost '8's that are within the grid boundaries.
5. **Fill Right Cells:** Fill the identified cells in the output canvas (`O`) with '1's.
6. **Return Output:** Return the modified output canvas.


**Program Version 5:**

```python
def Program_to_be_generated(I):
  return fill(I, ONE, frozenset((i, j + 1) for i, row in enumerate(I) for j, val in enumerate(row) if val == EIGHT and (i == 0 or I[i - 1][j] != EIGHT) and j + 1 < len(row)))
```

**Explanation:**

This version employs a concise approach using a single line of code with nested comprehensions:

- It directly fills a copy of the input grid (`I`) with '1's at specific locations.
- The locations are determined by iterating through each cell and checking if it's a top-most '8' with a valid right neighbor.


These five versions demonstrate different approaches to achieve the same transformation, highlighting the flexibility and expressiveness of the DSL.
