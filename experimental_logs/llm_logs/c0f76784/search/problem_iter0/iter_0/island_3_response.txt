## Transformation Analysis:

The transformation involves identifying objects (connected regions of the same digit) in the input grid and recoloring specific cells within or around those objects based on their position and shape. 

**Input_0 to Output_0:**

* The object of '5's at the top right corner remains unchanged.
* The object of '5's at the bottom left corner is modified:
    * The cells directly below the bottom-most '5's are recolored to '7'.
    * The cells two rows below the bottom-most '5's are recolored to '8'.

**Input_1 to Output_1:**

* The object of '5's at the top left corner remains unchanged.
* The object of '5's at the bottom left corner is modified:
    * The cells directly to the right of the right-most '5's are recolored to '8'.
    * The cell two columns to the right of the second-to-bottom '5' is recolored to '6'. 
    * The cells directly to the right of the top three '5's are recolored to '7'.

**Input_2 to Output_2:**

* The object of '5's at the top middle remains unchanged.
* The object of '5's at the bottom middle is modified:
    * The cells directly above the top-most '5's are recolored to '8'.
    * The cells two rows above the top-most '5's are recolored to '7'.


## Program Version 1:

**Code:**

```python
def solve(I):
  objs = objects(I, True, False, False)
  for obj in objs:
    if len(obj) > 1:
      c = color(obj)
      bottom = lowermost(obj)
      right = rightmost(obj)
      if bottom < len(I) - 2:
        I = fill(I, 7, shift(toindices(obj), (1, 0)))
        I = fill(I, 8, shift(toindices(obj), (2, 0)))
      elif right < len(I[0]) - 2:
        I = fill(I, 8, shift(toindices(obj), (0, 1)))
        I = fill(I, 6, {(bottom - 1, right + 1)})
        I = fill(I, 7, shift(toindices(obj) - {(bottom - 1, right)}, (0, 1)))
      else:
        I = fill(I, 8, shift(toindices(obj), (-1, 0)))
        I = fill(I, 7, shift(toindices(obj), (-2, 0)))
  O = I
  return O
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Identifies all connected objects in the input grid `I`.
2. **Iterate Objects:** Loops through each object.
3. **Check Size & Position:** For objects larger than one cell, determines if they are closer to the bottom edge, right edge, or other.
4. **Apply Recoloring:** 
   *  For objects closer to the bottom edge, fills the cells one and two rows below with '7' and '8', respectively.
   *  For objects closer to the right edge, fills the cells one column to the right with '8', fills the cell two columns to the right and one row above the bottom-most cell with '6', and fills the remaining cells one column to the right with '7'.
   * For other objects, fills the cells one and two rows above with '8' and '7', respectively.
5. **Return Modified Grid:** Returns the modified grid as the output `O`.

**(Note:  This is just one possible solution.  The following versions will explore different approaches using various DSL functions.)**
